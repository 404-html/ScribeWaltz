1
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:08,710
How long before you do a video
conversation with Kanye West?

2
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,013
Mm.

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,603
Yeah.

4
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,690
I mean the whole,

5
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,450
I don't even know what to say about

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:32,760
Candice Olin's.

7
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,540
Right.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,650
And Chinese west.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,210
I mean it's just observe.

10
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,950
So we'll see.

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:46,290
We'll see what happens when the sun
on the 25th we'll be listening to your

12
00:00:46,371 --> 00:00:46,920
lectures.

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,730
What's your advice for balancing Charles?

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,453
Well,

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,730
there is a charter and rule 12 call,

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,960
which is short at chapter 12
which is rule number nine.

17
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:04,490
Rule is assumed that the person listening
to deal with something you don't.

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,001
Okay.

19
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,250
So I'm going to tell you
a story about marriage.

20
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,510
This is,

21
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,160
this is,

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:10,160
this is kind of cool.

23
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:12,780
So I had this friend,

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:15,260
his name is flow Carlstrom.

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,960
He went to Sweden to get Eric
because he was Swedish Fish,

26
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,200
Canadian and uh,

27
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,890
and the marriage ceremony,

28
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:28,100
the couple have all the candle.

29
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,930
You're taking your boss.

30
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,210
And that was very interesting to me.

31
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,603
And you know,

32
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,860
in the Christian symbolic world,

33
00:01:37,861 --> 00:01:38,694
marriages,

34
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,630
which feature of something sick,

35
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,850
which means it's something axiomatic and
fundamental and not to be messed with

36
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,593
me.

37
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:46,931
Of course.

38
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,140
That's what you assume when you take,

39
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,440
you're going to make this a
foundation that you don't shake.

40
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:54,970
Who found again with that,

41
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,030
can you kind of stay in your
cell phone and what kind of,

42
00:01:58,031 --> 00:01:59,180
you're absolutely state.

43
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:00,090
Can you yourself on it.

44
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,780
One of the things about that,

45
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:05,290
and this is worth knowing
perhaps especially to the
people in this audience who

46
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,280
haven't been married yet,

47
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,180
but maybe to those of
you who are already here,

48
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:13,230
there's an idea that means that
your marriage to Kennel work,

49
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,520
unless you're all in.

50
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:20,150
That's why there is he bald at the
same monogamous we're calling them,

51
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:20,980
run the world by.

52
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,510
He aren't really to the society,

53
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,560
but they tend to be very unstable
for all sorts of complicated reasons.

54
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:29,730
So there's a strong proclivity toward
social reinforcement autonomy among human

55
00:02:29,731 --> 00:02:34,731
beings and there's a strong arm
liberty to make it in environment.

56
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,170
There's a psychological reason for that,

57
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,530
which is that you are not going to be
committed enough to your partner to take

58
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:42,630
care of them unless you bloody well know.

59
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,230
You want to shout him them that
you are shocking to the escape

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,590
because why are when you look how you're
not going to be serious enough about it

61
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:52,191
so I can really,

62
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:54,500
I have to put up with
you for like 50 years.

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,490
We better get our our house in order
because otherwise it's going to be some

64
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,320
slice of,

65
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,380
because you're just a
screwed up in horrible as me.

66
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,153
So,

67
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,830
so that's something that's very,

68
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,670
very serious and so with your partner
has a problem or if you have a problem,

69
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,150
you want to solve that because otherwise
you're going to have it maybe every day

70
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,110
for the rest of your life.

71
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,093
And you might've made,

72
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,620
because I could run away
and find someone else.

73
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:17,921
It's like,

74
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:21,340
well good luck with that because they're
going to come with just as many flaws

75
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,830
probably as you have
probably as department as,

76
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,710
and you're going to bring all your
insecurities and the vcs into the new

77
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:28,680
relationship anyway.

78
00:03:28,681 --> 00:03:30,370
So unless you want to be alone,

79
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,360
which is no picnic,

80
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,480
and generally a fairly quick
route to the kind of insanity,

81
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:38,810
then you're pretty much stuck with
the fact that you have flaws anyway.

82
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:41,380
So they're standing there
with this candidate.

83
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,260
Here's the ideal,

84
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,520
same ideas,

85
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,790
Cannibal Christmas,

86
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,080
it's a complicated idea or something you,

87
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,180
most of you act out,

88
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,430
I didn't have lights in
the darkness of the winter.

89
00:03:52,431 --> 00:03:54,940
You bring the tree inside is
what the hell are you up to?

90
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,590
And you don't know going to do it anyways

91
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,510
because of the course.

92
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:02,300
What do you want to do when
you bring a tree lights in?

93
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,150
It stands to reason,

94
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,491
right?

95
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:08,200
And what does the Y to symbolize?

96
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,110
Illumination.

97
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:09,944
Darks.

98
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,580
And it's,

99
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:10,890
it's,

100
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,440
it's a,

101
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,580
it's a pagan ritual,

102
00:04:12,581 --> 00:04:13,930
but it's been Christian honesty.

103
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:18,220
You put out an angel perhaps at the top
of the tree to signify that which is at

104
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:22,950
the top of things and you celebrate the
reemergence of the light to the dark

105
00:04:22,951 --> 00:04:23,131
side.

106
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:24,820
So it's a little ritual.

107
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,180
It's eight gap laying out in the
world in terms of good and evil,

108
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:30,130
with light being good darkness,

109
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,993
feed evil.

110
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,570
And it's a good thing to do in the
winter because it's dark and you're also

111
00:04:34,571 --> 00:04:36,150
celebrating the birth of the song.

112
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,031
It's very,

113
00:04:37,031 --> 00:04:37,864
very complicated.

114
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,310
So,

115
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,910
and then the capital and
the trees assignment in the
nation and vision and like

116
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,310
it's a Christmas tree.

117
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:48,850
So it's associated with the idea of the
birth of the mythological hero or the

118
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:52,390
messiah that's crest until you're
doing all that at the same time.

119
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,510
Now celebration,

120
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,420
because it's a great thing,

121
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,970
a new hero inches the world.

122
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,090
That's what happened to
a child the child has,

123
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:04,610
is a locus of divine consciousness is,

124
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,580
is threatened at birth.

125
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:08,350
Like the mythological hero wall was his,

126
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:10,570
because he's smaller and trout trout,

127
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,690
if not hopefully goes
up to do great things.

128
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:15,520
And so that's all tangled up in that.

129
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,470
So the,

130
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,420
the capital is a symbol of the light in
the world and the light in the world is

131
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,740
the mythological hero.

132
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,360
It's Christ in the Christian drama.

133
00:05:25,361 --> 00:05:26,710
So we'll use that.

134
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:30,580
So you hold the camera above your head
when you're getting married to symbolize

135
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,740
what you are subordinate to.

136
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,181
Because you might say,

137
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:34,901
well in the marriage,

138
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,790
well the wife or the husband,

139
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:40,930
that's the claim that's put out by
those who think that marriage is a

140
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,540
patriarchal,

141
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,210
oppressive institution,

142
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,680
which it is by the way,

143
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:45,461
which you know,

144
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:49,210
because we will need people who get
married now aren't rich people and rich

145
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:52,840
people don't oppress
themselves as far as we know.

146
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:56,320
What if you look at the demographics
as marriage has disintegrated,

147
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,450
it's disintegrated from the
lower socio economic classes.

148
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:04,070
And so unless you can come
up with a reason for why
rich privileged people would

149
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:05,000
impress themselves,

150
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,480
then the whole notion that marriage is
no oppressive patriarchal structure is

151
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,900
pretty much the gist fruit.

152
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,000
So,

153
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,610
so we'll say,

154
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:11,990
well,

155
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,530
Wireshark support it to their husbands,

156
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,311
but we also say,

157
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,020
well,

158
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,780
husbands are subordinate
to their wipes as well.

159
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,890
And Fair enough.

160
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,301
So,

161
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:22,820
so what is it that the couple
of his subordinate too,

162
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,420
and their history is what
symbolized by the light.

163
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,460
And so what that means?

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:28,880
No,

165
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,080
there's an old idea.

166
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,310
It's a very symbolic and a weird
idea that Christ was androgynous and

167
00:06:34,311 --> 00:06:35,900
combination of male and female,

168
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:40,220
he was a reconstruction of the original
Abbott who was male and female before he

169
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:41,090
was old apart.

170
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,200
This is a dream.

171
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:43,550
It's a cultural dream.

172
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:45,630
So Christ is the property.

173
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,270
You need a masculine and feminine.

174
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,340
And so that's what the marriage is.

175
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:51,500
Just a property be masculine and feminine.

176
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,420
And the people in the marriage,

177
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,180
the husband and the wife are supposed
to be subordinate to the ideal you of

178
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:58,400
masculine and feminine.

179
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:03,910
And what that I and union is that spirit
that's created by proper and truthful

180
00:07:04,011 --> 00:07:04,550
debate,

181
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,383
dialogue.

182
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,810
So what do you do if you,

183
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:07,850
if you're married to someone,

184
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,120
we have to contend with them and
they have to contend with you.

185
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,430
And that's a real bad if
you're actually communicated,

186
00:07:13,431 --> 00:07:16,250
cause you're not saying you
have different personalities,

187
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:17,270
you have different values,

188
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,170
you have different age,

189
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,810
your different sections
like you're different.

190
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:25,610
And that if you can incorporate them
difference in both of you can incorporate

191
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,091
that difference.

192
00:07:26,091 --> 00:07:30,590
Can you both why went out and you're a
full of flaws and their partners full of

193
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:30,921
flaws,

194
00:07:30,921 --> 00:07:33,110
but he knows something you
don't and you know something,

195
00:07:33,111 --> 00:07:33,800
he does it.

196
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,010
So if you can start that
information exchanged,

197
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:36,800
going,

198
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,660
that Turkle dialogue in both of you
can be transformed in the course of the

199
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:44,330
August speech that
constitutes the relationship,

200
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,920
the negotiation,

201
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,450
and what you're supposed to do.

202
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:51,140
And this is what symbolized by the candle
is both subordinate yourself to that

203
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:52,670
ongoing negotiation.

204
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,541
So you know,

205
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:56,450
one thing you don't want to do is you
don't want to beat your wife eat an

206
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:58,290
argument even though you really watch it.

207
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,130
I mean you absolutely want to and
you're going to act that out too.

208
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:02,900
And she's going to do
the same thing to you.

209
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,920
It's just not that helpful because
you have to live with her tomorrow.

210
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:09,680
And so if you defeat her in an argument,

211
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,790
well here's the options.

212
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,241
A,

213
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,760
she was right and you're wrong
and you just argued better.

214
00:08:13,761 --> 00:08:16,070
And so what the hell is that?

215
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,150
She's right.

216
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,170
You haven't solved the problem or
you were writing and meter good,

217
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,570
then she's like beaten.

218
00:08:22,571 --> 00:08:26,390
And not very happy about it is going to
do the same thing to you as soon as the

219
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:27,620
opportunity arises.

220
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,600
That's not very helpful.

221
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,650
So what do you want to do?

222
00:08:30,651 --> 00:08:32,720
And you want to find out
what the hell the problem is,

223
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,290
which is really painful and horrible
thing to do because people sometimes don't

224
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,530
even know what the problem is and then
you have to listen to them like for three

225
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:43,850
days to clinic play without trying to
tell him what's wrong cause they don't

226
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:45,490
know and you have to be shut out.

227
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:49,430
The non offers solutions too early
because otherwise they can't go to the

228
00:08:49,431 --> 00:08:51,710
painful process of figuring
out what the problem is.

229
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,970
Maybe it's some problem they have
with their father mistreated.

230
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,450
Your mother been like 1975

231
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,240
if you listen,

232
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,720
knowing that if you solved the problem,

233
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,610
you don't have to have it again.

234
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:13,440
Then if you could get that negotiated
dialogue going continually and that's what

235
00:09:13,441 --> 00:09:14,970
you're supposed to be subordinate to.

236
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,340
And so then to answer this question,

237
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,650
which is to me here,

238
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:27,450
my wife and I were expecting some of the
25th what is your advice on balancing

239
00:09:27,451 --> 00:09:28,890
childcare heritage in the business?

240
00:09:28,891 --> 00:09:29,251
It's like,

241
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:31,140
well my advice is

242
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,230
stick to your damage bout so you can't
run away and then you with your wife

243
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,580
because the two of you having two brains
rather than one would probably be able

244
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,900
to figure out how to do this as you go.

245
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:48,600
If you actually talk to each other.

246
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,010
That's part of the utility free speech.

247
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:56,011
But so you get to think out loud and if
there's someone else around you is also

248
00:09:56,401 --> 00:10:00,960
thinking and whose life is at twined
with yours and you both aiming for what's

249
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:01,650
good,

250
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,710
then between the might be
able to get the process going.

251
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:05,460
That's the,

252
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,560
that's the exchange of the logos,

253
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:08,310
let's say.

254
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,930
That will enable you to
overcome the problems of life
and then maybe having done

255
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:16,920
that and make yourselves into
a unit reasonably intelligent,

256
00:10:17,110 --> 00:10:17,750
wise,

257
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,260
it's also capable of learning.

258
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,580
And then when your child
and how does that unit,

259
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,480
they'll be a nice wall around,

260
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,080
you know,

261
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,370
you know what it's like because they're,

262
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:27,811
they're,

263
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:31,950
they're pushing the primates and they'll
get everything they can in the wall.

264
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,980
They'll just purchasing the torture
torches and see if he's a weakness

265
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:35,520
somewhere.

266
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,530
Cause they want to know.

267
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,760
And if they could set
you against your wife,

268
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,290
they will absolutely do that.

269
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,340
But if you,

270
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,350
because why wouldn't pay?

271
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,040
Because they want to see what's real.

272
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,210
They're not messing around.

273
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,650
We're trying to live right.

274
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:49,350
And they want to see what they're
going to push the boundaries.

275
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:54,270
And if you have a solid relationship
and the kid comes up and pushes against

276
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:54,451
that,

277
00:10:54,451 --> 00:10:55,170
it's like,

278
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:58,060
you know how when we were talking about
some of that to walk once or twice and

279
00:10:58,061 --> 00:11:01,610
stand up underneath the table
needs to short snap a good one.

280
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,490
But because of the table
never changes shape,

281
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,950
he'll only do that twice.

282
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,030
And so now for the chicken,

283
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,780
people was changing shape all the time.

284
00:11:12,781 --> 00:11:15,210
Or The kid would be underneath
there trying to bang his head on.

285
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:21,260
So if you and your wife has forged a
unit that isn't penetrable in some sense,

286
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:26,130
then they're going to push and push until
we find out could that doesn't work.

287
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,420
And then they're not going to replay that.

288
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,410
And that's going to be really good for
you because then your children will

289
00:11:31,411 --> 00:11:34,620
torture you to death and it's really
going to be good for your child because

290
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:39,120
they're going to have tested the limits
and find out that there are walls to

291
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:42,540
keep the chaos and that's
going to make them feel secure.

292
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,570
And then they're wanting to be able
to develop within that security.

293
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,430
So that's a perfect deal.

294
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,760
And so that's my advice for you.

295
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:52,740
Who's having to some on the 25th

296
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,740
thinks that you might want to think.

297
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,300
I have a chapter called,

298
00:12:19,301 --> 00:12:21,770
don't let your children do
anything that makes you dislike

299
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,393
dark

300
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,393
as well

301
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,703
low.

302
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,650
The more you're able
to construct the dark.

303
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:41,110
And so if you pretended
that it sounds like it up,

304
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,600
then why should anyone listen to you?

305
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:43,991
I mean,

306
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:45,010
I know what life was like.

307
00:12:45,011 --> 00:12:49,610
I spent 20,000 always counseling people
through the most difficult things that,

308
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:53,340
you know,

309
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,260
they were just selling.

310
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,203
I could,

311
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,390
it could help them solve a problem,

312
00:12:57,490 --> 00:12:59,610
even with the best will own their car.

313
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,040
And we just cornered into
this new damage is very,

314
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:03,874
very bad.

315
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,980
But most of the time it was
a very positive experience
because very frequently

316
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:09,760
people,

317
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,640
even in dire straits can make your
legs look better than they are.

318
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,953
So,

319
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:14,900
but to do that,

320
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:19,940
well you have to have to confront what's
terrible life like just try to by 11

321
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,510
and so you have to,

322
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,550
to deal with that.

323
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,653
So

324
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,710
how should you structure the
future children's education?

325
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:30,860
What were the first thing?

326
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,080
And we had to little fire.

327
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,153
Look,

328
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,620
the reason you don't want to let your
children do anything that makes you

329
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:39,281
dislike for this,

330
00:13:39,281 --> 00:13:43,360
because you'll be mean if you don't
mind and you're waiting or to them and

331
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,980
really capable of being mean.

332
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,030
And you might be neat because like you're,

333
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,420
you're the sort person who
abuses your child physically.

334
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:50,060
You know,

335
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:50,681
you laugh.

336
00:13:50,681 --> 00:13:51,910
Shall we have a terrible temper?

337
00:13:51,911 --> 00:13:53,800
And they're angry at
them when they succeeded.

338
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,850
Your brutal or you might be the sort of
person that smothers the with dependent

339
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:01,940
law and either way it can just do
them in and you can do both of those

340
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,470
unbelievably needly.

341
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,810
And if you don't like the children,

342
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,460
that is exactly what we do.

343
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,620
And they might think,

344
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,100
oh no you won't because you love them.

345
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,400
It's like,

346
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,410
yes you will.

347
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:14,180
That's what people are like and that's
why families are often such a stinky.

348
00:14:14,181 --> 00:14:18,340
It's of catastrophe and they don't have
to be like they frequently are and lots

349
00:14:18,341 --> 00:14:21,490
of people's whole life journey
is to fight their way out.

350
00:14:21,491 --> 00:14:22,940
If they're unbelievably powerful,

351
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,793
multiple family,

352
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,620
that's the whole [inaudible] nightmare.

353
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:27,663
So

354
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:32,620
you want to encourage your children to
behave in a manner that makes you deeply

355
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,390
appreciate the fact that they exist.

356
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:37,670
Now you're kind of praised
because you're only one person.

357
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:40,890
And so hopefully you have someone around
you that's your long term partner and

358
00:14:40,891 --> 00:14:44,680
say who could slap you on the back of
the head and you're being too insane

359
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,360
because you know,

360
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,860
part of what might make
you dislike your children,

361
00:14:48,861 --> 00:14:51,820
just the fact that you just only have
your act together well and they're doing

362
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,281
perfectly,

363
00:14:52,281 --> 00:14:54,830
you will key things if you
happen to be irritated about it.

364
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,760
And so that's part of why you need a
partner to sort of alerting when you meet

365
00:14:58,761 --> 00:15:00,310
unreasonable above your match.

366
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,090
And hopefully the two of
you were different enough.

367
00:15:02,091 --> 00:15:07,091
So you're a Melba makes you one half
decent put together person and that person

368
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,820
helps the child learn how to be likable.

369
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,150
So other people like,

370
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,310
so the first thing you want to figure out,

371
00:15:13,311 --> 00:15:17,460
if you want your child to have a
proper relationship with being,

372
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:17,930
et Cetera,

373
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:18,350
this,

374
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,090
whether that's actually what you want,

375
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,681
you know,

376
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:22,540
because you might get hit.

377
00:15:22,541 --> 00:15:22,881
Of course,

378
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:24,380
that's what people want
for their children.

379
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:24,681
It's like,

380
00:15:24,681 --> 00:15:25,210
no,

381
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:25,580
no,

382
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:25,721
no,

383
00:15:25,721 --> 00:15:26,554
of course.

384
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,493
And it's not.

385
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,900
Lots of people have terrible parents
and they're not just carrot to be them.

386
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,770
I mean that's bad,

387
00:15:33,771 --> 00:15:34,490
but it's not.

388
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,070
That's something that starts neglect.

389
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,500
Kids can handle latch.

390
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:38,811
One does,

391
00:15:38,811 --> 00:15:39,770
it's not total.

392
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,530
But I've had clients whose parents didn't.

393
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:45,170
Every time that person did something good,

394
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:49,220
their parents punished every single
time until they were terrified of doing

395
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:50,180
anything at all.

396
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,500
And either punished by criticizing to
death when they have the goal to try to do

397
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:59,501
something useful in the world or acting
as if they were absolutely terrified out

398
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:00,921
of their skeletal.

399
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:02,570
Every time a child took a risk,

400
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:06,290
which is the sort of helicopter
parenting that so absolutely Kevin Scott,

401
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,000
don't get upset your mother,

402
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:08,810
you know,

403
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,050
with your courageous and
forthright action in the world,

404
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:12,591
right?

405
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:14,420
And so then see if you do that,

406
00:16:14,421 --> 00:16:16,460
then you can associate courageous action,

407
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,353
guilt.

408
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,350
If you really want to do into your kids
and then that's an excellent trick and

409
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:23,540
take the best thing about them and
make them feel horrible about it.

410
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,070
That's a good trip.

411
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,810
And if you don't think
you're capable of that,

412
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:30,350
then you're not taking it because you
are capable of and it's a real danger.

413
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:34,290
It's the danger of over protectiveness
cause it takes a real courageous parents

414
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:35,124
too.

415
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,031
It's so interesting.

416
00:16:36,031 --> 00:16:37,190
I watched this video last night,

417
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:37,581
my wife,

418
00:16:37,581 --> 00:16:38,450
she went to me,

419
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,690
I think it was from Russia because I
don't think this could have ever possibly

420
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:42,470
happening.

421
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:45,560
America is typically about two,

422
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,440
I think he's still in diapers 30 mobile.

423
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:52,630
And you know we had their parents had
put up one of those little doorways that

424
00:16:52,631 --> 00:16:56,950
we put up for kids in the door that
keeps them in the room or maybe stops him

425
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,190
from falling down the stairs.

426
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,710
And so it had one of those little things.

427
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,730
But there's actually two.

428
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:07,930
I'm talking because this kid had and
learn how to get client to reflect and

429
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,310
learn a little,

430
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:18,330
the little door with the
post Nicco another one on
top and he climbed up a hell

431
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,330
of a time going up over the
top and he was in diapers.

432
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:23,931
If you look at that,

433
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,030
you think that

434
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:27,890
that's what's going to happen.

435
00:17:28,070 --> 00:17:30,150
But the parents did interfere.

436
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,370
They videotaped it.

437
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,370
No,

438
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,410
it's not abusive.

439
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:40,360
Here's what's abusive is you wait until
the kid is three quarters of the way up.

440
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,360
The second one,

441
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:45,260
so like five feet off the ground and
then you have a little panic attack about

442
00:17:45,261 --> 00:17:46,160
how or it is.

443
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,430
So then you upset the child so that he
fall and hurt himself and then you'd tell

444
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:53,580
him that's what happens when
you do that sort of thing.

445
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,180
That's abuse and they get to do that
[inaudible] point and it's like it's a

446
00:18:06,991 --> 00:18:08,700
courageous terror who stands back.

447
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,670
I don't want that kid this fall,

448
00:18:11,671 --> 00:18:15,240
but I'm not going to mock about movies
out there like a master in new world.

449
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:17,040
So that's what we do.

450
00:18:17,041 --> 00:18:20,820
If you have some courage and you let
your children take your us because if you

451
00:18:20,821 --> 00:18:23,400
don't have lumps are
going to get a lot of big.

452
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,763
So

453
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:31,140
you want the best for your children and
you've got to ask yourself that question

454
00:18:31,141 --> 00:18:34,600
seriously because there's at least is
a big part of you that came the part,

455
00:18:34,601 --> 00:18:37,170
let's say it does not want
the best for your children.

456
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,660
It could be an annoying
if it was successful,

457
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,700
that would be fun.

458
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,890
How they succeeded.

459
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,080
And so,

460
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,340
and if you don't think that's true that
you do not know anything because it is

461
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,610
your and [inaudible] and
everyone's like [inaudible].

462
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,900
Some people are really like that.

463
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:53,950
So when you might think that it's dark,

464
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,200
it doesn't have cause reality and,

465
00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:01,410
and [inaudible],

466
00:19:06,601 --> 00:19:09,240
what would you say to someone
who doesn't feel like he,

467
00:19:09,241 --> 00:19:10,840
not while you're right,

468
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:13,811
touching.

469
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:14,644
Okay,

470
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,820
what do you shouldn't do is beat
yourself up because of that.

471
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:20,310
Like you're not enough and it shouldn't,

472
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,300
it shouldn't take you are,

473
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,290
because then what the hell are you,

474
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,461
are you going to do?

475
00:19:23,461 --> 00:19:25,110
If you're already on attaining the goal,

476
00:19:25,111 --> 00:19:26,170
you've got nothing to do it.

477
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:26,880
You know,

478
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,560
one of the things I've noticed talking
to audiences like this over the last year

479
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,310
and a half or so,

480
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:35,280
the audience gets very quiet
when I talk about two things.

481
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,410
One is responsibility.

482
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,090
Every medical is quiet to
cancel school because of grips,

483
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:41,770
you know,

484
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:42,270
it's like,

485
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:42,391
oh,

486
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:43,350
there's something to that.

487
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,390
And you know that the audience
goes quiet when we talk,

488
00:19:46,391 --> 00:19:47,160
it comes up.

489
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,700
You know there's something in the
Internet because it's unspoken necessity

490
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:51,840
that's manifesting itself.

491
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,210
It's that

492
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,210
this issue of self esteem.

493
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,460
So would I be suggesting to people
psychologists plus the soil,

494
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,160
especially the ones that
aren't very well informed,

495
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:13,170
haven't been telling people for five
decades that they should have high self

496
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:14,004
esteem.

497
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:14,963
It's like

498
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,860
most of what passes for self esteem
has been shaped by a psychologist is

499
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:21,450
actually the temperamental trait.

500
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:25,260
So if you take self esteem scales
and you score heights because you're

501
00:20:25,261 --> 00:20:27,090
extroverted and low in neuroticism,

502
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,160
so the scales are wrong,

503
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:30,610
that's one.

504
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:34,320
And number two is who the hell says
you should have high self esteem.

505
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,340
What's so great about,

506
00:20:35,341 --> 00:20:36,174
you

507
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:39,980
know,

508
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:43,170
it's not because people are
very happy with who they are.

509
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,693
And so if you tell them,

510
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,031
oh no,

511
00:20:45,031 --> 00:20:45,950
you're good to read more.

512
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:47,080
I think wait a,

513
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,260
I'm not very happy with
the way things are with me.

514
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,400
And so I was supposed to be
happy with the way I'm and I'm,

515
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,070
and then like,

516
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,890
what about this?

517
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,530
This read this part of my life.

518
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,070
And so it's not a good thing to tell
people that they're just okay the way they

519
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:00,580
are.

520
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,290
That's not at all.

521
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,100
What do you want to tell them is you
could be winging when did you are,

522
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:09,930
you could be way more than
you are and that would be bad.

523
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,940
That would be better for you and it would
be better for your feminist would be

524
00:21:12,941 --> 00:21:17,430
better for the country to be better for
every and there's something about east

525
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,780
sufficient and wretched as you are.

526
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,490
Then could you start that,

527
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:26,610
start on that path and be successful and
so it isn't that you should be that you

528
00:21:29,561 --> 00:21:31,840
should be happy with yourself
because of who you are.

529
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:37,390
It's that you should be the sexual of
yourself because you are the sort of

530
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:42,391
person who transformed herself
into and that's way better.

531
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:49,700
[inaudible].

532
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,990
I want to put up a little
bit boundary road that look,

533
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,410
I know that people beat themselves up
at the time and so it could be two jumps

534
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:02,400
medical with regards to yourself
and that means getting aggression.

535
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,660
I notice of anxiety.

536
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,030
Can you really have and committed suicide?

537
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,490
You got out of it despite the fact that
you thought of anything you could be,

538
00:22:09,491 --> 00:22:12,030
you have to have a little bit of
mercy that you're touched towards you.

539
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,000
So if you don't want to,

540
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:13,840
you don't want it.

541
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,900
You want to treat yourself with
someone that you're trying to help.

542
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:17,710
Right.

543
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,790
That's another talking,

544
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:22,630
talking to treat yourself like you're
someone who responsible for help and that

545
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,850
regards to the detachment.

546
00:22:24,070 --> 00:22:27,380
Imagine that you're worthwhile
despite your analysis.

547
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,920
And then if necessary in the world,

548
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,200
at least in the bowl,

549
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:32,203
it's to help.

550
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,130
And I think that's absolutely the case
because you could certainly generate,

551
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,820
it'll help yourself up too much.

552
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:41,740
So you've been at least not do
that and that would be important.

553
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,640
So it's reasonable to treat yourself
with a certain amount of detached to the

554
00:22:45,641 --> 00:22:49,510
SPEC and then the garden himself
to someone you should try to help.

555
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:53,150
Like you would help someone
character in a detached sort of way.

556
00:22:53,151 --> 00:22:55,490
Because if people have melanin,

557
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,250
if other people have value,

558
00:22:57,490 --> 00:23:01,690
then you have melted and you load yourself
the same ethical responsibility that

559
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:03,770
you owe other people
and maybe what you want.

560
00:23:03,771 --> 00:23:07,810
What other people is the responsibility
to help them along the way so that the

561
00:23:07,811 --> 00:23:09,490
world gets better rather than worse.

562
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,490
And so that's the same attitude
that you should think to yourself.

563
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,260
So despite the fact that you're
not all that you should be,

564
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,030
despite the fact that you have plenty
to learn and they should learn it,

565
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:19,720
you don't,

566
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,860
you also don't get to beat yourself to
death with a stick all the time because

567
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,410
you're in submission 50 different ways.

568
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,960
So justice,

569
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,950
that's the judgment and mercy is what
enables you to tolerate the judgment.

570
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:37,900
And you need to use both of those forums
to discuss the proper relationship with

571
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:38,734
your life.

572
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,890
And so you're not enough.

573
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:45,140
Thank God for that because you wouldn't
have anything worthwhile to do if you

574
00:23:45,141 --> 00:23:47,390
were to not do,

575
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,640
which is to make things
better than they are,

576
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,810
including yourself.

577
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,823
And so

578
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:58,990
[inaudible]

579
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,830
do you pray?

580
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,200
I don't ask God for fees.

581
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,220
And I think that's what people do.

582
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:34,493
Pray

583
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,670
prayer is actually something
that works but asked him,

584
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,780
cause that doesn't work.

585
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,440
You could ask to have enough
courage to see the truth.

586
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,140
And that's a painful thing to do.

587
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,191
So for example,

588
00:24:55,191 --> 00:24:55,521
here's the,

589
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:58,250
here's the prayer of sorts.

590
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:01,020
So imagine you're having a fight
with your wife and it's only you.

591
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,500
It's like it's this sort of
fight that makes you women,

592
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:05,540
whether he should be in
the damn relationship.

593
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,033
And so,

594
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:07,850
you know,

595
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,970
every fight you tending in that direction,

596
00:25:09,971 --> 00:25:10,804
which is awesome,

597
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:15,440
why can't we won't have flex up
that entire space of catastrophe?

598
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,800
And it's part of the light.

599
00:25:16,801 --> 00:25:18,230
You want to be serious about it.

600
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,580
You don't want to open up
to the possibility that you
could leave every time you

601
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:23,330
have a fight.
