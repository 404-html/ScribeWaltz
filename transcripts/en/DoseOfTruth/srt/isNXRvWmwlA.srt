1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:06,960
When I was about your age,

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,980
now it was back in the early
eighties or there abouts.

3
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,363
Um,

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:19,680
and this is particularly true around 1984,

5
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:21,270
but it was true before that too.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,410
Um,

7
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:22,651
you know,

8
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:24,360
every generation has its worries,

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,850
real or imagined.

10
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:32,851
And the primary worry for people of my
generation was nuclear war and you know,

11
00:00:36,691 --> 00:00:38,280
it was a genuine worry.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,133
Um,

13
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,850
at one point,

14
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,200
many years later,

15
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:47,700
I went down to Arizona to visit an ICBM,

16
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:52,460
a decommissioned ICBM
nuclear missile silo and I,

17
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,610
the ICBM intercontinental ballistic
missiles were very large rockets.

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,631
Right?

19
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,920
They flew it,

20
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:04,020
I could fly halfway around the world
and it was deep underground and behind

21
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,291
very,

22
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,390
very thick steel doors.

23
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,320
It was light green,

24
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:07,531
you know,

25
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:11,760
that pastel green that everyone
seemed to like the 1950s.

26
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:15,510
I was like Pastel Green Star Trek console.

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,100
That's what it looked like.

28
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:18,443
And uh,

29
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,800
so we went down,

30
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,650
out in the yard was in the
desert out in the yard.

31
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,484
There was a very,

32
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:25,530
I would say yes,

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,910
magical object,

34
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,650
for lack of a better word.

35
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,700
And that was the nose cone for the IC.

36
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,000
I ICBM and it was quite big,

37
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:45,490
that big boat out high pointed like the
point of a bullet about three quarters

38
00:01:45,491 --> 00:01:47,470
of inch of an inch thick plastic.

39
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,850
You know what kind of a resin,

40
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:51,520
and it was designed to melt on reentry.

41
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,230
So that was just sitting there.

42
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,790
So that was fairly

43
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,330
okay

44
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:57,260
thought provoking,

45
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,280
let's put it that way.

46
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,820
And then we went into the missile silo,

47
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,980
interestingly enough,

48
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,600
appended to the front of it.

49
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,580
It had been decommissioned
under Reagan by the way,

50
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,170
in the front of it,

51
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,400
there was a,

52
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,400
like a museum with artifacts from the
1980s featuring Reagan and Gorbachev

53
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,870
Meeting Multiple Times.

54
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:24,860
And it was staffed by these southern,

55
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,170
these Americans from the south who were
grandparents age and they were here just

56
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:32,120
super friendly and you know,

57
00:02:32,121 --> 00:02:33,350
they were happy to be in the museum.

58
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:34,490
It was like going to visit your,

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,130
your grandma's nuclear missile silo.

60
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,110
And so it was jarring,

61
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:39,381
you know,

62
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:42,860
because it's obviously a poor tentious

63
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:50,500
place and yet it was conjoined
with hospitality and welcoming.

64
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,150
It was surreal in that manner.

65
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:54,531
Anyways,

66
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:55,364
we went in to the

67
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:57,040
okay

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,100
into the silo and a,

69
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,430
they ran us through a simulated launch.

70
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:08,670
So imagine a panel like this made out of
metal except twice as long with another

71
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:11,320
one of these things out the other end,

72
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,940
16 feet across or so

73
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,950
basically 1950s technology

74
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:20,403
but updated.

75
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,620
And then imagine that what you
had to do to launch it was the,

76
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,100
there was a guy with a key and there
was another guy with a key and if I

77
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:27,761
remember correctly,

78
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:29,140
the keys were around their necks,

79
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:31,840
although I don't think they were
stored around their necks permanently.

80
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:32,620
But,

81
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,090
and so to launch the missile,

82
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:36,040
you had to put the key in the lock,

83
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:37,863
both of you.

84
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,390
That was the safety precautions,

85
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,660
had to be two of you.

86
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:46,930
Put the key in the lock and hold it for
10 seconds and then a way the missile

87
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,340
goes and it wasn't as big.

88
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,760
The missile wasn't as big as the
rockets that went to the moon,

89
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,370
but it was plenty big.

90
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:54,851
You know,

91
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:55,040
the,

92
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,040
the silo itself would have easily been
as wide as this room is and perhaps

93
00:04:00,881 --> 00:04:01,840
larger and many,

94
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:02,920
many stories tall,

95
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:03,191
you know,

96
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,450
cause it was nested underground.

97
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,450
So they ran us through a simulated launch,

98
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,313
which was

99
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,990
surreal I would say.

100
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:17,940
And then they told us that someone asked
and they said the keys were in once.

101
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,560
Now they wouldn't tell us when,

102
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:22,643
you know,

103
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:27,770
that would have been during the Cuban
missile crisis because we were that close

104
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:32,070
and we were close again at other times,

105
00:04:32,071 --> 00:04:33,420
although perhaps not that close.

106
00:04:33,421 --> 00:04:36,150
And there seemed to be another peak of

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,160
conflict in 1984 when there was a movie
showed at that time called the day

108
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:45,810
after,

109
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,370
which at that time garnered more
views than any movie ever had on,

110
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,270
on TV.

111
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,270
And it was a story about the aftermath
of a nuclear war and the people who were

112
00:04:57,151 --> 00:04:57,541
left.

113
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:02,400
And it was pretty realistic
and pretty frightening.

114
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:03,180
And it,

115
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,020
it turned out,

116
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,480
as I found out later,

117
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:11,370
that that movie actually was one of the
things that influenced Ronald Reagan to

118
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,560
put pressure on or
negotiate with the Soviets,

119
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,560
depending on how you look at it.

120
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,473
And so,

121
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:19,681
well,

122
00:05:19,681 --> 00:05:19,921
and then,

123
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:20,161
you know,

124
00:05:20,161 --> 00:05:21,090
five years later,

125
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,060
the Soviet Union collapsed.

126
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,530
No one saw that coming.

127
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,413
Um,

128
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,020
and it really didn't collapse
in 1989 in some sense,

129
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:31,231
you know,

130
00:05:31,231 --> 00:05:34,890
like a huge machine like that.

131
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,330
It doesn't fall apart all like
once it falls apart over time.

132
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:42,960
And then at some point it just
becomes unsustainable and topples and,

133
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:44,520
you know,

134
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,400
it's like they lost faith
in their doctrine and,

135
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,413
and,

136
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,670
and for good reason.
