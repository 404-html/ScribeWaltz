1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:11,290
You Start Your path and you think that
you're heading towards your star and so

2
00:00:11,411 --> 00:00:15,880
you go in that direction and
then because you're here,

3
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:17,560
the world looks a particular way,

4
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:18,850
but then when you move here,

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,680
the world looks different and you're
different as a consequence of having made

6
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:28,090
that voyage and so what that means is
that now that thing that glimmers in front

7
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:32,920
of you is going to have shifted its
location because you weren't very good at

8
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:36,550
specifying it to begin with and now
that you're a little sharper and more

9
00:00:36,551 --> 00:00:37,930
focused than you were,

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,040
it's going to reveal itself
with more accuracy to you.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,430
And so then you have to take a.

12
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,580
You know,

13
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,980
it's almost like 180 degree reversal.

14
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,500
But it isn't because you know you've.

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,560
I mean you've gone this far and
that's a long ways to get that far,

16
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,190
but that's a lot farther than you would
be if you just stayed where you were

17
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:04,244
waiting.

18
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,170
And so it doesn't matter that
you overshoot continually.

19
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,510
Because as you overshoot,

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,900
even if you don't learn
what you should have done,

21
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:18,500
you're going to continually learn
what you shouldn't keep doing.

22
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,460
And if you learn enough about
what you shouldn't keep doing,

23
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,900
then that's tantamount at some point
to learning at the same time what you

24
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:27,734
should be doing.

25
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,390
So it's okay.

26
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,520
So it's like this.

27
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:34,520
Now what's cool about it though,

28
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,800
I think is that as you progress,

29
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:40,550
the degree of overshooting
starts to decline,

30
00:01:40,551 --> 00:01:41,300
right?

31
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,180
And that we know that there was
nothing hypothetical about that.

32
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,860
As you learn a new skill,

33
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,730
like even to play it,

34
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:47,900
play a song on the piano,

35
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:48,441
for example,

36
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,640
you overshoot madly,

37
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,440
you make an all sorts of
mistakes to begin with.

38
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,000
And then the mistakes

39
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,940
they disappear.

40
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,160
There's a great ted talk,

41
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:01,700
I think it was about sky,

42
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:01,940
uh,

43
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,940
set up a really advanced computational
recording system in his home and recorded

44
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:11,830
every single utterance his young
child made while learning to speak.

45
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:16,980
And then he put together the child's
attempts to say certain phonemes and put

46
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:22,570
them in the list and you can hear the
child deviating madly to begin with.

47
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,970
And then after hundreds and
hundreds of repetitions,

48
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:28,240
just zeroing in on the exact phoneme.

49
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,463
So you know,

50
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:30,610
you might not know this,

51
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:31,820
but when kids babble,

52
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:33,670
because they start babbling
when they're quite young,

53
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:38,470
they babble every human phoneme including
all sorts of phonemes that adults

54
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:39,304
can't say,

55
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:44,460
and then they they die into their
language so that after they learn,

56
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,791
say English,

57
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:48,700
then there's all sorts of phonemes
they can no longer here or pronounced,

58
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:49,391
but to begin with,

59
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:50,224
it's all there,

60
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,430
which is really quite interesting,

61
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,300
but so they Z,

62
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,390
as they learn a particular language,

63
00:02:55,391 --> 00:03:00,391
they zero in on the proper
way to pronounce that and
their minimized and every

64
00:03:00,731 --> 00:03:03,490
time you learn something now that's how
it is and that's really useful to know

65
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:08,350
too because it means that it's okay to
wander around stupidly before you fix

66
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:09,760
your destination.

67
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,740
Now you see that echoed in exodus,

68
00:03:11,741 --> 00:03:12,520
right?

69
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,020
Because what happens is that the Egyptians
or the Hebrews escape materiality,

70
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:20,860
which is kind of whatever you do
personally and psychologically,

71
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,870
when you escape from your previous
set of stupidly held and ignorant and

72
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:27,130
stubborn axioms,

73
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,840
it's like away from that tyranny.

74
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,141
It's like,

75
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:29,471
great.

76
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:30,730
I freed myself from that.

77
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:31,863
Well then what?

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:32,831
Well,

79
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:33,221
you think,

80
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,210
well now I'm on the way,

81
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:34,511
it's no,

82
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:34,841
you're not.

83
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,350
Now you're in the desert where
you wonder around stupidly,

84
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,480
you know and worship the wrong things
until you finally organized yourself

85
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:45,940
morally again and head
in the proper direction,

86
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:48,610
so that's worth knowing
too because you think,

87
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:49,601
well,

88
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,400
I got rid of a lot of things,

89
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:51,911
baggage,

90
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,950
excess baggage that I
didn't need in my life,

91
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:55,240
and now everything's okay.

92
00:03:55,241 --> 00:03:55,571
It's like,

93
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:55,721
no,

94
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:56,260
it's not.

95
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,430
You've got rid of a whole set of scaffolds
that were keeping you in place even

96
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:01,780
though they were pathological.

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,580
Now you have nothing and nothing actually
turns out to be better than something

98
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,780
pathological,

99
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,750
but you're still stuck with
the problem of nothing,

100
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,040
and that's,

101
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,221
well,

102
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:14,920
that's exactly why exit this is
structured the way that it is.

103
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,870
It's that you escaped from maturity.

104
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:17,710
It's hooray.

105
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:18,910
We're no longer slaves.

106
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:19,091
Yeah,

107
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:21,460
well now you're nihilistic and lost.

108
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,530
It's not necessarily an improvement,

109
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,940
but it is,

110
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,773
but it is the pre.

111
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,710
See,

112
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:31,450
it's also useful to know that because you
can also be diluted into the idea that

113
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,550
imagine that you're trying
to become enlightened,

114
00:04:33,551 --> 00:04:37,090
which might mean to turn all those
parts of you on that could be turned on.

115
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:37,661
You think,

116
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:37,781
well,

117
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,840
that's just a linear pathway uphill.

118
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,161
You know,

119
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:42,100
it's just from one success to another.

120
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,431
It's no,

121
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,264
it's not.

122
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,210
It's like here you are and you're not
doing too badly and the first step is a

123
00:04:46,211 --> 00:04:47,860
complete bloody catastrophe.

124
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,230
It's worse and then maybe you can pull
yourself together and you hit a new

125
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,540
plateau and then that
crumbles and shakes and bang.

126
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:59,500
It's worse again and so because part
of the reason that people don't become

127
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:04,501
enlightened is because it's punctuated
by intermittent deserts essentially by

128
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,400
intermittent catastrophes,

129
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:10,390
and if you don't know that well then
you're basically screwed because you go

130
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,330
ahead on your movement forward
and you collapsed and you think,

131
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:13,481
well,

132
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,081
that didn't work.

133
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:14,831
I collapsed.

134
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:15,191
It's like,

135
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:15,880
no,

136
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,800
that's par for the course.

137
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,170
It's not indication that you failed.

138
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:23,980
It's just indication that it's really
hard and that when you learn something,

139
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:27,850
you also unlearn something and the thing
you unlearned is probably useful and

140
00:05:27,851 --> 00:05:29,620
unlearning it actually is painful.

141
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,011
You know,

142
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:32,140
let's say if you have to get
out of a bad relationship,

143
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,310
it's like not every,

144
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:34,203
not any.

145
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,780
There isn't any relationship
that's a hundred percent bad.

146
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,670
So when you jump out of it,

147
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:41,380
well maybe you're in better shape,

148
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:43,120
but you're still lonesome and disoriented.

149
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,780
You don't know what your past was and
you don't know what your present isn't.

150
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,230
He don't know what your future is.

151
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:48,460
It's that's not.

152
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,380
That's why people stay with the
devil they know instead of you know,

153
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,880
looking for the devil they don't know so,

154
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,040
so anyways,

155
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:03,640
the fact that you're full
of faults doesn't mean you
have to stop and thank God

156
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:04,461
for that.

157
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:08,330
That's a really useful thing and the
fact that you're full of faults doesn't

158
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:13,331
mean that you can't learn and so you can
pause it in an ideal and you're going

159
00:06:13,411 --> 00:06:14,420
to be wrong about it,

160
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,840
but it doesn't matter because what
you're right about is positing the ideal,

161
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,710
moving towards it.

162
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,660
If the actual ideal isn't

163
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,410
conceptualized perfectly,

164
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:25,550
well first surprise,

165
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,061
surprise,

166
00:06:26,061 --> 00:06:27,800
because like what are you
going to do that's perfect.

167
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:30,450
So it doesn't matter that it's imperfect,

168
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:31,281
imperfect,

169
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:33,770
it just matters that you do
it and that you move forward.

170
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,850
So that's really,

171
00:06:34,851 --> 00:06:38,000
that's really positive news as far as
I'm concerned because you could actually

172
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:38,481
do that,

173
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:38,840
right?

174
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,420
You can do it badly
and anyone can do that.

175
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:42,254
So that's,

176
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,183
that's useful.

177
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:44,781
Okay.

178
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:46,340
So like if you were an efficient person,

179
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,130
you would have just done
that but you're not.

180
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:50,211
But who cares,

181
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:50,431
you know,

182
00:06:50,431 --> 00:06:51,650
and you still end up in the,

183
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,520
in the same place and maybe the
trip is even more interesting.

184
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,120
Who knows?

185
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,260
Probably too interesting.
