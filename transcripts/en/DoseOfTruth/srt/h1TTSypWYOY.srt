1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,260
Then she has,

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,180
she gets pregnant and she has twins.

3
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:13,190
And this is an interesting thing.

4
00:00:13,191 --> 00:00:14,900
The twins fight inside her.

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,750
She can tell that they're
not getting along.

6
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,220
And this is an echo,

7
00:00:19,221 --> 00:00:19,521
right?

8
00:00:19,521 --> 00:00:24,521
It's an echo of Cain and Abel and there's
a mythological motif that the unions

9
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,180
have called the hostile brothers,

10
00:00:26,181 --> 00:00:27,170
the hostile brothers.

11
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:28,460
And you see them all the time.

12
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:32,510
Batman and the joker are hostile brothers
and Thor and Loki or hostile brothers

13
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:33,100
and I,

14
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,470
it's an unbelievably common motif and uh,

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,071
you know,

16
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:39,380
the ultimate hostile
brothers or Christ and Satan.

17
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:40,214
So that's the,

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,670
that's the archetipal representation
of the hostile brothers,

19
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,361
right?

20
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:45,980
The ultimate good and the ultimate evil.

21
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:47,323
And so,

22
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:49,910
and so it's an echo of
the Cain and Abel story,

23
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,790
although it's a little more complex,

24
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,290
I would say from a literary point of
view because it isn't obvious which of

25
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:57,981
these brothers,

26
00:00:57,981 --> 00:00:59,570
his cane and which of them is able,

27
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:02,360
they have parts of both in each of them.

28
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,640
So Esau,

29
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,160
who turns out to be one of the brothers
and Jacob move turns out to be the

30
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:07,700
other,

31
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,300
both have their admiral bull
qualities and their faults.

32
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:12,201
Anyways,

33
00:01:12,201 --> 00:01:15,260
I'm Esau comes is born first,

34
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,570
but Jacob hasn't by the heel.

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,880
And so there was a fight within the
womb to see who would emerge first.

36
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:27,881
Now that's relevant because the
firstborn had a special status,

37
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:30,020
while has a special status
in many communities,

38
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,970
especially agricultural communities.

39
00:01:31,971 --> 00:01:35,360
And there's a reason all these
people were more hurts people.

40
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:38,540
But if you divide your property
equally among all your children,

41
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,740
then he'd like three generations.

42
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:42,440
Everybody has one goat and
everybody starves to death,

43
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,131
you know?

44
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:44,970
Or the same thing happens with lands.

45
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:49,100
So one of the ways that that traditional
communities solve that as they just

46
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:53,330
give them almost everything to the first
born and then the everyone else knows,

47
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:53,571
well,

48
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,600
you go out and do whatever you can
and it's kind of arbitrary and unfair,

49
00:01:56,601 --> 00:01:57,620
but you know,

50
00:01:57,621 --> 00:02:02,621
at least it's predictably arbitrary
and unfair instead of doom over four

51
00:02:02,721 --> 00:02:03,501
generations,

52
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:04,100
you know?

53
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,730
So it actually mattered to be the first
born and God generally favors the first

54
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,573
born.

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,850
And then you might think,

56
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:10,971
well,

57
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:12,580
what is it about being born first?

58
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,460
It's so relevant,

59
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:13,630
uh,

60
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,860
apart from the,

61
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,260
the cultural practice of,

62
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,200
of a board.

63
00:02:18,201 --> 00:02:19,130
Generous inheritance.

64
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:19,911
And I would say,

65
00:02:19,911 --> 00:02:20,061
well,

66
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:23,360
the first born is something like the
model for the leader of the family,

67
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:23,541
right?

68
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,940
Because the first born child should be,

69
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,260
if there's a number of siblings,

70
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,860
a should take care of the
siblings at least to some degree,

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,780
but also should be a role model for them.

72
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:35,030
So it's like a natural
position of leadership,

73
00:02:35,031 --> 00:02:36,590
but there's a cycle.

74
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,610
There's a cycle psychologize of the
idea of the firstborn in these stories

75
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:45,611
because God often passes over the first
born in favor of a later born child.

76
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,060
Um,

77
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,910
he seems to do that on the
basis of moral character,

78
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:50,744
essentially.

79
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,160
And so there's this idea that,

80
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:52,720
well,

81
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,330
there's a natural proclivity
towards leadership.

82
00:02:56,331 --> 00:03:00,070
That's just a biological fact that
would be associated being a first born.

83
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,960
But there's an element of character,

84
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:04,300
a logical development
that transcends that.

85
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:05,490
And so that you,

86
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,140
it's more important to be
spiritually a firstborn,

87
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:08,501
let's say,

88
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,390
than to be biologically a first born.

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,400
And God recognizes that continually in
these stories and inverts the natural

90
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,950
order and favors a later board who's,

91
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,060
who's done more work with regards
to characterological development.
