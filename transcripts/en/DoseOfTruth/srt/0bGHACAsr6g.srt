Hi,
Dr. Peterson.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,800
Um,
so what the story of Jacob today,

3
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:13,740
there was a theme of betrayal and you
can see that from the beginning because

4
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:15,570
he was very angry and jealous of his
brother.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:18,870
And I was thinking,
are there any stories or we can say

6
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:21,120
about betrayal that does come from a
loved one,

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:23,760
right?
Where it's not from a place of so black

8
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:26,220
and white of anger,
resentment and bitter,

9
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:28,550
and how the parties,
um,

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,570
kind of recover from that.
Or is there any way to reading dot.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,160
Or is it as black and white us if you'll
be traced on one,

12
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:36,660
then there it's like Jacob where he's,
he was bitter.

13
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:37,300
He was planning

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,250
hatred,
no one.

15
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,730
And in fact,
in this story,

16
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:43,660
it's not black and white because we know
we're only halfway through it.

17
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:44,620
And,
um,

18
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,830
one of the things I've noticed as a
clinician,

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,400
let's say,
is that an,

20
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,040
as an observer of people in general,
is that I've never ever seen anyone get

21
00:00:54,041 --> 00:00:57,220
away with anything.
And Jacob doesn't get away with any of

22
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:58,720
this.
And so,

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,600
um,
you know,

24
00:01:01,601 --> 00:01:06,601
he's humbled by his eventual experiences
and he learns that he did it wrong.

25
00:01:06,701 --> 00:01:10,300
And there's reconciliation that happens
throughout the story of Jacob.

26
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,680
So,
and there's minor betrayals and major be

27
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:14,411
trails.
You know,

28
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:17,890
that some of them have tremendously
serious consequences and some of them

29
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:21,670
have lesser consequences,
but there is an underlying idea that

30
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,310
things can still be set right.
Even though it's,

31
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:28,760
well,
I think it takes Jacob some 20 years,

32
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:31,900
something like that to set things right.
And even then,

33
00:01:31,901 --> 00:01:36,190
it's like touch and go.
So if I answer your question,

34
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,750
okay,
yeah.
