1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,620
So that's a lovely photograph.

2
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:12,680
Obviously that's the
establishment of a new center.

3
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,540
And then the center can be a cathedral
to and often is of course in classic

4
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,320
towns,

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,270
European towns in particular,

6
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:26,620
although it's not only European
towns that are like this there,

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,150
there's a center that's made out of stone.

8
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:32,900
So that would be the cathedral and it's
got the highest tower on top of the

9
00:00:32,901 --> 00:00:33,231
tower.

10
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:36,410
There's often a cross and
that's the symbolic center.

11
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:37,430
So people are,

12
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:41,600
are drawn together around
whatever the cross represents.

13
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:45,440
Now that the cross obviously
represents a center cause it's an x,

14
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:45,741
right?

15
00:00:45,741 --> 00:00:46,970
X marks the spot.

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,250
So the center of the Cross is the center.

17
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:52,340
And then the cathedrals
often in a cross shape,

18
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:53,870
which also marks the center.

19
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:58,670
And then in the cathedral there's
a dome often and that's the sky.

20
00:00:58,671 --> 00:01:02,480
And that's that ladder that
reaches from Earth to heaven.

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:05,030
So it's a recapitulation of the same idea.

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,433
So,

23
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:12,100
and people are drawn to that center and
the center is the symbol of what unites

24
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:12,771
them.

25
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:17,771
And what unites them is the faith that
the cathedral is the embodiment of.

26
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:20,000
And you think,

27
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:20,121
well,

28
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,390
what does the faith mean?

29
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:21,861
And again,

30
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:25,650
we're approaching this psychologically
and what it means is that we,

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,170
everyone who's a member of that group
accepts the transcendent ideal of the

32
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:31,004
group.

33
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,061
Now the thing is,

34
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:33,230
if you're the member of a group,

35
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:35,600
you accept the transcendent
ideal of the group.

36
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,270
That's what it means to
be a member of a group.

37
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:41,030
So if you're in a work team and
you're all working on a project,

38
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:45,350
what you've essentially done is decided
that you're going to make the goal

39
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,090
unquestionable,

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:47,450
right?

41
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:47,691
I mean,

42
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:49,070
you might argue about the details,

43
00:01:49,071 --> 00:01:50,690
but if you're tasked with something,

44
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,081
you know,

45
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:52,100
here's a job for you.

46
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,380
10 people organize
yourself around the job,

47
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,470
you can argue about how
you're going to do the job,

48
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:59,270
but you can't argue about the job,

49
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,010
then the group falls apart.

50
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,430
And so there's an act
of faith in some sense,

51
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,840
the reason that the act of faith
is necessary is because it's very,

52
00:02:08,841 --> 00:02:13,430
very difficult to specify without
error what that central aim should be,

53
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,440
given that there's any number of aims,

54
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:15,920
right?

55
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,581
And it's a very,

56
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,110
very difficult thing to figure out.

57
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:21,740
And this is something we're going to do
a little bit tonight is like what should

58
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:25,250
the aim be around which
a group would congregate?

59
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,350
You know,

60
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,740
so,

61
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:27,261
so Matt,

62
00:02:27,261 --> 00:02:30,770
especially if it's a large group and
it's a large group that has to stay

63
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:35,771
together across very large swaths of
time and the group is an incredibly

64
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:36,680
diverse,

65
00:02:36,681 --> 00:02:36,921
you know,

66
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:41,921
what possible kind of ideal could unite
a large group of diverse people across a

67
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:43,760
very large stretch of time.

68
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,930
That's a really,

69
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:46,010
really hard question.

70
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:49,700
And I think part of the way that
question has been answered is it's been

71
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:53,720
answered symbolically and in images
because it's so damn complicated that it's

72
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:57,440
almost impossible to articulate so,

73
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:01,810
but obviously you need to a center around
which everyone can unite because if

74
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,644
you don't,

75
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,600
then everyone is at odds with one another.

76
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:07,450
Like if I don't know what you're up
to and you don't know what he's up to,

77
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:12,190
we have no were just strangers and we
don't know that our ethics match at all.

78
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,870
Then the probability that we're going to
be able to exist harmoniously decreases

79
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:18,100
rapidly to zero.
