1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:07,921
Thank you.
So,

2
00:00:07,921 --> 00:00:09,950
so let me ask you another question about
that then.

3
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:12,360
So she,
one of the problems that I've had

4
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:15,630
because I've been trying to look out at
the,

5
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,680
the potential for our true relationship
between Islam and Christianity.

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:21,630
You know,
to the degree that I understand Islam or

7
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,210
Christianity,
which of course there's plenty to

8
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:26,550
understand about both.
So it's no easy thing to manage.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,380
But there is this claim as well that,
that that's widespread and rather vague

10
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,650
that that Islam is in essence a religion
of peace.

11
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:37,650
And,
but when I look at the historical data,

12
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:42,651
say stemming from Medina,
the Medina time and then moving forward

13
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,560
and the fact that Muhammad was
definitely someone who engaged

14
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:49,950
personally in warfare and in an
expansionist warfare,

15
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,310
it's not,
it's not an easy thing for me to make

16
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:57,750
the leap to uh,
to comprehending or being able to accept

17
00:00:57,751 --> 00:01:00,960
the claim that the fundamental doctrines
of Islam are peaceful,

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,771
are,
are,

19
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,210
are associated with piece.

20
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:06,240
Because it looks to me like there's an
element of it that's quite militaristic.

21
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:10,320
And I've also thought that,
let's say there's a religious element to

22
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,970
Islam.
And I mean this is not an original

23
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,040
thought.
Obviously there's a religious element to

24
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:15,690
Islam,
but there's also something that's

25
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:19,740
clearly more like a political movement
and more like a governmental movement.

26
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:23,820
And that's also complicated by the fact
that there isn't any clear separation

27
00:01:23,821 --> 00:01:26,850
between church and state in Islamic
doctrine as far as I can tell.

28
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,380
So when we hear claims that are,
when claims are made that Islam is

29
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:35,520
essentially a religion of peace,
then that doesn't seem to be the case

30
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:40,521
with the Medina end of the theological
discourse or the actions that that

31
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,740
emerged thereof.
And then part of the problem is how do

32
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:47,430
you reconcile that with the
contradictions in relationship to the

33
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:48,510
earlier,
earlier,

34
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:51,390
as you say,
Meccan doctrines and it isn't clear to

35
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,740
me how that can be done.
So

36
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:56,990
mostly as a political community that the
believers should.

37
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:02,130
Of course,
they are in that position today.

38
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,770
Right?
Right.

39
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,470
That did not give you the lessons
choice.

40
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,150
He's insane.
Or can have your brides are like,

41
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:15,930
his message was you guys are Washington
follow spots.

42
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,830
These are items you live in a time and
signals and I left the last message

43
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:26,250
conveyed to you
the light and enlightenment and come

44
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,930
with me.
No please.

45
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,230
[inaudible] records.
Lots of messages.

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,310
It's the fact that cooking apply of
course,

47
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,890
fortunately the other end of the mixture
attacker,

48
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:45,020
the records described
in Rosina,

49
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,420
yes he does that

50
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,320
walk the wall.

51
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:57,380
The numbers were [inaudible] and these
are people who come from of them.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,320
Then you see everywhere where people
access as law,

53
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:07,770
that is destination seniors live only
after you accept Islam.

54
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,800
As long as you refused to abide by
Islamic law or accept to be subdued by

55
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,780
Islam,
you are at war.

56
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,760
That's why they limit make this
distinction between the House of Islam

57
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,040
and the House of war.
Right.

58
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,480
And the House of war is everywhere where
there are infidels and it's the job of

59
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:31,030
the Muslims and the house of peace to
convert.

60
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,950
So it's a religion of peace in so far as
it's final utopian aim is the cessation

61
00:03:37,081 --> 00:03:39,510
of conflict,
but it's the cessation of conflict in

62
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:43,780
part as a consequence of of conquest.
Okay.

63
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:44,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

64
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,170
Well,
that was more or less how I understood

65
00:03:46,171 --> 00:03:48,390
it.
So when the claim is made that it's a

66
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:50,520
religion of peace,
then that isn't precisely,

67
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:53,400
it's,
it's a slight of hand in some sense.

68
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,650
With regards specifically to that
phrase.
