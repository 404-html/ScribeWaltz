1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,020
Is the pre cosmo Garnett chaos.

2
00:00:08,021 --> 00:00:08,860
This is from

3
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,740
William James,

4
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:12,880
who was a pragmatist,

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,910
lived on each coast at about
the end of the 18 hundreds.

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,010
He was one of the founders
of modern psychology.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,770
He liked to sniff nitric nitrous oxide,

8
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,940
which is a hallucinogen.

9
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:26,080
He was sort of like the world's first
major league hippie and he wrote sort of

10
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:29,950
hippie poetry as a consequence of
his nitrous oxide experimentation.

11
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:33,670
And here's part of what a he
derived from his experiences.

12
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,533
So,

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:34,990
um,

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,850
pure experience is the name which I
give to the original flux of life before

15
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:41,110
reflection is categorized,

16
00:00:41,111 --> 00:00:44,770
it only newborn babes and
persons in semi coma from sleep,

17
00:00:44,771 --> 00:00:45,161
drugs,

18
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:46,360
illnesses or blows.

19
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,500
It can have an experience pure in the
literal sense of awe that which is not yet

20
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:56,850
any definite what potential
potential cause you might think,

21
00:00:57,821 --> 00:00:59,050
well what's the world made of?

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,060
It's made out of actuality,

23
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:01,990
right?

24
00:01:01,990 --> 00:01:03,160
That's not how you act.

25
00:01:03,161 --> 00:01:06,760
You Act as if the world's made out of
potential and you interact with that

26
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:07,594
potential.

27
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:11,110
And what James is saying is that there
are times when you experience something

28
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:14,830
that's akin to relatively pure potential.

29
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,010
And then you might ask yourself
whether or not potential is real,

30
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,690
which is a really interesting question,

31
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:22,930
but I can say regardless of
how you answered that question,

32
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:27,250
you act as if it's real and you'll also
feel guilty if someone that you love

33
00:01:27,251 --> 00:01:28,150
comes up to you and says,

34
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,910
you're not living up to your potential.

35
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:31,630
It's like,

36
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:32,770
what the hell does that mean?

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,150
What does it mean?

38
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:37,540
It means you're not becoming
that which you could be.

39
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:38,471
Well,

40
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,304
what is that?

41
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,671
It's like,

42
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:39,881
you know,

43
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:40,810
we're materialists.

44
00:01:40,811 --> 00:01:42,040
How are we going to measure that?

45
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:42,910
You can't touch it.

46
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:43,750
You can't taste it.

47
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,650
You can't see it.

48
00:01:44,651 --> 00:01:45,790
You can't measure it.

49
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,780
Right?

50
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:47,050
But,

51
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:47,890
but nonetheless,

52
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:52,891
it's like the substance of being and
being his potential as well as actuality.

53
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,630
And we're grappling
always with the potential.

54
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,640
And so that's what James is talking about.

55
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:58,570
Pure potential.

56
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,750
I like to think of it as
latent information full
both of oneness and menace,

57
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,660
but in respects that don't
appear changing throughout yet.

58
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,370
So confusedly that it's phases.

59
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:13,630
Interpenetrate sounds like the Yin and
Yang symbol and no points either of

60
00:02:13,631 --> 00:02:16,420
distinction or of identity can be caught.

61
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,270
Here's his poem.

62
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,200
No verbiage can give it because
the verbiage is other incoherent,

63
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,540
coherent the same and it fades and
it's infinite and it's infinite.

64
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,170
Don't you see the difference?

65
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,570
Don't you see the identity constantly?

66
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,340
Opposites United the same.

67
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:38,290
Me telling you to write and not to right.

68
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,520
Extreme,

69
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,661
extreme,

70
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,740
extreme something.

71
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:42,940
And other than that thing,

72
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,850
intoxication and otherness
than intoxication.

73
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,740
Every attempted betterment.

74
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,070
Every attempted other men is a,

75
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:54,520
it fades and it fades forever
and forever as we move.
