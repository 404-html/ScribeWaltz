1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:07,571
Jake says,

2
00:00:07,571 --> 00:00:10,360
I've been incredibly inspired by you
love what you do and would like to

3
00:00:10,361 --> 00:00:12,070
enlighten people in a similar manner.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,560
Be careful what you wish for it is,

5
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:18,550
is it appropriate to aim to have as
much as an impact as you or more so?

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,763
Um,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,590
I think it's the idea is
formulated wrong in some sense.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,300
Yeah.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,133
I think,

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,033
I mean,

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,050
it's good to have people that

12
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:33,270
okay,

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,110
you admire,

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,973
let's say,

15
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:36,200
okay,

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,200
who can serve as models and I'm not
claiming that I'm necessarily in that

17
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:41,961
category,

18
00:00:41,961 --> 00:00:43,430
but it's good to have people like that.

19
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:48,431
But what you want to figure out to do
two D to do is how to manifest the ideal

20
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:51,020
within the confines of your own life,

21
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,381
right?

22
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:53,330
Because you're a
particular sort of person.

23
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:57,290
And so the way that you're
going to live your life best,

24
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:02,291
it's very unlikely that it
would be associated in any
important way with the way

25
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:06,110
that I've chosen to live my life unless
we have very similar temperaments,

26
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:07,040
which is possible.

27
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:07,874
But you know,

28
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,140
relatively unlikely

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,230
because the odds against that are,

30
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:12,890
you know,

31
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,910
extraordinarily high.

32
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,343
Um,

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,650
the odds of any two people having
the same temperament are very,

34
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:20,963
are very high.

35
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,960
So what you can do is aim to,

36
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:30,210
to Orient yourself towards a high good
that you can conceive up to discipline

37
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:32,160
yourself to tell the
truth and all of that.

38
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,980
And then what I would say is
that as your life unfolds,

39
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:37,680
you'll have the amount of
influence that you should have,

40
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,510
whatever that happens to be.

41
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,081
You know,

42
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,020
some people live pretty local lives.

43
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,700
Like my life for example,

44
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:47,190
is much more public than my wife's life.

45
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,810
But that doesn't mean that her
contribution is somehow lesser.

46
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:54,270
I mean she's been unbelievably
good with our kids.

47
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:58,470
My daughter was very ill and my wife was
extraordinarily good with her and was a

48
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:02,940
great mother and it's been a tremendous
help to me as a very honest person and a

49
00:02:02,941 --> 00:02:03,721
wise person.

50
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,770
And you know,

51
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,180
that all has an impact.

52
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:09,690
It's just not as obvious because while
the kids really love her and now she's

53
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:13,200
got grandkids and God only knows what
the consequence of that is going to be

54
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,690
across successive generations,

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,981
and you know,

56
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:18,990
she isn't interested in the public life.

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,780
I'm a journalist of hours to interviewer
quite recently about what the last

58
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:27,180
year's been liking her
preferences to not do that.

59
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,580
And that's fine.

60
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:33,580
Like she has her own destiny and
her own way of being in the world.

61
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:37,830
And there's nothing to say that it's
lesser in any sense of the word at all.
