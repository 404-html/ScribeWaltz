1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:08,480
Oh,
Rogers was a phenomenologist.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,210
It's useful to know what that means
because you hear people use words all

3
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,460
the time,
like why?

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,570
Maybe not all the time,
probably not usually like phenomenology

5
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:24,410
or existentialism,
postmodernism and structuralism and all

6
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,730
those things.
It's not.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's frequently the case that
it isn't that easy to figure out what

8
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:33,770
the dark cloud.
That's because they don't know.

9
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,560
No,
because it's actually quite difficult to

10
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,060
make a reasonable conceptual distinction
between all those different modes of

11
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:46,061
thinking and phenomenology came out of
philosophy and its earliest advocate was

12
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:54,560
a guy named Edmund and its most famous
proponent was probably heidegger,

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,140
heidegger garden,
lots of trouble because he ended up

14
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:03,170
supporting the Nazis at least to some
degree,

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,960
so that's pretty good reason to get in
trouble.

16
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:08,020
All things considered,
you know,

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,030
although you know most people in
Germany,

18
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,490
so not that's any excuse obviously.

19
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,860
It's hard to exactly get your head
around what the phenomenologists are

20
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:27,770
talking about.
I was reading about David chalmers this

21
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,180
morning.
I don't know how many of you know about

22
00:01:29,181 --> 00:01:33,330
David Chalmers,
but he's a philosopher who started the

23
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,650
Tucson conventions on consciousness and
chalmers.

24
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,890
I'm not sure what I think about
gentleman.

25
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:47,090
He's very charismatic.
He's got a way with words and setting up

26
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:50,900
those convention center has done a great
deal for the study of consciousness.

27
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,360
But um,
sometimes I think that what he pointed

28
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:59,120
out to scientists was obvious.
It was funny,

29
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:01,540
you know,
when they're,

30
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,090
when psychology was primarily
behaviorist,

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,460
which was back in the fifties,
it came as a big shock to psychologists

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,300
when certain psychologist started to
talk about cognition.

33
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:14,300
They called that the cognitive
revolution and you know,

34
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,180
I think it was obvious to everybody,
but psychologists at that point that

35
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:22,210
people fought and I think it was perhaps
the same situation with philosophers and

36
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:27,410
it's pretty obvious to everybody that
consciousness was a tough nut to crack.

37
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:32,411
But the philosophers kind of ignored it
and chalmers brought it back into the

38
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:37,100
academic mainstream.
The phenomenologists are really all

39
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:40,610
about consciousness.
They just accepted as a fact.

40
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:45,320
I'm rather than trying to deny its
existence because it can't be easily

41
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,480
reduced to its material.
Substrate.

42
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,960
Chalmers big point was that he couldn't
understand why evolution couldn't have

43
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:58,340
produced creatures exactly like us who
have no conscious awareness that you

44
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:03,341
called them,
fundamentally said that the existence of

45
00:03:03,881 --> 00:03:05,740
consciousness is an enduring mystery.

46
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,800
Well,
I think that's true.

47
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,670
I don't.
I'm not sure that we've got anywhere in

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,240
terms of figuring out exactly what
consciousness is,

49
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:17,440
despite a lot of time and effort put
into it and despite a lot of tremendous

50
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,860
amount of work done on the brain,
but anyways,

51
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:23,980
the phenomenologists are.
They just took it as a fact.

52
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:27,760
Now,
heidegger believe that western

53
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:31,870
philosophy had lost its way really since
the time of the Greeks,

54
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:35,150
and he thought that phenomenology or the
philosophies,

55
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,170
primary field of focus should be being
itself,

56
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,240
not reality,
but being.

57
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,110
And it's not easy to understand what he
meant by being,

58
00:03:47,111 --> 00:03:50,920
but
the phenomenal field.

59
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,140
The idea of a phenomenal field somewhat
captures it.

60
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:55,850
So
for Heidegger,

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,830
reality was what you experienced.
So he sort of,

62
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:04,720
you sort of tip the tables instead of
presuming an objective world and then

63
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:07,090
deriving the subjective from it.
He presumed that

64
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,160
the entirety of your experiences were
real

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,800
and that included your emotions and your
felt motivational states and your dreams

66
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:24,580
and your fantasies and even your
delusions.

67
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,610
Now,
that doesn't mean that people like

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,070
heidegger thought that all the elements
of lived reality belonged in the same

69
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:37,350
category,
so if you thought that

70
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:42,560
dreams and the reality that you've
shared with other people were

71
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:46,800
indistinguishable from one another,
you'd be just as pathological to a

72
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,690
phenomenologist as to anyone else,

73
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,780
but they were trying to get back to the
central mystery of life,

74
00:04:56,781 --> 00:05:01,670
which is that
there is something rather than nothing.

75
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,010
I suppose the neck.
We experienced it

76
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,360
and that's the place where Roger Starts.
One of the presumptions of,

77
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:19,810
of the Rogerian is,
is that in order to help someone,

78
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,160
you have to put yourself in their shoes
fundamentally.

79
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,830
So you have to try to see the world from
their perspective,

80
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,070
and that means adopting
the viewpoint.

81
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,360
It means adopting the reality that
manifests itself to them

82
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,340
so that you can develop an empathic
understanding,

83
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:46,000
body focused understanding of the person
that you're talking to you.
