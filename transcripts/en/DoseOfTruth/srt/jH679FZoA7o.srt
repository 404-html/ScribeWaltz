1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,790
Meditation.

2
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:05,790
Spirituality is the key
to unlock human potential.

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,880
It's a perfect example of
how inequality emerges.

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,500
And we've seen this with test as well.

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:13,771
You know,

6
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:17,520
I've always wanted to build
my own software company
saying pretty much they cost

7
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,354
autonomous.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:23,040
It's just getting over that last little
bit of do we really have the regulatory

9
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:27,600
and the social infrastructure to
support switching vehicles to autonomy.

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,390
Everybody's equal to begin with.

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,740
Everybody basically plays a random game
cause monopolies basically around them

12
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,583
games.

13
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:42,700
We're instead of having
huge amounts of corn,

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,860
soybean ground to feed all these farm
animals and massive slaughter plants then

15
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:51,690
and forums you then we'll just have
basically your own localized queen meat

16
00:00:51,691 --> 00:00:52,524
production.

17
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,260
The court is written by the programmers
and the artists create the visuals.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:01,860
So what does a designer do
have and designers at all?

19
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:06,270
They started to mentally think of the
player and to make that experience be as

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,740
enriching as possible.

21
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,990
So it's a random game.

22
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,350
So what happens when everyone starts
equal and you play a random game?

23
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,300
One person ends up with everything.

24
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,570
Everyone else stacks up at zero where
they sold the company just before I turned

25
00:01:18,571 --> 00:01:19,404
24.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,060
Oh yes.

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,040
That is what I'm talking about.

28
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:25,160
Well,

29
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,940
what do you ask?

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:26,271
Uh,

31
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:26,691
you know,

32
00:01:26,691 --> 00:01:27,051
children,

33
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:28,400
what they want to be when they grow up.

34
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:30,380
Mine was like an inventor or like,

35
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:30,711
you know,

36
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:31,860
I want to know when to stop wearing them.
