1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,290
Metaphysical store

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,953
reality.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,920
How it seems to have happened to us
is that over the last five years,

4
00:00:19,940 --> 00:00:21,020
something like that,

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,450
we invented a new way of looking
at the world as a materialist

6
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,020
and that is exactly the view of story.

7
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,430
It's different than that.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It's a new technology and the problem
seems to be that the emergence of that

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:39,710
which has made us wealthy,

10
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,510
technologically powerful.

11
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,800
There's a,

12
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:44,230
he said,

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:44,900
boy,

14
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,200
fundamental way metaphysics
of our basic story

15
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:56,170
need to have this idea in the lady 1900
leaving that the conflict between the

16
00:00:59,091 --> 00:01:01,860
scientists worldview and
the religious world view,

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,070
a designated religious will view

18
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:05,990
that.

19
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,160
He described that as the debit card
and he believed that because that had

20
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:10,491
happened,

21
00:01:10,491 --> 00:01:14,450
we had lost our moorings or ethical
moorings and that our society is going to

22
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:17,420
wash away for that between
nihilism and totalitarianism.

23
00:01:17,421 --> 00:01:20,030
That's a con and neat.

24
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,290
You died quite young,

25
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,770
believed that in order to recover
from that and find our marriage,

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,020
that we were going to have to replace
the gods that we once believed in,

27
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:30,441
let's say,

28
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:31,060
or your God,

29
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,250
but we want to plead it with
some notion of our own divinity.

30
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,340
Take responsibility for
creating our own doubters.

31
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,470
That was his idea is superman,

32
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,160
the Overman now yo was
very interested in niches,

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:47,540
diagnosis because he knew that we lived
inside stories and the stories had

34
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,740
certain accidents of value and then our
faith and our fundamental story had been

35
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:53,930
shaken not least by our scientific,

36
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,430
the rising of scientific knowledge,

37
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:59,780
and he was interested in trying to figure
out how people might find themselves

38
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:02,510
reoriented so they
didn't turn to nihilism,

39
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:02,901
let's say,

40
00:02:02,901 --> 00:02:03,980
or two to telecare.

41
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:07,910
Ian Utopian world news bucket
put themselves back in the story,

42
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,970
but he didn't buy the niches prognosis
for cure because yoga was influenced by

43
00:02:14,721 --> 00:02:16,100
Freud and Freud.

44
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,510
You out that

45
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,170
people didn't create their own values.

46
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,300
You can't do that because you have to
nature you and the nature manifests itself

47
00:02:26,301 --> 00:02:29,330
within you regardless of your choice.

48
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:34,930
There's things that you can't
get yourself to do and know that,

49
00:02:35,241 --> 00:02:35,481
right?

50
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,730
Because it was a matter of
creating your own values.

51
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:38,211
You just think,

52
00:02:38,211 --> 00:02:41,570
well you can wake up one morning and
you could just tell yourself what to do.

53
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,690
Like go to the gym three times a week
so that you know you're in good shape.

54
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,940
Stop eating junk or quit drinking and
bang just cause you've got control over

55
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:55,061
yourself and well obviously that's just
not the case and that's because there

56
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:58,970
are all sorts of things operating inside
of you that have their own autonomy.

57
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,970
They're all own nature that you Glen,

58
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,530
he will have to contend with it.

59
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,070
So that's why you went back
inside the human psyche,

60
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,030
so to speak,

61
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,280
to look at the fantasies that
we spontaneously generated,

62
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,860
disagree with of the world,

63
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,830
to see if he can find out
what the pattern constituted.

64
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,533
Perfect.

65
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,760
Now I'm going to tell
you this little story.

66
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,650
So this is the idea.

67
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,263
This is partly,

68
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:28,420
he's stories are parked of your ride
from thousands or even can have tens of

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:34,340
thousands of years of watching how people
act it successfully and unsuccessfully

70
00:03:34,341 --> 00:03:36,830
in the world and extracting patterns.

71
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:40,880
So the patterns get extracted,

72
00:03:40,881 --> 00:03:45,230
they get more abstract and they
get less real in some sense,

73
00:03:45,231 --> 00:03:46,850
but they get more broadly applicable.

74
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,190
So let me tell you first story.

75
00:03:49,191 --> 00:03:52,520
So this is from the opening
chapter opening parts of geography.

76
00:03:52,521 --> 00:03:54,040
So there's an idea in genesis,

77
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:59,480
this is roughly how the idea is laid out
and it's an idea that is expressed in

78
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:01,490
consultancy all over the
world in different forms.

79
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,480
So the first time you had is that
there's sorts of two domains,

80
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:05,720
major fee,

81
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,610
there's potential chaos and
there's order having more.

82
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,151
Okay.

83
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:11,984
Now that's,

84
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:12,950
that's the,

85
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,810
that's the structure of reality.

86
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,100
It's like the Dow was getting yet that's
the same thing that you're hemispheres

87
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:23,180
are matching order and chaos and
that's what the world's made up.

88
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:23,920
Okay.

89
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,041
I'm,

90
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,270
there's a third factor.

91
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:28,680
And the third factor is the thing
that immediately if we noticed too,

92
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,230
and that would be,

93
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,070
that's equivalent.

94
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,771
I think one,

95
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:35,430
one are people mean when they talk about
consciousness because that seems to be

96
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,250
what consciousness,

97
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,083
dubs,

98
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,800
consciousness establishes
order your conscious,

99
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,880
you make decisions,

100
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,950
you make it a world.

101
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,080
But while you're being
conscious in attempting,

102
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:48,220
you're attending what you don't yet
understand and haven't asked her.

103
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,790
So you face with something going
and potential and you transform that

104
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,880
effortfully in carefully
to what you understand and
what you couldn't have that.

105
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,510
So that's what your consciousness does.

106
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,540
And the Genesis you see that portrayed,

107
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,330
you sees death portrayed as something
that's defined because if dividing spirit,

108
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:09,340
so that's basically Gallois
y'all was y'all was,

109
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,101
what would you call it?

110
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,420
The process by which you all,

111
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:13,910
what generates the world
is being turned her.

112
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,870
This is the Christianization of that
story is the term of the logos and the

113
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:20,570
logos is the capacity for attentive,

114
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,530
communicative,

115
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,330
truthful speech.

116
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,390
And so there's a deep idea at
the beginning of genesis step

117
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,340
whenever defining consciousness
is that which uses truthful,

118
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:37,341
communicated speech to encounter the
chaos of the unknown and to transform it

119
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:38,760
and to have that border.

120
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,110
And so that's a technical description
of the structure of reality and it's an

121
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:47,850
ethical injunction as well because
what happens in the opening chapters of

122
00:05:47,851 --> 00:05:52,530
genesis is that God use the logos to
create the world out of that preexisted

123
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:54,210
chaos and he,

124
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,370
and when he does that in stages,

125
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,100
he pronounces it good.

126
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,170
And so there's an idea
there [inaudible] idea

127
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,640
because one of the things
he might ask yourself,

128
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,990
and this is one of the things that the
mass murderers asking themselves all the

129
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:16,991
time is being justified or is it something
against which you should strive and

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,533
destroy?

131
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,500
And that's a very good
question because life is very,

132
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:27,680
very difficult and it's full of suffering
and it's full of new trail and it's

133
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:32,540
full of malevolence and it's
not an unreasonable proposition.

134
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,730
He questioned whether it would be
better if you're not thinking of all the

135
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:40,740
assistants and the people who take the
steps to doing the terrible things that

136
00:06:40,851 --> 00:06:41,900
they ended up doing.

137
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,790
Answer that question in the affirmative.

138
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,190
They believe that life itself
is so unbearable in its
fundamental structure that

139
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:50,600
normally should it not exist,

140
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:55,160
but that the right response to it is to
take revenge against the fact that its

141
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:56,210
existence.

142
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:01,760
And that's part of the answer to how you
get to where you have to go if you're

143
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:04,760
going to render down and drive
it for camp blocks on the city,

144
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,110
on city sidewalks,

145
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,550
it's a deep,

146
00:07:07,551 --> 00:07:09,620
deep bro and it's justifiable,

147
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,990
but the hypothesis it's
laid out in genesis,

148
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:14,860
which is an amazing hypothesis,

149
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:19,870
is that despite the fragility of the
world and the vulnerability of the world,

150
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,100
and it's called cleverly,

151
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,670
let's say towards malevolence,

152
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:27,710
if you encountered with consciousness
and counters the potential that the world

153
00:07:27,711 --> 00:07:30,890
is extracted from and
he does that truthfully,

154
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:34,040
then what is created as
a consequence is good.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,310
And I would say that's the host.

156
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:40,130
That's the most fundamental act of
faith and I think that's the fundamental

157
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:41,680
ethical question that lives,

158
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:46,160
it's that underlies the entire corpus
of the stories in which our culture and

159
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:48,350
all of them are paid.

160
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,453
The question is,

161
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,570
are you willing to act out the
proposition that being is good?

162
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,190
If you abide by the truth,

163
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,940
and what's interesting is that
it's an existential question,

164
00:07:58,941 --> 00:07:59,500
Nate.

165
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,800
It's not a question that you can that can
be answered by fact because no one can

166
00:08:03,801 --> 00:08:05,960
prove it to you because they can't.

167
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,650
They can't tell you what your life is
going to be like if you do that because

168
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,690
you're the only person that can find out.

169
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:15,710
And the only way you can find out is
essentially by risking everything you can

170
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:16,101
decide,

171
00:08:16,101 --> 00:08:16,221
well,

172
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:21,221
I'm going to separately proposition
that truthful being is that being that

173
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:22,820
producers what's good,

174
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,590
and then I'm going to abide by that.

175
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,260
But then the springs
things will how to you,

176
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,330
because it isn't necessarily the case
that if you attempt to abide by your own

177
00:08:31,491 --> 00:08:32,324
truth,

178
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:37,130
that everything that happens to every
second is going to be demonstrative proof

179
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,690
that that's the right pathway.

180
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,850
You're gonna get yourself
in all sorts of trouble.

181
00:08:40,851 --> 00:08:41,750
If you do that,

182
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,310
you know that perfectly well because
there's uncomfortable conversations that

183
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,210
you should probably
have heard a few people.

184
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,550
And if you have those
uncomfortable conversations,

185
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:50,330
it's not like there's big,

186
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:52,460
it's just going to be roses and sunshine.

187
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:53,810
While you're having the discussion.

188
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,280
Quite the contrary.

189
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:58,040
The truth is a very disruptive force,

190
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,250
especially people that are
living inside an illusion.

191
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,070
And so it is,

192
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,010
it's a statement.

193
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:04,251
It's an,

194
00:09:04,251 --> 00:09:06,950
if it's a metaphysical statement of faith.
