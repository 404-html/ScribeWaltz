1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,360
I was starting to read the
psychoanalysts and I really got,

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,580
I really got interested
in what they had to say,

3
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:12,780
um,

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,830
partly from reading Freud because I was
really interested in his analysis of

5
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,480
family dynamics and have dreams,

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,640
but more particularly from reading young.

7
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:22,630
And one of the things I learned from Yoga,

8
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,280
which really has never ceased to shock me,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,563
was his,

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:27,991
see,

11
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:29,310
he basically made a point.

12
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:32,970
And the point was that you're
not master in your own house,

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,920
that there are forces that are,

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,340
are operating on you at an
unconscious level that determine,

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,671
for example,

16
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:43,230
the direction of your attention.

17
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,731
So for example,

18
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:48,030
you know how sometimes you'll read
something in to really grip you and then

19
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:49,380
you'll read something else and you like,

20
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:50,760
you can't even concentrate on it.

21
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,803
And you might say,

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:51,991
well,

23
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:55,110
I need to concentrate
on this boring thing,

24
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:55,591
you know,

25
00:00:55,591 --> 00:00:59,360
cause an exam depends on it or a promotion
and there's just no damn way you're

26
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,760
reading it and your attention
flits all over the place and,

27
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,840
and you know you're
undisciplined and all that,

28
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:04,560
but,

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,290
but then you have this other thing and
it just grips you like this and you

30
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:07,501
think,

31
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:07,741
okay,

32
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:08,574
well what,

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,810
what's doing that?

34
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,090
It's not your will.

35
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,240
Because your will would be the thing
that would allow you to concentrate on

36
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,400
whatever you chose to concentrate on.

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,450
It's something underneath your will
that's actually directing your attention.

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,561
And you could say,

39
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,430
well it's random,

40
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:24,690
but of course it's not.

41
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,990
It's maybe random if you have a
serious case of schizophrenia.

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,730
But,

43
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:28,900
and,

44
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,250
and I think in some sense that's
actually the definition of schizophrenia.

45
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,540
But it's not random.

46
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,160
If you're a functioning human being,

47
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,480
the thing that grips your attention and
directs it to one place or another is

48
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:41,670
something that's what's a deep instinct.

49
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:44,250
It's a manifestation of
what union called the self,

50
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:45,810
which is a very interesting idea.

51
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:47,220
So human thought,

52
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,480
it's such a cool idea.

53
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,430
He thought that the mechanism that
directed your attention in the present was

54
00:01:53,431 --> 00:01:57,360
your future self attempting to
manifest itself in the present world.

55
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,351
So you might say,

56
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:03,351
well you have a potential and that
potential is what you could be in time.

57
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:06,420
And in order for that
potential to manifest itself,

58
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:08,550
it has to be palpable in the present.

59
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,080
And the way that instinct for further
develop manifests itself in the present is

60
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:16,590
by directing your attention towards
things that are likely to increase your

61
00:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,930
competence and further
your growth right now.

62
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,780
And that's just an unbelievable idea.

63
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:22,021
You know,

64
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:22,854
it's like your,

65
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:26,670
your potential better self
beckoning to you in the present.

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,871
Amazing.

67
00:02:27,871 --> 00:02:30,690
And I really can't think of a
better explanation for it than that.

68
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:30,990
That's a,

69
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,850
that's a really good explanation but a
very frightening one because it means in

70
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:37,020
some sense that you're,

71
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,760
that something as fundamental as your
attention is more or less controlled by

72
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:45,450
processes that are so deep that you don't
have a tremendous amount of voluntary

73
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,284
control over them.

74
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,780
Like you can interact with
the forces to some degree,

75
00:02:48,781 --> 00:02:49,411
but you know,

76
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:53,250
you're not one of those per creatures
that can just tell yourself what to do.

77
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,020
Life would be really easy if
that's what it was like right here.

78
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,710
It's time to go to the
gym three days a week,

79
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,471
two hours a day.

80
00:02:59,471 --> 00:02:59,890
It's like,

81
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:00,131
you know,

82
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:03,700
you're superman in two years so you
can eat properly and you know you're,

83
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,520
you're not going to drink too much and
you're not going to take cocaine and all

84
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:07,091
of these things.

85
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:08,680
He just tell yourself that and bang,

86
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,514
you quit.

87
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,680
And it's kind of weird
that it isn't that way,

88
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,410
but it's really seriously not that way.
