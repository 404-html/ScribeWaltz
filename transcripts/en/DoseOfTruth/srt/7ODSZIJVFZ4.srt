1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,500
I realized that a belief system was
actually a set of moral guidelines

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,840
and moral guidelines are guidelines
about how you should behave.

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,030
Also,
how you should perceive,

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,570
and the reason that a moral guideline is
necessary for you to perceive is that

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,320
you can't look at anything without a
hierarchy of value,

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,140
right?
Think about it like how many things in

7
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:29,550
this room could you look out?
There's an in innumerable things in this

8
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:32,310
room to look at.
There's just all this squares,

9
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:36,000
the little tiny squares in this fabric.
You could look at those things for till

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,980
the end of time,
one at a time,

11
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:40,290
but you don't do that.
In fact,

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:44,610
if I took most of you out of this room,
there's a very low probability that

13
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:46,500
you'll be,
you'd be able to tell me what color the

14
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,650
walls were,
or even if those things were on the

15
00:00:49,651 --> 00:00:50,484
walls.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,150
And the reason for that is that who
cares?

17
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,680
As long as the walls don't move,
colors irrelevant,

18
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,480
and there's no reason for you to
remember it.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,440
It has no emotional significance.
It has no value.

20
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:07,680
And so what you do instead is,
well,

21
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,680
this is what you're doing.
So why are you here?

22
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,700
Do I don't mean in the broad
metaphysical sense?

23
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:17,160
I mean specifically,
why are you here right now?

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,631
And I would say,
well,

25
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:23,240
you're a students obviously and you're
trying to get a degree and you know,

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,010
you believe that that will have some
functional utility.

27
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,060
Maybe you'll be a little wiser and a
little more literate and a little and be

28
00:01:30,061 --> 00:01:32,550
able to think a little better and be
able to write a little better.

29
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,010
And so you'll actually be more
functional in the world.

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,040
That would be good.
You know,

31
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:38,970
and,
and maybe you're interested in,

32
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,960
but anyways,
it's,

33
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:45,830
you're in this particular lecture so
that you can take this particular class

34
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:50,550
so that you can get a particular kind of
degree so that you can launch your life.

35
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,030
And then in your life you're probably
going to meet someone that you have a

36
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:57,090
longterm relationship with and you're
going to have children and you're going

37
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:00,180
to partake in the society.
And that's why you're here.

38
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,320
All of those reasons simultaneously is
why you're here.

39
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,890
And so then that helps you decide what
to look at.

40
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,760
And so what you look at is at the
moment,

41
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,510
or listen to is me,
because in principle,

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,480
I'm the gateway to that set of
accomplishments at this moment.

43
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:27,260
And so you focus on me and that's
because you value that.

44
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,710
And so what that means.
