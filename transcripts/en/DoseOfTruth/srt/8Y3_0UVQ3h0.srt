1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,260
Well,
it all started in 2007 when I was lucky

2
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,200
enough to have a full on medical level
of depression.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,480
I'm really,
really bad.

4
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:17,550
I talk about it in some sort of detail
in the,

5
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,410
uh,
in the book I realized it's actually a

6
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:22,320
level of which I don't even,
I realized I wrote about it with details

7
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,490
of my youth.
My wife doesn't know.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,180
There's a weird privacy thing that
sometimes happens when you're talking to

9
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:31,470
know dictating into a computer that you
kind of like this just between me and

10
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:33,870
the computer and now I realize it's
probably the most public thing,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,370
but the thing that saved me,
the thing that ultimately helped me deal

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,190
with my depression in general was
cognitive behavioral therapy.

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,360
I'm,
in a sense,

14
00:00:42,361 --> 00:00:47,361
it's sort of like applied stoicism.
You just look at your own thoughts back

15
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:51,370
to the really exaggerate once you've
labeled them as cognitive distortions

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960
that these include things like
generalization,

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,310
catastrophizing,
binary thinking,

18
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:58,450
thinking,
everything has to be there,

19
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,380
all good or all bad.

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,060
I'm actually particularly guilty of
these.

21
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,400
Yeah.
And Amazingly,

22
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:06,780
if you just actually learn what these
distortions are and practice every day

23
00:01:06,781 --> 00:01:10,190
to sort of talk back to sort of the more
anxious or depressed voices in your own

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,450
head,
it's an incredibly effective treatment

25
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:14,070
for depression,
anxiety and it changed,

26
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,220
absolutely changed my life.
Meanwhile,

27
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:18,860
as this is changing my life,
I still work.

28
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:23,060
I'm still the president of fire,
which means I defend free speech and due

29
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:26,110
process and academic freedom on campus.
And um,

30
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,850
and while I was learning all of these
intellectual habits,

31
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:32,590
all these ways to sort of talk yourself
down,

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,810
I was looking around at what
administrators were doing and saying to

33
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:37,441
myself,
wow,

34
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,750
it's actually kind of like the
administrators are saying,

35
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:42,600
oh by the way,
do engage in cognitive distortions,

36
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,520
do engage in binary thinking,
do overgeneralize and most of all,

37
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,480
catastrophizing all the time.

38
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,600
And I remember thinking somebody will be
affected as well.

39
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:53,880
Thank goodness the students don't seem
to really be buying it.

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,150
And that's what changed in 2013,
2014 prior to 2013,

41
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,980
2014 since I started in 2001,
the worst constituency for free speech

42
00:02:03,981 --> 00:02:07,190
on campus was actually administrators
best,

43
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:10,850
most reliable fans of free speech you
could run into on campus were generally

44
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,980
the students themselves.
And then sometime around 2013,

45
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:16,000
2014,
we saw a,

46
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,730
suddenly there were demanding everything
from trigger warnings to microaggression

47
00:02:19,731 --> 00:02:22,850
policies to December for even people.
But,

48
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:25,070
but both on the left and the right on
the spectrum.

49
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,440
And it seemed like we said it seemed to
happen almost overnight and this and

50
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:36,071
when I went to talk to John About it,
now we've become friends through mutual

51
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:38,400
friends.
And I said it's almost.

52
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,240
I talked about my whole theory that
we're teaching a generation the habits

53
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:45,180
of anxious and depressed people from
cognitive behavioral therapy.

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,750
John got really excited about the idea,
um,

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,020
and asked if I wanted to write about it.
And I was already a fan of John's work.

56
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,160
So I was like,
absolutely.

57
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,690
Yeah.
So I thought that his,

58
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,490
his insight into what had changed was
absolutely brilliant.

59
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:01,340
I had just begun to notice this in my
own teaching.

60
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,150
I'd been teaching since 1995 at
University of Virginia originally,

61
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:08,900
and it was seemingly overnight,
right around 2014.

62
00:03:08,901 --> 00:03:10,690
These new ideas,
students,

63
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:12,360
of course,
political,

64
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:14,230
they protest,
they object to things,

65
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,970
but what was new grid?
Put his finger on it.

66
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,100
What was new was the idea that these
words are going to harm me,

67
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,150
not just defend me,
not just be unjust.

68
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,950
Pardon me?
We have to protect.

69
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:26,350
It was this idea that students are
fragile and need protection and the

70
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,980
protection should come from
administrators,

71
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:31,500
from adults.
That's what was new and disturbing.

72
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,490
Yeah.
Will you guys talk in the book about

73
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:34,660
Concept Creep?

74
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:35,963
Hmm.

75
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:39,900
The overgeneralization of the idea of
trauma.

76
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,550
You know,
one of the things that's really struck

77
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:46,690
me as interesting about the safe space
movement and the microaggression

78
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,540
policies and all of that is that it does
run so contrary to what every clinician

79
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,390
worth his or her salt,
those about treating anxiety or

80
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:55,224
depression

81
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,430
and
so,

82
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:03,410
so that's kind of a remarkable.
A phenomenon in itself is that what we

83
00:04:03,411 --> 00:04:06,650
know clinically has been absolutely
inverted by people who are

84
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:10,600
hypothetically agitating on the part of
students' mental health and it's not as

85
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:15,601
if the mental health community has stood
up on moss and denounced this.

86
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,330
So.
And I also don't.

87
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,050
I don't understand that.
I also don't understand how we got here.

88
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:26,700
You guys talk in the book a little bit
about your little bit of.

89
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,860
You hypothesize a little bit about the
internet generation.

90
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:32,380
Right?
And those were the kids born after 1995.

91
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,880
You don't put the finger on the
millennials but.

92
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:40,180
But let's talk a little bit about why
you think things changed in 2013.

93
00:04:40,181 --> 00:04:41,380
In 2014.

94
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Let me just first say your point about
these new ideas are not clinically

95
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,860
supported.
Something that we suggest in the book.

96
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:54,520
We don't know.
We don't know if this is going on.

97
00:04:55,170 --> 00:05:00,170
To what extent is this a sincere desire
for protection and a sincere belief that

98
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:05,391
students are fragile and to what extent
is it the pursuing of a political agenda

99
00:05:05,601 --> 00:05:05,921
and,
and,

100
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,320
and making political points and using
mental health as a cover?

101
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,060
I think both are operative and,
and so,

102
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,790
and it may depend on the context.

103
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,290
Why do you think the first one is
operative?

104
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,390
Because this runs so contrary to
everything that's known about the actual

105
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:28,120
protection of mental health.
I'm very skeptical about attributing a

106
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,130
positive motivation to it.
Like it seems to me that it's

107
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:33,020
fundamentally driven by resentment.

108
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,740
Well,
it's so,

109
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,700
uh,
so you're absolutely right that the

110
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:40,270
psychological community does not support
this,

111
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:43,750
but yet has not stood up very vocally to
condemn it.

112
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,350
So we are hopeful that psychologist and
psychiatrist,

113
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,830
everyone we spoke to agreed that
wrongly,

114
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,870
that's exactly the worst thing to do for
someone who suffers from ptsd,

115
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:59,600
is to sweep their daily life of
reminders,

116
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,110
thereby denying them the chance to,
to,

117
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,370
to,
to the situation,

118
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,630
to decondition the,
uh,

119
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,740
the power of these triggers in the real
world.

120
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,060
It's worse in some sense because one of
the things you do when you expose people

121
00:06:16,531 --> 00:06:21,030
who have anxiety disorders to the things
they're anxious about is not make them

122
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:23,400
less anxious but make them more
courageous.

123
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,420
Yeah.
Right.

124
00:06:24,421 --> 00:06:28,470
And that's why generalizes because the
psychoanalysts thought that exposure

125
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:30,810
would just mean the fears would pop up
somewhere else,

126
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,530
but they don't and it's because people
learn that there's more to them than

127
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:36,840
they thought,
and then when you protect them,

128
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:39,840
not only do not expose them,
which is a big problem,

129
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,770
but you also teach them to generalize
the idea of their weakness,

130
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,160
which is a really terrible thing to do
to people.

131
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,620
So you couldn't invent a more
counterproductive mental health

132
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:52,230
movement.
And instituted on campus is if you set

133
00:06:52,231 --> 00:06:53,160
out to design it.

134
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,110
That's something that we always try to
emphasize and so interesting for us to

135
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:02,740
look at was the one thing,
because you know the third anti free

136
00:07:02,741 --> 00:07:06,110
speech movement is coming from students
in the relatively recent past,

137
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,990
so late eighties and early nineties for
example.

138
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,190
But the thing that was so striking was
that they were medicalizing all,

139
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,970
all of these claims,
of course,

140
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,510
they're sitting there going like,
that doesn't sound right.

141
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:18,280
And I talked to John and he was like,
that doesn't sound right.

142
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:19,870
And we interviewed for the original
article,

143
00:07:19,871 --> 00:07:22,800
maybe seven different,
the clinical psychologists,

144
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:23,950
cbt experts,
uh,

145
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,940
you know,
for example.

146
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,600
And the thing I keep on trying keep on
explaining it as it's,

147
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,340
as a fraternity of what could be a minor
version into something more like a

148
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:35,740
phobia because we're giving it so much
more power.

149
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:39,100
And the worst thing of all that we're
doing so much of our campuses,

150
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:43,120
we're turning it into a Schema.
We're turning the idea that I've broken

151
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,370
into,
um,

152
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,110
into.
It's a permanent sort of self

153
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,300
definition.
So that's why I do think that there's

154
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,370
sort of a mixed motive thing going on
here.

155
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,730
I think that we have a self fulfilling
prophecy going on to some degree because

156
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:57,640
I do think that some of this kind of
hopeless ideology,

157
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,960
he's actually genuinely Harvard students
actually making them more anxious and

158
00:08:01,961 --> 00:08:02,380
depressed.
