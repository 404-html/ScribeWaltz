1
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,080
You're supposed to read this week was
gray marble of the limbic system and Basal

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,273
Ganglia.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:18,690
It's a hard paper,

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,510
but it's easy compared
to the options paper,

5
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:22,440
which was Swanson.

6
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:24,300
And I had everybody read that last year,

7
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:25,160
but you know,

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:28,110
people were basically having convulsions.

9
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,900
And so I decided that it
wasn't really fair to get,

10
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:31,411
you'd read it.

11
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:32,011
However,

12
00:00:32,011 --> 00:00:34,200
I would very much
recommend that you read it.

13
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,710
And because it's a bloody
brilliant paper and the old,

14
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,240
you'll learn so much from
it that it will be worth,

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,870
especially if you're interested in the
scientific element of psychology at

16
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:43,381
Swanson.

17
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:45,390
He's a smart guy and that's a great paper.

18
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,060
And one of the things I
really liked about it,

19
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,070
and this is what I'm going
to an end about grades,

20
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:50,904
papers as well.

21
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,980
They're there,

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,300
they're there.

23
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:58,470
You're describing brain physiology and
the relationship between that physiology

24
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:03,360
and behavior in a way that's sufficiently
sophisticated so that I actually think

25
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:04,920
it's psychologically revealing.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:05,640
It's,

27
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,091
it's so,

28
00:01:06,091 --> 00:01:06,241
it's,

29
00:01:06,241 --> 00:01:08,280
it's useful and important
to know these things.

30
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,330
And I think what's happening,

31
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,231
you know,

32
00:01:10,231 --> 00:01:13,170
I've been thinking more and more that
that hierarchy that I'm showing you guys

33
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:14,004
over and over,

34
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,040
I really think that that's
basically a map of the unconscious.

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,930
It's something like that and it's
not that hierarchy I showed you isn't

36
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,650
obviously a fully worked out
representation of the unconscious,

37
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,480
but it's,

38
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,930
it's not a bad schemata.

39
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:29,730
And I think what it's missing is that,

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:30,991
you know,

41
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,440
the at near the bottom where
you have the actual actions,

42
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,660
those actions are actually sequenced
into what you might call a motor melodies

43
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,970
that have a perceptual
frame associated with them.

44
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,680
And then those are nested inside
fundamental motivational systems.

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,940
And Swanson's paper does a
lovely job of detailing the,

46
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,910
the physiological substrate for that,

47
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,451
you know?

48
00:01:54,451 --> 00:01:58,230
So basically what he shows is that
the nervous system is built up of

49
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:03,231
hierarchical modules that start in the
body that basically start with spinal

50
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:05,250
reflexes.

51
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,173
You know,

52
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,270
sort of quick and dirty spinal
reflexes that cause your,

53
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:09,691
your,

54
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:11,910
your people think of their
brain is in their head.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,630
It's like,

56
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,463
no,

57
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,140
there's a big part of
your brain in your head,

58
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,540
but a huge part of it's
distributed through your body.

59
00:02:18,541 --> 00:02:20,030
So I re I re,

60
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,990
I remember reading and
I hope this is correct,

61
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:24,450
that there are more neurons in
your autonomic nervous system,

62
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:27,930
then there are in your central nervous
system and the autonomic nervous system

63
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:30,690
is distributed throughout the body and
it's the part of the nervous system that

64
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:31,920
governs all the things.

65
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:33,360
You're too stupid to take care of,

66
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,660
like how your liver works and how your
heart should stay beating and how you

67
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:38,080
digest food and you know,

68
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,390
complicated things that consciousness
isn't capable of dealing with and you

69
00:02:42,391 --> 00:02:43,140
don't want to,

70
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,381
you know,

71
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:46,800
you don't want to downplay the
complexity of those sorts of functions.

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,220
There are so important that evolution
doesn't let you mess around with them.

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,113
So,

74
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,163
and then,

75
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,003
um,

76
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:53,620
you know,

77
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,970
the,

78
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:54,330
the,

79
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:56,920
the voluntary motor system
and the sensory system.

80
00:02:56,921 --> 00:02:58,110
So the central nervous system,

81
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:58,470
well,

82
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,140
you know,

83
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:04,140
your spine is fairly hefty bit of neural
tissue and then of course the neurons

84
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:06,670
themselves are distributed
through your body.

85
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,470
So really your brain is
distributed through your body.

86
00:03:09,471 --> 00:03:13,150
And there's also a tremendous number
of neurons in your gut as well.

87
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,280
And some of those seem to actually produce
information that might actually even

88
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,300
acquire consciousness.

89
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:19,451
Now,

90
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,310
I don't necessarily need it the gut level,

91
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:22,750
but it certainly informs you.

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,033
So,

93
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:28,840
so Swanson's basic proposition is
that it's a Piagetian proposition.

94
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,171
You know,

95
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:33,610
that you lay out these initial reflex
of behaviors and then they're sequenced

96
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:35,800
into more complex melodies.

97
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:36,640
The,

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,360
the,

99
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:37,691
the,

100
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,524
uh,

101
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:38,891
you know,

102
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,910
the lowest level,

103
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:44,290
highest resolution behaviors you practice
and practice until you're an expert at

104
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:44,410
them.

105
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,561
Like,

106
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:45,371
you know how to grip,

107
00:03:45,371 --> 00:03:46,450
you don't have to figure that out.

108
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:50,560
So you've got these elements of behavior
that you can basically parse off to

109
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,270
automated systems.

110
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:55,900
And some of those automated systems are
so automated that they're handled by

111
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,130
very low brain areas,

112
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:58,050
like spinal levels.

113
00:03:58,051 --> 00:03:58,960
So for example,

114
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:01,300
if you take a paraplegic person and you,

115
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:02,921
and you,

116
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:03,754
uh,

117
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,170
if you take a paraplegic person and
you suspend them under the arms,

118
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,180
over a treadmill and tilt them forward,

119
00:04:10,181 --> 00:04:13,660
they'll walk has pretty remarkable
because you wouldn't think that.

120
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:16,210
But walking isn't that complicated.

121
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,100
I shouldn't say that.

122
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,533
Walking could be,

123
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,040
can be handled by the spine.

124
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,900
Figuring out where you want to walk.

125
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:24,100
That's more complicated.

126
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,490
So higher order brain
systems are involved in that,

127
00:04:27,491 --> 00:04:29,200
but so you think about it as a hierarchy.

128
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,150
Now one of the things that that,

129
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:31,984
ah,

130
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:36,460
at Swanson really concentrates on is
this is the function of the hypothalamus

131
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:40,720
and she'd tell you some
things about the hypothalamus.

132
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,790
It's Sorta sits at the top of the,

133
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,040
of the spinal cord and it's,

134
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,270
it's not that big.

135
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,710
It's a little bitty brain area.

136
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,630
Although it's,

137
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:49,750
it's also not,

138
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:50,591
you know,

139
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:54,850
you got to remember that when you hear
a word like hypothalamus or word like

140
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:57,040
emotion or word like brain,

141
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,870
those are low resolution words,

142
00:04:58,871 --> 00:04:59,410
right?

143
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,900
The phenomena itself isn't homogenous.

144
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:04,300
And so if you look at the hypothalamus,

145
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,650
it's composed of modules and then those
modules are composed of modules and

146
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:12,520
those modules modules are composed of
modules and all the way down to the

147
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,390
cellular level.

148
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,630
And then there's some modules there
and that goes all the way down to the

149
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:17,500
molecular level.

150
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:20,260
And then there's sub module
is at the molecular level.

151
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:21,550
So it's really,

152
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,600
really complicated.

153
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:26,620
And to think about it as a homogenous
system is just a low resolution

154
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:27,490
representations.

155
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:29,710
So the hypothalamus isn't an entity,

156
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:34,690
it's a group of functionally related
entities that are composed of groups of

157
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:35,900
functionally related entities.
