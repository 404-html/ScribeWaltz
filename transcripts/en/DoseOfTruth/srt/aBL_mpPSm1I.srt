1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,090
And the Lord was with Joseph and he was
a prosperous man and he was in the house

2
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:10,691
of his master.

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,530
The Egyptian and his master saw that the
Lord was with him and the Lord made all

4
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:15,940
that he did to prosper in his hand.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:19,270
So that's an echo of the idea that we
encountered earlier about walking with

6
00:00:19,271 --> 00:00:19,690
God.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,230
Right.

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:24,400
So Adam walked with God before he ate
the fruit with eve and then he wouldn't

9
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:28,750
walk with God and they had Noah walked
with God and Abraham walked with God.

10
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:29,800
And so the idea is,

11
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:32,350
well that's that alignment
with the highest ideal.

12
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:33,610
I think it's something like that.

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:34,773
And you know,

14
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,930
we could think about that as
a metaphysical claim as well.

15
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,850
But I don't think it is.

16
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:40,961
I mean,

17
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:45,961
I've got thousands of letters now in the
last year from people who have told me

18
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,790
that they were in a pit.

19
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,170
That's exactly right.

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:56,390
And that they decided that they were
going to try to put their lives together

21
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,490
and that it worked.

22
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:01,480
And so that's really something,

23
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:01,721
you know,

24
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:02,980
and they write surprised.

25
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:03,311
It's like,

26
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:03,431
well,

27
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:06,740
I decided that I was going to work hard
at what I was doing and I wasn't going

28
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:09,100
to lie any more than absolutely necessary.

29
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,290
I thought I'd give it
a try for a few months,

30
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,100
you know,

31
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,870
and all sorts of good
things started to happen.

32
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:14,704
To me,

33
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,650
it's like maybe that's
how the world works now.

34
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:19,960
Obviously it doesn't work
like that all the time.

35
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:20,231
Right.

36
00:01:20,231 --> 00:01:22,150
Because you can get
sliced off at the knees.

37
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:27,151
I mean there's an arbitrary element
to existence that you can't wish away,

38
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:31,330
but that doesn't mean that there are,

39
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,780
it doesn't mean that there aren't
bad strategies and good strategies.

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,960
So I do think that one of the
most fundamental existential
questions is like if

41
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:44,390
things aren't going well
for you and your life is,

42
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,020
are you absolutely certain that you're
doing absolutely everything you can to

43
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:48,950
put things in order?

44
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,390
Because if you're not,

45
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:53,570
then you shouldn't complain because
you don't know to what degree you're

46
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:57,110
actually contributing or even
causing the circumstance.

47
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,441
Now,

48
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:58,880
that's a very annoying thing to think,

49
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,860
and I'm not trying to blame the victim,

50
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,251
you know?

51
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,100
I know that people end up with lung
cancer because they were exposed to

52
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:04,790
asbestos.

53
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,450
You know,

54
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,410
I'm not trying to,

55
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,860
although I also know too that if you
have lung cancer because you've been

56
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,030
exposed to asbestos,

57
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,190
that can be a tragedy or it can be hell.

58
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:13,971
And to some degree,

59
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:15,800
that depends on how you conduct yourself.

60
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,150
So I mean,

61
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:19,400
I know that's pretty gloomy possibilities,

62
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:19,671
right?

63
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:20,504
But

64
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,371
so anyways,

65
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,600
so Joseph is a slave,

66
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,890
but it turns out that he's a,

67
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:29,300
he hasn't sacrifice the
integrity of his character.

68
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:30,410
And so it turns out that being,

69
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,800
it turns out that he's not a slave.

70
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,890
It's just that everyone around
him thinks he's a slave,

71
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,113
but he's not.

72
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:38,890
So that's pretty interesting.

73
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,310
He was a goodly person and well favored.

74
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,581
Well,

75
00:02:42,581 --> 00:02:47,270
so he's a good guy and he's an
impressive specimen as well.

76
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,900
This is pretty interesting given
the current political climate,

77
00:02:50,901 --> 00:02:51,734
I would say.

78
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,030
And it came to pass after these things
that his master's wife cast her eyes upon

79
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:57,050
Joseph and she said,

80
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,370
lie with me.

81
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:01,060
That means that actually has two meanings.

82
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:01,870
Right?

83
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,703
Um,

84
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,970
but he refused

85
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,880
and said unto his master's wife,

86
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:10,480
behold,

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,313
my master

88
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:17,260
does not know what's with me in the house
and he's committed all that he has to

89
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,094
my hand.

90
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:23,110
There is no one greater in
this house than I neither has.

91
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:24,520
He kept back anything from me,

92
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:27,100
but you because you are his wife.

93
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,320
How then can I do this great wickedness,

94
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,251
wickedness,

95
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,570
and sin against God.

96
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,470
And it came to pass as she speak to Joseph
Day by day that he harkened not unto

97
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,870
her to lie by her or be with her.

98
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,550
It's being sexually harassed.

99
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:43,413
Joseph.

100
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:44,830
And it came to pass.

101
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:45,551
Well,

102
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:46,280
it's right,

103
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:46,961
it's right.

104
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,231
I mean,

105
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:47,860
look,

106
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,940
look at the painting.

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,570
And it came to pass about this time that
Joseph went into the house to do his

108
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,420
business and there was none of the
men of the house they're within.

109
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,120
And she caught him by his garment saying,

110
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:04,954
lie with me.

111
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,650
And he left his garment in her
hand and fled and got him out.

112
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,220
So that's kind of
embarrassing for poor Joseph,

113
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:13,054
I would say.

114
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,580
And a bit on the suspicious side.

115
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,390
And it came to pass when she saw that
he had left his garment in her hand and

116
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:20,380
was fled forth,

117
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,380
that she called unto the men of
her house and spake unto them.

118
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:23,980
See,

119
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,461
see,

120
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,290
he has brought into Hebrew to mark us.

121
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:27,460
He came in unto me,

122
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:28,061
lie with me,

123
00:04:28,061 --> 00:04:30,460
and I cried with a loud voice.

124
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:35,320
So what is it Hell hath no
fury like a woman scorned?

125
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,350
That's the proper commentary on that.

126
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,910
And it came to pass when he heard that,

127
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:43,510
I lifted up my voice and cried that he
left his garment with me and fled and got

128
00:04:43,511 --> 00:04:48,310
himself out and it came to pass when
his master heard the words of his wife.

129
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:49,210
So that's the Faro,

130
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,410
which he spake unto him,

131
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:51,040
saying,

132
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,090
after this manner,

133
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:53,290
did thy servant to me,

134
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,340
his wrath was kindled and Joseph's
master took him and put him in prison.

135
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:59,290
A place where the king's prisoners were,

136
00:04:59,620 --> 00:04:59,861
was,

137
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:00,640
were bound,

138
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,170
and he was there in the prison.

139
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:02,651
Well,

140
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:03,760
that sort of sucks.

141
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:08,761
It's like first his brothers betray him
and throw him in a pit and then he gets

142
00:05:09,521 --> 00:05:10,301
made a slave,

143
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:12,070
which is probably better
than being in the pet.

144
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,480
And then he becomes
sort of like king slave.

145
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,530
So that's working out pretty well
and now someone lies about him,

146
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,900
he gets betrayed again and now
it's into the prison with them.

147
00:05:19,901 --> 00:05:20,734
And so it's this,

148
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,881
it's this again,

149
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:22,270
right?

150
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,200
It's the same thing.

151
00:05:23,201 --> 00:05:28,030
It's [inaudible] with the Rock
and then down in its order,

152
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:28,900
chaos,

153
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:29,741
order,

154
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:30,450
chaos.

155
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,750
And then you have to think,

156
00:05:31,751 --> 00:05:31,901
well,

157
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:32,780
are you the order?

158
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:37,270
Are you the chaos or you the thing that's
moving between them because that's the

159
00:05:37,271 --> 00:05:38,500
right thing to be.

160
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,450
Because otherwise you're just ordering.

161
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,710
That's a really bad idea.

162
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,020
Or you're just chaos and
that's a really bad idea.

163
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:49,240
You can be the thing that's dynamically
mediating between them and that's what

164
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:50,074
he's doing.

165
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,520
But the Lord was with Joseph and showed
him mercy and gave him favor in the

166
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,140
sight of the keeper of the prison.

167
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,130
That's no easy thing to do,

168
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:58,730
I would think.

169
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:58,971
You know,

170
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:02,420
it's like you're thrown in prison
and now the jailer likes you.

171
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,081
Now.

172
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:06,680
How exactly are you going to manage
that as much good thing to think about

173
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,580
because you might think,

174
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:08,030
well,

175
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,680
if you were really in dire straits,

176
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:12,890
how is it that you should conduct
yourself so that you have the highest

177
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:15,290
probability of having things work out?

178
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:16,700
And it's not saying,

179
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:17,240
well,

180
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:19,330
Joseph took over the thumb screw,

181
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:19,940
you know,

182
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,480
and started using that on the other
prisoners that that's not the indication

183
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:24,021
here at all.

184
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:25,340
It's that he's doing something.

185
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:29,030
He's acting like a person
who isn't a prisoner,

186
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,130
even though he's in the prison,

187
00:06:31,131 --> 00:06:34,280
just like he was acting like someone
who wasn't a slave when he was a slave.

188
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,863
And so

189
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,200
it makes you wonder who you can be despite
the fact that other people think that

190
00:06:45,201 --> 00:06:47,360
you're whatever you appear to be.
