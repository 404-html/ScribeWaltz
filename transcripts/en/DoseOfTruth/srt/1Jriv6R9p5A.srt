1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,580
Yes,
authentic leftism is populous.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,440
It is based in working class style,
working class language,

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,340
working class,
direct emotional openness and brushing

4
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:17,971
stuff.
Speech.

5
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:19,760
Okay.
Not this fancy,

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,300
contorted jargon of this udall leftist
of academe who are fraud.

7
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:27,030
These people,
these people who managed to manage to

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:30,450
rise to the top and at Berkeley and
Harvard and Princeton.

9
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,650
Okay.
Do you have any of these people are

10
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:33,510
radical?
They are career people.

11
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,130
Their corporate types.
Okay.

12
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:38,670
Then who like who succeeded in it?
They love the institutional contacts.

13
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,890
They know how to manipulate the
bureaucracy,

14
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,110
which is totally invaded in usurped.
Okay.

15
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,350
The academe everywhere.
Okay.

16
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,590
These people are company polit players.
They could have done well in any,

17
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,690
any field.
They love to sit in endless committees.

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:54,090
They loved bureaucratic regulation and
so on.

19
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,970
There's not one,
not one leftist.

20
00:00:56,971 --> 00:00:59,520
Okay.
And American academe raised his or her

21
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:01,960
voice against obscene growth.

22
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,880
Growth tuition costs which have
bankrupted a whole generation of young

23
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:06,660
people.
Not,

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,100
not one voice.
Okay.

25
00:01:08,101 --> 00:01:11,400
To challenge that.
That that invasion by the bureaucrats.

26
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:14,040
Okay.
Actual fascist bureaucrats.

27
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:14,570
Okay.
Well,

28
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,800
if we added the cancer risks.
Okay.

29
00:01:16,801 --> 00:01:20,820
There are so many of them because the
faculty have completely lost any power

30
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,100
in American academia.
Okay.

31
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,790
It's us.
It's a scandal.

32
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,570
What has happened.
Okay.

33
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:27,540
And they deserve the president's
servitude that they're in right now.

34
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,860
Okay.
Because they never protested.

35
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,590
When I.
my first job at Bennington College,

36
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,550
Ninety,
76.

37
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,300
I was there when there was an uprising
by the faculty against encroachment,

38
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:38,190
by the board of trustees and the
president.

39
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,870
Okay.
And it was a huge thing.

40
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:40,441
It was,
it was.

41
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:42,330
It was reported on the New York Times
and so on.

42
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,380
And we.
And we pushed that precedent out.

43
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:45,090
Okay.
And,

44
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,940
and there's not been a single uprising
of mankind against,

45
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,250
against encroachment,
by the trustees and by the

46
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:52,490
administrations and all these decades.
Okay.

47
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,720
Pass them slaves.
Slaves.

48
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:56,040
They deserve their slavery.

49
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,760
Yep.
I couldn't agree more.

50
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,630
I thought the same thing about
university professors for a long time is

51
00:02:02,631 --> 00:02:06,530
that they get exactly what they deserve
because they never stand up and say no.

52
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,610
And the fact that in the United States,
it's not quite as bad in Canada,

53
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:14,090
I wouldn't say,
but the fact that the students have been

54
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:17,990
essentially handed a bill of indentured
servitude here for the student loans is

55
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:20,060
absolutely beyond comprehension.
You know,

56
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:24,560
it seems to me that the bureaucracy has
basically conspired to determine how to

57
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,890
pick the pockets of the students' future
earnings.

58
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:30,110
Right?
And they do that by offering them an

59
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:32,960
extended adolescence with no quality
control,

60
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,690
something like that.
So it's a real bargain with the devil.

61
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,010
And,
and I told the abandonment of any kind

62
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:40,410
of education actually in history and
culture.

63
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,120
All right,
everybody got along with it.

64
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:46,170
That is the transformation into a
cafeteria kind of a menu.

65
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:47,970
Okay,
we can pick this course or that course

66
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:50,940
or this course without any kind of
guidance from the university about a

67
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:55,470
central core curriculum that teaches you
history and chronology and introduces

68
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:56,580
you to the basics,
right?

69
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,160
Because what are our professors are
prima donnas.

70
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,500
They can only teach and their little
areas.

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,950
So we have this total fragmentation and
the the,

72
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:09,190
the great art history survey courses are
being abandoned steadily because why?

73
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,730
Because graduate students are not
trained to see the great narratives or

74
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:15,250
the network because we are taught now
that narratives are fault.
