1
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:28,020
So I have this program called
holding cell fourth program.

2
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,330
Its components is the future arm program.

3
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,920
And I was speaking to consider their
lives deeply and to develop a vision and a

4
00:00:37,931 --> 00:00:38,764
strategy.

5
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,170
And it's not easy to have someone
who hasn't been encouraged that say,

6
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,120
my vision has been on practice.

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,033
Avid.

8
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:50,981
People say,

9
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:51,161
well,

10
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:52,830
I don't know what I should be doing.

11
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:53,620
It's like,

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,160
well,

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,461
you know,

14
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:56,110
some things you shouldn't be doing.

15
00:00:56,111 --> 00:00:57,280
So that's a good start.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,860
I do need them.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,550
And it was practical planner.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,680
If you don't know what to do,

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,260
you would start by stopping doing all
the stupid things that you're doing that

20
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:06,150
you know are stupid.

21
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,460
And that's a good start if it
starts to clear your vision,

22
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,120
right?

23
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,953
So if you,

24
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,940
if you don't know what to do,

25
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,540
but you do know that you're doing
things that you're ashamed of,

26
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,960
something you regret,

27
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,220
you could start by just

28
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:24,280
eliminated in one by one and
slowly to the best of your ability.

29
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,070
And then there's your,

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,540
so that journey of matter is
starting to become disciplined.

31
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:31,480
The false of ethical rules
on some set of ethical rules.

32
00:01:31,481 --> 00:01:32,640
And with any luck,

33
00:01:32,641 --> 00:01:35,020
it can follow a set of
ethical rules long enough,

34
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:36,170
then you'll get disciplines enough.

35
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:40,210
So you'll start to have a clear vision
and then you might be able to see the way

36
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:41,044
forward.

37
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:46,290
Or you might see a way more important
for intended rather than merely what you

38
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:47,974
should avoid.

39
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,980
So that's a good initial practical issue.

40
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:51,080
It's well,

41
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:54,990
because everyone knows you know perfectly
well that there are things you would

42
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:55,690
do even,

43
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,640
you know you shouldn't do,

44
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:57,941
but you don't.

45
00:01:57,941 --> 00:01:58,930
Stall

46
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,460
started stopping

47
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:08,830
because of the natural part of this
idea about putting your house in perfect

48
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:10,840
order before you criticize the world.

49
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,560
Because there's a question
that's always open and that's,

50
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,770
suppose this is the question,

51
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:15,310
so to speak.

52
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,970
They'd gone placed in front of cake.

53
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:17,804
It's like,

54
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,221
well,

55
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:18,941
how do you know the world?

56
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,520
Would we interpret places you
weren't sent to Richard thing?

57
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,830
Maybe it wouldn't be.

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,750
And I don't mean might say,

59
00:02:25,751 --> 00:02:26,690
well that's pretty challenging,

60
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:27,210
I'm sure.

61
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:30,760
Would you say to people who has a parent
who's dying of Alzheimer's disease,

62
00:02:30,761 --> 00:02:31,510
for example,

63
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:34,040
like wasn't gonna hit their act
together and he's going to fix that.

64
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:37,570
It's like it made it a hell of a lot
better than it wouldn't be otherwise.

65
00:02:37,571 --> 00:02:38,404
I can tell you that.

66
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,690
And that's something because it's bad
enough to have someone who's dead and you

67
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:46,840
and your family without having an
incredible amount of unnecessary pathology

68
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:50,530
gathering around that and make something
that could be merely tragic into

69
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:51,460
something that's outlined.

70
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,680
Hell No.

71
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,310
It happens to people all the time.

72
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,340
And so even if it's not
the perfect solution,

73
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,760
the best solution that you have,

74
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:05,770
and then the next part of that is when
I suggested to people that they do the

75
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:08,070
future authoring program and they're,

76
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,150
they're leery about doing it.

77
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:16,290
I asked them to do it back because a
bad plan is way better than no plan.

78
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,220
Because if you didn't come into town,

79
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,890
they didn't learn why
you should that plan.

80
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,590
Exactly.

81
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,480
Not Hypothetically,

82
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,610
but exactly in the world.

83
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,540
And then in the news,

84
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:33,310
that information above her
failure to retool a better clap.

85
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,690
And so the English like manufacture,

86
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,560
you're tracking the destination,

87
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:38,161
it's moving,

88
00:03:38,161 --> 00:03:41,350
there's some kind of ideal
and your vision is blurry.

89
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,380
You don't know where to look.

90
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,250
So you're going to go this way
and then you can go that way.

91
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,360
We can go this way.

92
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:47,960
But if you keep doing that big,

93
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,120
the deviations from the right path
agreed going to decrease his time and

94
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:55,720
eventually you'll be walking
forward in an efficient manner.

95
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,050
And you might have to take all sorts
of errors before you manage that.

96
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,980
But I've watched people long enough in
my clinical practice to know that waiting

97
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,870
for Kudos and very bad idea and
not going up as a very bad idea.

98
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,310
It's like implement the
best plan and half a half

99
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:16,830
and learn from and that works and you
get sharper at making your planets.

100
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:20,470
And then the other thing that we do
with the future authoring program,

101
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:20,800
the school,

102
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,490
we ask people,

103
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:21,611
well,

104
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:26,611
maybe you can't decide what your
passion or your calling should be,

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,020
but it's a pretty cool question.

106
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:33,430
But you like ask yourself
some questions like,

107
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,953
well,

108
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,080
is there something you could do to
improve your intimate relationship?

109
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,341
One thing,

110
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:42,700
is there a way that you can
improve your friendships?

111
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:46,480
Is there something you could do at your
job that would make it better than it is

112
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:47,290
now?

113
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,000
Even if it's something incremental,

114
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,470
could you do something more productive
and meaningful with your time outside of

115
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,160
work?

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,510
Could you be slightly better at
handling temptations that come your way?

117
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:03,010
Could you take care of herself somewhat
better mentally and physically?

118
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,860
And you know the answer to all
of those questions is jeopardy.

119
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,311
Yes.

120
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,220
And then you can even ask
himself a simpler question,

121
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,580
which would be well into something that
you could do that would make one post

122
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:15,220
things better.

123
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,990
Is there also something
that you would have to,

124
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,530
and you can ask yourself that instead
of telling yourself that you should,

125
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,200
which is the same thing,

126
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,691
might say,

127
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:29,620
well I would like my
marriage and ask yourself,

128
00:05:29,621 --> 00:05:30,940
well how can my marriage be better?

129
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,600
And you'll get a bunch of
answers and most of you in place,

130
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,940
because if you really ask
yourself the question like that,

131
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:40,750
the part of our agreements and magic and
who's looking for new masters will tell

132
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,290
you.

133
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,590
And then we'll tell you a bunch
of things you don't want to hear.

134
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,110
I load them with the things you already
know and some of them will be thinks

135
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:48,480
that there's just no gam you,

136
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,200
even though you know that you should,

137
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,610
but some subset of those might be things
that you should do that by your own

138
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:56,950
definition that you actually would

139
00:05:59,230 --> 00:05:59,920
we,

140
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,540
is there a step in the right direction?

141
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,900
So eight would ever step
in the right direction.

142
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:10,901
You're willing to take day by day and
that's incremental progress and it'll

143
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,490
little spire awkward.

144
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,260
It does fire up well.

145
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:16,760
There's a stage of the New Testament,

146
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:18,530
which actually happens
to be a true statement,

147
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:22,040
which is to those who have
everything more will be given.

148
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,610
And it's a,

149
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:27,400
it's a reflection of underlying
phenomenon that looks like phenomenon.

150
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,710
It looks like a natural law,

151
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:31,580
which means that as things
start to recruit to you,

152
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,900
the rigging average,

153
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:35,630
they move further accrue will increase.

154
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,370
That's a natural law school.

155
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,000
Price's law sometimes or deport for Credo,

156
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,200
it's reflective and creative distribution.

157
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:47,201
So there's a chapter 12 rules for
life called don't compare yourself.

158
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:50,750
Compare yourself to
where you were yesterday,

159
00:06:50,751 --> 00:06:52,910
not to someone else's today.

160
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,370
And it's an injunction for
incremental improvement.

161
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,350
If you don't know where
to go in your life,

162
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:00,980
well think about where you are
and see if today could make,

163
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:05,150
where do you are somewhat better on some
dimension so that when you go to bed at

164
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:05,720
night,

165
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,660
you're not as rich as you were
when you woke up in the morning.

166
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:11,780
And so if you do that in the two years,

167
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:12,380
you know,

168
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,310
one thing a day,

169
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:14,270
just a small thing,

170
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:16,400
something you could actually
do that you would do,

171
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,470
then your life will be way headed.

172
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,730
And at the end of that,

173
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,960
you might have enough clarity of mind to
start to understand where you would go

174
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,090
if things worked out
from across the world.
