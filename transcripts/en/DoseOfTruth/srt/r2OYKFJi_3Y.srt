1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,120
There's an old psychoanalytic idea,
which is really worthwhile.

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,880
It's like a surgical tool.
And I would say if you're going to use

3
00:00:05,881 --> 00:00:09,000
it in your own life,
use it carefully because you don't want

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,760
to do unnecessary surgery.
And the rule is,

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:15,120
and I think this is union rule,
but I can't remember exactly where I

6
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:18,840
read it.
If you can't understand why someone is

7
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:22,650
doing something,
look at the consequences of their

8
00:00:22,651 --> 00:00:25,200
actions,
whatever those might be.

9
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:28,350
And then in further motivation from the
consequences.

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,640
So if you see someone who seems to be
doing nothing except making everyone

11
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:36,330
around them and themselves miserable and
you can't understand why,

12
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,230
one of the hypotheses that you might
entertain is that they're trying to make

13
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:43,050
everyone around the miserable as well as
themselves.

14
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:47,280
And that's actually their goal.
And it's hard for people to understand

15
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:51,390
these sorts of things because when we
see phenomena like the columbine

16
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:52,350
shooters,
you know,

17
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,610
we always assume that the reason that
these people are doing these sorts of

18
00:00:56,611 --> 00:00:58,170
things is for other reasons.

19
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,860
Then the reasons they,
that the reasons that appear to motivate

20
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:05,070
them or even the reasons they say
they're doing it because the columbine

21
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:06,630
killer,
especially the more literate one,

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,360
he said exactly why he was doing what he
was doing.

23
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,180
It's not,
it's as clear as it could possibly be.

24
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,990
All you have to do is go online and read
what he said and he tells you what he

25
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:18,450
was up to.
But people don't like to think that way

26
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:22,530
because they don't believe that anybody
could be consciously possessed of that

27
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,400
much malevolence without there being
some other kind of cause.

28
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,300
Like,
you know,

29
00:01:27,301 --> 00:01:31,230
he was bullied at school or you know,
he was an outcast and those things were

30
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,990
only vaguely true and they certainly
weren't more true of having them.

31
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:35,610
They were true of,
you know,

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:38,430
how many people in high school or you
know,

33
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,770
bullied and somewhat outkast.
Jesus,

34
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,980
it must be 10%.
It's probably more like 30 you know,

35
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:46,440
that doesn't mean that the schools are
blowing up all over,

36
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,330
you know,
all over all the time.

37
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,640
It's a completely insufficient
explanation.
