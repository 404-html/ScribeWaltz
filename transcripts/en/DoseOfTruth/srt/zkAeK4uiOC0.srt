1
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,223
Says,

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,800
ditch your barber barber quite a bit.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:17,160
They hit his haircuts a little shorter
than I'm accustomed to and there's some

4
00:00:17,161 --> 00:00:18,030
reasons for that.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,893
But

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,643
Oh,

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:21,983
what can I say?

8
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,890
How hair grows back and they'll be
just as beautiful as I was before,

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,580
had no time.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,920
So I guess that's how that is.

11
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,281
See now,

12
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:30,600
Richard Van Copeland says,

13
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:31,920
my haircuts looking fresh.

14
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:32,850
So who's that?

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:35,130
Nick's are overrated.

16
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:35,964
Take the APP.

17
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,570
Yeah.

18
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:36,960
So.
