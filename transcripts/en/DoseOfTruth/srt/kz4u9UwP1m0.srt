1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,470
Okay.

2
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:13,470
So how did your work on disgust changed
the way that you looked at things?

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,950
Fundamentally mean you gave
some indication of that already,

4
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,600
but what else has changed?

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,200
So since I was coming out of a,

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,800
of a psychological literature
that was very focused on,

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:27,420
on sort of secular,

8
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:31,140
secular ethics about justice and fairness,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:32,580
and then I began studying,

10
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:36,930
discussed and looking at the broader
moral domain that almost all societies

11
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:37,764
have,

12
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,230
that then also led me to think about,

13
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:40,321
well,

14
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:40,531
okay,

15
00:00:40,531 --> 00:00:44,670
if disgust is a reaction to
things that seem to be degrading.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,270
So an interesting element of discusses
this notion of degradation that there are

17
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:49,830
always these vertical metaphors.

18
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:50,920
Um,

19
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,150
uh,

20
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,771
image discussed,

21
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:53,580
brings us down and discussed it.

22
00:00:53,581 --> 00:00:57,990
So a lot of some religious practice in
Judaism and Islam and Hinduism is about

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,090
preparing your body to
approach God and uh,

24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,040
purification.

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,180
And so that led me to think,

26
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:03,450
well,

27
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:08,450
if there's an emotion which is about
seeing our lower base or animal biological

28
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,294
nature,

29
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,800
is there an opposite emotion?

30
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,400
Is there an emotion that we feel when
we see some manifestation of a higher

31
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,300
nobler nature?

32
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,220
And I was just beginning to think this,

33
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:18,390
when I moved to Uva,

34
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,350
I got my first job at University
of Virginia in 1995 and I read,

35
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,960
uh,

36
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,660
the set of Thomas Jefferson's letters.

37
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,270
And in one letter he describes,

38
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,140
he describes the feelings you
get from reading great fiction.

39
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:35,040
He advises a cousin of his that he
should buy fiction for his library,

40
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:35,611
not just,

41
00:01:35,611 --> 00:01:35,821
you know,

42
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,560
serious works of law and philosophy.

43
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,881
And he described,

44
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,310
he says,

45
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:39,800
Eh,

46
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,310
doesn't,

47
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:40,630
uh,

48
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:40,770
he,

49
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,200
he describes the feeling of,

50
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,090
of,

51
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,280
uh,

52
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,040
of uh,

53
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
having your sentiments be elevated.

54
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:50,610
Does it not dilate your breast or giving
an open feeling in your chest when you

55
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,100
see these acts of beauty
and kindness and gratitude?

56
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,551
I thought,

57
00:01:53,551 --> 00:01:53,970
wow,

58
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,950
that's exactly yet.

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:55,830
Um,

60
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,480
and so because I've
been studying discussed,

61
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:59,190
I then started studying its opposite,

62
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,740
which I and some others
called moral elevation.

63
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:06,270
So this is kind of vertical metaphor of
elevation and degradation and it snaps

64
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:08,280
onto the body too with regards to,

65
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:08,941
that's right.

66
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:09,774
High Low,

67
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,320
uh,

68
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,711
clean,

69
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,544
dirty.

70
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,060
Um,

71
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,321
yeah,

72
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:12,550
it's,

73
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,680
it's a beautiful pairing.

74
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:18,450
And so having this language of elevation
and discussed just really has helped me

75
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,560
see a lot of things.

76
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:19,920
I just,

77
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,660
I can just see a lot of things happening.

78
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:22,771
It allows me to,

79
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:23,460
like,

80
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,791
even in,

81
00:02:23,791 --> 00:02:23,941
you know,

82
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,391
manipulate,

83
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,770
like of applying for a grant proposal.

84
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:29,100
Like it I can get very good at like
having an elevating ending and you know,

85
00:02:29,101 --> 00:02:29,460
to,

86
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,180
um,

87
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:30,391
uh,

88
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:32,220
to end with a note of uplift.

89
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,323
Um,

90
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,920
and so it just brought it,

91
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,720
it just broadened my
thinking about morality.

92
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,090
And this was around 1995 and so again,

93
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,210
it just prepared me so that,

94
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:40,800
um,

95
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,250
uh,

96
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,810
and I'd already been
to India by that point.

97
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:44,360
I spent three months doing research in,

98
00:02:44,361 --> 00:02:45,031
in Orissa,

99
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:45,900
in eastern India.

100
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:46,650
Um,

101
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,480
so it just broadened my thinking and
that's what allowed me finally to

102
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:55,050
understand conservatives because
I had always been on the left.

103
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,300
I hated Ronald Reagan.

104
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,173
Um,

105
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,620
I thought Republicans were stupid and
evil and it was only when I had gone to

106
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:06,850
India and really tried to
understand a traditional religious,

107
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,610
hierarchical gender stratified society.

108
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:11,440
Tried to understand it in their terms.

109
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,000
They didn't try to just bring in my own,

110
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,710
my own western left,

111
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:14,921
you know,

112
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,150
left leaning perspectives.

113
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,050
Um,

114
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,190
that I was,

115
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,550
and this was all under the guidance of
Richard Suede or my postdoc supervisor at

116
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:22,420
the University of Chicago.

117
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:23,254
We did a post doc.

118
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,220
Um,

119
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,080
it was only then that he was able to,

120
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,460
to,

121
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,920
to sort of get inside their minds and
their moral system and see that there were

122
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,840
alternative moral worlds.

123
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,200
They each had their own logic and
that was the metaphor I came to it.

124
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,321
You know,

125
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,154
at the time,

126
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,311
you know,

127
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,990
the matrix movies were very popular.

128
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,130
So the metaphor,

129
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,300
the Matrix as a consensual
hallucination made a lot of sense.

130
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:45,430
It's waking up with the idea of just
speaking about moral matrices have a

131
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,264
different moral matrix,

132
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,170
better grounded in biology and biology
in the sense that it gives us the

133
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:50,801
potential.

134
00:03:50,801 --> 00:03:54,160
It's like the building blocks of this
matrix can't be just anything that comes,

135
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,050
it comes from our experiences,

136
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:57,430
our embodied experiences.

137
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:57,941
And again,

138
00:03:57,941 --> 00:03:58,810
George Lakoff is the,

139
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,790
is the master of,

140
00:03:59,791 --> 00:03:59,970
of,

141
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:00,940
of that thinking.

142
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:06,510
And so it was only then that I was able
to now listen to conservative talk radio

143
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:11,410
and Christian religious radio and see,

144
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,100
rather than just saying,

145
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,300
oh that was stupid terrible.

146
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,020
People say like,

147
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,220
Oh wow,

148
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,910
yeah,

149
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,640
I can see that they're
striving for certain versions.

150
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:18,160
Right.

151
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,770
So you started to understand their
metaphorical language essentially.

152
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,161
That's right.

153
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:22,360
And that was like kind of like my,

154
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:22,711
you know,

155
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:24,940
on a great awakening or
scales falling from my eyes.

156
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:25,841
But you know,

157
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,010
since well it took a few more,

158
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,120
it took a number of a lot more years.

159
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:32,710
But eventually I kinda just like pulled
out the implants from my eyes and I

160
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:36,640
stopped seeing everything through a
partisan lens and I'm not on any side now.

161
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,890
I'm just trying to
understand what that is.

162
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,411
Well,

163
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,400
it's really useful.

164
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:43,990
It's really useful to understand that
there are actual reasons why people see

165
00:04:43,991 --> 00:04:47,680
the world differently and that you can't
just easily say that one is right and

166
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:51,010
the other is wrong because the liberals
are correct when it comes to borders,

167
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:54,040
that if you thicken them too much
and diminish the information flow,

168
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,570
you risk making the society so
static that any radical environmental

169
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,980
transformation will sink it.

170
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,150
It's the case,

171
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,110
but the conservatives are right in that
you pay a big price with regards to

172
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:09,850
newcomers and new information with regards
to risk to exposure to contaminating

173
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,260
while to contamination period,

174
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:12,970
but also to contaminating ideas.

175
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,980
And so then I've always thought,

176
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:15,221
you know,

177
00:05:15,221 --> 00:05:15,870
the,

178
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,730
the environment itself moves back
and forth like a snake in some sense.

179
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:22,810
And what we're trying to do is
stay on the center of its back.

180
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,270
And the only way we can
do that is by people,

181
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,160
by having people pull
to the right and say,

182
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:27,881
be careful.

183
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:29,260
And people pull to the left and say,

184
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:29,501
well,

185
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:29,741
yeah,

186
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:33,030
but be open with that dialogue and the,

187
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:36,100
the exchange of information
that that dialogue allows,

188
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:41,101
we can maybe specify the center of that
moving target and stay and stay well and

189
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:42,610
stay on the back.

190
00:05:42,611 --> 00:05:42,830
Let's,

191
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:43,390
yeah.

192
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:43,661
Okay.

193
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:45,420
So that's a really complicated
metaphor with the snake,

194
00:05:45,421 --> 00:05:45,960
but I think it's,

195
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,190
it's,

196
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:50,240
it's a perfect way in to what's going
on on campus and to why viewpoint

197
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,120
diversity is so important.
