1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,550
Be comedians are happy,

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:08,791
right?

3
00:00:08,791 --> 00:00:10,830
But everyone doesn't
aspire to be a comedian.

4
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:12,510
Then you don't watch comedy all the time,

5
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:16,860
even though you could laugh nonstop more
or less if the comedians funny you want

6
00:00:16,861 --> 00:00:18,270
to get your teeth into something.

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,500
And also seems to me that this is one
of the reasons I liked existential

8
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:23,580
philosophy was that,

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,320
you know,

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,350
the existentialists believed it's
sort of an original sin idea.

11
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:32,000
They believe that we came into the world
with an ethical burden already laid in

12
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:32,581
upon us.

13
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:33,840
Something like something like that.

14
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:38,130
And that we had a felt sense that it was
necessary for us to justify our being.

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,480
And if we didn't do that,

16
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:41,460
then we weren't authentic to ourselves.

17
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,470
We weren't moving towards individuality,

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,360
we weren't sustaining the community,

19
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,700
we weren't living properly
and that and that,

20
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:52,701
that idea was deeply embedded in people
as part of their ordinary experience.

21
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,100
And that also seems to me to be accurate.

22
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,791
And you know,

23
00:00:56,791 --> 00:00:59,430
I've dealt with lots of people
say in my clinical practice and

24
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,430
they don't really cut.

25
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:02,821
They have,

26
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,750
they will come and say,

27
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,490
I wish I wasn't so unhappy.

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,650
But they don't usually come and say,

29
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,120
I wish I was happier.

30
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,980
And those things aren't the same.

31
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,220
And then when,

32
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:12,750
when,

33
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,000
when you talk to people
who are having trouble,

34
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:15,211
you know,

35
00:01:15,211 --> 00:01:18,750
they want to straighten things out
and figure out how to do them right.

36
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,980
It's something like that.

37
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,130
And,

38
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,481
and that,

39
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:22,530
that's the primary,

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,790
that's their primary goal.

41
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:23,990
And.
