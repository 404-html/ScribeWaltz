1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:07,670
Your area candidate.

2
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:09,420
You're in Toronto right
now and Justin Trudeau,

3
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:10,950
he interrupts a woman at a town hall.

4
00:00:10,951 --> 00:00:13,950
She's asking you a question and he didn't
like one of the words that she used.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:16,830
Listen to the sound bite and
then we'll get your reaction.

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:18,583
Right.

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,980
So that's why we came here today to ask
you to also look into the policies that

8
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:29,531
religious charitable organizations have
in our legislation so that it can also

9
00:00:29,601 --> 00:00:34,601
be changed because maternal love is the
love that's going to change the future

10
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:35,870
of mankind.

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:37,640
So we'd like you to look,

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,350
we would like to say people kind,

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,080
not necessarily mankind for inclusive.

14
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:42,861
There we go.

15
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:43,694
Exactly.

16
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,070
And the crowd roars.

17
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:48,740
Yeah,

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,040
well it's quite a,

19
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,520
it's quite the performance.

20
00:00:52,521 --> 00:00:53,354
I mean,

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,360
I'm afraid that our prime minister is
only capable of running his ideas on a few

22
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:01,220
very narrow ideological tracks.

23
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,850
We saw the first evidence of that
when he put his cabinet together,

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,820
he insisted upon making it 50% women,

25
00:01:07,821 --> 00:01:12,800
despite the fact that only about
22% of the elected mps were women.

26
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,060
And it was easier for him to do that
than it was for him to screen people for

27
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:20,900
the sort of competence that would actually
be necessary to be cabinet members.

28
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:23,030
So we've seen a fair bit of this behavior,

29
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:28,031
but that was the most egregious example
I suppose our prime minister's great

30
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:29,120
example of that.

31
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:34,121
So back I think it was in
2015 he announced that half
of his cabinet was going

32
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:39,620
to be women because it was 2015 or
something like muddle headed virtue

33
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:40,370
signaling,

34
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,610
signaling excuse for north thinking.

35
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,390
I think only 20% or 25% of
the elected mps were female.

36
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:52,580
So the proper balance on
average would it be 25% female,

37
00:01:52,581 --> 00:01:54,110
75% male.

38
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,200
What he should've done
was figured out who,

39
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,310
what all of these would make for a
competent cabinet minister because it's

40
00:02:01,311 --> 00:02:05,420
actually quite important to have competent
cabinet ministers and then selected

41
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:09,590
from among his people for
nothing other than competence,

42
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,670
but he could virtue signal and then
he set up the most important board,

43
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:18,671
let's say of the entire comp country
on a cause I random basis Jesus.

44
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,090
How pathetic.

45
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:23,690
He should have been pilloried
by Canadians for that.

46
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,510
But we're so clued out and,

47
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,920
and also in the situation
that you described,

48
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,660
it's like if I say,

49
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:29,871
well,

50
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:32,780
50% of Trudeau's cabinet
shouldn't have been women.

51
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,590
It's like,

52
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:33,831
oh,

53
00:02:33,831 --> 00:02:34,910
you're a misogynist.

54
00:02:34,911 --> 00:02:35,810
It's like no,

55
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:39,050
only 25% of the elected
officials were women.

56
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:39,831
Now you might say,

57
00:02:39,831 --> 00:02:42,700
well it would be better if
50% of the were elected.

58
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:44,450
It's like maybe it would be better,

59
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,680
but it didn't happen.

60
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,690
So you can't,

61
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,180
you can't fix it at the top end.

62
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,410
It was appalling.

63
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,800
So it's a hard argument to make you
because you need to know that there's more

64
00:02:57,441 --> 00:03:01,240
difference within groups then between
in order to be able to come up with a

65
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,380
credible argument,

66
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:03,190
you know?

67
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,050
And then so yeah,

68
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,200
I think that the Trudeau government
is far to the left of where people

69
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:09,670
originally assumed it would be.

70
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,481
I mean,

71
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:15,481
I think that his decision to put 50%
women in the cabinet was an abdication of

72
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:18,220
responsibility of a magnitude that,

73
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,520
that we haven't seen before
in Canadian political history.

74
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,440
Only 26% of the,

75
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,600
of the MPS elected were female.

76
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,260
And that should have been approximately
the proportion of cabinet members.

77
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,370
But to say this is 2015 or
whatever the hell the year was.

78
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,600
And then to abdicate his responsibility
for selecting the most competent people

79
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,900
was an indication of exactly how,

80
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,680
uh,

81
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,461
what would you say,

82
00:03:42,461 --> 00:03:45,100
how suited he is to be prime minister.

83
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:49,270
And people just didn't make much of an
issue of that because of their attempts

84
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,021
to be tolerant.

85
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,890
But I think that what he did was re,

86
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:52,421
oh,

87
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:56,470
I thought the fact that he ran to begin
with was reprehensible because he ran

88
00:03:56,471 --> 00:04:00,940
entirely on the name brand recognition
that he had derived from his father.

89
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:04,660
And I think that that's the mark
of someone who's narcissistic.

90
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,970
You shouldn't have done that or

91
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,060
very charismatic and attractive and
he knows how to behave in public.

92
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,070
And so Andy had a very,

93
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,730
very famous name and,

94
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,440
but I believe that it was immoral
of him to run because the,

95
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:26,640
we're not dynasties democracies
aren't dynasties and he hadn't the um,

96
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,201
the CV,

97
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:29,830
the,

98
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:34,300
the record of success that you would
need as an independent individual to

99
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,350
justify himself as a qualified
candidate for prime minister.

100
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,120
So I thought that is his candidacy right
from the start was ethically flawed

101
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,463
then to,

102
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,730
to multiply that error with these,

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,833
these,

104
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,033
these,

105
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,700
uh,

106
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,790
shallow attempts at
broadcasting tolerance,

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
especially at the expense of competence
and the capacity to truly evaluate is

108
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,230
just inexcusable.

109
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,310
Inexcusable.

110
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,090
Look,

111
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,650
it's unbelievably widespread.

112
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,510
So I'll give you an example that's very,

113
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,650
that's very similar.

114
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,000
Our Prime Minister,

115
00:05:10,001 --> 00:05:14,410
Justin Trudeau announced in 2015 that
half the cabinet that he put together

116
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:15,244
would be women,

117
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,421
right?

118
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:18,040
The fact that only approximately,

119
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:21,700
I think it was 20 to 25% of the
elected officials were female.

120
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:27,040
And so what he basically admitted
as far as I'm concerned are,

121
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,510
was two things.

122
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,051
Number one,

123
00:05:29,051 --> 00:05:33,970
he was incapable of judging people on
their competence because when you put

124
00:05:33,971 --> 00:05:36,130
together something like the
cabinet for our country,

125
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,820
what you do is you find the most
competent people period because

126
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,520
it's so bizarre that it even has to be
said because it actually turns out that

127
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:50,521
the cabinet is important and so to me
all he did was default on his see his

128
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:56,800
central moral obligation to screen every
single one of his members of parliament

129
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:01,430
with exceeding care and to pick the most
qualified people and his rationale was

130
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:04,400
that it was 2015 you know,

131
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:09,430
so and we to reduce
competence to racial ethnic,

132
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,080
gender identity,

133
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:15,080
something like that is
absolutely appalling.

134
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,270
Move philosophically as well.

135
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,830
As far as I'm concerned to assume that
diversity is somehow represented by group

136
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:22,401
membership.

137
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:23,540
There's no evidence for that.

138
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,540
There's absolutely no scientific
evidence for that whatsoever.

139
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:26,991
In fact,

140
00:06:26,991 --> 00:06:30,050
the scientific evidence
suggest quite the contrary,

141
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:34,470
which is that there's more variability
within groups than there is between

142
00:06:34,471 --> 00:06:35,304
groups,

143
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:38,520
which is actually an antidote
to the central racist claim.

144
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:38,761
Right.

145
00:06:38,761 --> 00:06:40,430
Because the central racist claim is,

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,130
there's more difference between groups
than there is difference within them.

147
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:44,971
And so,

148
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:45,450
you know,

149
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,950
you seen one black person,

150
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:47,880
you've seen them all.

151
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,260
We lock people who've already done that.

152
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:50,531
Okay,

153
00:06:50,531 --> 00:06:51,131
that's interesting.

154
00:06:51,131 --> 00:06:53,200
So you're saying it's
a necessary transition.

155
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,260
You're saying that something about the
life that he ended up saying something

156
00:06:56,261 --> 00:06:56,681
simple.

157
00:06:56,681 --> 00:07:01,120
If you can't make your damn bed quit
Wavell black cards at corporations,

158
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,380
it's like Jesus.

159
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:04,060
It's like seriously?

160
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:04,691
It's like,

161
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,560
what the hell?

162
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:06,131
What makes you,

163
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:08,340
you can't get this tiny
little part of the world.

164
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:10,840
It's actually right at
your feet functional.

165
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:11,980
You have contempt for it.

166
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,580
It's just my bedroom seems like grits
shoots this caricature of people.

167
00:07:15,581 --> 00:07:15,821
I mean,

168
00:07:15,821 --> 00:07:16,654
look,

169
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,980
they're there.

170
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:18,521
Flip on that is,

171
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:18,940
look,

172
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,640
why should I waste my time making my bed
when we got to deal with his problems

173
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,474
in the world?

174
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,320
You know what gives you risk inflating
your own ego by dealing with the problems

175
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,154
of the world.

176
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,140
It's the cathedral problem again.

177
00:07:29,141 --> 00:07:29,440
It's like,

178
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:29,651
oh,

179
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:31,480
I shouldn't be at the
center of the universe.

180
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:31,720
Right?

181
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,141
So it's like,

182
00:07:32,141 --> 00:07:32,421
yeah,

183
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:32,741
yeah,

184
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:33,574
well maybe,

185
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,420
maybe not.

186
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,950
I'm trying to find a resolution of this,

187
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:39,370
that that goes beyond the existing
cultural conflict around it.

188
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,960
Because no doubt people need to attend
to their own projection and their own

189
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:48,070
limitations and have humility and some
psychological insight and work harder on

190
00:07:48,071 --> 00:07:49,330
what they're directly responsible for.

191
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,230
I don't doubt that,

192
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,830
but I am concerned with a message that
says that's all you should be doing.

193
00:07:53,831 --> 00:07:54,760
And until you figure that out,

194
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:58,750
anything else you should be doing your
thing you have to do at first or you can

195
00:07:58,751 --> 00:07:59,201
do that.

196
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:02,590
You should be very leery of assuming
that when you try to do something else,

197
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:04,900
you won't just make it
worse and you will look.

198
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,960
I've dealt with people who've dealt with
complex systems for a very long period

199
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:11,680
of time and I know the difference between
someone who can make a complex system

200
00:08:11,681 --> 00:08:15,290
better and someone who will make a
complex system worse and most people will

201
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,840
make a complex system worse.

202
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,320
Okay.

203
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,330
That's for sure that that's okay.

204
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:21,910
That's good because that's coming to
the question of development and the

205
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:25,060
question of human maturation and the
question of what it means to unfold

206
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:25,690
throughout the lifespan.

207
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,530
So just to,

208
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,150
just to try and distill that last point,

209
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:32,770
you're sort of saying don't begin and
end with your own responsibility of

210
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,200
cleaning your room and sorting your
personal and immediate fares out,

211
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,350
but realize that until you can do that,

212
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,740
you may be lacking a certain forms of
competence that might make you die.

213
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,160
Whether you should be
quite so visceral and,

214
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:48,100
and adamant about your political views.

215
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,240
Precisely that.

216
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:49,600
Yes,

217
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,450
and it's exactly the opposite of what
students are taught in universities.

218
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,030
But you're not saying don't care
about those things or don't act on,

219
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,640
but just while you're doing them,

220
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:59,370
attend to your own
limitations and competencies.

221
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,130
Well I'm saying you should be aware of,

222
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:03,680
you should be aware of your
own competence and your limits.

223
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,040
Right.

224
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,200
And that that's especially
true if you're very young.

225
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:06,920
Cause like what the hell?

226
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,340
You know,

227
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:08,240
you haven't done anything.

228
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,540
Right.

229
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,230
You're like,

230
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,260
I tell 18 year old,

231
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,690
six years ago you were 12.

232
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:11,991
It's like,

233
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,540
what the hell do you know you,

234
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,350
you haven't,

235
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:14,591
you,

236
00:09:14,591 --> 00:09:14,991
you're,

237
00:09:14,991 --> 00:09:15,440
you're,

238
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:15,831
you're,

239
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:17,930
you're under the care of
your family or the state.

240
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:19,910
You haven't established
an independent existence.

241
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:20,810
You haven't had children.

242
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:21,980
You haven't started a business.

243
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,810
You haven't taken
responsibility for anything.

244
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:24,621
You don't have a degree.

245
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:25,850
You haven't finished your courses,

246
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,840
you don't know how to read.

247
00:09:26,841 --> 00:09:27,531
You can't thank,

248
00:09:27,531 --> 00:09:28,364
you can't speak.

249
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:28,800
You're,

250
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,633
you're,

251
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,460
you don't know how to present yourself.

252
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,451
Well Jesus,

253
00:09:32,451 --> 00:09:32,990
you know,

254
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:37,990
and it's just not right to tell people
in that situation that they should go out

255
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,410
and change the socioeconomic,

256
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,620
what culture,

257
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,453
what those children,

258
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,970
those children are young
people that observe or not
wise adults managing complex

259
00:09:44,971 --> 00:09:45,960
systems at that plea.

260
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,020
They see people giving subsidies
to fossil fuel companies.

261
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,800
They see people and just
teaching them a university or no,

262
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,950
like you're so hung up on
the university experience.

263
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,310
Like we keep coming back to this issue
of the activist at the university,

264
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,020
which is clearly very salient for you,

265
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:02,070
but for those who are not there,

266
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:04,590
it's frankly alienating
because you other workers,

267
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:05,281
so fantastic.

268
00:10:05,281 --> 00:10:08,520
But it keeps coming back to this narrative
of these slightly callow students who

269
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,280
are maybe a bit over enthusiastic
about a political issue.

270
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,730
I'm more concerned with their
professors then with the stool.

271
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,040
Okay.

272
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,870
Also the support with the professors

273
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,530
completely corrupted the humanities
and the humanities are the core of the

274
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,161
university.

275
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,810
And by corrupting the humanities,

276
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,350
they're corrupting the fundamental
structure of our civilization and they're

277
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:27,120
spreading that out into
the general culture.

278
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:27,540
Right.

279
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,800
But then there's no excuse for that.

280
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,740
They may be doing that,

281
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:32,640
but simultaneously others are
corrupting the ecological foundations,

282
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,660
the social foundations.

283
00:10:33,661 --> 00:10:35,100
Democracy is arguably dying.

284
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,400
There are real problems
that are existential threats
that are on a different

285
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,234
level.

286
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,650
There's multiple large variety of ways.

287
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,630
And I don't think that's happening
principally because some people are being

288
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,680
taught feminist theory and
the University of Toronto.

289
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,090
It's not that it's something else much
bigger and broader and deeper that when

290
00:10:51,091 --> 00:10:51,990
people raise these issues,

291
00:10:51,991 --> 00:10:53,400
you focus on that small issue,

292
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,050
not the big ones that
they're worried about.

293
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:55,981
Well,

294
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:57,690
it depends on the issue I suppose.

295
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,410
Um,

296
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:00,060
I would say for example,

297
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:01,080
just for argument's sake,

298
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,361
well what,

299
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,140
what should I say about climate change?

300
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,670
What should you do to drive here?

301
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,300
If you were,

302
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,960
no I didn't.

303
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,501
I didn't want,

304
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:07,981
what did you do?

305
00:11:07,981 --> 00:11:08,420
How'd you do?

306
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,510
I took public transport,

307
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,273
but that's not really,

308
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:11,761
but again,

309
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:12,850
that's hardly the point.

310
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:13,684
Yeah.

311
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,540
Well the point,

312
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,690
because it's part of the problem with
climate change is irreducible complexity,

313
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,140
right?

314
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,501
It's like,

315
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:19,940
you know,

316
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,261
we,

317
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,094
we,

318
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,360
there's a cost to our existence
and the cost is externalization,

319
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,090
right?

320
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,600
Externalization of costs and we
don't know how to manage that.

321
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:27,810
Right?

322
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,321
And I would say,

323
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,460
should we be concerned about it?

324
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:29,700
So like,

325
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,390
yeah,

326
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,200
absolutely.

327
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,290
Do we know how to be
concerned about it yet?

328
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:33,990
Not really.

329
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:34,520
[inaudible] right.

330
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:34,821
So,

331
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:36,250
so then how do we learn does that,

332
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,280
that becomes the question,

333
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:37,700
right?

334
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,110
So the younger generation who are,

335
00:11:39,111 --> 00:11:43,520
who like give me an example more
directly affected the kinds of people in

336
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,760
developing countries and younger people
who feel the pinch of this all the

337
00:11:46,761 --> 00:11:47,031
morning.

338
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:47,864
Cause they can see,

339
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:48,711
for example,

340
00:11:48,711 --> 00:11:49,161
New York,

341
00:11:49,161 --> 00:11:52,610
the chancellor thing underwater by by
the end of the century is not negligible

342
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,070
and therefore they're

343
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:56,380
looking for a response that
really matters to them.

344
00:11:56,381 --> 00:11:57,730
And when you think about responsibility,

345
00:11:57,731 --> 00:11:58,810
I think this number,

346
00:11:58,811 --> 00:12:02,200
they're view is don't patronize me about
my bedroom when I've got the planet to

347
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,043
say

348
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,710
there is no,

349
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:05,950
no,

350
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,130
no,

351
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,701
it's a boy.

352
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,420
I understand.

353
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,920
I think your bedroom is important,

354
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:09,863
right?

355
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:13,420
I mean do you think the whole
planet is more important?

356
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,830
They're more concerned about that.

357
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,010
And One why is your room is
a microcosm of the planet,

358
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,370
right?

359
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:18,881
Without tell.

360
00:12:18,881 --> 00:12:19,714
Tell us about that then.

361
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,471
Well let's,

362
00:12:20,471 --> 00:12:20,771
let's,

363
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:25,210
let's go back to the climate issue here
first because there's this guy that I'm

364
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:25,691
aware of.

365
00:12:25,691 --> 00:12:28,810
His name is Boyan Slat and I'm going
to talk to him in the relatively near

366
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:29,644
future I think.

367
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,330
And he's a model for,

368
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,380
for young people.

369
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,740
He went out scuba diving when he was
17 and there was a lot of plastic,

370
00:12:35,741 --> 00:12:35,921
you know,

371
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:36,820
and that sort of bothered him.

372
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:39,220
And then he started thinking about
Manta rays and how they move through the

373
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:39,551
water.

374
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,640
And then he noticed that most of the
plastic was in the top six inches.

375
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:43,474
And then he thought,

376
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,450
I wonder if I could build a machine that
was like a Manta ray that would float

377
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:47,290
on top of the water.

378
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,040
And anyways,

379
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,300
to make a long story short,

380
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:54,540
he's devised a way to rid 50% of the
plastic in the world's oceans within five

381
00:12:54,731 --> 00:12:58,540
years and has spent the last six years
developing that and is well on the way to

382
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,231
implementing it.

383
00:12:59,231 --> 00:13:02,500
And it looks like it might work and he's
going to be able to make a profit from

384
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:04,840
it just to add that extra bit of punch.

385
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:06,340
And so by on slot,

386
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,210
I would say it's like,

387
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,890
I don't know if his room was clean or not,

388
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:12,010
but there was something about him that
was dead on because when he looked at a

389
00:13:12,011 --> 00:13:12,641
problem like that,

390
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:13,210
he thought,

391
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,550
I'm not going to go out there and tell
a bunch of other people what they're

392
00:13:15,551 --> 00:13:17,080
doing wrong so that they can solve it.

393
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm going to bloody well fix it.

394
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,790
And that's what I'm telling
young men in particular to do.

395
00:13:21,970 --> 00:13:22,360
Although,

396
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:22,631
you know,

397
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,310
I'm feeling women want to do that.

398
00:13:24,311 --> 00:13:25,121
It's like great.

399
00:13:25,121 --> 00:13:26,080
More power to them,

400
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:27,610
but you know,

401
00:13:27,611 --> 00:13:28,121
people say,

402
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:28,301
well,

403
00:13:28,301 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm taking climate change seriously.

404
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,480
I'm going out to protests.

405
00:13:31,481 --> 00:13:33,040
Like you're not taking it seriously.

406
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,120
That's not serious.

407
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:37,840
Serious is you're going to devote 80
hours of your life to it for the rest of

408
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:38,261
your life,

409
00:13:38,261 --> 00:13:38,411
right?

410
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:41,380
You're going to work on that so intently
that you're not even going to think

411
00:13:41,381 --> 00:13:43,200
about anything else that's here.
