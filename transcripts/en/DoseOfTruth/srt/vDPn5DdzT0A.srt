1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,300
So here's something to think about.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:12,830
This is a way of approaching
what Rogers was up to.

3
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,070
Imagine how you use words.

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:19,991
No,

5
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:21,790
you could use words instrumentally.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,520
Let's start with that.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,630
If imagine that you want something
from someone and then you might think,

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,093
well,

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,630
how can I phrase my argument so that
I'm going to get that from this person?

10
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,400
And then you might say,

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:36,761
well,

12
00:00:36,761 --> 00:00:40,180
what sort of argument would appeal to
that person and what buttons can I push

13
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:42,040
and how can I get what I want?

14
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,120
And then you're using words
in an instrumental way.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:50,890
You're using them as tools to obtain
what you desire from other people.

16
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:51,731
Now,

17
00:00:51,731 --> 00:00:53,860
I think if you do that completely,

18
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,210
you're a psychopath.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,320
I mean that because a psychopath
has no room for you at all.

20
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,160
It's about him or her and you're there
to be used as an instrumental target.

21
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,071
Now,

22
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:12,850
I'm not saying that every time
someone uses language instrumentally,

23
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:15,280
they're acting like a psychopath,

24
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,473
but

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,520
that's the logical conclusion
to that form of language use.

26
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,340
Now then you might think,

27
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:26,253
well,

28
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,740
you can ask little kids tried
to do that to their parents,

29
00:01:30,741 --> 00:01:31,340
right?

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,140
Siblings will often collude,

31
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,330
we'll have a little
conspiratorial conversation
about how to approach one parent

32
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:38,990
or the other.

33
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:40,940
Usually by isolating the parents,

34
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,020
that's a good strategy.

35
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,380
And then they'll phrase their requests
so that they can extract out the desired

36
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,314
benefit.

37
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,533
Um,

38
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,760
I follow these pickup artists online,

39
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,310
um,

40
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:56,840
being very interested in
their use of psychology.

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,390
And they are instrumental language users,

42
00:01:59,391 --> 00:01:59,661
right?

43
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:04,430
So their trick is they're
developing a whole little hope,

44
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:09,410
hurry of verbal tricks that
they use in attempts to seduce.

45
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:13,820
It's a very narrow focus and
it's instrumental language.

46
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:14,730
It,

47
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:17,990
it's as if that the personhood of the,

48
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,950
of the target is irrelevant fundamentally.

49
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,290
So it's a fairly pathological,

50
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,670
it can become pathological,

51
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:26,504
very easy.

52
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:27,681
So then you might say,

53
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:28,430
well,

54
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,250
how would you use language if
you weren't using instrumentally?

55
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:31,711
Because you know,

56
00:02:31,711 --> 00:02:34,370
you have to have a career and
you have to be goal oriented.

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,870
You have to be aimed towards things.

58
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:38,210
And so since you have to be goal oriented,

59
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,470
how can it be other than that,

60
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,180
you would use language instrumental.
