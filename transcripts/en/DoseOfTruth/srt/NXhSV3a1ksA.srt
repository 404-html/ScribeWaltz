1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,011
Sorry,

2
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:08,570
it's taken me just a little while too.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:10,673
Good.

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:11,750
Someone says,

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,181
well,

6
00:00:13,181 --> 00:00:13,450
I'll,

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:13,780
I'll,

8
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,100
I'll like go for that.

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,433
Let's see.

10
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,933
Um,

11
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,121
hi Jordan.

12
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:21,370
What are feelings and why do we have the,

13
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,253
well,

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,450
here's a way of thinking about it.

15
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,550
So look,

16
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,530
let's say you were walking down a pathway.

17
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,970
I actually saw this happen one day,

18
00:00:30,971 --> 00:00:31,930
so I'll tell you this story.

19
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:35,110
So I was walking along the cliffs near,

20
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,880
I think it was San Diego or la,

21
00:00:36,881 --> 00:00:37,714
I don't remember.

22
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,600
I think probably,

23
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,673
I think it was,

24
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,150
I think it was San Diego.

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:43,991
Anyways,

26
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:46,490
I was walking along there
with some friends and uh,

27
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,890
and a brother of a friend of mine who's
quite a toll guys about six foot five,

28
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:51,641
something like that.

29
00:00:51,641 --> 00:00:54,130
And he was walking along the
path on the edge of the cliff,

30
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:55,570
kind of sandy and with,

31
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,380
with scrub pine around
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.

32
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:00,431
And uh,

33
00:01:00,431 --> 00:01:01,750
it was march I think.

34
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,280
So it was warm but not too warm.

35
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,750
We were walking along and all of a sudden
his little girl who I think was like

36
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:08,584
four or five,

37
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,950
I said she was walking in front of him.

38
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,310
And in front of me and I guess we are
going round a little bit of a corner and

39
00:01:15,311 --> 00:01:18,490
all of a sudden she jumped
right up on his shoulders,

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,620
which I'd never seen a child do that.

41
00:01:20,621 --> 00:01:21,454
It was like watching,

42
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:21,820
you know,

43
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,240
if you,

44
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,450
if a cat's sleep and you
and you and you go out it,

45
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:29,830
it'll like jump up and puff out
its hair and can jump straight up.

46
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,060
Well that's what this kid did.

47
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:33,760
And there was a rattlesnake
at the side of the,

48
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,871
of the path.

49
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:35,890
Now it was cold,

50
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,390
which was probably good.

51
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:38,830
But you know,

52
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,240
there's a guy named uh,

53
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,960
yeah,

54
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,220
oh I can't read.

55
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,780
He wrote a great book on fear.

56
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:46,921
It'll come to me,

57
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:47,551
it'll come to me.

58
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,680
It's a book that I should
have on my book list actually.

59
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:55,010
And he showed that there
are circuits in your brain.

60
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,120
They're reflex circuits.

61
00:01:57,121 --> 00:02:00,210
So this has been demonstrated to
some degree much earlier that map.

62
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,880
So imagine that a snake is a pattern.

63
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:06,420
And then imagine that there's a pattern
on your retina that constitutes the

64
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:06,841
snake.

65
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:10,620
And then imagine that that can be
transformed into another pattern,

66
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,600
which is a muscular output pattern.

67
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,140
And that muscular output pattern
is to jump you in the air.

68
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:18,780
So your eyes make your,

69
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,570
your make your muscles
move in a particular way.

70
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:26,430
And that happens before you see
the snake and before you're afraid.

71
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,080
And the reason for that is that,

72
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,670
so it's there not many neural connections
between snake detection and leaping in

73
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:33,504
the air.

74
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,340
And that's because if you waited to
feel fear and waited to see the snake,

75
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,340
that would take between a
quarter and half a second,

76
00:02:41,341 --> 00:02:44,490
something like that and the snake
would have already bitten you.

77
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:49,290
So unless you had those really short
neuropathways that have been conserved in

78
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:52,260
the evolutionary process since
like the beginning of time,

79
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,800
anything super fast and simple
would be able to kill you.

80
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:57,690
So now,

81
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,030
so let's say that you do
encounter something unexpected.

82
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,080
Oh first you have these bodily
reflexes that are really fast.

83
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:08,200
And then the next thing that happens
generally speaking is that you feel an

84
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:08,681
emotion.

85
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:10,150
Like maybe you're frozen.

86
00:03:10,151 --> 00:03:12,700
So if you hear a real growl behind you,

87
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,331
you'll freeze.

88
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,670
And then you'll feel fear
and that'll keep you frozen.

89
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,610
And so the,

90
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:18,371
the fear is,

91
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:18,880
uh,

92
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,820
an indication of that physiological state.

93
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:25,870
And then only after that will you
start to think and strategize.

94
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,870
And so you need reactions at multiple
levels of temporal resolution in order to

95
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,220
keep you safe in the world.

96
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:35,800
And the fast reactions are
muscular and reflexive.

97
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:36,760
And then the next ones,

98
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:40,690
generally speaking or something like
emotions and they're low resolution,

99
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:41,524
but quick,

100
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:41,861
you know,

101
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:43,090
like if you're afraid,

102
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:45,610
it means there's something
that may be dangerous.

103
00:03:45,611 --> 00:03:46,444
It's vague.

104
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,870
And it's not until you explore it that
you know exactly what the danger is.

105
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:52,480
But the fear is a good
enough initial category.

106
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:57,490
So you could think about feelings
as instinctual categories,

107
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,540
things to love,

108
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,590
things to eat,

109
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,120
things to run away from,

110
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,600
things to run towards their
low resolution categories.

111
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,120
And that's how animals
categorize the world.

112
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,640
They use emotion and motivation
to categorize the world.

113
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,500
So we have them to keep ourselves properly
oriented in the world and to react

114
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,540
quickly and so that we can stay alive.
