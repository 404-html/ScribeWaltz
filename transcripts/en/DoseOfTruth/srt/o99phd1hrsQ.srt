1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,113
First of all,

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:13,980
you unite your mind,

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:14,671
you're thinking,

4
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,080
let's say with your emotions.

5
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:19,620
So that makes one thing
instead of two fighting things.

6
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:20,970
Okay,

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,803
that's a good one.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,400
And then the next conjunction he talked
about was it isn't enough to unite your

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,380
mind and your emotions.

10
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:31,380
And he thought about that as a
male female pairing symbolically.

11
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:33,960
That's how it would manifest
itself sometimes in dreams.

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,650
So you take the masculine
element and the feminine element,

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:41,340
the the thinking and
the emotion unite those.

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,200
And that makes you more like one thing.

15
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:43,441
Okay.

16
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:46,050
And now all of a sudden that's
represented as symbolically mail.

17
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:49,350
That one thing and it unites with
something else that's now represented

18
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:49,891
symbolically,

19
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:50,910
seven female,

20
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,990
that's the body.

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,820
So you take the mind,

22
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:57,180
emotion integration and
integrate that in your body.

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,140
So what does that mean?

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,320
You act it out instead of just thinking.

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,050
So there's this
philosophical idea called a,

26
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,280
now I'm going to forget what it's called.

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,320
It's a contradiction in action.

28
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,970
There's actually a technical term for it,

29
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,830
but that's when you think
and believe something,

30
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:14,340
but you're,

31
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,390
but you don't act it out.

32
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,370
And so that means there is a dissociation
in you somehow between your abstract

33
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:24,130
representations and what
you manifest in action.

34
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:27,810
While that's another form of discontinuity
that isn't doing you any good.

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,830
You know the driver's going one way and
the cars going the other and you won't

36
00:01:31,831 --> 00:01:34,410
even be able to understand
yourself if you do that.

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,431
But even more,

38
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:38,770
you're not putting your principles
into practice so you're disassociated.

39
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,470
You're being is dissociated.

40
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:43,710
So once you get your mind and
your emotions working together,

41
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:46,410
then the next thing to do is
to act that out consistently.

42
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,740
So that was the second conjunction
as far as young was concerned.

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,180
And then the third one was,

44
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,510
this is the tough one and this is the
one that's related to phenomenology.

45
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,800
You erase the distinction
between yourself and the world.

46
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,043
Okay,

47
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,400
that's a tough one.

48
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,860
So imagine you're dealing
with someone who's hoarding.

49
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:05,941
Now,

50
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:10,230
people who are hoarding are often older
or neurologically damaged or they have

51
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,700
obsessive compulsive disorder.

52
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,720
But then you walk into their house and
there's like 10,000 things in their

53
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,021
house.

54
00:02:16,021 --> 00:02:16,680
There's,

55
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,230
there's,

56
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:17,640
there's,

57
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,970
there's maybe a hundred boxes and you
open up a box and in the box there's some

58
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:25,971
pens and some old passports and some
checks and their collection of silver

59
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:29,580
dollars and some hypodermic
needles and some Dustin,

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,001
you know,

61
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,170
a dead mouse and,

62
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:31,891
and,

63
00:02:31,891 --> 00:02:35,820
and there's boxes and boxes and
boxes is like that in the house.

64
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:38,970
It's absolute chaos in
their absolute chaos,

65
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,350
not ordered chaos.

66
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,860
And then you think is that
their houses that they're being,

67
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,610
is that their mind and answer
is there's no difference.

68
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,990
There's no difference.

69
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,651
So,

70
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:49,921
you know,

71
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,431
I could say,

72
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:50,611
well,

73
00:02:50,611 --> 00:02:52,440
if you want to organize your psyche,

74
00:02:52,441 --> 00:02:55,440
you could start by organizing your
room if they've thought would be easier

75
00:02:55,441 --> 00:02:58,620
because maybe you're a more concrete
person and you need something concrete to

76
00:02:58,621 --> 00:02:59,410
do.

77
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:03,070
So you go clean up under your bed and
you make your bed and you organize the

78
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:04,570
papers on your desk and you think,

79
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:04,900
well,

80
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,970
just exactly what are you organizing?

81
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:10,630
Are you organizing the objective
world or are you objecting your field?

82
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,580
Are you organizing your field of being
like your field of total experience?

83
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,470
And young believed that.

84
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,770
And I think that there's a Buddhist
doctrine that sort of nested in there that

85
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,620
at the highest level of
psychological integration,

86
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,310
there's no difference between
you and what you experience.

87
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,601
Now you think,

88
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:29,380
well,

89
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,300
I can't control everything I experienced,

90
00:03:31,301 --> 00:03:34,590
but that's no objection because
you can't control yourself anyway.

91
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,920
So the mere fact that you can't extend
control over everything you experience is

92
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:43,060
no argument against the idea that you
should still treat that as an extension of

93
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:43,894
yourself.

94
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,441
So you can say,

95
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:44,561
well,

96
00:03:44,561 --> 00:03:49,561
let's say you have a long standing
feud with your brother while sat a

97
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:51,370
psychological problem.

98
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,241
Is that him?

99
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,860
Is it a problem in the objective world?

100
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:54,360
Or is,

101
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,770
is it a problem in your field of being?

102
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,370
And it's very useful to think
that way because you might ask,

103
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,680
what could you do to improve yourself?

104
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,560
Well,

105
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,320
let's step one step backwards.

106
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,550
The first question might be,

107
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:08,980
why should you even
bother improving yourself?

108
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:11,710
And I think the answer to
that is something like,

109
00:04:11,711 --> 00:04:15,100
so you don't suffer any more
stupidly than you have to.

110
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,500
And maybe so others don't have to either.

111
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:18,640
It's something like that,

112
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:18,941
you know,

113
00:04:18,941 --> 00:04:20,980
like there's a real injunction
at the bottom of it.

114
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,590
It's not some casual self-help doctrine.

115
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:26,770
It's that if you don't
organize yourself properly,

116
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,260
you'll pay for it and in a big way.

117
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,260
And so will the people around
you now and you could say,

118
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:33,460
well I don't care about that,

119
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,690
but that's actually not true.

120
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,330
You actually do care about
that because if you're in pain,

121
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:38,740
you will care about it.

122
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,630
And so you do care about it.

123
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,520
Even if it's just that negative way,

124
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:43,354
you know,

125
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,560
it's very rare that you can find someone
who's in excruciating pain who would

126
00:04:47,561 --> 00:04:48,394
ever say,

127
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:49,421
well,

128
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:54,100
it would be no better if I was out of
this sort of pain is one of those things

129
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,960
that brings the idea that it would be
better if it didn't exist along with it.

130
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:04,050
It's in controvertible so you get your
act together so that there isn't any more

131
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,460
stupid pain around you than necessary.

132
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:06,941
We'll,

133
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:08,080
so then the question might be,

134
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:10,150
well how would you go about
getting your act together?

135
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:11,230
And the answer to that.

136
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,360
And this is a phenomenological idea too,

137
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:18,250
it's something like look around for
something that bothers you and see if you

138
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:19,084
can fix it.

139
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,250
So now you think,

140
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:23,500
well let's say there,

141
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:24,640
let's say you go into,

142
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,500
you can do this in a room.

143
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:29,470
It's quite fun to do it just when
you're sitting in a room like a room,

144
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,370
maybe your bedroom,

145
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:32,710
you can sit there and just sort
of meditate on it and think,

146
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:33,280
okay,

147
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,330
if I wanted to spend 10 minutes
making this room better,

148
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,070
what would I have to do?

149
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:40,540
And you have to ask yourself that,

150
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:40,751
right?

151
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:41,650
It's not a command.

152
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:45,280
It's like our genuine question and things
will pop out in the room that you know

153
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:48,520
you like there's a stack of papers over
there that's kind of bugging you and you

154
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:51,850
know that maybe little order there
would be a good thing and you know,

155
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,684
you haven't,

156
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,560
there's some rubbish behind your computer
monitor that you haven't attended to

157
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:57,590
for like six months.

158
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,040
And the room would be slightly better
if it was a little less dusty and the

159
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,990
cables weren't all
tangled up the same way.

160
00:06:02,991 --> 00:06:04,430
And like if you,

161
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,550
if you allow yourself just to consider
the expanse in which you exist at that

162
00:06:11,001 --> 00:06:11,630
moment,

163
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:15,350
there'll be all sorts of things that'll
pop out in it that you could just fix.

164
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,851
And you know,

165
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:17,331
I might say,

166
00:06:17,331 --> 00:06:17,511
well,

167
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,910
if you were coming to
see me for psychotherapy,

168
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,780
this smell,

169
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,260
easiest thing for us to do first would
just be to get you to organize your room.

170
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,041
You think,

171
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,221
well,

172
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:26,420
is that psychotherapy?

173
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,441
And the answer is,

174
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:27,741
well,

175
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:31,460
it depends on how you conceive
the limits of your being.

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,840
And I would say start where you can start.

177
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,660
You know,

178
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:36,890
if,

179
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,320
if something announces itself to you,

180
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,150
which is a strange way
of thinking about it,

181
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,570
as in need of repair
that you could repair,

182
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,800
then hey,

183
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:46,963
fix it.

184
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:48,830
You fix a hundred things like that.

185
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:50,990
Your life will be a lot different.

186
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,311
Now,

187
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:56,570
I often tell people to fix the things
you repeat every day because people tend

188
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:57,860
to think of those as trivial,

189
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,023
right?

190
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,930
You get up,

191
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:00,860
you brush your teeth,

192
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,210
you have your breakfast,

193
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:02,511
you know,

194
00:07:02,511 --> 00:07:04,820
you have your routines that
you go through every day.

195
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,400
Well though,

196
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,630
those probably constitute
50% of your life.

197
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:09,651
And people think,

198
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:09,801
well,

199
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:10,461
they're mundane,

200
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:11,720
I don't need to pay attention to them.

201
00:07:11,721 --> 00:07:12,051
It's like,

202
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:12,201
no,

203
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:12,381
no,

204
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,370
that's exactly wrong.

205
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,870
The things you do every day,

206
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,590
those are the most important
things you do hands down.

207
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:20,090
All you have to do is do the arithmetic.

208
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,830
You figure it out right away.

209
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:27,040
So a hundred adjustments to your broader
domain of being and there's a lot less

210
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,380
rubbish and there's a lot
less rubbish around it,

211
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,640
a lot fewer traps for you to step into.

212
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,360
And so that's in keeping with
Ewing's idea about erasing the dis.

213
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:43,310
Once you've got your mind
and your emotions together,

214
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,020
and once you're acting that out,

215
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:50,350
then you can extend what you're willing
to consider yourself and start fixing up

216
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:54,440
the things that are part
of your broader extent.

217
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,150
Now sometimes you don't
know how to do that.

218
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:57,020
So you might say,

219
00:07:57,021 --> 00:08:00,620
imagine you're walking down Bloor
street and there's this guy who's like

220
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:03,410
alcoholic and schizophrenia and has
been on the streets for 10 years.

221
00:08:03,411 --> 00:08:05,600
He sorta stumbled
towards you and you know,

222
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,310
incoherently mutters something.

223
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,900
That's a problem.

224
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,990
And it would be good if you could fix it,

225
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,300
but you haven't got a clue
about how to fix that.

226
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:18,680
You just walk around that and go
find something that you could fix.

227
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:20,210
Because if you muck about in that,

228
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,940
not only is it unlikely that
you'll help that person,

229
00:08:22,941 --> 00:08:25,250
it's very likely that
you'll get hurt yourself.

230
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,391
So you know,

231
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:29,840
just because while you're
experiencing things,

232
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,540
announced themselves as in need of repair,

233
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,080
doesn't mean that it's you right that
in there that should repair them.

234
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,790
You have to have some humility.

235
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,630
You know,

236
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,750
you don't walk up to a helicopter that
isn't working and just start tinkering

237
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:42,584
away with it.

238
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,000
You,

239
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,170
you have to stay within
your domain of competence.

240
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:46,220
But most of the time,

241
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,900
if people look at their lives,

242
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:49,303
you know,

243
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,470
it's very interesting thing to do.

244
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,311
I liked the,

245
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:56,010
I liked the idea of the room because
you can do that at the drop of a hat.

246
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,351
You know,

247
00:08:56,351 --> 00:08:58,350
we'd go back to where you
live and sit down and think,

248
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,184
okay,

249
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,830
I'm gonna make this place
better for half an hour.

250
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:02,790
What should I do?

251
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,530
It you have to ask.

252
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,620
And things will just pop up like mad.

253
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:10,500
And it's partly because your
mind is a very strange thing.

254
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,790
As soon as you give it a name,

255
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,410
a genuine aim,

256
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,440
it'll reconfigure the world
in keeping with that aim,

257
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,870
that that's actually how
you see to begin with.

258
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,970
And so if you said it a task,

259
00:09:20,971 --> 00:09:22,830
especially if you have
to be genuine about it,

260
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:26,730
which is why you have to bring your
thoughts and emotions together,

261
00:09:26,731 --> 00:09:28,350
and then you have to
get them into your body.

262
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,820
So you're acting consistently,

263
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,980
you have to be genuine about the aim.

264
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,210
But once you aim,

265
00:09:33,211 --> 00:09:36,510
the world will reconfigure
itself around that aim,

266
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,830
which is very strange.

267
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:38,401
And,

268
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:39,570
and it's,

269
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,020
it's,

270
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:41,880
it's technically true.
