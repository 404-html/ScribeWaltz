1
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,650
What happens in the shop manic

2
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,150
experiences that Scherman has the
experience of being reduced to a skeleton

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,493
first.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,150
So death,

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,030
a death experience on very
realistic death experience.

6
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:28,990
And then the next thing that happens is
that he finds himself in a place where

7
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:30,810
he's communing with his ancestor,

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,320
the ancestral spirits.

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:37,690
And then after that there's the
climbing of something like the ladder,

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,980
Jacob's ladder say,

11
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,480
and an encounter with God
for all intents and purposes.

12
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,003
And uh,

13
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,900
it's very widespread,

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,873
um,

15
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:49,383
phenomena.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,670
It's the world tree.

17
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:52,071
And I,

18
00:00:52,071 --> 00:00:53,140
I've thought about this a lot,

19
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:54,160
trying to figure out what this,

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,703
yeah.

21
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,720
What this represents.

22
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,290
According to a Yakut informant,

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,380
that that's in Siberia,

24
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,080
the spirits carry the future showmen to
hell and shut them in a house for three

25
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:03,750
years.

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,450
Here he undergoes is initiation.

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,890
The spirits cut off his head,

28
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,270
which they set off to one side for the
novice must watch his own dismemberment

29
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,140
with his own eyes,

30
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,350
dissolution to the primary
elements in some sense,

31
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,740
and hack his body to bits which are
later distributed among the spirits of

32
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:19,760
various sicknesses.

33
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:22,910
It's only on this condition that
the future Sharman will obtain.

34
00:01:22,911 --> 00:01:26,120
The power of healing is bones then
covered with new flash in his,

35
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:28,340
some Casey has also given new blood,

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,570
so visit death and resurrection experience
that's associated with this show.

37
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:32,404
Monique ritual.

38
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,330
We're here in the presence
of a very ancient religious
idea which belongs to the

39
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:41,230
hunter culture.

40
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,140
Bone symbolizes the final
route of animal life.

41
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:46,810
The mold from which the
flesh continually raw rises.

42
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,110
It is from the bone that men and
animals are reborn for a time.

43
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:52,570
They maintain themselves in
an existence of the flesh.

44
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,960
Then they die and their life is reduced
to the essence concentrated in the

45
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:58,150
skeleton from which
they will be born again.

46
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,290
That's a good graphic
representation of the experience.
