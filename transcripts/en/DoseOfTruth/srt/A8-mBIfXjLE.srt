1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,350
Can you talk about your own specific
experiences slash methods used with

2
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:12,550
integrating the shadow?

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,530
Yeah.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:17,020
Well I can actually,

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,870
I think a tremendous amount of what
you might regard as shadow integration,

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,110
which in the parlance of behavioral
psychologists would be something like

7
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:31,380
assertiveness training,

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:31,920
right?

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,280
It's training and how to stand
up for yourself and for your,

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,290
let's say for your better self,

11
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:42,291
which would be the self that you could
use productively over a medium to long

12
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,060
period of time that
would be of use to you,

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,980
but also views to people around you.

14
00:00:46,981 --> 00:00:51,981
So it's a self that's owned by the
necessity of taking care of yourself,

15
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:55,440
but also simultaneously taking
care of the people around you.

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,933
MMM.

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:04,910
I think that the simplest way to start
that work is to consult your resentment.

18
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,800
You know,

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:12,800
it's easy to become bitter about life and
to become angry because of course life

20
00:01:13,561 --> 00:01:16,410
is difficult and it's full
of disappointments and

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,600
people are also subject to be trail on
the part of themselves and on the part of

22
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,310
people that hypothetically care for them.

23
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:28,311
And so it's easy to get bitter and to
be resentful and resentment is a very

24
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,620
useful emotion even though I
think it's one of the most,

25
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:32,850
uh,

26
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,910
damaging emotions if it's
not dealt with properly.

27
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:40,710
So if you're resentful basically
means only one of two things,

28
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:44,940
it either means you should grow up and
quit whining and get on with your life.

29
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:50,210
Or it means that you're being subject
to tyrannical forces of one form or

30
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,920
another maybe emanating from you.

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,140
Maybe a consequence of
the natural environment,

32
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,790
maybe a consequence of society.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You're being subjected to radical forces
and you're not putting your own best

34
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,890
interests forward.

35
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,110
Like in that broader
sense that I described.

36
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:08,790
And I don't mean you're selfish,

37
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:13,791
narrow interests that only serve the
purposes of instantaneous gratification.

38
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,850
I mean your own best interest in terms
of developing your character over the

39
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:18,840
span of your life.

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,820
If you're resentful,

41
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,780
it either means that you're immature
and that you should grow the hell up.

42
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,620
And so you need to figure out
how much of your resentment is,

43
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:28,330
is,

44
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,000
is that,

45
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,690
and maybe the allied with the desire to
find other things or people to blame.

46
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:39,140
But the other possible option is
that you have something to say or do,

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:39,901
right?

48
00:02:39,901 --> 00:02:44,901
Because you're in a situation where
you're violating your own internal ethical

49
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:48,750
standards and you're
being required pressure,

50
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,650
let's say to say things you don't believe
or to do things that you believe to be

51
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:56,250
wrong and you need to determine,

52
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,910
you need to start to strategize and plan
how can rectify that so that you can

53
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:01,840
say what you mean.

54
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,420
Like if you're negotiating with
a marital partner for example,

55
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:08,980
and there are issues in your marriage
that aren't making you happy.

56
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,500
While the first thing is you
have to take note of that,

57
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:11,711
right?

58
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:13,390
To see that you're actually unhappy.

59
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,170
Uh,

60
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,560
the second is that you have to be
willing to engage in a certain amount of

61
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:21,130
conflict because in order to
sort out what's disturbing you,

62
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,150
you're going to have to allay your
concerns out on the table and say,

63
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:25,571
well look,

64
00:03:25,571 --> 00:03:26,440
this is bothering me.

65
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:27,131
You don't have to say,

66
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:27,610
well,

67
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,700
I'm right and you're wrong
and you have to fix this.

68
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:31,331
You have to say,

69
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:31,750
well,

70
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,730
I've noticed that this

71
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,230
pattern of interaction or
lack of interactions say in
our relationship is making

72
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:42,640
me resentful and angry,

73
00:03:42,641 --> 00:03:43,750
and the danger of that,

74
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:44,111
of course,

75
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,360
as you're going to take it out
on yourself and your partner,

76
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,040
the Dangerous Passion,

77
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,450
passive aggressiveness,

78
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,021
you know,

79
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,780
you're not going to respond to your
partner positively when they do something

80
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,021
good,

81
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:56,890
if you're resentful about them and
you're not going to respond to yourself

82
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,351
properly,

83
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:58,690
and so you have to lay
it out on the table,

84
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:00,840
but sort of in a spirit of ignorance,

85
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:01,674
humility,

86
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:01,991
it's like,

87
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:02,800
look,

88
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,730
I'm frustrated.

89
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,370
I'm feeling this way
about our relationship.

90
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,860
Here's what I think might be going wrong,

91
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,660
maybe on my part and maybe on your part
and here's what I envision as a possible

92
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:14,410
solution.

93
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,970
That's also really necessary.

94
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,970
If you're going to say
what you have to say,

95
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,280
which is to manifest yourself
properly in the world,

96
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:24,250
is you can't just complain
about what's wrong.

97
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,360
You have to think,

98
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:25,511
well,

99
00:04:25,511 --> 00:04:28,930
what would my minimal
preconditions for satisfaction B,

100
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,140
you have to offer that to the
person that you're negotiating with.

101
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,800
And so then you learn to abide by the
truth to the degree that you can do that

102
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,730
and no one does it perfectly,

103
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,780
you know?

104
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,850
But it,

105
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,090
it's very useful because you're not
storing up a whole sequence of memories

106
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:53,170
about how you were unfairly
treated and abused and betrayed.

107
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:54,071
Instead,

108
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:57,670
you're trying to stay on top of it
and to note your unhappiness and

109
00:04:57,671 --> 00:05:02,671
dissatisfaction when it manifests itself
and to accept that that's the case.

110
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,770
And then to analyze that to
see if it's your problem.

111
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:06,431
Like I said,

112
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:11,431
with regards to maturity or if it
indicates that there's an injustice in the

113
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:16,390
manner in which you and the world are
interacting and then to work to set that

114
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,920
right even in small ways.

115
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,140
And so it's,

116
00:05:19,141 --> 00:05:20,350
it's a matter of character,

117
00:05:20,351 --> 00:05:22,210
logical development and that makes you,

118
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,450
that makes you stronger over time.

119
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,250
And partly what you need,

120
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:27,461
you know,

121
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,800
in order to do that is you
have to really understand,

122
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:31,000
and we do this,

123
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,520
this is why we built in the
future authoring program.

124
00:05:33,521 --> 00:05:37,660
We built the section where you have
to outline your most dismal future,

125
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:37,961
right?

126
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:41,300
What your future would be like if you
let all your bad habits and character,

127
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,480
logical weaknesses have the upper hand.

128
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:48,700
And the reason we did this
is because you can't be a,

129
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,630
you can't straighten yourself out
merely as a consequence of hope.

130
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,810
Let's say you lay out a vision for the
future and you think about what your life

131
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,644
would be,

132
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,280
what you'd like your life to be like,

133
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,100
and then that makes you hopeful and
it motivates you because it gives you

134
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:04,280
something worthwhile and
higher order to work for.

135
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,300
Right?

136
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,111
And that's useful.

137
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:10,070
That's positive emotion working for you
because positive emotion is experienced

138
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,180
in relationship to goals,

139
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,800
but it's not as not as useful as also
being chased by something you're terrified

140
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:16,634
by.

141
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,110
And if you have a good sense of how you'd
fall apart if you stayed week and just

142
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,240
exactly what kind of hell that would be.

143
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:27,920
Then when you determined to do something
like to tell the truth and to say what

144
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:30,380
you think and to not do
things that you hate,

145
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,330
then you're going to be pulled along
by the purpose that your vision has

146
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:36,141
provided for you,

147
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:40,760
but also pushed along by your desire
to avoid the worst forms of hell that

148
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:42,920
you've already outlined
for yourself personally.

149
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,440
And that can also help you be brave
enough to stand up in a situation that we

150
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,820
would require a conflict.

151
00:06:49,821 --> 00:06:54,821
Because if you have something to say and
you have something to negotiate about

152
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:55,964
with someone,

153
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,800
then there's going to be a certain
amount of conflictual dialogue that

154
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,980
accompanies that right it to lay out a
set of problems and to describe the fact

155
00:07:06,951 --> 00:07:10,880
forthrightly that those
problems characterize a
relationship and then to seek

156
00:07:10,881 --> 00:07:15,800
for solutions is quite stressful in
the short term and it's really easy to

157
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:16,221
avoid.

158
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:20,810
And so people avoided all the time and
then they store up grievances across the

159
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,100
span of the relationships and eventually
the grievances mount to the point where

160
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:28,730
they return in monstrous form
and just eat everything up.

161
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,540
That's where you get divorces or that's
where you explode at your boss and ended

162
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,250
up fired or that's where you,

163
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:34,850
you know,

164
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,690
you develop high blood pressure over
15 years because he can't stand all the

165
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:39,524
accumulated,

166
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:40,610
uh,

167
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,090
uh,

168
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,980
Monse all the accumulated monsters in
your closet and then you drink yourself

169
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:48,230
into oblivion because he
can't stand your life.

170
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,483
That's all,

171
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,361
you know,

172
00:07:50,361 --> 00:07:51,620
very counterproductive.

173
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,270
But it's easy to avoid that necessary
conflict on a moment to moment basis

174
00:07:56,271 --> 00:08:01,271
because it's very stressful to speak
forthrightly about genuine conflicts.

175
00:08:01,551 --> 00:08:04,040
Especially when you're dealing
with important parts of your life,

176
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,170
but otherwise you don't
straighten them out.

177
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,970
And then you have to
carry all that forward.

178
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,590
So you need to be terrified of the
consequences of not speaking your piece.

179
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,790
And that can counterbalance the
terror of actually trying to have a

180
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,630
conversation.

181
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,590
So.
