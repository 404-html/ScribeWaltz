1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,280
Now.
So let's take a look at the stories and

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,790
let's take a look at the leading
figures.

3
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:10,870
So we know,
for example,

4
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:14,500
that the figure of Satan and
Christianity is associated with a number

5
00:00:14,501 --> 00:00:15,940
of strange forms,
right?

6
00:00:15,941 --> 00:00:20,260
The first association we know of is that
he's associated with the,

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,100
with the dragon and in the garden of
Eden,

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,330
right?
So there's a,

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,600
and so that there's a profound
ambivalence and Christianity about the

10
00:00:28,601 --> 00:00:32,110
meaning of the opening act of genesis.
Because on the one hand you have,

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:34,660
when Adam and eve are still profoundly
unconscious,

12
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:38,590
they don't suffer,
but they're profoundly unconscious,

13
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:39,820
right?
They're not self conscious,

14
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,610
they're not aware of themselves.
So in many ways there's still animals.

15
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,820
So there's a gnostic line of
speculation.

16
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,890
The gnostics were a Christian sect that
believed that a redemption could at

17
00:00:50,891 --> 00:00:54,640
least partly be attained by
understanding rather than just faith.

18
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,020
The gnostics believed that the,
the serpent that tempted Adam and eve

19
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:04,021
towards self consciousness was a more
developed aspect of God than the God

20
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:06,130
that had created Adam and Eve to begin
with.

21
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:09,790
Because the unconsciousness that
characterized Adam and eve was to

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,690
underdeveloped to be perfect.
And so they had to be tempted forward

23
00:01:13,691 --> 00:01:15,760
into a more fully developed
consciousness.

24
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:20,170
And so although classical Christianity
associated the serpent in the tree with

25
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:21,790
Lucifer,
who's the bringer of light,

26
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:25,810
who Satan,
the gnostic thread of reasoning said,

27
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:26,441
well,
wait a minute.

28
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:29,650
It's not that simple because yeah,
selfconsciousness makes you aware of

29
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:33,220
death and vulnerability and,
and knocks you out into the profane

30
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,780
world.
But there's an aspect of it,

31
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:38,080
the kind of looks like enlightenment.
And you know this already in your own

32
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:42,070
lives because often when you believe
something and you're unconsciously

33
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:45,940
convinced of the adequacy of that model,
and then you find that it's not

34
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,020
sufficient,
right?

35
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,890
And so you crumble in disappointment,
you put your trust in someone and you

36
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:53,380
find out,
say they're not worthy of that trust.

37
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:57,250
And that,
that the evidence that enlightens you

38
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:00,040
breaks that frame of reference and makes
you collapse.

39
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:04,000
You think that's a terrible thing.
You can't help but feel that as a real

40
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:07,360
betrayal and as an act even of evil.
But then a year later,

41
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:09,040
two years later,
you might look back and think,

42
00:02:09,041 --> 00:02:09,850
God,
you know,

43
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,420
I really needed that.
I really needed that lesson because as a

44
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:17,260
consequence of learning that I'm much
more mature and much more likely to

45
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:21,850
establish stable relationships.
And so it's easy to see that from one

46
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:24,280
perspective,
something can be terrible and then from

47
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:26,410
another,
it might not be terrible at all.

48
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,040
And even in classic Christianity,
you get this strange ambivalence about

49
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:33,010
the events in genesis that runs
something like this.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,511
Well,
yes,

51
00:02:34,511 --> 00:02:37,810
it was an act of the,
of the most evil spirit,

52
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,450
the spirit of enlightenment,
the spirit of rationality,

53
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,840
or the bringer of light,
Lucifer to knock Adam and eve out of

54
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:47,500
their transcendental unconsciousness and
to start history,

55
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,620
it was an evil act,
but on the other hand,

56
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,670
it was also the precondition for the
later emergence of Christ.

57
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,350
And as far as the Christians are
concerned,

58
00:02:56,351 --> 00:03:00,490
that's the greatest event in history.
So without this initial opening act,

59
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:01,960
right,
this tragic opening act,

60
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,220
there'd be no reason for the whole
redemptive story and therefore

61
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,250
considered from the perspective of the
total story.

62
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,810
The opening tragedy cannot purely be
considered evil.

63
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,440
Very,
very complicated line of reasoning.

64
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,750
Now,
the other thing you see here,

65
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,040
and I think this relates back to our
initial map is,

66
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,980
and this also helps you understand the
way people think.

67
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,981
Now I said already that it's real easy
to confuse tragedy and evil,

68
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,740
right?

69
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,840
Okay.
So what that means is that it's real

70
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:39,280
easy to confuse the negative aspect of
the unknown with evil and likewise it's

71
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,340
very easy to confuse the negative aspect
of culture with evil,

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,640
your own culture,
the tear radical aspect of it or the

73
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:48,340
culture of other people.
So it's very easy for,

74
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:51,130
for example,
for us to demonize the foreigner and

75
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:55,330
that's basically because there's a part
of our mind that presumes that all

76
00:03:55,331 --> 00:03:59,440
things that strike us negatively,
all things that produce negative emotion

77
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:02,620
on our part,
like fear are the same thing.

78
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:08,010
So there's a a blurry category of evil
that's all terrible natural things,

79
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:11,950
all terrible social things.
And then whatever nastiness the

80
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:14,890
individual can generate among
themselves,

81
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,040
it's much more useful to draw a clear
distinction between these different

82
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:25,750
categories because that clarity of
thought can help you,

83
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,210
can help you focus in most specifically
on those things that the individual is

84
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:34,840
responsible for in terms of turning the
world to waste.

85
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,640
So Milton says this figure of Satan,
Lucifer,

86
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,400
the,
the light bringer always associated with

87
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:45,310
rationality.
Milton presents him as a remarkable

88
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:46,031
creature,
right?

89
00:04:46,031 --> 00:04:49,720
He's the head highest angel in God's
heavenly hierarchy.

90
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,820
He's Christ elder brother in,
uh,

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:56,350
in a similar mythological vein.
He's the most powerful angel that ever

92
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:58,930
lived.
So at least in the opening stages of

93
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,330
this act,
Satan is presented as something

94
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,370
absolutely remarkable.
Now,

95
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,880
the problem is here,
his very remarkable illness starts to

96
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:11,380
work against him.
And what happens is that as he grows in

97
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:15,580
power and strength in this heavenly
hierarchy starts to become convinced

98
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:20,020
that the omniscient himself,
whatever,

99
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:23,350
that transcendent figure is,
is unnecessary.

100
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:28,650
So the idea is that whatever Satan
represents decides because of his own

101
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:32,830
pride,
his own belief in his own sufficiency,

102
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:38,100
that the transcendent can be eradicated
from consideration the way Milton

103
00:05:38,651 --> 00:05:41,560
presents.
That is as a revolution in heaven,

104
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,453
fundamentally.

105
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,600
So imagine that the story is something
like this.

106
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,330
Well,
George Kelley,

107
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:54,331
way back in like 1955 noted that what
human beings like more than anything

108
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:57,960
else really when you get right down to
it is to be right.

109
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,060
Why?
Well,

110
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,650
it's a pain to be wrong,
right?

111
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:04,170
Because if you're wrong,
then the little structure that you're

112
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:09,171
using to conjure up the world has to
dissolve and then you have to do a lot

113
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:13,500
of really aggravating work,
exploratory work and creative work to

114
00:06:13,501 --> 00:06:16,140
put it back together.
And during the time,

115
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:19,620
before you put it back together,
then you're flooded with negative

116
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:20,910
motivational states,
right?

117
00:06:20,911 --> 00:06:23,850
You don't know which way is up,
metaphorically speaking.

118
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:27,090
So we don't like to be,
we don't like not to be.

119
00:06:27,091 --> 00:06:27,720
Right.
And,

120
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,190
and so what does that mean?
Well,

121
00:06:29,191 --> 00:06:33,000
psychologists know that people have a
very strong confirmatory bias,

122
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:36,420
which basically means that if you bring
a frame of reference to bear on the

123
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:39,000
world,
the probability is very high,

124
00:06:39,001 --> 00:06:43,650
that you will look for confirming
evidence and you will discount

125
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:47,640
disconfirming evidence.
Now the other thing that is

126
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,690
characteristic of great figures of evil,
like Satan is their tendency to lie,

127
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,550
right?
So Satan is prince of the lie.

128
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,990
Now what does that mean exactly?

129
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,713
Yeah.

130
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:05,070
So Tsl Eliot wrote this poem called the
cocktail hour.

131
00:07:05,411 --> 00:07:07,660
He talks about this woman goes in for
psychiatric treatment.

132
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,150
The woman says to the psychiatrist,
I'm telling Ya,

133
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,580
I really,
really hope there's something wrong with

134
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:15,040
me because I'm having a miserable time
of it.

135
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,800
And as far as I can tell,
there's only two options here.

136
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,370
Either I'm okay and I'm having a
miserable time because the world is

137
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:24,490
terrible,
in which case there's nothing I can do

138
00:07:24,491 --> 00:07:27,070
about it.
Or there's something wrong with me at

139
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,100
some level of analysis that I don't
really comprehend.

140
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:34,690
And although that's a painful option,
I'm really hoping it's true because if

141
00:07:34,691 --> 00:07:37,810
there's something wrong with me,
possibly I can fix it and if there's

142
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:39,340
something wrong with the structure,
the world,

143
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:41,890
well,
what's there to do about that?

144
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,080
Okay.

145
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,590
Often what you see in psychotherapy is a
battle between those two perspectives

146
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:52,760
going on in the minds of the client that
the client is in a situation where

147
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,300
they're repetitively facing tragedy,
they have a specific viewpoint about the

148
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:00,170
world,
like their viewpoint might be,

149
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,940
well,
when it comes right down to it,

150
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:05,060
you really can't trust other people and
they have all sorts of reasons for

151
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,700
believing that they were abused as
children or they've had a bad

152
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:10,340
developmental history,
a number of relationships that haven't

153
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,770
gone well.
They have all the facts at their

154
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:15,140
disposal to justify that particular
perspective,

155
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:19,130
but the truth of the matter is is that
as long as they hold on to that belief

156
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,860
and won't let it go and and no wonder
they won't,

157
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:25,490
they're going to continue to suffer.
And part of what you're always doing to

158
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:26,720
someone in therapy saying,
you know,

159
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,850
yeah,
you got a pretty coherent view of the

160
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:31,760
world and all that,
and I can understand why you'd like to

161
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,700
cram the whole world into that coherent
perspective.

162
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,580
But the truth of the matter is,
as long as you hold onto that and won't

163
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:38,750
sacrifice it,
right,

164
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,390
we'll go through this terrible period of
disillusion.

165
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:45,950
It's always going to produce the same
tragic consequences.

166
00:08:45,951 --> 00:08:48,380
So as long as you hold onto your belief
rigidly,

167
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,350
everything around you is going to go
from bad to worse.
