1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,470
I knew of this native carver.

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:06,060
He's a Kwakwaka'wakw guy.

3
00:00:06,061 --> 00:00:09,870
He's carved a bunch of wooden sculptures,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,240
totem poles and masks
that I have in my house.

5
00:00:12,241 --> 00:00:14,100
And he's a very interesting person,

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,091
not literate,

7
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:16,320
not particularly literate,

8
00:00:16,321 --> 00:00:20,340
and really still steeped in this
ancient 13,000 year old tradition.

9
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,380
He's an original language speaker.

10
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:22,970
And,

11
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:23,803
um,

12
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,660
the fact that he hasn't literate has sort
of left hand with the mind of someone

13
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:30,420
who's preliterate and
preliterate people aren't stupid,

14
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:31,380
they're just not literate.

15
00:00:31,381 --> 00:00:34,330
So their brains are organized
differently in many ways.

16
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:36,090
And I've asked him about his,

17
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,450
his,

18
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:41,450
his intuition for his carvings
and he's told me that he dreams,

19
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:43,320
like you've seen the Haida masks,

20
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,310
you know what they look like?

21
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:44,970
Well,

22
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:45,970
his people are,

23
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:48,180
are closely related to the Haida,

24
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,950
so it's the same kind of style.

25
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,820
And he said he dreams
in those animals and,

26
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:55,260
and can remember his dreams.

27
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,490
And he also talks to his grandparents
who taught them how to carve in his

28
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,001
dreams.

29
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,220
Quite often if he runs into
a problem with carving,

30
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:03,870
his grandparents will come
and he'll talk to them.

31
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:08,871
But he sees that the creatures that he's
going to carve living in an animated

32
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:11,460
San soon as in his imagination.

33
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,260
And I mean it's not that difficult.

34
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:13,741
First of all,

35
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,060
I have no reason to disbelieve him.

36
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:15,631
He's a very,

37
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:20,631
very straightforward person and he doesn't
have the motivation or the guy all I

38
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:23,100
would say in some sense to
invent a story like that.

39
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,290
There's just no reason that
you would possibly do it.

40
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,540
I don't think he's told
that many people about it.

41
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:28,740
He thinks it's kind of crazy.

42
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:29,270
You know,

43
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,450
he said when he was a kid,

44
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,070
he thought he was insane because he'd
had those dreams all the time about these

45
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,630
creatures and so forth.

46
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,700
And so it wasn't something
he was trumpeting.

47
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,150
But I found it fascinating because I can
see in him part of the manifestation of

48
00:01:44,701 --> 00:01:46,260
this unbroken tradition,

49
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,790
we have no idea how traditions like that
are really passed along for thousands

50
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:50,791
and thousands of years.

51
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:51,240
Right.

52
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,610
Part of it's oral and memory,

53
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,850
part of it's acted out and dramatized
and then part of it's going to be

54
00:01:56,851 --> 00:01:57,780
imaginative.

55
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,520
And people who aren't literate,

56
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:01,650
they store information quite
differently than we do.

57
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:02,760
We don't remember anything.

58
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:04,080
It's all written down in books,

59
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:04,590
right?

60
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,060
But if you're from an oral culture,

61
00:02:06,061 --> 00:02:07,350
especially if you're trained in that way,

62
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:09,630
you have all of that information at hand,

63
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,501
both.

64
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:11,400
So you can speak it,

65
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:14,430
you can tell the stories and you
really know them and you know,

66
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,590
modern people don't really
know what that's like anymore.
