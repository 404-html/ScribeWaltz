1
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,290
Thank

2
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,050
you.

3
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,603
So

4
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,930
for one hour and 15 minutes

5
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,263
of

6
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,020
the last days

7
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,063
I'm

8
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,520
going to use a similar system on his face
and I'm going to serve as a surrogate

9
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,030
less a.

10
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,530
So I'll,

11
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:26,140
I'll,

12
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,620
I'll,

13
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,490
I'll ask them the questions
and you will all line.

14
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:34,630
I'll assign a sliding
door or a l I thought.

15
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,253
Oh

16
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,713
yeah.

17
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,573
Cool.

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,633
Um,

19
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,720
so it is customer and to

20
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,300
us better than him

21
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:04,330
and usually when is being introduced

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,420
to a speed.

23
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,890
Now of course you've
all come there because

24
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,773
I'm.

25
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,120
So I'm going to do a different thing
because I think it has thomas you more

26
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,290
deeply something about what
is going on with his job.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,810
So I'm going to read you a few
things that are wrong about.

28
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,260
So these are actual things
that are often media,

29
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:47,130
character assassination and there has
been one each day just about for a long

30
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,143
time.

31
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:55,990
So is the times if he wants
to force young women marriage,

32
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,160
these people

33
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,830
actually not that bad.

34
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,410
Okay.

35
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:10,993
So,

36
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,060
and that's the reason they say that
they want you to become a grade

37
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,550
level group.

38
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,443
All right.

39
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,063
Of these

40
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,940
conservative reform listing with.

41
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,720
So that's another one,

42
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,623
the directors that

43
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:34,850
I,

44
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:35,683
I,

45
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,350
I'm one of you as well as I go,

46
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,350
a coral is

47
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,061
formed,

48
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:44,110
is preferable

49
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,460
to say he's a scientists.

50
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:03,040
We encourage these young men to see
themselves as he's a mash up of delivers a

51
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,670
Mashup of hits.

52
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:07,840
And my first book of myths,

53
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:15,430
we seems like a terrible therapist is
in fact political and social thinker,

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,670
an angry white guy,

55
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,910
authoritarianism and Richard
Spencer is that system isn't

56
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:28,871
used to do,

57
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:29,800
is chill.

58
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:40,960
He's attached with Mrs.
This is just a small sample

59
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,190
and it's all wrong for have,

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,280
you know,

61
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,240
decided to go home and shield.

62
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,490
It's all wrong

63
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:58,600
and you want every day to miss
informed people about that.

64
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,100
And you can demonstrate
demonstratively false.

65
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,503
I would.

66
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,450
There are some people that see him as a
risk to their agenda and their work with

67
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,170
you for some reason.

68
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,550
That is a reasonable balance,

69
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,400
walter,

70
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,630
with fruitful.

71
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:26,380
And I've never seen such a campaign
against any thing ever in the world.

72
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:27,170
Uh,

73
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,340
not even some of them
is untruthful or ask.

74
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:32,770
This is thing is.

75
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,250
So this tells you something,

76
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,143
this

77
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:43,330
tells you something about this importance
of his message and I'm not gonna,

78
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,250
not gonna theorize about
exactly what that is,

79
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,150
because there are lots of theories
about exactly what it is in what you say

80
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,893
breakfast

81
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,783
and

82
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,883
actually

83
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:08,450
let's just listen to you and you
have to figure out what happened.

84
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:16,310
So please give a warm welcome,

85
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:18,670
not be

86
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,800
thinking the other room

87
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,973
numbers

88
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,020
that there isn't anything more
where your issue is issue,

89
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:38,350
then we're discovering numbers that

90
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,293
power

91
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,813
and

92
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,290
the claim numbers are

93
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,773
reading

94
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,380
to utilize them and your ability
to operate in the world expands

95
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,880
when you use it.

96
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,200
The facilitator use of
operating the world.

97
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:20,570
Interesting lead numbers are abstractions.

98
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,570
And so that raises another question.

99
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,463
Well,

100
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,340
what's more real?

101
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,223
The

102
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,593
yeah,

103
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,500
and maybe the question for me,

104
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:49,500
but it's not obvious that abstractions
aren't real strong on anything else.

105
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,730
And so then you might ask yourself,

106
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,370
well then one of the most real

107
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,360
abstractions

108
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,063
start

109
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,183
tonight.

110
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:06,530
We're going to talk about in
relationship with as many rules as I can.

111
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:11,163
No,

112
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,400
those were the rules.

113
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,234
First

114
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,540
is stand up straight.

115
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,210
Shoulders.

116
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,043
Back

117
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,220
to is treat yourself like
you're someone responsible for

118
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,431
number three,

119
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:30,930
which is very tightly associated with

120
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:32,910
me,

121
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,210
is making friends with those people.

122
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,790
By the way,

123
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:42,810
these rules aren't designed
to make your life easier.

124
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,990
His whole life.

125
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,570
Everything was seeding,

126
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,843
easily

127
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,670
cry out

128
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,523
world

129
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:11,160
as a universal benefactor that we would
strive to do nothing other than to make

130
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,490
life more difficult for

131
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,120
someone to respond to me is the same
as the nice to so it's not associated

132
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,760
with the best

133
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,880
for is you hear yourself yesterday

134
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,730
and that's Johnson.

135
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,773
That's easy.

136
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,963
You need,

137
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:47,110
you need things that are

138
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:50,323
worthwhile,

139
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:54,180
but that is

140
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,153
more.

141
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,490
It is deserved.

142
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,200
We're undeserving manner,

143
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:09,340
so as the target for improvement

144
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:17,110
and the rule of thumb there
is if you dislike them,

145
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,003
that

146
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,920
is a bad idea.

147
00:11:20,921 --> 00:11:25,921
To allow their children to act in a way
that makes other children is like the or

148
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:30,730
adult is like they're going to have to
deal with children and you're going to

149
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,250
have to be so.

150
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:37,370
Your primary responsibility is to how
have your job or not behave so that the

151
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,090
world opens up its arms and well

152
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,350
managed.

153
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:51,680
That it's not a simple thing
to do is protect your house,

154
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:56,681
is the perfect word in world and not
take no action until you have activator.

155
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,620
We use that line,

156
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,790
your ambition and work on what's right
in front of you that you will suffer for

157
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,400
it.

158
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,400
You didn't roll the large scale
transformation of other people.

159
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,230
Seven is meaningful,

160
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:30,110
not scream and rant would say
in some sense some sense that's

161
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:40,590
not telling the truth or
at least necessary junkies
necessary additional because

162
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:47,200
I don't think that you can
pursue what is meaningful,

163
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,750
the truth and the reason for that is
let's say why you corrupt the mechanisms,

164
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,300
mechanisms that

165
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:03,430
manifested itself meaning
and then you can trust them.

166
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:05,770
That's a very bad idea,

167
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:09,730
so the fundamental reasons to not live

168
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,990
and when you grew up in
rely on yourself and if

169
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:23,830
you lie on the absence of rule justin,

170
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,260
but nothing,

171
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:29,123
you be

172
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:32,963
just

173
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:33,833
that was it

174
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,840
than

175
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,740
the person that you're listening to.

176
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Something that's not so much respect
for the person that is a mark of

177
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,000
recognition of your own
unbearable maintenance.

178
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:50,930
Now,

179
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,270
one of the things you have
to do is decide whether

180
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,183
more

181
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,670
you have to make sense

182
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,203
more.

183
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,590
You have to decide what's more important.

184
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,101
First of all,

185
00:14:10,101 --> 00:14:15,101
there's a lot of what you know and so if
you restraints with that because that's

186
00:14:15,711 --> 00:14:16,544
important,

187
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,610
well that's a good thing because you're
going to be surrounded by your entire

188
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,453
life.

189
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:23,330
If you were appreciative of that,

190
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,370
absolutely make things better,

191
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:27,023
but

192
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,840
the other element of that is,

193
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:30,980
well,

194
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,980
why should you be appreciated as well?

195
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,980
You shouldn't be.

196
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,480
Your life is absolutely
perfect in every way.

197
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,970
You have exactly what you needed.

198
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:45,380
One get ordered around in
what you do is sufficient,

199
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:50,290
but if you believe that things
can still be right around you,

200
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,463
your own

201
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,760
with regards to the effect
you have another people,

202
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:58,700
it obviously wasn't built yet and it
was more important than what you do know

203
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:03,760
and you should be paying us and find out
at every possible moment and if you're

204
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,590
fortunate when you have a
conversation with someone,

205
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:10,420
actually interested in
what they say they haven't.

206
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:14,870
Even if they're not very good
at communicating initiatives
or awkward or even if

207
00:15:14,871 --> 00:15:19,340
they display a certain amount of energy
towards you is always the possibility

208
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,040
that they might tell you
something you don't know,

209
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,590
in which case you could walk
away from the conversation,

210
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,800
less ignorant and then it were when
you started the conversation and if you

211
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:30,810
like,

212
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:35,810
isn't everything that you would like it
to be the slightly less important and is

213
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,320
probably the thing and so ruth Pennington,

214
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:45,340
be precise and speak from that's in there
and say that that's a barrier of a New

215
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,140
Testament in council,

216
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,140
which is a description of the nature of
the world which is not being asked to

217
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:01,310
receive is very stringent theory,

218
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,473
let's say,

219
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:07,630
but I would say is far more in accordance
with what we know about the psychology

220
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,880
of perceptions,

221
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:14,190
let's say than you might imagine
because it is the case that

222
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,210
you don't get to delegate.

223
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,143
Now,

224
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,250
Mike,

225
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:26,250
if you do it in that and might
is better as which the center,

226
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:31,270
if you specify the nature of the.

227
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,621
Actually,

228
00:16:32,621 --> 00:16:37,210
if you specify the nature of the being
that you want break into being that he

229
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:41,350
radically decreases the probability
that that's her or she will know that

230
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:46,351
because you regard yourself at least to
some degree as active creative agents,

231
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,160
fundamental attitude towards itself
isn't afterwards is that you will have a

232
00:16:57,551 --> 00:17:02,050
landscape of possibilities that leave
themselves open to you and you make

233
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:02,884
choices.

234
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:08,030
The three no's and determined
in consequence how the
world is going to manifest

235
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:13,471
itself in a field of potential concern
of your choices do determine which

236
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:20,791
elements of that are going to concretize
them self into the real world are very

237
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,550
unhappy with yourself.

238
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,960
People will do a property and you're
very unhappy with other people.

239
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,510
If they don't do that property,

240
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:32,200
you're going to have other people.

241
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,980
If they don't treat you
like that's what your life,

242
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,460
because part of what
you demand for people,

243
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,920
let's say in terms of sheer civility,

244
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,930
is that they act towards you lose.

245
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:49,170
If you're the locus of voluntary choice
in the world and your brave each other

246
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:49,790
for that.

247
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:52,890
As children and parents,

248
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,840
your parents would say,

249
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,990
if you're fortunate,

250
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,120
you're not living up to your potential,

251
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,180
which is actually a compliment in a sense,

252
00:18:00,181 --> 00:18:05,181
even though it's also a judgment and the
problem is I know perfectly well that

253
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,180
you can be more than you are and you'll
pay your bills done every single thing

254
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:13,500
like he thinks in relationship
to your own conscience that yes,

255
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:17,370
I have a lot of brokers that are not
fully realizing and that actually

256
00:18:17,371 --> 00:18:20,370
constitutes state transgression
against the group.

257
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:21,800
I don't.

258
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,800
I don't think I've ever met anyone
who doesn't believe that if you have

259
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:32,450
reasonable conversations to seems self
evident now and then you need someone

260
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:35,040
who's a narcissistic itself,

261
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,790
satisfying,

262
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,710
but then they're narcissistic.

263
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,120
That's not good at that as a
medium to low third strategy.

264
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:43,520
That's a disaster.

265
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:44,410
You know?

266
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,050
It's a short term protecting.

267
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,453
Moreover,

268
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,740
it's not the least.

269
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:50,060
Of course,

270
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,480
other things as well.

271
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:52,811
Rule 11,

272
00:18:52,811 --> 00:18:57,811
there's no father children in their
state board and that's the discussion is

273
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,090
courage,

274
00:18:59,090 --> 00:18:59,923
encouragement,

275
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:03,990
workforce specifically
because I the standard,

276
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:04,873
for example,

277
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,450
what role parents play in
the lives of their children.

278
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,520
I would say this is a little bit that
is a fundamental importance as well as a

279
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:19,730
family to your children so that they act
in a socially desirable manner so the

280
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,260
world opens itself up to them.

281
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,990
You also want to encourage them,

282
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,210
which is not the same as sheltering them.

283
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,280
It's not the same at all.

284
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,250
And to encourage the audience
to say something like,

285
00:19:32,251 --> 00:19:33,070
look accurate,

286
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,770
something like your kid

287
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,470
as you.

288
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,970
The world is already difficult.

289
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:44,700
It's even difficult or
you're not the same.

290
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:46,230
Their child's size difficulties,

291
00:19:46,231 --> 00:19:47,500
but they're still different.

292
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Role is a very hard place and it's a
better place and it's not only a hard

293
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:55,920
interface.

294
00:19:55,920 --> 00:20:00,920
It's also tested the trailer and
that's the fundamental bottom line,

295
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:06,590
but there's something in you that is
capable of taking that on and transcending

296
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,300
and that's encouragement.

297
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,061
You'd say,

298
00:20:12,061 --> 00:20:12,894
well,

299
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,030
as difficult as things are,

300
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,680
you are often the children and with
children when you're doing that,

301
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:26,430
say in advisedly dangerous things,

302
00:20:26,431 --> 00:20:31,431
which of course knew if their state
border to interfere with that is to

303
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,890
interfere with the child's willingness
to voluntarily expose themselves to the

304
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:42,801
risks that they need to expose themselves
to in order to develop the competence

305
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,860
that allows them to thrive,

306
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,210
to grow the account,

307
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,520
sheltered from

308
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:55,520
interfere with children when they're
taking the necessary risks is not love.

309
00:20:55,910 --> 00:21:00,910
We're infinitely powerful is our parents
and it's deeply down into children and

310
00:21:01,601 --> 00:21:06,601
I can tell you that I've never had a
client come to my office and all the

311
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:09,063
hundreds,

312
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,060
all hundreds of encounters
have people in my office.

313
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:15,070
I've never had a client say,

314
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,870
my parents need me to be independent.

315
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,510
That hasn't happened with one right now.

316
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:29,040
My parents need me to dependent or
life conspired with my parents to

317
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,653
perpetually.

318
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,090
That happened all the time.

319
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,740
So here's a rule of thumb that I think
is a good word is often applied to

320
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,490
nursing homes by people who work at your

321
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,903
job.

322
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,150
And the rule is,

323
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:51,190
do not do anything for anyone they can
do for themselves and the reason for that

324
00:21:51,191 --> 00:21:53,040
extended support that

325
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,151
first of all,

326
00:21:55,151 --> 00:21:59,620
if you do something and
facilitates the movement forward,

327
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,510
then they move forward because you help

328
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:08,520
people as therapists that advice

329
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,270
it might fail in the shape they are.

330
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,020
Rooms paid for my advice,

331
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:15,131
and second,

332
00:22:15,131 --> 00:22:16,090
if it succeeds,

333
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,970
then I get to be the successful one.

334
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,700
I don't want to steal the
success for my clients.

335
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,170
That's a bad idea.

336
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:28,380
I want to help them figure out what it
is that they should a map and then the

337
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,380
strategy for attaining now.

338
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:34,870
But I want to ensure
that it's their destiny,

339
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,590
not something I'm in a position

340
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,700
I would say therapeutic relationship,

341
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,510
bad relationship here you right?

342
00:22:46,511 --> 00:22:49,290
So one of the things you want
to do with your departments,

343
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,020
your spouse,

344
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:54,850
you say your husband or wife and also
children's to listen to them so that you

345
00:22:54,851 --> 00:22:58,870
can figure out what their problems are
and figure out which one is going to

346
00:22:58,871 --> 00:23:03,340
figure that out by communicating and then
perhaps aid them in the development of

347
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:04,174
the strategy.

348
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:09,360
You have to ensure very carefully that
you're not imposing your own structure in

349
00:23:11,111 --> 00:23:11,580
that,

350
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,890
going to steal from them what's there,

351
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:20,820
so it's a little evidence current as the
fundamental is you can say what's the

352
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:27,190
antidote to the catastrophe
life and what has to be safety.

353
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:33,230
If you're non sensible enough to know
that a certain amount of tradition,

354
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,620
the safeties is worthwhile,

355
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:39,520
you should probably wear your seatbelt
when you're driving in your car because

356
00:23:39,521 --> 00:23:41,620
why he foolhardy breath,

357
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:47,210
but given that there is no
security in the final analysis,

358
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,860
then encourage.

359
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,890
There isn't much better medication than
sheltering and so and that's that's I

360
00:23:56,841 --> 00:24:01,841
think the eating with the idea that what
life is essentially is not a place to

361
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:08,270
be happy to aim for degree for
some front of the wall now to,

362
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:14,180
but I called to something like adventure
and I think that's the proper way of

363
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,090
conceptualizing it.

364
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,860
Certainly if you go
watch a story and move,

365
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:20,040
do you agree to something like that?

366
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:24,050
If you encounter a narrative
that's really literate,

367
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,080
romance or a classic adventure
story is the element of this.

368
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:33,240
It's gripping is the adventure and so
portray life is an adventure and romance

369
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,820
and properly and the way that we

370
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,830
facilitate the is to encourage them.

371
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,160
I have a five month already,

372
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:46,830
liked him,

373
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,670
was a good guy,

374
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,593
smart guy,

375
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,520
good guy and everything.

376
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,480
He was little.

377
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,040
He's a good musician.

378
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,140
Talented athlete.

379
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,453
Curve

380
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,880
will be bundles,

381
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,960
relationship with his girlfriend,

382
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,530
his girlfriend,

383
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,680
the other

384
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,430
gender,

385
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,520
and brought the birth parents.

386
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,400
They need every provision profitable
to help her prepare for the jury that

387
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,840
invite the community to
make sure she had a great

388
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:30,030
group and when you
talked with his parents,

389
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,060
all he did was worried that he was
to her and get her can get her,

390
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,860
but they didn't understand that
they were choosing between the hurt,

391
00:25:41,861 --> 00:25:44,860
but you might make to the world
and you're having an adventure.

392
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,320
That's girlfriend.

393
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,470
The hurt that he would
encounter by staying at home,

394
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,250
Howard in his basement,

395
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,280
protectionism or lobbying Paris,

396
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,640
last girlfriend.

397
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,910
Which of those two things is more
damaging and their answers as his parents

398
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:05,670
wouldn't worry as much as
it was in the basement.

399
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:07,620
Don't worry,

400
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:11,840
he's going to be more so I'm

401
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,210
going to count three,

402
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,220
the NIPSA

403
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,210
meditation on rigidity.

404
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:28,810
It's a discussion of what we do and what
to do and that's really good to that.

405
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:34,590
Your personal life,

406
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,260
work life,

407
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,520
interview quickly.

408
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,870
It indicates of death in the

409
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:49,760
lots of degree or any of the things that
we have your world outside now close

410
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,250
with a

411
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:00,160
discussion of necessity of nearly years.

412
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,620
These are more of a control
perhaps of the days,

413
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,520
and these are really

414
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,950
our three minutes,

415
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,040
10 minutes.

416
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,103
Can we get

417
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,500
in front of Molly last time that

418
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,900
you do that on your blog,

419
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:32,160
you're doing not suffering away madly

420
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,560
appreciate everything manifests itself.

421
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,840
That allows itself to be appreciated.

422
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:48,290
And so that's the 12 rules and I'll
return and the street music platform for

423
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:54,100
laying abstractions.

424
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:02,210
So some of other with the sense of doubt,

425
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,910
doubt,

426
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,810
doubt is a very extreme word,

427
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,670
easily translatable,

428
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,800
single meaning,

429
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,620
at least in English,

430
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:19,310
it means half of light so that the path as

431
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,990
the profit path so that the proper path.

432
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,240
So the idea that as a symbol of reality,

433
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,820
what does it needs to be enlightened?

434
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,830
So there's an implicit idea there that
the fundamental reality life is the path

435
00:28:37,291 --> 00:28:40,110
that takes you like it's
not a materialist idea,

436
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,290
just different times.

437
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:46,410
It's the idea that life is more
outreaches and we're on a journey,

438
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,690
best reconceptualize.

439
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:51,320
The reality is the place
that you journeyed through,

440
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:54,390
what are the elements,

441
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:59,330
what are the constituent elements of
the place that you journey through now

442
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,193
that's needed,

443
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,720
and yet in

444
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,273
the world,

445
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:11,240
the black Blackford again and again,

446
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:16,700
seven possibly gain from the fact
that it's a symbolic representation,

447
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,970
doesn't mean women or men in art.

448
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:26,680
It's an attempt to use sexual symbolism
who represent a deeper underlying

449
00:29:27,241 --> 00:29:32,241
reality is massively in is
dark night and there's a light

450
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,320
and the black law license,

451
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,600
one of the other red anymore.

452
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:49,380
And so that's the new

453
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:52,970
world.

454
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:55,350
And the question is
perhaps address to use.

455
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:55,660
Well,

456
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,610
what exactly does that mean?

457
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,520
So it actually means something.

458
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:04,770
It's kind of abstraction and it's actually
an incredibly powerful instruction.

459
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,050
Once you understand instruction,

460
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:12,850
it be the most real abstraction
there is going to layout with on.

461
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,270
They offer you a little bit of

462
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:22,310
and then that they're real and they're
going to tell you what it means

463
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,153
so

464
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,650
you kale now will pay off,

465
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,793
you know,

466
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,280
they often.

467
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,380
So one of the things that deal
with this is something like

468
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,000
this is not how people think,

469
00:30:46,001 --> 00:30:48,710
if you want to spray,

470
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,110
because it is how we act,

471
00:30:50,111 --> 00:30:51,220
and as I said already,

472
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:56,730
you act as if you confront and you treat
pencil out as if it's real and if your

473
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:00,950
attitude towards it,

474
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,640
converters on you a certain World Vision,

475
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:08,790
which is why you know what people need
when they say you're not giving up,

476
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,280
no one ever says

477
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,123
no,

478
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:20,230
and very few people say,

479
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,561
Oh,

480
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:23,290
I'm fully living up to my remit,

481
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:28,350
is the reality that undergirds
that consistent conception
that makes that person

482
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,320
off ability

483
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:30,503
immediately.

484
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:34,840
She lives in the future.

485
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,713
That's part of it,

486
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,230
and we believe in the future.

487
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,220
We believe that it exists even though
it isn't here and it's not measurable.

488
00:31:42,221 --> 00:31:42,720
It's.

489
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:47,050
It only exists as a potential
step up realizable often.

490
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,700
That's what the future is really well.

491
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:50,440
We're complaining with.

492
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,670
We don't really contend,

493
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:57,390
reorient yourself to
future comes out direction,

494
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,150
just signed as part of and
how you construct the French.

495
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,493
In the past,

496
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:14,020
our payoff is retention
and that's the problem.

497
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:17,870
It's like if you're in a working,

498
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:21,280
is there another way
of consensual I needed?

499
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,420
Do I have a of

500
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:27,020
another plan?

501
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:31,880
It's something that I got put into a power
that was make this terrible situation

502
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,970
or that's all I have to call
and use it to transfigure.

503
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,150
I'll eat this.

504
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,030
He told me he more because
of the wager conceptualizing.

505
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,240
We need that.

506
00:32:48,410 --> 00:32:53,410
I understand it himself so bad
that there are basically done.

507
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,240
You have to do.

508
00:32:56,390 --> 00:32:57,290
People obviously

509
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:04,150
got their businesses collapse
and genuinely terrible
things can happen to you

510
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,770
that aren't your fault,

511
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:11,630
that is not saying can just
cheering them worldwide.

512
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,980
That's pretty cool,

513
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:19,780
but I understand that you
have a tremendous ability
to transform the landscape

514
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:25,460
of possibilities in front of you
and then when things are terrible,

515
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,260
that's your best bet.

516
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,790
Doesn't see just these.

517
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,600
You don't have a better option,

518
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:38,020
and so her pencil is also
something that a terrible manner.

519
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,120
So imagine this.

520
00:33:40,121 --> 00:33:41,550
This is really thinking about,

521
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:44,640
so imagine that you have a relationship,

522
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:47,780
let's say American now,

523
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:53,140
the rear one trust and available us,

524
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,620
and that's the trust and fidelity
is the action of your memories.

525
00:34:01,990 --> 00:34:02,823
Like,

526
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:03,380
well,

527
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,590
let's lay it out for 10 years,

528
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,870
and then your wife tells you
that she has had three affairs,

529
00:34:11,990 --> 00:34:15,960
each of them the last three years
and the last one a lot this year.

530
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,540
So then what happens?

531
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,403
Then

532
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,400
what happens is that everything
you thought was wrong,

533
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:29,511
right?

534
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:33,760
And this is such a disrespecting
thing actually been in the past.

535
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,740
The past is

536
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:37,690
there.

537
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:42,690
All the sudden you find out that one of
the things that you thought of the past

538
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:47,300
that was very important
thing wasn't true at all,

539
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:52,510
and so work on meeting a whole task that
you thought was was it wasn't what it

540
00:34:52,511 --> 00:34:52,680
was.

541
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,680
It all so it transforms itself from a
nationality is pretentious and most of

542
00:35:00,351 --> 00:35:03,190
them is native listener.

543
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,750
The need

544
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:15,270
for your marriage is dreadfully unhappy
and you're just looking for an excuse to

545
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:16,933
me.

546
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,910
It's possible that that revelation,

547
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,400
even though it was shocking,

548
00:35:20,401 --> 00:35:22,790
we will come with the spirit is released,

549
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:27,230
so this repetitive professional manifest
itself even when it's unexpected,

550
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:30,980
it doesn't necessarily
manifest itself in India.

551
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,200
Got will also breed.

552
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,960
If one thing to that

553
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,930
and the trail was
revealed and the divorce,

554
00:35:42,931 --> 00:35:44,620
can you set yourself up to two years?

555
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,330
My work,

556
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:49,630
it's not a pathway on written saying

557
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,360
that's the introduction of the board and
he need the oldest story that we have

558
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,360
is something like order is susceptible
to disruption by payoffs and human.

559
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:14,020
The fundamental demands made on the
human being is to contend with the chaos

560
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:15,350
that is not work,

561
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:21,180
not just in order to not pretend that
the chaos is to encourage your children,

562
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:24,714
for example,

563
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:29,870
what you're doing is encouraging you to
become the masters of the chaos that is

564
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,640
is an order is made some his of payoff,

565
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,410
which makes them not as important.

566
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,940
You train your children,

567
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,530
encourage your children and yourself and
your partner from having sense to be a

568
00:36:43,531 --> 00:36:45,560
master of detail

569
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,750
and so

570
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,250
so this,

571
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,463
this rough,

572
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,433
disruptive.

573
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:59,660
It's the infinite world to disrupt
your financial considerations.

574
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:03,390
That's another way of looking at
another way of looking at it is it's the

575
00:37:03,391 --> 00:37:08,130
serpent in the garden of Eden and the
reason that that story is set up the way

576
00:37:08,131 --> 00:37:13,131
it is because it's trying to represent
that there was no place so bound and data

577
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,303
secure.

578
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,840
Even if it's set up my blog himself,

579
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:22,470
it doesn't have an agent of chaos inside.

580
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,630
It's exactly the same idea,

581
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:28,440
but now here there's
some more representation.

582
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:29,513
It's just

583
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,550
the question is,

584
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,133
well,

585
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:39,500
what we do in regard given the sustainment
and that's something like master the

586
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,753
snakes,

587
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,860
so and that's a neat idea.

588
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:48,240
That's the same idea as

589
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:56,070
sitting on the ocean rescue water
from the belly of the whale.

590
00:37:57,370 --> 00:38:02,370
The same idea and that's an l
greatest stories is your gross

591
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,150
manifests itself together.

592
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:15,151
Something as a consequence to the sure
is there isn't a story that's more

593
00:38:15,391 --> 00:38:18,810
emblematic of what a nice event that that.

594
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,650
That is a.

595
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:22,410
that's our best bet.

596
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:24,661
All right,

597
00:38:24,661 --> 00:38:26,320
so nails.

598
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,003
You don't.

599
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,140
It's a task that need to
suddenly enter your left,

600
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:31,941
the office,

601
00:38:31,941 --> 00:38:32,774
the flood.

602
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:36,740
It's definitely become
ever present possibility.

603
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,780
Apocalypse in your personal life,

604
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:39,663
in your community.

605
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,810
Like in the

606
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,193
refinery,

607
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:50,000
virgility existing in a
world that's beyond me,

608
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:55,110
off his potential lies before cause I
need something can rescue yourself from

609
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,320
seeing orders,

610
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,210
permanent element,

611
00:39:01,211 --> 00:39:02,044
the existence.

612
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:04,030
Chaos is what you don't know.

613
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,420
What's outside the fire

614
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,013
walls,

615
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,140
walls of your town,

616
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,630
outside of the borders of your passion.

617
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:20,300
All of that is hail

618
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:23,863
or

619
00:39:26,010 --> 00:39:28,480
order is where you are.

620
00:39:28,550 --> 00:39:30,860
What you're doing is working any matter.

621
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,430
It's very specific.

622
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,060
How do you know that you know what you're
doing when you don't because you don't

623
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:40,973
know everything.

624
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,170
Everything you do is my ignorance,

625
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,540
but you still have to
operate in the world.

626
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,640
This is what we do is make
finite plans and then plans,

627
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:55,820
maybe sap strategies to make those kinds
manifested itself and if the consultant

628
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,230
the way that you desire in
any regard to knowledge,

629
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:06,430
so that's your difference between truth
and it's the only definition you can use

630
00:40:06,751 --> 00:40:11,751
because you don't have everything at
hand and when you're aware of is working,

631
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:16,170
that's word and you might think
why should just stay there?

632
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:21,650
Because that's a comfortable place to be
and there's a certain truth except for

633
00:40:22,351 --> 00:40:24,540
one thing if you

634
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,750
word and you stand in it and wait,

635
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:38,600
the disorder itself because
things aren't stacked,

636
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,650
things change all the time.

637
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,220
You're finding yourself in a static
structure is definitely trail because

638
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:51,580
everything around you is blocks and the
thing that's permanent rule transform

639
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:54,054
itself.

640
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,610
Here's an example.

641
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,800
Let's say you're a perfectly well.

642
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:01,040
We'll have a new rule you actually with.

643
00:41:01,230 --> 00:41:02,410
That's none of your children.

644
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,433
Children,

645
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:06,783
that's

646
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,070
very mature form of children.

647
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,580
They can be really delightful people to
have like three years maybe paint them

648
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,483
the reason

649
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:20,930
they hit puberty,

650
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:23,960
which is the emergence
of hail off into the,

651
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,220
into the bowl,

652
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:30,240
ready to go through the
emergency sexuality in the
descriptor that didn't have a

653
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:32,670
deficit progression.

654
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,120
Do you ever get shot off the things?

655
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,023
Always do.

656
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,270
It's know where to turn 16.

657
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,760
You're no longer is like 11 year old.

658
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:48,830
Very immature 16 years and the reason
that I got out was because just because

659
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:50,250
somebody is now

660
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,890
five years from now and
so in order to be stable,

661
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,790
you're not the same thing.

662
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:03,690
The dynamic not static,

663
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:08,870
so you have to be very large bowing to
where you're going and this opinion,

664
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,660
both African,

665
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,760
so it's stability,

666
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:18,761
plus parents permission and
manifest in your narrative,

667
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:23,810
meaning that's actually
the instinct meeting,

668
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,960
which is an instinct to perhaps the
precisely the instinct that tells you who

669
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:31,460
are sufficiently stable.

670
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:35,870
You transforming yourself at a
sufficient rate up with everything.

671
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,350
It's changed and you know that
because if you're at your job,

672
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,640
you to say yourself,

673
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:41,631
well,

674
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:42,870
my job is really secure,

675
00:42:42,871 --> 00:42:44,210
but it's not very challenging.

676
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:50,250
You think that it's very secure
and that's it's not challenging.

677
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,430
It's in the sense that
the spirit goes out of it.

678
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:56,670
If it's not challenging,

679
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,620
you need to be challenged and why Israel?

680
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,070
We've answered as well.

681
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:05,090
Tomorrow's how and whoever you
now this is enough for tomorrow,

682
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,190
and so today you also have Laura
and next week and next year,

683
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,860
and if you're challenging and
it isn't doing that for me,

684
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,940
and you find the need,

685
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,600
and the reason for that is that it's
sliced your most essential instinct.

686
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:26,590
Instinct is the instinct for meaning
and it signifies that it actually seemed

687
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:28,603
balanced,

688
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:30,583
right?

689
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:31,963
We right,

690
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:35,280
which is why it's fundamental
open space paying us,

691
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,640
nor are the most real things.

692
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,440
Alright,

693
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,200
so you have the payoff.

694
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:46,330
It's not in scope and then
he's not the order that you,

695
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,960
your mastery.

696
00:43:50,770 --> 00:43:51,640
Let's take order.

697
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:57,320
We're thinking about the structure
order and I'm not saying,

698
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,840
I'm not saying that at all.

699
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,010
That's the balance,

700
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,010
the balance.

701
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,780
Even as important in this category,

702
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:11,420
whether you liked development,

703
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,640
their fundamental constituent
elements of reality.

704
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,530
You might say,

705
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:18,711
well,

706
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:20,070
what's your evidence for that?

707
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,620
And it can tell you one piece
of evidence for very much time.

708
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:28,750
You have content experience
needs to be great

709
00:44:31,030 --> 00:44:31,863
was your

710
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:34,063
world.

711
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:38,020
Your brain is the adaptive world,

712
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:44,660
let's say fundamental strategy meeting
structure and the bifurcation indicates

713
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:49,280
that filed medical reality

714
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,000
divided four

715
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,530
and if you're working deposition
reality is scientific,

716
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,050
biological

717
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,450
reality that shapes

718
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:18,170
early perspective and they like
bifurcated representation of life.

719
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:21,901
It's a proper.

720
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:26,620
We never did reality and
perhaps the real itself is

721
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:32,950
a nice logical evidence.

722
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:38,533
American.

723
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,010
You left spirit,

724
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:47,190
specialized operations in those situations
that you know and understand and

725
00:45:47,401 --> 00:45:48,470
you're right when the spirits

726
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:55,040
in those situations that united no nor
understand and the proper way to sell our

727
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,470
was to be balanced operations.

728
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:01,710
Correct.

729
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:07,020
The way that manifests itself in
different experiences as meaningful,

730
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:12,180
so that's not an APP first path.

731
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:14,483
What will you say?

732
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:18,220
Justification for the that these two

733
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:24,770
are the most real domain order over.

734
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,093
Now,

735
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,120
if you just sit there and who is that?

736
00:46:30,121 --> 00:46:30,954
What we think?

737
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,620
Why will suffer and die?

738
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,000
That's what will happen.

739
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:41,510
So without actually apart
deterioration in death,

740
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,050
we meet at

741
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:47,763
last

742
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,990
3 billion years of evolution.

743
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:02,020
The action actually move in
the face of necessity is quite

744
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,840
rewarding that

745
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:12,430
you have to know

746
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,860
that you have to have some.

747
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:20,310
You need some water.

748
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:25,100
Do you need some show
that you need some kind of

749
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,750
sexual partner

750
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,833
way?

751
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,420
Actually nee nee people grinding way
those same people across God you sins are

752
00:47:42,671 --> 00:47:43,460
necessary.

753
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:45,340
Well as survival itself.

754
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,470
Assumptions just sitting there.

755
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:53,570
It's not the right

756
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:56,953
word,

757
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,370
not in world.

758
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:03,420
The Internet stops you from deteriorating
guy at minimum and not being able to

759
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,940
address the problems that are a Jersey
for about now of 800 are in water.

760
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:19,903
Sewage.

761
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:25,170
The loan to the jurors is specialized.

762
00:48:25,230 --> 00:48:26,880
Bottom hole,

763
00:48:27,470 --> 00:48:29,310
you can bless it and afraid.

764
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:30,860
She suffers pain,

765
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:35,860
almost a special assistance for all
both you and your correctional systems

766
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:39,730
orientation world and they have to figure
out what to do so when you're hungry,

767
00:48:39,731 --> 00:48:40,564
it's time,

768
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:41,853
it's

769
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:44,630
time to seat belts.

770
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:50,620
You have specialized system
where there aren't enough because

771
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:53,843
that's

772
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:57,280
the problem with organizing.

773
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:58,130
It's like,

774
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:02,180
well not the complaint.

775
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:03,630
You have to do something,

776
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:08,670
a little shelter and there is right
now for the next two years from now,

777
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,780
five years from now,

778
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:15,781
so you have to have stretches
of time now in the future you,

779
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:19,420
this new family and the community,

780
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:24,540
it's all done has to be taken into
account in your movement for very,

781
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,040
very close to Salt Civil
Paisley and your motivational.

782
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:30,670
50.

783
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:31,090
Anger,

784
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:35,470
hunger and so forth can help
them solve those problems now,

785
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,970
but not all of them.

786
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:39,750
Permanent hire.

787
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:44,620
All of our complex problems.

788
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,710
How do we propagate the game across

789
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:55,380
the left hemisphere operates
we embarrassed when work.

790
00:49:56,650 --> 00:50:00,910
It's hard work like senior
right hemisphere off.

791
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,160
People don't like it going on accident,

792
00:50:04,161 --> 00:50:05,950
but it's the whole native emotion,

793
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,380
the whole pain and anxiety.

794
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:13,950
It's the thing that turns on I deeply
did not expect if the terrorism onslaught

795
00:50:17,251 --> 00:50:18,084
of what we do

796
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:24,620
now because used the right
hemisphere in condition,

797
00:50:25,091 --> 00:50:25,924
standard

798
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:33,610
artistic expression for all sorts of
things you like so because it's also

799
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:41,210
possible in the interim

800
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:48,430
should you have to do is I'm going to

801
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,200
use something.

802
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,940
You have to do some definitional issue.

803
00:50:56,570 --> 00:51:01,310
This is an act out the proposition
that the thing you're doing,

804
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,860
Z is preferable.

805
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:07,600
You have and we'll do it for those things.

806
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:08,433
You're trying to get

807
00:51:10,130 --> 00:51:10,963
tangled.

808
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,440
Say I'm eating,

809
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,070
but I don't know.

810
00:51:15,590 --> 00:51:20,240
There's something wrong with the way you
conceptualize that mistake because we

811
00:51:20,241 --> 00:51:25,241
did something and bring it into
existence is the same as johnny and say,

812
00:51:26,211 --> 00:51:26,391
well,

813
00:51:26,391 --> 00:51:31,391
that has been something because either
your academic or you know what you're

814
00:51:32,451 --> 00:51:33,284
talking about.

815
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,193
It's more

816
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:40,470
confused that your action patterns
and the girls health representation,

817
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:48,090
but that doesn't mean that they're
critics of just means that people use so

818
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:55,500
after an awkward suffer in order to add
value because much more than the Nata,

819
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:01,980
which means happy topic of value,

820
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:09,190
so we just start dying because it's

821
00:52:12,350 --> 00:52:13,183
not

822
00:52:15,250 --> 00:52:16,083
socially

823
00:52:17,890 --> 00:52:18,723
pursued.

824
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:24,320
Aims in isolation because you're not not
a solitary animals and your title and

825
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:32,840
deeply private families,

826
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,033
communities,

827
00:52:34,430 --> 00:52:36,620
our society and social.

828
00:52:36,870 --> 00:52:37,620
Every.

829
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,453
No,

830
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,400
as long as we been Fridays,

831
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:45,110
so maybe that's.

832
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:49,580
That's at least six years and it
might be more like $60 million.

833
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:52,030
It's really all time.

834
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,640
So it's not an arbitrary
social construction.

835
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:01,120
Now what happens start

836
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:05,740
to hire.

837
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:08,243
He

838
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:10,333
Watch,

839
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:14,510
let's say one thing is doing that.

840
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,830
Enough happens me

841
00:53:18,870 --> 00:53:23,870
to do anything besides already promoting
healthy things done and then you get

842
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:33,170
whatever comes to me and the first
thing he did around whatever.

843
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,850
So and that is

844
00:53:40,770 --> 00:53:41,870
insane and

845
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,360
people would ask me

846
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,790
one visual landscape,

847
00:53:51,550 --> 00:53:55,030
something double back

848
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:59,490
in Cleveland for a good activity.

849
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:04,980
There's actually a law price's
law and it's a real law.

850
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,660
He's governed size,

851
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:13,080
the massive star and just of cover covered
price's law says that the square root

852
00:54:16,701 --> 00:54:18,400
of the number of people engaged in it,

853
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:19,253
the pricing.

854
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:24,000
So if you have 10 absolute

855
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,800
candidate and if you have 10,000 in a
how did this work and that you know how

856
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:40,200
well the series itself such that
a minority people have more money.

857
00:54:41,430 --> 00:54:43,170
80 five richest people in the world,

858
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,090
they have it.

859
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:49,870
It's something like that and everybody
goes from my boss and one percent it's

860
00:54:49,871 --> 00:54:50,360
like,

861
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,560
well first of all girl,

862
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:52,231
one percent.

863
00:54:52,231 --> 00:54:53,064
So

864
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:54,963
yourself

865
00:54:57,430 --> 00:55:02,430
speaking and by current
standards and certain binders,

866
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,800
you're all even one percent.

867
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,800
So if that's a problem,

868
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:12,060
well it's a problem for
all of you might be,

869
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:12,810
you know,

870
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,010
Richard is app.

871
00:55:14,130 --> 00:55:19,130
That doesn't mean all in the same boat
on the fact that wealth NCA to enhance

872
00:55:20,910 --> 00:55:24,440
the cable is part of
the general expression.

873
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,760
There's nothing special.

874
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:31,610
You see the same thing
every creative building in.

875
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,210
How many of you have recorded a

876
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,720
full record?

877
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:38,993
How many?

878
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,500
Five?

879
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,333
Zero

880
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:43,363
one.

881
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:48,810
So there's one of the and
that's one 10th of one percent.

882
00:55:48,811 --> 00:55:49,644
Something like that.

883
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:51,000
How many of you have

884
00:55:53,710 --> 00:55:57,230
a date on obtaining?

885
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,350
Is Hanging in national says here,

886
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,553
look

887
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:09,080
how many of you will be member
of a professional sports team

888
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,100
when we get the point here?

889
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:14,731
Okay,

890
00:56:14,731 --> 00:56:15,620
so it was like,

891
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:36,020
and so the rule

892
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,520
system that you use and it
doesn't know me well enough.

893
00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:44,730
It's like,

894
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:45,850
well here's something else

895
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:53,050
started with guardian is an intrinsic

896
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:55,833
deep

897
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:00,550
suffering and you train itself,

898
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:03,580
so that's the baseline.

899
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:04,810
That's intolerable.

900
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:05,743
Anyways,

901
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,380
he was involved and immersed in digital.

902
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:13,420
What we do with the base of something
and you try to find something to justify

903
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,440
having something that gives him the
hell in the morning and not just any old

904
00:57:19,851 --> 00:57:20,170
one,

905
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,230
but I'm more with your water,

906
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:27,231
has Alzheimer's disease and your daughter
have you need something to get out of

907
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:29,960
bed for girls more than this two and half.

908
00:57:30,710 --> 00:57:31,391
The purpose,

909
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,224
that

910
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:38,390
purpose is going to be such that it
better be a damn noble purpose because

911
00:57:40,030 --> 00:57:42,640
otherwise why important and so

912
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:48,270
that's of sufficient tension,

913
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:49,113
let's say,

914
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,140
or valuable position.

915
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:57,200
So worth suffering for because you're
going to stop and you better have

916
00:57:57,341 --> 00:57:58,810
something that needs the suffering.

917
00:57:58,810 --> 00:58:02,180
Justify its structure,

918
00:58:03,510 --> 00:58:04,343
period

919
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,760
when the flood comes in your life and
certainly we'll build that will sustain

920
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,770
for the catastrophe.

921
00:58:14,910 --> 00:58:17,380
That's not this pursuit of happiness.

922
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,890
It's not even your.

923
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:24,910
None of them is your
orientation that we managed

924
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:27,740
to hire.

925
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:32,410
It's so high that it's worth
bearing the burden of being reduced

926
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:38,100
you implement out of Ireland now say,

927
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:38,943
well,

928
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:42,390
and then it got higher priorities.

929
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:44,710
Apparently people are
going to be very good at.

930
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:49,800
There's that higher desk and then you
have the second girl admire when I asked

931
00:58:51,071 --> 00:58:56,071
you stick out your knee
pain and they were very,

932
00:58:57,430 --> 00:58:58,310
very unlike.

933
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,890
I'm not saying people all day

934
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:08,680
extraordinary there and
that's an inevitability.

935
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,990
As soon as you decided
something were doing,

936
00:59:11,990 --> 00:59:13,460
these people start

937
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,330
to take would be or observed

938
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,460
almost everybody else.

939
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,360
What is the problem?

940
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,520
Like IRA

941
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:31,800
attendances,

942
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:36,800
disintegration or most people
bought and so that's the next thing,

943
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,100
the hierarchies,

944
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,890
because if going to

945
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:45,863
die,

946
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,720
you didn't want to die,

947
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,323
solution

948
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:57,800
will have the problem the
higher and it's almost higher.

949
00:59:59,110 --> 01:00:02,390
Most people now typically
agree with the lions.

950
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,980
Have something to say.

951
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:05,570
That's what they say,

952
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:12,440
and then look at that very
carefully and he can say,

953
01:00:12,790 --> 01:00:17,790
that hasn't been a hierarchy
itself or or we just finished.

954
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:23,050
It doesn't mean you have no more issues

955
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:29,990
to deal with that when it's
actually in a way to deal with.

956
01:00:29,991 --> 01:00:34,670
That was the hardest political
factor is that right?

957
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,280
The deals with hierarchy,

958
01:00:36,330 --> 01:00:37,340
the department,

959
01:00:37,341 --> 01:00:38,120
this cost,

960
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:43,120
so one of the things that you can reliably
assume about someone's right is that

961
01:00:44,331 --> 01:00:49,331
they will be patriotic in favor of
the current higher or being more.

962
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,780
That's exactly the only new hire.

963
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,060
It's up in.

964
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:00,020
More people will be higher,

965
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,370
so patient support.

966
01:01:04,770 --> 01:01:09,770
The people who are dispossessed by
Harvey and when you have to say is,

967
01:01:10,370 --> 01:01:11,203
yeah,

968
01:01:11,330 --> 01:01:12,890
we actually do something,

969
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:13,724
most app,

970
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,720
anything like that.

971
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:20,960
The answer is no because there's no
permanent solution to the problem of his

972
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,750
possession by the higher.

973
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,450
We don't know how to fix it.

974
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:27,640
Say,

975
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:28,370
well,

976
01:01:28,370 --> 01:01:30,550
hire north slope.

977
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,310
That's a price to pay,

978
01:01:34,810 --> 01:01:37,160
but we can take from
the top at the bottom.

979
01:01:37,161 --> 01:01:37,994
It's like

980
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:40,393
yes,

981
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,990
hypothetically,

982
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,173
good

983
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:45,843
practice.

984
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,761
It's very,

985
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:51,761
very easy to go too far and then what
we ended up with is less dispossessed.

986
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:58,670
You ended up with no one
who has anything that's

987
01:02:00,990 --> 01:02:01,823
scarcity,

988
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:02,990
right?

989
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:07,160
They were equally debt or start with,

990
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:12,480
which is essentially what the states
did cross the entire 20th century is not

991
01:02:13,641 --> 01:02:15,560
the proper way to address.

992
01:02:15,561 --> 01:02:19,040
The higher there has to be addressed.

993
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:23,083
Awesome.

994
01:02:23,190 --> 01:02:25,070
For you,

995
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:26,563
this is a

996
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:29,343
mirror

997
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:33,570
system so they can stay there and without

998
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,043
children

999
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:42,500
or they can a higher becomes corrupt
so that people who own theory and power

1000
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:43,793
compliant,

1001
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:45,690
it's just our

1002
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,290
title,

1003
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,540
which looks like a theory
because there's all sorts of

1004
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:54,843
weight

1005
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:57,933
also.

1006
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:03,360
If the higher steam that everybody stacks
up with zero and you one can apply it

1007
01:03:04,510 --> 01:03:07,890
to basic definition of tyranny,

1008
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:10,890
they don't have to write the thing,

1009
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:15,270
the spring game because
we're already at zero,

1010
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:17,150
so we're going to help me not to lose.

1011
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:21,330
And so one of the things that you want
to do if you're a sensible concern of it,

1012
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:23,160
is making sure that the hierarchy,

1013
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,001
the gains,

1014
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:28,970
it's Ruthie competence is
transparent and it's likable.

1015
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:34,180
You can otherwise equal ossify and Steven
and then it will destroy itself and if

1016
01:03:35,641 --> 01:03:36,480
you're a conservative,

1017
01:03:36,481 --> 01:03:37,420
you know,

1018
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:42,470
stability and the hierarchy
set up a situation where
the tire itself so promote,

1019
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:48,830
you can say,

1020
01:03:48,830 --> 01:03:49,663
well,

1021
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:50,523
don't

1022
01:03:52,550 --> 01:03:54,720
you think Walter's

1023
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:04,510
lonely is the hierarchical structure
itself as a feature of existence,

1024
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:08,610
at least a third of a billion years old,

1025
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:12,800
which means that you cannot attribute.

1026
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:13,883
Listen,

1027
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,340
the free market or the
corrupt patriarchal blessing

1028
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,880
pasted all three of those elements
contributed to existence on the stations

1029
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,373
as

1030
01:04:31,890 --> 01:04:35,910
Nike is actually directed
towards the left.

1031
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:41,690
If you want to help this dispossess
don't really exist in supplier is on.

1032
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,940
Capitalism has it's wrong,

1033
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:46,410
it's wrong.

1034
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,850
That is way cheaper than mountain.

1035
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,050
Here's something else to

1036
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:53,993
consider.

1037
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:56,630
So we are spectacular.

1038
01:04:57,050 --> 01:04:57,883
Dwelt

1039
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:01,210
first in class or Iceland,

1040
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,340
more wealthy than 100 years ago.

1041
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:06,580
It's absolutely awesome.

1042
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:11,270
And so that's the first passenger
west exponential growth started.

1043
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:12,563
You really,

1044
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:19,960
really thought first announced
faculty of the world.

1045
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:22,260
I don't know his people.

1046
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:23,833
Um,

1047
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,990
you went and set a goal to have

1048
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:29,693
it

1049
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:35,800
ready will ever report
we obtained in 2000,

1050
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:36,460
12,

1051
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:40,390
three years ahead of the
most optimistic record.

1052
01:05:40,391 --> 01:05:43,050
So people are lifted on greatness,

1053
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,210
has never been

1054
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:46,613
broken,

1055
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:47,973
divided

1056
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:50,450
with fruit,

1057
01:05:50,460 --> 01:05:51,880
with access to the first one.

1058
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:54,280
Why did you have access to medications?

1059
01:05:54,281 --> 01:05:54,950
Going deeper?

1060
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:57,480
What would probably be like kiss?

1061
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:58,300
It's.

1062
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:01,510
There are so many things in business
so fast we cannot even believe it.

1063
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:03,423
And here's

1064
01:06:05,180 --> 01:06:06,140
as far as the data,

1065
01:06:06,290 --> 01:06:11,290
we have the operation of the free
market system which does inequality.

1066
01:06:11,650 --> 01:06:12,490
That's the thing,

1067
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,350
but as far as I can tell,

1068
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:19,630
the system that has every well and
as long as it's every system produces

1069
01:06:20,441 --> 01:06:21,280
inequality,

1070
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,800
but only system we know that cruises,

1071
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,810
for instance,

1072
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:27,313
adding,

1073
01:06:27,350 --> 01:06:32,140
holding the remark so when
you're forever left and right,

1074
01:06:32,350 --> 01:06:35,750
how many units of inequality it as well,

1075
01:06:37,090 --> 01:06:38,620
and if the answer is zero,

1076
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:43,720
then once you're outside
the appropriate date,

1077
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:46,280
that's the romance.

1078
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:49,720
And if you try to impose
that will be his name.

1079
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:52,420
There's the price we paid for.

1080
01:06:52,421 --> 01:06:53,254
Well,

1081
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:54,520
is it important?

1082
01:06:55,300 --> 01:06:55,421
Now,

1083
01:06:55,421 --> 01:07:00,110
that doesn't mean that you've
committed to this extreme.

1084
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:01,930
On the other phone,

1085
01:07:02,010 --> 01:07:03,600
it's just the whole thing,

1086
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:06,213
what happens,

1087
01:07:06,420 --> 01:07:07,253
all the data,

1088
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:11,400
lay it out and zero,

1089
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:12,390
zero,

1090
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:13,223
one person.

1091
01:07:13,360 --> 01:07:15,140
Now complaints.

1092
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:21,070
The advocacy states his
specialty is needed because
there's a fair bit of chance

1093
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:23,650
or the awkward world,

1094
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:28,360
but the logical conclusion
from the hierarchy,

1095
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:33,140
the complaints is that one person
has everything and everyone's not.

1096
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:35,560
Obviously that's fine,

1097
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:37,643
so,

1098
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,270
so you know when they're awake.

1099
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,040
In our society

1100
01:07:43,590 --> 01:07:44,600
we have progressive tax.

1101
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,533
Hold

1102
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:51,940
on real quick before I get another way
of rectifying that people will have on

1103
01:07:53,470 --> 01:07:54,303
game,

1104
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:54,840
right?

1105
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,190
For Society,

1106
01:07:56,320 --> 01:08:01,320
we are many many things people can
play and so if you're a lawyer in a,

1107
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:06,060
if you can run small restaurant,

1108
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:11,250
it was a diversity of age and so that's
a good way of allowing of increasing

1109
01:08:13,330 --> 01:08:16,400
robustness and consistent
so that you don't get higher

1110
01:08:21,010 --> 01:08:25,830
instigated roses perhaps
it's an intractable problem.

1111
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:29,200
It says one of the things from the end

1112
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:31,543
station,

1113
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:33,910
the war will be business always.

1114
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,810
What's that in reference to?

1115
01:08:35,810 --> 01:08:40,810
It's also in reference to the Napkin
and happens to be an economics

1116
01:08:43,390 --> 01:08:46,890
of everything from those things.

1117
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:48,470
Everything will be taken.

1118
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:53,120
That's the structure of the world and
he can't lay it at the feet of progress.

1119
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:55,100
It's the structure of the world.

1120
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:55,611
Now.

1121
01:08:55,611 --> 01:09:00,600
That means we have to contend with is
a part of the reason that we haven't

1122
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:03,890
continued political file
and that we need to have

1123
01:09:05,590 --> 01:09:08,990
is to make sure our hierarchies exist.

1124
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:14,340
Maybe attack the Rock and
being elected to that,

1125
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:22,420
but that means the left has
that higher level necessarily,

1126
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,560
but valuable in the past will,

1127
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,150
despite your necessity as a tenant,

1128
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:29,870
the stack people up at the bottom.

1129
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:34,010
You see that in

1130
01:09:37,480 --> 01:09:41,220
you see that the old testament because
one of the things that happens when you

1131
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:45,900
in the state and empire status,

1132
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:51,060
six times the machine off
stuff and then is corrupt.

1133
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,710
It loses the way it is.

1134
01:09:54,730 --> 01:09:55,740
Balancing things,

1135
01:09:57,710 --> 01:09:58,543
the kidneys,

1136
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:02,320
so the people and then forgetting
your relationship with God.

1137
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:07,300
That's another way of thinking and then
it says you are paying enough attention

1138
01:10:07,301 --> 01:10:12,301
to the widows and the more you better
thought and these devices in their

1139
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:17,190
narrative thing that what's going to us

1140
01:10:19,450 --> 01:10:22,330
and so they don't take
the steps necessary.

1141
01:10:22,331 --> 01:10:23,400
Corrective by here,

1142
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:28,500
deviation from the path and
they absolutely flattened
and the consequences of

1143
01:10:29,381 --> 01:10:30,940
that last generation,

1144
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:35,910
but second generation and then struggled
growing up in something approximating

1145
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,220
empires test again.

1146
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:39,190
It's exactly the same thing happens.

1147
01:10:39,510 --> 01:10:43,390
We forget and we collect stories

1148
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:50,510
by the Canadian literary people

1149
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:58,290
to break them so there's no such

1150
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:04,210
thing as a nice adjunct,

1151
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:06,400
so so,

1152
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:11,980
so that's the nature of who
are ordered chaos and order.

1153
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:16,130
Your goal is your relationship.

1154
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:21,260
If you do that by meeting
a lot more expedient,

1155
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:22,760
that's safe,

1156
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:29,200
ensure that you have the third
property by taking his life.

1157
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:36,670
You want to pat all the instinct that
orients in the world and you will have

1158
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:37,980
engaged,

1159
01:11:37,980 --> 01:11:40,830
engaging with the sea and
the reason you do that,

1160
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:42,270
we just practice something.

1161
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:46,970
We build structures that specialize
in math and any level of it.

1162
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,930
So if you're living a lie,

1163
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:53,810
this is very thing to do and you're
building neurological mechanisms that go

1164
01:11:53,860 --> 01:11:56,010
through that lie and once they're built,

1165
01:11:56,070 --> 01:11:57,060
they're you.

1166
01:11:57,570 --> 01:11:58,280
And good luck.

1167
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,113
Undoing

1168
01:12:00,600 --> 01:12:01,700
the Parker House

1169
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:04,550
is built.

1170
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:06,630
Negativism surf

1171
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,610
for and those systems are alive.

1172
01:12:11,940 --> 01:12:14,910
All they want is to
grow up and they're not,

1173
01:12:14,930 --> 01:12:16,380
it's not psychological.

1174
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,380
It cycled as he was.

1175
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:24,050
Don't build structures and prohibition
predicated on deception because you will

1176
01:12:24,241 --> 01:12:28,610
pay that and so if you're going to guide
your life with the orientation of the

1177
01:12:28,630 --> 01:12:33,050
instincts that meaning you have to be
very careful what we say and write.

1178
01:12:33,051 --> 01:12:36,850
The thing is every time you say
or write with and something,

1179
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:41,880
you build the little girl that specialized
to that and they participates in this

1180
01:12:42,130 --> 01:12:42,990
of the world.

1181
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,060
So right.

1182
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:52,873
Chaos.

1183
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:57,940
Or is it higher is here's the next book

1184
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,530
is order a higher.

1185
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,790
The subsidiary questions
will be the hierarchy.

1186
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:10,833
What's.

1187
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:11,351
Well,

1188
01:13:11,351 --> 01:13:13,600
I don't live off of the hierarchy.

1189
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,840
The hierarchy does not
want what to be down.

1190
01:13:24,110 --> 01:13:24,943
So

1191
01:13:26,660 --> 01:13:30,460
the first thing I could see
his orders not at Meijer.

1192
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:33,120
What are the same?

1193
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:36,270
That's a different thing.

1194
01:13:36,990 --> 01:13:37,823
So

1195
01:13:40,430 --> 01:13:44,140
I take a job

1196
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,070
and a job briefing.

1197
01:13:49,080 --> 01:13:49,913
Soccer?

1198
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:52,803
No,

1199
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:07,430
my son is still pretty good.

1200
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:12,553
Rena,

1201
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:13,973
just down the street

1202
01:14:16,710 --> 01:14:17,170
there.

1203
01:14:17,170 --> 01:14:22,170
And so it's sort the kids into these
games and if team was getting skunked flap

1204
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:30,420
or any other things winning too much and
then rebalance the teams so that they

1205
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:33,910
are equal in skill.

1206
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:36,250
So that was the sliding fees.

1207
01:14:36,850 --> 01:14:37,683
So

1208
01:14:39,020 --> 01:14:43,860
and then we're on the
way it behaves during

1209
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,523
one.

1210
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,833
And

1211
01:14:49,780 --> 01:14:52,630
so when my son was deep within,

1212
01:14:53,260 --> 01:14:58,260
I think it was the championship game
correctly and there's one kid on his team

1213
01:14:59,330 --> 01:15:00,850
who was the best player

1214
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,460
very fast on his feet because he gets to

1215
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:09,003
eat.

1216
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:11,633
But um,

1217
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:13,810
that's problem.

1218
01:15:15,640 --> 01:15:20,640
One problem was he wasn't passed on now
to talk with you pretty much answer as

1219
01:15:24,971 --> 01:15:25,804
well,

1220
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:31,120
but you want to be the
best person on the team

1221
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:33,560
and you want to read the,

1222
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,320
my boss wants to walk.

1223
01:15:37,630 --> 01:15:39,340
Maybe your team mates,

1224
01:15:39,341 --> 01:15:40,270
band player.

1225
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:41,690
How's that?

1226
01:15:41,980 --> 01:15:44,760
Maybe you want to meet the
people on the team player.

1227
01:15:45,020 --> 01:15:46,990
I did a little bit too far,

1228
01:15:47,300 --> 01:15:52,030
but she certainly want to make
your teammates better plan anyway,

1229
01:15:52,031 --> 01:15:54,630
I think we'll want to do
that because bad people.

1230
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:56,741
Well,

1231
01:15:56,741 --> 01:16:01,120
that's at world because first of all,

1232
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:03,580
if you ran across the
contribution around you,

1233
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:08,710
is that a little better and it's a
helpful way to win by making everyone else

1234
01:16:09,551 --> 01:16:10,384
load.

1235
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:16,020
It's not much of a victory
and so we passed the damn pop,

1236
01:16:17,980 --> 01:16:19,210
especially who,

1237
01:16:19,211 --> 01:16:20,044
especially you.

1238
01:16:20,240 --> 01:16:22,720
So you've got a comfortable lead.

1239
01:16:23,730 --> 01:16:28,730
Well then maybe risk taking time to wait
for that specific game to build up the

1240
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:36,790
confidence in the ability of the and then
maybe every leader they make your not

1241
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:44,180
even so much because you're the
best for but because why not?

1242
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:45,730
Okay.

1243
01:16:45,730 --> 01:16:48,660
So once again we're pretty excited,

1244
01:16:48,870 --> 01:16:53,330
real close and it's like three
to three and it's a minute lap.

1245
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:54,880
Another to you.

1246
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:58,240
This in stores really cool.

1247
01:16:58,450 --> 01:17:03,450
And so my son speed limits except that
they were in the championship and it was

1248
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:04,900
a pretty good thing.

1249
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,630
So you know whether or not they lost.

1250
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:09,040
It's not lost.

1251
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,153
Hey,

1252
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:10,770
you know,

1253
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:13,520
here's the broader integration.

1254
01:17:13,760 --> 01:17:14,061
Okay,

1255
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:16,000
so this

1256
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:25,700
one for the scenario because
as far as I'm concerned,

1257
01:17:25,910 --> 01:17:26,743
he was

1258
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:29,000
useless.

1259
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,900
Teammates who is helping,

1260
01:17:33,630 --> 01:17:34,020
correct.

1261
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:35,570
What is fair,

1262
01:17:35,780 --> 01:17:40,780
who had helped those idiots
farther rushes over to him.

1263
01:17:42,630 --> 01:17:47,630
And his loss and supports have been this
notion that he was wrong and I thought

1264
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:51,973
you,

1265
01:17:56,740 --> 01:17:57,573
yeah,

1266
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:03,683
way more

1267
01:18:04,820 --> 01:18:07,650
than he had a son who was a star.

1268
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:10,450
Then she had a son who is in good versus.

1269
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:12,950
Yes,

1270
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:17,210
absolutely you gave the wrong choice.

1271
01:18:17,540 --> 01:18:19,620
He sacrificed in some school,

1272
01:18:19,710 --> 01:18:20,630
in part,

1273
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:26,180
she helped them save face for
game that's not acceptable.

1274
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:30,790
So here's what you tell them to tilt.

1275
01:18:33,300 --> 01:18:38,300
It doesn't matter if you indicate that's
what the production side of it and

1276
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,510
better knowing what it meant.

1277
01:18:43,990 --> 01:18:45,310
But who knows what that means.

1278
01:18:45,940 --> 01:18:49,830
If you tell a joke or not and
maybe they're going to walk again,

1279
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:51,033
go,

1280
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:52,360
you're an alien

1281
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,920
lg right out because obviously,

1282
01:18:57,750 --> 01:18:59,900
and he got mad with you.

1283
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:01,530
So what does it mean?

1284
01:19:01,630 --> 01:19:02,500
Say that.

1285
01:19:02,770 --> 01:19:04,810
And what do you mean by that?

1286
01:19:04,811 --> 01:19:05,950
And Go,

1287
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:06,461
well,

1288
01:19:06,461 --> 01:19:07,300
I don't know what it needs,

1289
01:19:07,301 --> 01:19:08,320
but it's a good thing.

1290
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,760
So what do you mean by that?

1291
01:19:14,260 --> 01:19:15,290
Here's grabbing me

1292
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:19,280
a little bit.

1293
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:25,920
Because other people would
just like to dislike.

1294
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:27,531
Unless you walk.

1295
01:19:27,531 --> 01:19:29,870
The children who have a goal for everyone,

1296
01:19:29,950 --> 01:19:31,200
dislikes them.

1297
01:19:34,070 --> 01:19:35,160
Don't let the children

1298
01:19:38,700 --> 01:19:43,480
take retention so that other people will
punish them because you don't have the

1299
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:44,713
discipline.

1300
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,830
People don't find that.

1301
01:19:46,900 --> 01:19:51,680
A lot of people make time for it,

1302
01:19:51,750 --> 01:19:52,583
so

1303
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,280
let's take that apart.

1304
01:19:59,630 --> 01:20:04,630
The first thing is ms dot Garcia's
hierarchy in order to hire their answer is

1305
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:05,953
no,

1306
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:11,360
it's a fire or it's the
set of all possible.

1307
01:20:12,200 --> 01:20:15,810
However you guys do in a society time.

1308
01:20:16,150 --> 01:20:19,880
There's higher that
transforms the hierarchy,

1309
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:24,010
the civics and the hierarchies.

1310
01:20:24,310 --> 01:20:25,143
Jane,

1311
01:20:25,220 --> 01:20:27,450
the fact that the higher rebate,

1312
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:32,950
and so you've been in hierarchy as a
structures to a multitude of possible

1313
01:20:33,931 --> 01:20:36,240
higher that's going to change.

1314
01:20:36,241 --> 01:20:40,920
His life continues and so what were
your children is not even master's out

1315
01:20:40,921 --> 01:20:42,890
higher than you want them to,

1316
01:20:42,900 --> 01:20:44,720
children's to be the master of the sand,

1317
01:20:44,721 --> 01:20:47,310
the whole possible higher ed.

1318
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:49,890
Then no matter how
things change their rate,

1319
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:51,040
see,

1320
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:51,180
well,

1321
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:54,150
how is it for things to change?

1322
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:58,050
Answer this way so that people
will invite you to play.

1323
01:20:59,230 --> 01:20:59,700
Right?

1324
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:04,700
There's the Google Group for children
raising children is really rule.

1325
01:21:05,250 --> 01:21:06,083
One of the things.

1326
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:08,660
This is something who's present,

1327
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:10,250
who's been anointed

1328
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:13,260
to agendas.

1329
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:18,550
It's really good for
children to play Nice.

1330
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,221
First of all,

1331
01:21:20,221 --> 01:21:25,221
if you have children in play
because you know that they asked us,

1332
01:21:26,050 --> 01:21:31,050
they will rough and tumble play with you
until you are completely exhausted and

1333
01:21:33,061 --> 01:21:34,070
they're not even.

1334
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,250
They explained

1335
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,260
it to push to the edge,

1336
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:48,190
so I knew this new fondant
harvest is the pacer gs and

1337
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:57,550
perhaps a little more quiet people.

1338
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:01,350
He wrote a book called
Athletic Neuroscience.

1339
01:22:04,280 --> 01:22:08,040
He just started placer in separate places

1340
01:22:10,470 --> 01:22:15,030
and he didn't want to work on graphs and
showing that in order to social life.

1341
01:22:15,700 --> 01:22:20,700
So far it hasn't been in compliance
and here's the cool thing,

1342
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:29,120
I guess in some instances postmodern
to peak of the patriarch of purity,

1343
01:22:30,240 --> 01:22:35,240
so you've taken into
combat menial ended up.

1344
01:22:37,970 --> 01:22:40,970
You give them an opportunity to apply

1345
01:22:45,940 --> 01:22:48,540
the next time that you
bring to the same place.

1346
01:22:49,290 --> 01:22:52,000
You can measure how much work
they'll open the floor to

1347
01:22:55,050 --> 01:22:57,470
say work or how hard.

1348
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:02,630
I'll decide street spring to the panel
and so we can get an estimate of the

1349
01:23:02,990 --> 01:23:07,990
nation because playing harder
work and that's really hard.

1350
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:10,903
So

1351
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:14,313
one

1352
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:17,283
issue.

1353
01:23:17,690 --> 01:23:19,930
So that's over the place.

1354
01:23:21,370 --> 01:23:26,370
Now let's grab a run rate is 10 percent
the Hubbard and that really me people

1355
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:34,933
getting

1356
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:37,413
in

1357
01:23:38,810 --> 01:23:39,643
the parking lot,

1358
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,750
so now really been little stuff.

1359
01:23:43,751 --> 01:23:48,751
If you think that moved for healing,

1360
01:24:00,550 --> 01:24:02,350
Marvin and he like

1361
01:24:04,680 --> 01:24:09,680
walked into the fear is going

1362
01:24:11,930 --> 01:24:12,763
to

1363
01:24:18,410 --> 01:24:20,610
and don't have kids.

1364
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:46,100
Ten percent

1365
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:55,100
skirt

1366
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:09,920
because that one

1367
01:25:12,520 --> 01:25:14,180
little thing.

1368
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:21,650
No wonder you're not psychopathic
individuals wondering nicely,

1369
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,710
they know

1370
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:34,130
the rules for playing someone's 30
times or not the with playing someone

1371
01:25:37,070 --> 01:25:42,070
so plate repeatedly and what have
you observed in your time together in

1372
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:45,650
situations?

1373
01:25:45,650 --> 01:25:50,650
Little different little
that comes bouncing ball.

1374
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,590
So now is your number.

1375
01:25:53,870 --> 01:25:54,703
You lost.

1376
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,690
You have to preach this complaint.

1377
01:25:57,940 --> 01:25:59,760
That's now big.

1378
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:01,733
That's all.

1379
01:26:15,010 --> 01:26:15,843
Yep.

1380
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:26,920
I don't think so.

1381
01:26:28,290 --> 01:26:32,970
To start studying my absolute miracle

1382
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,270
that divergence doesn't.

1383
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:40,720
He about to play even harass.

1384
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:43,020
It's so basic.

1385
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:48,150
It doesn't even human
that is deeper than human.

1386
01:26:48,750 --> 01:26:50,850
It's real and it's epic.

1387
01:26:50,890 --> 01:26:55,890
It's interesting interaction and it's
not just the that would seem so no.

1388
01:26:57,020 --> 01:26:58,790
Chimpanzees is blue,

1389
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,540
pink and they're really,

1390
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:04,900
really strong six times
and sprawled with nail

1391
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:12,830
fungus growing up and that happens
is people have just passed.

1392
01:27:13,990 --> 01:27:16,490
It's like gym

1393
01:27:20,350 --> 01:27:23,960
and this is interesting girl,

1394
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:29,370
and so getting discovered in
the 1974 chips are tribal.

1395
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:31,473
It improv over

1396
01:27:33,690 --> 01:27:38,690
territory and there's a river that's
the payoff and our chimpanzees is habit.

1397
01:27:40,900 --> 01:27:45,620
The Kale or the chimpanzees
and the juvenile patrol,

1398
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:49,620
the perimeters is your support by fire.

1399
01:27:49,900 --> 01:27:52,170
For Jim to have them,

1400
01:27:52,280 --> 01:27:55,890
if they have a sense of quantity.

1401
01:27:56,460 --> 01:27:57,610
If five chairs

1402
01:28:00,130 --> 01:28:00,963
pits,

1403
01:28:01,490 --> 01:28:06,140
I actually knew that literally
that's the CPG and gyms

1404
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,300
and they will eat them alive.

1405
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:16,050
So there isn't a lot of empathy.

1406
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:22,080
Think about when you think about the

1407
01:28:23,710 --> 01:28:27,030
direction and you might think and like,

1408
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:27,870
yeah,

1409
01:28:27,870 --> 01:28:30,910
maybe it's your contents
and it's something else.

1410
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:33,440
Men,

1411
01:28:33,440 --> 01:28:34,273
he,

1412
01:28:34,860 --> 01:28:35,960
we'll start wondering very,

1413
01:28:35,961 --> 01:28:36,794
very rapidly

1414
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:40,550
so you have to score.

1415
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:42,330
You're absolutely

1416
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:48,070
horrifying book.

1417
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:49,050
So read it.

1418
01:28:51,420 --> 01:28:52,253
So

1419
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:58,480
just the gym's creatures
and so let's look at a gym.

1420
01:29:01,830 --> 01:29:02,663
Basically

1421
01:29:04,430 --> 01:29:05,263
how

1422
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:11,570
moving the ball in that gym and then my
feet water to answer the most powerful

1423
01:29:14,120 --> 01:29:14,953
tyrannical

1424
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:19,020
rule is how

1425
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:22,673
that happens.

1426
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,920
You know what happens to tyler juice?

1427
01:29:26,550 --> 01:29:31,550
They had an off day and to subordinates
you each gang up to make a one and a

1428
01:29:35,671 --> 01:29:36,850
half super gimp

1429
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:40,423
right?

1430
01:29:40,710 --> 01:29:45,660
So here's the gym tyrants
need gloved hands,

1431
01:29:46,620 --> 01:29:49,410
so how do you never yourself as Jim,

1432
01:29:49,740 --> 01:29:54,740
if you want to be at the IRA and have
preferential access to our announcer,

1433
01:29:58,500 --> 01:30:03,480
is engage in mutually reciprocal
interactions with your peers.

1434
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:06,540
The chance to stay here,

1435
01:30:06,541 --> 01:30:07,374
stay with me,

1436
01:30:10,170 --> 01:30:14,940
are the ones that have friends that are
rolling through the permanent as Asian

1437
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:15,773
Pacific,

1438
01:30:16,690 --> 01:30:20,850
but also be mailed and so have
you been involved with chimps,

1439
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,640
patriarchal utility,

1440
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:26,170
a and beans locked

1441
01:30:27,890 --> 01:30:28,723
situation,

1442
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:32,690
and so that speaks to a
broader edtech is sacred,

1443
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:39,440
that you can see this sort of thing
throughout the Amazon thing is seems to

1444
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:46,420
stabilize social as is now.

1445
01:30:46,480 --> 01:30:49,010
Maybe the simple avenue,

1446
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:51,270
the Lord's prayer,

1447
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:57,480
but we're doing simple and the idea
that our higher radical patriarchy,

1448
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:05,460
which is a word that nobody
thinks her cheap camera reviews,

1449
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:10,490
passion that comes from the idea that
a that are hierarchies of radical which

1450
01:31:12,061 --> 01:31:12,850
they aren't,

1451
01:31:12,850 --> 01:31:16,030
and it can be done that way
and being the most reliable,

1452
01:31:16,200 --> 01:31:21,200
nice to obtaining status to see how hard
it is to be expressions of power and

1453
01:31:21,591 --> 01:31:23,970
both of those things are wrong.

1454
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:25,920
They're wrong.

1455
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:26,880
Nonetheless,

1456
01:31:26,880 --> 01:31:30,220
that's the theory of the
flashes in the community.

1457
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:35,830
Not that we haven't have to be honest
that none of that's sufficiently

1458
01:31:36,961 --> 01:31:41,280
sophisticated is honestly super
reasonable explanation of the work.

1459
01:31:42,040 --> 01:31:42,873
So we should.

1460
01:31:44,080 --> 01:31:49,080
All it's doing is dividing us
into drive and it's not sold that.

1461
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:50,350
It's hypothetical.

1462
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:53,123
So

1463
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:03,993
yeah,

1464
01:32:14,750 --> 01:32:17,740
you're saying that's

1465
01:32:19,900 --> 01:32:23,400
not what life is.

1466
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:24,583
Not

1467
01:32:25,980 --> 01:32:27,910
a sequence of the same.

1468
01:32:28,020 --> 01:32:33,020
These sequences on different things and
if you want to be a successful player in

1469
01:32:35,081 --> 01:32:40,081
the set of multiple different days in
Ohio or ethnic and you build subordinate,

1470
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,540
not ethic to piggeries anyone game,

1471
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:45,763
you know,

1472
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:47,273
so when you put

1473
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:54,540
your victory each is and the reason that
this is the best possible for you is

1474
01:32:56,851 --> 01:32:59,520
that you get invited a number of pain.

1475
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:01,463
And so let's

1476
01:33:05,470 --> 01:33:05,790
see.

1477
01:33:05,790 --> 01:33:10,790
So let's say you want the
best for task yourself.

1478
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:14,003
Well,

1479
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:19,620
I'm not going to be around forever and
they're going to have a lot of different

1480
01:33:19,621 --> 01:33:20,454
people,

1481
01:33:21,420 --> 01:33:22,380
single people,

1482
01:33:22,980 --> 01:33:25,110
individual groups with people,

1483
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:27,660
children and adult.

1484
01:33:28,110 --> 01:33:33,110
And what they have to be prepared for
is to interact with people in the best

1485
01:33:33,590 --> 01:33:38,590
offer for them to say you're to.

1486
01:33:39,480 --> 01:33:40,313
People said

1487
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:43,620
it.

1488
01:33:43,620 --> 01:33:48,620
Be shared reading or not share
in any technical deliverable.

1489
01:33:49,060 --> 01:33:49,893
Three,

1490
01:33:50,010 --> 01:33:51,350
it's hard to move here

1491
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:56,830
for data sharing,

1492
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:02,100
like learn like she's engaging
with your parents and what is it?

1493
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:04,981
What is it?

1494
01:34:04,981 --> 01:34:07,200
It's your job when you're socializing.

1495
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:12,360
A child was to before bed is for
me is the attitude of the time.

1496
01:34:14,480 --> 01:34:19,480
Therefore they might give up as it isn't
going to happen in the literature on

1497
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:20,560
antisocial behavior.

1498
01:34:20,690 --> 01:34:22,800
Children is crystal clear on this point.

1499
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:25,500
If your child was not for

1500
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:28,533
sale,

1501
01:34:30,080 --> 01:34:30,913
beautiful.

1502
01:34:31,110 --> 01:34:35,240
After the psychologists and sociologists

1503
01:34:36,900 --> 01:34:41,900
have tried for like six days to figure
out are anti social behavior in older

1504
01:34:43,141 --> 01:34:46,380
children and adolescents
show they have managed

1505
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:50,920
or is pushing

1506
01:34:53,770 --> 01:34:57,050
up your job person that
other children want to play,

1507
01:34:58,110 --> 01:34:59,610
the reason you want

1508
01:35:02,690 --> 01:35:03,523
primary

1509
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:07,090
and so if your children are accepted,

1510
01:35:08,150 --> 01:35:10,490
then you're on the way
with other children,

1511
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:13,110
with a parent,

1512
01:35:13,540 --> 01:35:16,280
but I'm easy to find there is represented

1513
01:35:18,410 --> 01:35:18,990
and they start.

1514
01:35:18,990 --> 01:35:20,520
You reciprocate reciprocally,

1515
01:35:20,660 --> 01:35:22,890
socialize quite.

1516
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:27,350
It's a little bit better job
of really played companions.

1517
01:35:28,220 --> 01:35:32,270
Then you could just stand back and you
have to be around when something breaks

1518
01:35:32,271 --> 01:35:34,010
down and the system doesn't work.

1519
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:35,560
When you haven't been here as a resource,

1520
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:39,470
but basically for first
of all it was going say,

1521
01:35:39,630 --> 01:35:40,170
you know,

1522
01:35:40,170 --> 01:35:45,170
you know what is so glad
and have asked for it,

1523
01:35:49,190 --> 01:35:54,190
so you're trying to make your child's
maximum weight on the world made up of a

1524
01:35:57,261 --> 01:36:02,261
sequence of higher parents score and so
if you want the child could be the sort

1525
01:36:03,711 --> 01:36:08,710
of person who's invited to
participate in what our higher self

1526
01:36:10,220 --> 01:36:13,610
and how much the child might do that.

1527
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:14,220
Well,

1528
01:36:14,220 --> 01:36:19,220
they have two separate
will take turns right?

1529
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:23,240
You have to find out what
other people want to be.

1530
01:36:23,330 --> 01:36:28,330
They want to play too
sophisticated ethical rules
before know if you're playing.

1531
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:35,450
If they are planning
for what are they like?

1532
01:36:35,870 --> 01:36:37,490
If somebody doesn't follow the airplane,

1533
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:40,180
one and emotional person,

1534
01:36:40,190 --> 01:36:45,190
they revert to the behavior of the little
two year old temper tantrum diversity.

1535
01:36:46,220 --> 01:36:48,920
Here's the crash on the floor.

1536
01:36:49,490 --> 01:36:52,250
It's not funny because we played.

1537
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:54,620
If you don't lose them
nice and no one else.

1538
01:36:54,621 --> 01:36:57,950
Different winds to help
with someone like that

1539
01:36:59,810 --> 01:37:04,810
and that's all know any stamps
has been put up with that.

1540
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:11,700
Like if they find out their
potential partner is a two year old,

1541
01:37:13,350 --> 01:37:14,340
he's war,

1542
01:37:14,580 --> 01:37:18,630
they just stop and go find another gig
because that's exactly what happened.

1543
01:37:19,150 --> 01:37:24,150
Want that again and make sure that
they're better to never let them loose in

1544
01:37:25,721 --> 01:37:26,554
anything.

1545
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,580
They don't get any prior.

1546
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:28,911
Well,

1547
01:37:28,911 --> 01:37:29,890
I want it

1548
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:32,273
long.

1549
01:37:32,660 --> 01:37:33,493
You don't want it.

1550
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:37,460
You don't like your kid
is unsophisticated manner.

1551
01:37:37,970 --> 01:37:41,420
That's not the same thing on the other.

1552
01:37:41,670 --> 01:37:43,240
Had the

1553
01:37:45,090 --> 01:37:46,500
back back.

1554
01:37:46,910 --> 01:37:47,780
You shouldn't be no.

1555
01:37:56,160 --> 01:37:56,993
Right.

1556
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:58,740
So you might take apart.

1557
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:00,473
What does it mean?

1558
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:04,143
Superbowl.

1559
01:38:04,950 --> 01:38:07,310
Repeat again.

1560
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:24,690
And then walk down.

1561
01:38:29,790 --> 01:38:30,623
It was

1562
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:36,360
already built into the
interaction that we all are.

1563
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:37,913
What are we getting?

1564
01:38:38,050 --> 01:38:40,040
Really understand her though.

1565
01:38:42,040 --> 01:38:45,370
So imagine you're watching a wall

1566
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:49,270
to that

1567
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:52,593
way.

1568
01:38:53,340 --> 01:38:53,900
Right?

1569
01:38:53,900 --> 01:38:54,733
And so.

1570
01:38:54,830 --> 01:38:55,663
No,

1571
01:38:58,870 --> 01:38:59,703
no,

1572
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:01,993
that's fine.

1573
01:39:04,920 --> 01:39:06,300
Why did you pass

1574
01:39:10,050 --> 01:39:12,210
out now

1575
01:39:17,770 --> 01:39:18,700
the reason

1576
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,840
why they want to

1577
01:39:26,540 --> 01:39:27,900
pass down until

1578
01:39:32,590 --> 01:39:33,860
they don't want to find it because

1579
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:41,640
that

1580
01:39:51,820 --> 01:39:52,653
way

1581
01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:56,483
it's

1582
01:39:58,710 --> 01:39:59,550
written down.

1583
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:02,953
So

1584
01:40:08,390 --> 01:40:13,390
what happens if the wall
was where all the breath,

1585
01:40:17,060 --> 01:40:19,140
the whole

1586
01:40:27,350 --> 01:40:28,183
why

1587
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:32,320
people weren't

1588
01:40:33,830 --> 01:40:36,140
allowed to eat

1589
01:40:43,370 --> 01:40:46,710
and so basically say is

1590
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:49,870
not useful.

1591
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:51,620
Useless.

1592
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:52,453
Most.

1593
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:57,193
Yeah.

1594
01:41:00,420 --> 01:41:01,253
So

1595
01:41:03,070 --> 01:41:05,650
I know what I will

1596
01:41:09,120 --> 01:41:09,953
do

1597
01:41:14,080 --> 01:41:16,030
my status,

1598
01:41:16,570 --> 01:41:19,480
and he gets ball hunting the next day.

1599
01:41:20,180 --> 01:41:20,951
So you might think,

1600
01:41:20,951 --> 01:41:25,951
well let's proceed with the loyalty
that is don't care this next year of the

1601
01:41:30,370 --> 01:41:32,670
preacher that's wrong.

1602
01:41:32,980 --> 01:41:33,880
And then you might say,

1603
01:41:33,881 --> 01:41:37,190
well that's the rule that
will call it that strong,

1604
01:41:39,330 --> 01:41:40,320
have rules.

1605
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:43,633
The

1606
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:47,050
rule say actually

1607
01:41:49,670 --> 01:41:51,370
what they're doing with the rules.

1608
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:53,920
That's how we got our rules.

1609
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:58,170
That's how our rules we have to know.

1610
01:42:00,230 --> 01:42:04,180
And then in walks and then in stories.

1611
01:42:04,870 --> 01:42:06,620
That's what our religious stories are,

1612
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:12,080
the consequences as watching what the
academic and then transporting that into

1613
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:18,300
the store and continue on that story
adds to the story of good decisions.

1614
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,713
Let's say

1615
01:42:21,030 --> 01:42:22,740
why do you want to watch that sport?

1616
01:42:22,900 --> 01:42:26,980
Because you want to know how to at the
descended from the gates and that's what

1617
01:42:26,981 --> 01:42:31,981
that story and as the movies or books
or religious narratives are about,

1618
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:37,950
that's where everything is at a rigorous
level and the reason is because that's

1619
01:42:39,581 --> 01:42:44,190
what the world is native and that's what
we need to know so that he might be.

1620
01:42:44,430 --> 01:42:45,770
So here's something to think about.

1621
01:42:47,200 --> 01:42:49,330
I'll give you the symbolic participation,

1622
01:42:50,320 --> 01:42:55,320
so there's this idea of Christianity
not talking about this from a religious

1623
01:42:55,361 --> 01:42:56,194
perspective.

1624
01:42:57,050 --> 01:42:59,120
I'm talking about this Andrew,

1625
01:42:59,160 --> 01:42:59,993
the last

1626
01:43:02,340 --> 01:43:03,173
four games,

1627
01:43:08,360 --> 01:43:13,360
so there's this idea of in
Christ he is the king of pain.

1628
01:43:16,630 --> 01:43:21,630
He's running to take that part so that
you have a higher whatever it is and

1629
01:43:22,391 --> 01:43:23,480
they're so unhappy to talk,

1630
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:27,110
so that's the first half is necessary.

1631
01:43:27,300 --> 01:43:32,300
The problem with that higher mission to
tell a story about how the best talking

1632
01:43:34,120 --> 01:43:34,953
to your team,

1633
01:43:35,200 --> 01:43:37,440
like what we were doing the best.

1634
01:43:37,660 --> 01:43:41,000
I know you're over here,

1635
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:44,410
maybe it's hockey,

1636
01:43:44,680 --> 01:43:45,513
soccer,

1637
01:43:45,730 --> 01:43:46,563
plumbing,

1638
01:43:46,570 --> 01:43:47,403
law,

1639
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:48,393
business.

1640
01:43:48,510 --> 01:43:53,510
Our goals are and the
thing that's after 12

1641
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:56,313
out

1642
01:43:57,360 --> 01:44:02,360
as something that's whatever
is the department across
of things that are at the

1643
01:44:03,510 --> 01:44:04,343
park.

1644
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,910
This is

1645
01:44:08,610 --> 01:44:12,430
normal and he wanted to
steal some character to

1646
01:44:16,400 --> 01:44:18,040
character and you want a good good.

1647
01:44:18,050 --> 01:44:18,780
Sheriff says,

1648
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:23,780
if you don't want to just tell
a story about some guy named

1649
01:44:26,510 --> 01:44:27,343
John.

1650
01:44:27,680 --> 01:44:32,680
Woke up at six and then he
said four times in 20 times

1651
01:44:35,450 --> 01:44:36,740
and walked into the bathroom.

1652
01:44:40,540 --> 01:44:43,580
You know how to move your mouth off.

1653
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,043
Dysplasia.

1654
01:44:51,030 --> 01:44:51,863
Good

1655
01:44:52,990 --> 01:44:53,823
ingredients,

1656
01:44:53,950 --> 01:44:56,960
good across a bunch of people
and you want him to abstract.

1657
01:44:56,980 --> 01:44:58,820
The summons was evil.

1658
01:44:59,150 --> 01:45:01,510
This is directly across a
bunch of evil character.

1659
01:45:03,750 --> 01:45:07,010
Good character is the bigger than life.

1660
01:45:07,370 --> 01:45:08,360
One thing I

1661
01:45:10,890 --> 01:45:11,810
learned from

1662
01:45:14,930 --> 01:45:18,850
the entire Monday her,

1663
01:45:19,530 --> 01:45:24,530
when you picked up the whole entire
group into groups of candidates

1664
01:45:26,310 --> 01:45:27,440
who people,

1665
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:28,761
then you say,

1666
01:45:28,761 --> 01:45:28,941
well,

1667
01:45:28,941 --> 01:45:33,941
we're going to average across most app
with the opposite Google Person Dato's

1668
01:45:35,331 --> 01:45:36,230
goals 10.

1669
01:45:38,650 --> 01:45:39,820
Let's say there are thousands

1670
01:45:41,330 --> 01:45:43,110
out of anything.

1671
01:45:43,260 --> 01:45:45,630
I'm just asking what the still images.

1672
01:45:47,320 --> 01:45:48,153
Maybe get

1673
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:50,943
one.

1674
01:45:51,330 --> 01:45:52,330
What that one is,

1675
01:45:52,450 --> 01:45:55,450
what's applicable across the
entire set and ask people.

1676
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:58,050
That's a design thing.

1677
01:46:00,380 --> 01:46:05,380
That's what it is and so the Christian
is Christ paid me be diesel vehicles.

1678
01:46:08,841 --> 01:46:13,730
Across the cross is the place
where suffering is accepted.

1679
01:46:14,290 --> 01:46:16,940
The Cross is the dove
and that's the Scott,

1680
01:46:17,840 --> 01:46:19,010
so there's an idea

1681
01:46:21,240 --> 01:46:25,490
of the cross earth is the
center of the universe.

1682
01:46:26,120 --> 01:46:30,230
It's look goal and you see this
bigger staring down at you.

1683
01:46:30,620 --> 01:46:34,850
That's the thing and that's
how it behave in the world.

1684
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:40,150
That's what that represents
and faithful with.

1685
01:46:40,250 --> 01:46:40,820
Nice.

1686
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:40,971
Well,

1687
01:46:40,971 --> 01:46:45,971
here's a way of unpacking
this is associated associated
with use of how is the

1688
01:46:48,220 --> 01:46:49,053
data.

1689
01:46:58,000 --> 01:46:58,833
Yeah.

1690
01:47:04,650 --> 01:47:05,483
Well,

1691
01:47:08,090 --> 01:47:08,923
we

1692
01:47:18,700 --> 01:47:23,700
certainly not say that
the way to the wall is our

1693
01:47:26,700 --> 01:47:27,533
resource.

1694
01:47:30,500 --> 01:47:33,720
I'm not even saying that a little bit

1695
01:47:35,890 --> 01:47:36,150
say,

1696
01:47:36,150 --> 01:47:36,983
well,

1697
01:47:38,670 --> 01:47:41,410
isn't that a clerical staff is,

1698
01:47:42,390 --> 01:47:43,780
well actually no,

1699
01:47:56,750 --> 01:47:58,580
and I'm ready for

1700
01:48:05,190 --> 01:48:06,023
this.

1701
01:48:07,600 --> 01:48:08,720
This is what happens

1702
01:48:10,400 --> 01:48:14,090
with this stance is I'm
willing to take less.

1703
01:48:14,180 --> 01:48:17,100
The world throws at me right now.

1704
01:48:21,420 --> 01:48:22,253
That's

1705
01:48:28,130 --> 01:48:33,130
what's scaring the hell off the
street right here with stances.

1706
01:48:40,580 --> 01:48:41,413
While

1707
01:48:42,560 --> 01:48:43,393
volunteering

1708
01:48:48,100 --> 01:48:51,830
represents willingness to take on.

1709
01:48:55,330 --> 01:48:56,163
The

1710
01:48:58,750 --> 01:49:03,750
best possible strategies
have been successful

1711
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:09,490
is the fact that we both

1712
01:49:11,230 --> 01:49:12,063
sat down

1713
01:49:13,870 --> 01:49:14,703
and

1714
01:49:17,540 --> 01:49:18,820
you see

1715
01:49:21,900 --> 01:49:22,733
these.

1716
01:49:24,580 --> 01:49:29,540
They will be world will be

1717
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:31,993
more

1718
01:49:36,970 --> 01:49:37,803
work.

1719
01:49:39,060 --> 01:49:40,530
That's why I don't know.

1720
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:41,573
That's.

1721
01:49:41,610 --> 01:49:42,720
That's great.

1722
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:48,020
That's it's the same place
center you same idea.

1723
01:49:51,040 --> 01:49:51,940
You're secure.

1724
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:56,970
That's you have tradition and the the
civilization behind you and you have one

1725
01:49:59,110 --> 01:49:59,943
day off.

1726
01:50:00,020 --> 01:50:00,920
That's not enough

1727
01:50:02,460 --> 01:50:05,290
and against the is nice

1728
01:50:07,010 --> 01:50:11,080
and you can use that as a guy and
it's an eight neurological instincts.

1729
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:16,560
It's not something as denominator most
real thing or is far as I can tell and

1730
01:50:17,700 --> 01:50:19,210
associated with certain

1731
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:21,780
ventures,

1732
01:50:23,130 --> 01:50:24,910
courageously unknown.

1733
01:50:25,380 --> 01:50:27,070
Book yourself on the line.

1734
01:50:27,780 --> 01:50:32,380
He mentioned risk yourself ball.

1735
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:34,660
Apparently you haven't any

1736
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,760
great because you're in it's own way.

1737
01:50:39,410 --> 01:50:41,290
There's no else that isn't death.

1738
01:50:43,420 --> 01:50:43,960
Exactly.

1739
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:48,960
Would be able to speeding
up what the candidate is.

1740
01:50:49,620 --> 01:50:53,390
Choose how to confirm it,

1741
01:50:53,410 --> 01:50:55,380
so rule one is the standard experience.

1742
01:50:55,430 --> 01:50:56,340
He told us that,

1743
01:50:56,800 --> 01:51:00,070
and it has thing so amazing.

1744
01:51:00,970 --> 01:51:05,970
This is a kind of ultimate reality idea.

1745
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,460
Position yourself properly.

1746
01:51:09,080 --> 01:51:09,913
You might say,

1747
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:11,913
well,

1748
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:13,233
let's

1749
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:16,120
make her hurt estimates in person,

1750
01:51:17,030 --> 01:51:17,863
or

1751
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:21,040
then you say,

1752
01:51:21,390 --> 01:51:21,550
well,

1753
01:51:21,550 --> 01:51:23,560
what's the fundamental realities of life?

1754
01:51:23,590 --> 01:51:23,891
And say,

1755
01:51:23,891 --> 01:51:24,071
well,

1756
01:51:24,071 --> 01:51:25,460
the suffering and the level

1757
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:31,240
two course

1758
01:51:33,330 --> 01:51:34,163
black,

1759
01:51:34,900 --> 01:51:36,490
it'll be true.

1760
01:51:36,920 --> 01:51:37,860
It's not.

1761
01:51:38,050 --> 01:51:39,420
It's not the finance,

1762
01:51:41,530 --> 01:51:46,530
despite the fact that that's the ability
of the human spirits and prevail is

1763
01:51:47,711 --> 01:51:49,850
more powerful than people.

1764
01:51:54,250 --> 01:51:55,360
That's the fruit.

1765
01:51:55,900 --> 01:51:58,300
You know that first of all,

1766
01:51:58,430 --> 01:52:00,610
know that because you're ashamed that

1767
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:05,060
you don't have people learn.

1768
01:52:05,560 --> 01:52:10,560
Some people who manifests courage
is dire straits and you know what?

1769
01:52:10,961 --> 01:52:11,500
I've lost.

1770
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,530
Just need people like that
and you're not like that.

1771
01:52:14,890 --> 01:52:15,190
They,

1772
01:52:15,190 --> 01:52:20,190
she speaks to the deep as possible and
they know what we can be and you don't do

1773
01:52:21,931 --> 01:52:22,100
it.

1774
01:52:22,100 --> 01:52:24,110
You see people in situations,

1775
01:52:24,350 --> 01:52:27,360
but it's so difficult
that it's truly a miracle.

1776
01:52:27,450 --> 01:52:28,480
It can condense,

1777
01:52:29,240 --> 01:52:32,440
nor I think of people
who work in beautiful.

1778
01:52:32,530 --> 01:52:33,670
That's a good example.

1779
01:52:33,880 --> 01:52:34,780
That's hard,

1780
01:52:35,560 --> 01:52:36,240
right?

1781
01:52:36,240 --> 01:52:41,000
That's in brief every day and it's
not something that uses voice.

1782
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:42,610
It's like it's right there.

1783
01:52:42,611 --> 01:52:44,290
It's just really impossible to be

1784
01:52:51,080 --> 01:52:51,913
and

1785
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:54,930
sleep all the time.

1786
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:03,883
Freedom

1787
01:53:07,680 --> 01:53:08,513
that

1788
01:53:10,060 --> 01:53:11,310
Gypsy told that

1789
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:15,133
after

1790
01:53:17,440 --> 01:53:20,750
childbirth is something
I've never seen anyone else

1791
01:53:27,580 --> 01:53:29,110
unless you been

1792
01:53:35,420 --> 01:53:37,530
exposed to

1793
01:53:39,530 --> 01:53:40,850
what they're afraid of

1794
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:43,533
children,

1795
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:45,730
the children,

1796
01:53:46,580 --> 01:53:47,840
if that makes me stronger,

1797
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:51,840
if you have post traumatic stress,

1798
01:53:52,010 --> 01:53:57,010
the victim of sexual assault
by a stream disorder,

1799
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:04,610
the most effective treatment is to get
you to relive the experience as much as

1800
01:54:05,060 --> 01:54:06,510
possible out of experience,

1801
01:54:09,200 --> 01:54:11,750
and if you do that

1802
01:54:14,930 --> 01:54:18,410
can be buried in the world statement and

1803
01:54:20,820 --> 01:54:22,430
it sounds as avoiding something.

1804
01:54:23,040 --> 01:54:23,873
Voiding.

1805
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:29,530
Break it into manageable pieces and how
it therapy expose themselves to it and

1806
01:54:29,930 --> 01:54:32,560
be able to hear and that's the dragon.

1807
01:54:32,860 --> 01:54:34,200
In the clinical practice,

1808
01:54:35,690 --> 01:54:37,120
what do you most want to?

1809
01:54:37,270 --> 01:54:42,270
What most people would probably
go right to help the state.

1810
01:54:44,150 --> 01:54:47,290
So she was three and I thought

1811
01:54:51,020 --> 01:54:51,853
was

1812
01:54:53,270 --> 01:54:54,970
very neat

1813
01:54:56,650 --> 01:54:57,483
story,

1814
01:54:59,210 --> 01:55:00,420
a stroke,

1815
01:55:01,010 --> 01:55:01,843
Rehab.

1816
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:03,853
Anyways,

1817
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:05,481
I said,

1818
01:55:05,481 --> 01:55:05,631
well,

1819
01:55:05,631 --> 01:55:06,464
I can

1820
01:55:07,880 --> 01:55:09,930
play it for awhile.

1821
01:55:10,120 --> 01:55:10,953
I'm not,

1822
01:55:11,090 --> 01:55:12,950
you come up with the rural from.

1823
01:55:13,640 --> 01:55:14,520
So uh,

1824
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:16,040
he came back and she said,

1825
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:18,250
I want to see an involving

1826
01:55:25,730 --> 01:55:26,563
is.

1827
01:55:28,850 --> 01:55:30,480
And she had his

1828
01:55:31,980 --> 01:55:32,410
story.

1829
01:55:32,410 --> 01:55:33,010
He said,

1830
01:55:33,010 --> 01:55:33,843
no problem.

1831
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:42,270
She was very,

1832
01:55:42,270 --> 01:55:43,103
very imperative.

1833
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:50,120
Not New.

1834
01:55:51,190 --> 01:55:52,660
Any problems we,

1835
01:55:53,770 --> 01:55:54,603
you know,

1836
01:55:54,920 --> 01:55:57,590
art and it's your ground.

1837
01:55:58,490 --> 01:56:03,490
I'll take law that's that need instead
of going to be useful for them and error

1838
01:56:08,040 --> 01:56:11,460
experience with a new
appreciation for life.

1839
01:56:12,370 --> 01:56:13,203
Well

1840
01:56:14,540 --> 01:56:16,050
that would come to the library.

1841
01:56:16,540 --> 01:56:18,080
It seems like dogs.

1842
01:56:18,290 --> 01:56:21,910
So with this room and watched this,

1843
01:56:23,150 --> 01:56:28,150
I'm apt to move from the smaller
three person operation and got her

1844
01:56:34,260 --> 01:56:35,093
house.

1845
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:37,030
She is inside.

1846
01:56:38,030 --> 01:56:41,190
I got here and I certainly can't.

1847
01:56:43,850 --> 01:56:44,683
She

1848
01:56:45,610 --> 01:56:46,710
take them all black.

1849
01:56:49,580 --> 01:56:50,413
And then

1850
01:56:53,150 --> 01:56:56,950
she was spending more time
watching less tiny way I think.

1851
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,110
Well she was fine because now watch it.

1852
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:01,480
At some point you asked that you could,

1853
01:57:01,800 --> 01:57:05,840
even if what she did it,

1854
01:57:07,050 --> 01:57:08,960
she was like,

1855
01:57:11,250 --> 01:57:11,700
well,

1856
01:57:11,700 --> 01:57:13,810
so what did she discover?

1857
01:57:15,560 --> 01:57:17,540
What was important

1858
01:57:19,360 --> 01:57:20,193
to us,

1859
01:57:20,550 --> 01:57:24,660
and she didn't discover this depth
was terrifying because it was,

1860
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:30,310
what was you with the
hell off comprehension and
much quicker than she was.

1861
01:57:32,580 --> 01:57:34,500
And she went away thinking,

1862
01:57:35,060 --> 01:57:35,893
oh,

1863
01:57:36,560 --> 01:57:41,560
that I did the thing I was most
afraid of doing your animals.

1864
01:57:43,560 --> 01:57:47,030
Not only am I not more
damaged than reverse,

1865
01:57:47,250 --> 01:57:48,810
I'm actually better than it was.

1866
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:52,550
And so from then on she
got up reference point,

1867
01:57:53,340 --> 01:57:54,380
which is an interesting to.

1868
01:57:54,450 --> 01:57:59,440
I think this is why I'm
initiate first dance

1869
01:58:01,810 --> 01:58:04,390
extraordinary young into
something absolutely terrified,

1870
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,600
genuinely terrified.

1871
01:58:06,780 --> 01:58:08,070
So for the rest of your life,

1872
01:58:08,071 --> 01:58:12,210
they know the difference between what's
actually terrifying must just sort of.

1873
01:58:13,700 --> 01:58:18,470
Because you really need to know that
because you need to go and work with

1874
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,040
patients versus conferences

1875
01:58:22,090 --> 01:58:25,520
she could prepare like reality.

1876
01:58:25,720 --> 01:58:26,553
Like

1877
01:58:28,610 --> 01:58:31,970
most people I example avail,

1878
01:58:32,310 --> 01:58:35,720
despite the real life with Belle

1879
01:58:38,250 --> 01:58:40,620
arte reverse best.

1880
01:58:43,060 --> 01:58:46,130
So you don't have a story real.

1881
01:58:56,030 --> 01:58:56,863
That's

1882
01:59:00,340 --> 01:59:01,840
all right.

1883
01:59:04,060 --> 01:59:04,490
See,

1884
01:59:04,490 --> 01:59:05,850
through the whole group,

1885
01:59:07,380 --> 01:59:08,780
if you even have

1886
01:59:18,970 --> 01:59:23,150
representation from the Ngo community,

1887
01:59:23,410 --> 01:59:25,480
where do you see drop on some open.

1888
01:59:26,610 --> 01:59:27,443
I'm gonna ask

1889
01:59:30,650 --> 01:59:32,100
each forest

1890
01:59:33,880 --> 01:59:34,713
gardens

1891
01:59:37,030 --> 01:59:39,240
if you were to

1892
01:59:43,070 --> 01:59:44,890
stand up straight shoulders.

1893
01:59:46,390 --> 01:59:47,223
Hmm,

1894
01:59:48,110 --> 01:59:48,943
the darkness,

1895
01:59:55,910 --> 01:59:56,743
please

1896
01:59:59,140 --> 01:59:59,973
consider

1897
02:00:01,680 --> 02:00:02,513
me

1898
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:07,450
the same idea

1899
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:14,990
with the spirit,

1900
02:00:19,640 --> 02:00:21,520
the highest

1901
02:00:27,390 --> 02:00:28,820
possibly just

1902
02:00:34,060 --> 02:00:34,893
take

1903
02:00:37,000 --> 02:00:38,140
on the world

1904
02:00:39,740 --> 02:00:40,573
wars

1905
02:00:42,280 --> 02:00:43,113
against

1906
02:00:45,900 --> 02:00:47,020
your own art,

1907
02:01:30,950 --> 02:01:33,800
so when you go to slide though.

1908
02:01:34,200 --> 02:01:34,750
Nice.

1909
02:01:34,750 --> 02:01:35,660
Very cool.

1910
02:01:41,810 --> 02:01:42,643
Well,

1911
02:01:47,740 --> 02:01:49,220
you have

1912
02:01:50,970 --> 02:01:52,120
a question.

1913
02:03:35,210 --> 02:03:40,210
Thank

1914
02:03:47,680 --> 02:03:48,513
you.

1915
02:04:55,700 --> 02:04:56,533
Everyone

1916
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:02,273
seems

1917
02:05:04,860 --> 02:05:05,693
to

1918
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:20,753
be

1919
02:05:43,840 --> 02:05:44,673
a

1920
02:05:46,340 --> 02:05:47,173
lot

1921
02:05:54,530 --> 02:05:55,363
of

1922
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:07,153
this.

1923
02:06:11,030 --> 02:06:11,863
Well,

1924
02:06:12,870 --> 02:06:15,370
the next one is

1925
02:06:18,600 --> 02:06:19,433
the

1926
02:06:28,570 --> 02:06:29,403
call.

1927
02:06:46,990 --> 02:06:48,900
Somebody is reacting,

1928
02:06:51,780 --> 02:06:53,160
exposure resolved.

1929
02:06:55,760 --> 02:06:56,593
Seniors,

1930
02:06:59,340 --> 02:07:00,173
the

1931
02:07:07,260 --> 02:07:09,780
line producer,

1932
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:15,860
there's regular

1933
02:07:18,180 --> 02:07:19,013
tall

1934
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:25,303
are

1935
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:37,473
anger,

1936
02:07:38,990 --> 02:07:39,823
anger,

1937
02:07:41,820 --> 02:07:42,653
so

1938
02:07:46,070 --> 02:07:47,380
he need to be necessarily.

1939
02:07:48,740 --> 02:07:49,590
I think that

1940
02:07:53,940 --> 02:07:54,773
fear

1941
02:07:57,440 --> 02:08:00,220
around what

1942
02:08:02,290 --> 02:08:03,123
we're

1943
02:08:12,310 --> 02:08:13,143
being

1944
02:08:15,670 --> 02:08:16,960
punished for your face.

1945
02:08:17,720 --> 02:08:18,900
It's so

1946
02:08:34,800 --> 02:08:35,633
minimal

1947
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:42,360
and so built up.

1948
02:08:42,940 --> 02:08:45,090
Then instigate

1949
02:09:07,300 --> 02:09:08,133
deeply

1950
02:09:10,310 --> 02:09:11,143
unhappy,

1951
02:09:16,500 --> 02:09:18,690
not depressed

1952
02:09:31,430 --> 02:09:35,560
people

1953
02:09:46,100 --> 02:09:46,933
necessarily.

1954
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:48,540
You think

1955
02:09:53,170 --> 02:09:54,750
that's the other thing

1956
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:59,623
is

1957
02:10:07,090 --> 02:10:10,940
that certain states and then to see

1958
02:10:13,460 --> 02:10:14,293
doing

1959
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,220
political background,

1960
02:10:27,320 --> 02:10:29,500
at least you

1961
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:32,260
got the.

1962
02:10:33,180 --> 02:10:38,180
The people who are on the market,

1963
02:10:40,370 --> 02:10:45,370
conceptual IPA is
political in their world.

1964
02:10:45,471 --> 02:10:50,040
There isn't one of the things
that weren't considered food.

1965
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:53,130
You are

1966
02:10:57,450 --> 02:11:00,040
have receipt for

1967
02:11:02,200 --> 02:11:05,140
what really is.

1968
02:11:06,820 --> 02:11:09,600
Here's something that you've

1969
02:11:11,990 --> 02:11:13,490
collected this perspective.

1970
02:11:15,460 --> 02:11:17,590
There is no such thing.

1971
02:11:17,600 --> 02:11:18,433
That's

1972
02:11:19,490 --> 02:11:21,030
not that they oppose it.

1973
02:11:22,260 --> 02:11:23,870
It isn't a movie

1974
02:11:25,610 --> 02:11:26,443
this,

1975
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:28,310
so if you stand up and say

1976
02:11:34,340 --> 02:11:38,330
that's not acceptable
moving because you are,

1977
02:11:39,640 --> 02:11:44,640
you're an hour of the dominant group and
whatever you awkward regardless of why

1978
02:11:48,120 --> 02:11:53,120
you're outdated or regardless of making
sure opinion is nothing much you your

1979
02:11:58,250 --> 02:11:59,083
a

1980
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:05,080
framework and so one of

1981
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:09,610
the hippies I believe

1982
02:12:11,710 --> 02:12:16,710
and I do believe and I do
consent to propositions that are

1983
02:12:23,270 --> 02:12:26,800
game and they're very happy with them.

1984
02:12:27,740 --> 02:12:32,690
I'm not playing pool and so they
don't know what to do about.

1985
02:12:32,691 --> 02:12:36,550
That is definitely a far right.

1986
02:12:36,640 --> 02:12:37,473
All right.

1987
02:12:38,290 --> 02:12:39,123
Then

1988
02:12:41,840 --> 02:12:42,673
maybe

1989
02:12:46,080 --> 02:12:47,240
that's convenient,

1990
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:50,780
so it's easier to demonize.

1991
02:12:50,781 --> 02:12:53,370
That is to again,

1992
02:13:00,070 --> 02:13:00,903
more

1993
02:13:06,570 --> 02:13:07,403
rights

1994
02:13:12,990 --> 02:13:14,180
in our family.

1995
02:13:15,220 --> 02:13:17,120
Stress is

1996
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:21,450
certainly not the case.

1997
02:13:21,570 --> 02:13:26,380
The reason that I'm very pleased about it,

1998
02:13:38,530 --> 02:13:39,363
promoting

1999
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:44,370
the weapons of the state,

2000
02:13:56,250 --> 02:13:58,370
certainly more nobody's met

2001
02:14:01,340 --> 02:14:02,173
how

2002
02:14:12,100 --> 02:14:12,933
you

2003
02:14:21,040 --> 02:14:21,873
know

2004
02:14:24,010 --> 02:14:27,960
each day to day you have

2005
02:14:31,110 --> 02:14:31,943
no.

2006
02:15:25,420 --> 02:15:26,253
You

2007
02:15:34,810 --> 02:15:38,450
use his art on the wall.

2008
02:15:53,810 --> 02:15:54,643
Was

2009
02:15:56,860 --> 02:15:57,693
it

2010
02:16:00,330 --> 02:16:01,163
just.

2011
02:16:08,000 --> 02:16:13,000
I don't know what happened is
exactly what I'm thinking of.

2012
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:16,473
The most powerful

2013
02:16:25,810 --> 02:16:26,740
way to gain

2014
02:16:29,930 --> 02:16:30,763
the story.

2015
02:16:32,160 --> 02:16:32,993
Her

2016
02:16:36,760 --> 02:16:37,593
name

2017
02:16:39,950 --> 02:16:40,783
is

2018
02:16:42,420 --> 02:16:47,150
4 million people want hard to sustain,

2019
02:16:55,150 --> 02:16:55,983
sustain,

2020
02:16:56,490 --> 02:16:57,323
total

2021
02:17:05,430 --> 02:17:06,263
opposite,

2022
02:17:09,190 --> 02:17:10,023
but

2023
02:17:12,740 --> 02:17:13,573
this is

2024
02:17:20,630 --> 02:17:22,120
the statement that

2025
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:29,370
was first of all he wants

2026
02:17:39,090 --> 02:17:39,923
is

2027
02:17:45,380 --> 02:17:47,260
an innocent.

2028
02:17:48,520 --> 02:17:49,540
I'm not saying I'm like,

2029
02:17:49,541 --> 02:17:49,830
Whoa,

2030
02:17:49,830 --> 02:17:50,663
will you

2031
02:17:52,390 --> 02:17:53,223
not

2032
02:17:58,340 --> 02:17:59,410
be in

2033
02:18:01,110 --> 02:18:01,943
opposition

2034
02:18:04,200 --> 02:18:06,610
if you're and you're not

2035
02:18:09,740 --> 02:18:10,573
that

2036
02:18:12,520 --> 02:18:13,720
the packard,

2037
02:18:14,590 --> 02:18:19,590
then they're independent party and so
so far span and the consequences said

2038
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:28,780
world needs and then the rest are

2039
02:18:30,460 --> 02:18:32,560
still very stressful.

2040
02:18:33,240 --> 02:18:36,140
You I very.

2041
02:18:38,790 --> 02:18:39,623
For

2042
02:18:41,230 --> 02:18:42,063
some

2043
02:18:43,530 --> 02:18:44,990
of you

2044
02:18:47,730 --> 02:18:49,430
written pieces,

2045
02:18:49,640 --> 02:18:51,090
how is it

2046
02:18:55,470 --> 02:18:56,303
making

2047
02:18:59,110 --> 02:18:59,943
sense

2048
02:19:12,170 --> 02:19:13,003
so far?

2049
02:19:28,650 --> 02:19:29,560
This

2050
02:19:31,700 --> 02:19:32,533
last

2051
02:19:34,640 --> 02:19:35,473
the

2052
02:19:43,140 --> 02:19:44,670
stuff then

2053
02:19:50,350 --> 02:19:51,440
radical.

2054
02:19:53,070 --> 02:19:57,270
The third one is

2055
02:19:59,140 --> 02:20:04,140
all the support needed me and videos and

2056
02:20:07,700 --> 02:20:11,050
then they posted that
an idea was the balance,

2057
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:13,530
but what happened was

2058
02:20:15,620 --> 02:20:17,800
to say

2059
02:20:19,760 --> 02:20:24,710
it's more guarantees me,

2060
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:26,733
she

2061
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:31,670
changed her pattern

2062
02:20:34,950 --> 02:20:35,783
where

2063
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:44,140
you're trying to do something in the two

2064
02:20:46,530 --> 02:20:47,363
zero.

2065
02:20:53,470 --> 02:20:54,303
She

2066
02:20:55,910 --> 02:20:57,980
was really scared

2067
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:04,753
so

2068
02:21:10,940 --> 02:21:11,773
my

2069
02:21:30,080 --> 02:21:30,913
nipples

2070
02:21:33,480 --> 02:21:34,313
and

2071
02:21:35,610 --> 02:21:37,530
goal in

2072
02:21:40,170 --> 02:21:41,003
selling

2073
02:21:42,840 --> 02:21:45,000
and so that was

2074
02:21:48,750 --> 02:21:49,600
so long

2075
02:21:52,390 --> 02:21:53,223
ago.

2076
02:21:53,810 --> 02:21:55,690
She's real.

2077
02:21:57,670 --> 02:21:59,890
You have to do with seeing new

2078
02:22:01,400 --> 02:22:01,600
in,

2079
02:22:01,600 --> 02:22:04,520
but no means is there is anything

2080
02:22:06,670 --> 02:22:10,830
you leave now I can serious

2081
02:22:16,950 --> 02:22:21,950
know if I don't get it and I
believe that's fundamentally
moving across the that

2082
02:22:25,320 --> 02:22:26,153
yeah,

2083
02:22:28,100 --> 02:22:32,380
Boston substantially more than giving me

2084
02:22:34,430 --> 02:22:35,263
a

2085
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:40,040
position where if

2086
02:22:41,780 --> 02:22:44,740
they were going to ask.

2087
02:22:46,400 --> 02:22:49,120
So what I need the video is a theme.

2088
02:22:49,200 --> 02:22:50,033
I thought

2089
02:22:55,120 --> 02:22:57,480
I the

2090
02:23:02,650 --> 02:23:03,483
decisions

2091
02:23:13,390 --> 02:23:14,223
Eric.

2092
02:23:21,890 --> 02:23:22,650
No,

2093
02:23:22,650 --> 02:23:25,280
I didn't think this

2094
02:23:36,370 --> 02:23:37,203
was

2095
02:23:38,430 --> 02:23:40,570
absolutely school.

2096
02:23:44,550 --> 02:23:45,680
I am still doing.

2097
02:23:50,650 --> 02:23:51,483
Which

2098
02:23:55,750 --> 02:23:56,583
rules

2099
02:24:04,010 --> 02:24:06,590
have.

2100
02:24:07,910 --> 02:24:08,743
These

2101
02:24:10,000 --> 02:24:10,833
are

2102
02:24:12,810 --> 02:24:13,643
all

2103
02:24:17,170 --> 02:24:18,003
discussing,

2104
02:24:27,550 --> 02:24:28,383
discussing,

2105
02:24:33,230 --> 02:24:34,500
you know,

2106
02:24:35,550 --> 02:24:36,383
American

2107
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:43,403
re

2108
02:24:47,410 --> 02:24:48,243
continue.

2109
02:24:55,740 --> 02:25:00,740
You can always get better at
listening and so I've listened to.

2110
02:25:10,370 --> 02:25:11,830
I'm not good at that.

2111
02:25:13,390 --> 02:25:16,290
I would give that courtesy

2112
02:25:22,300 --> 02:25:23,133
still.

2113
02:25:42,350 --> 02:25:43,183
Sometimes

2114
02:25:46,070 --> 02:25:46,903
you

2115
02:26:02,180 --> 02:26:03,013
go

2116
02:26:29,050 --> 02:26:29,883
and

2117
02:26:32,310 --> 02:26:33,143
you need

2118
02:26:36,230 --> 02:26:37,063
good enough

2119
02:26:41,210 --> 02:26:42,043
and it's

2120
02:26:43,430 --> 02:26:46,220
way more aware of your

2121
02:26:48,470 --> 02:26:49,303
cro

2122
02:26:50,420 --> 02:26:51,910
that's happening.

2123
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:58,080
Then I have a whole store that they each

2124
02:27:03,030 --> 02:27:03,880
get

2125
02:27:06,350 --> 02:27:08,630
system healthy

2126
02:27:10,180 --> 02:27:11,013
way

2127
02:27:17,630 --> 02:27:21,300
so it's like Jasmine

2128
02:27:25,120 --> 02:27:25,953
ordinance

2129
02:27:30,120 --> 02:27:30,953
stories,

2130
02:27:32,160 --> 02:27:34,420
but every time I tell the story,

2131
02:27:36,620 --> 02:27:37,453
my

2132
02:27:40,080 --> 02:27:40,913
like

2133
02:27:46,090 --> 02:27:49,810
idea of games.

2134
02:27:50,030 --> 02:27:51,070
Who would be ideal?

2135
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:52,700
Going shoulders.

2136
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:56,890
I know those are the same thing.

2137
02:27:57,210 --> 02:28:02,050
That's why I still don't really know.

2138
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:04,930
I know this

2139
02:28:07,710 --> 02:28:09,770
stack each

2140
02:28:18,380 --> 02:28:19,480
but also

2141
02:28:23,060 --> 02:28:25,370
so you been

2142
02:28:27,800 --> 02:28:28,633
that

2143
02:28:55,630 --> 02:28:56,463
if

2144
02:28:59,550 --> 02:29:00,383
you're afraid of.

2145
02:29:06,050 --> 02:29:10,610
And then delivering a talk,

2146
02:29:12,920 --> 02:29:13,950
you can

2147
02:29:15,870 --> 02:29:16,703
reach

2148
02:29:27,890 --> 02:29:28,723
out

2149
02:29:34,300 --> 02:29:35,133
and

2150
02:29:41,580 --> 02:29:43,170
I listened.

2151
02:29:47,840 --> 02:29:49,250
I'm not

2152
02:29:54,210 --> 02:29:55,043
your

2153
02:29:57,690 --> 02:29:58,480
watch.

2154
02:29:58,480 --> 02:29:59,313
People

2155
02:30:05,110 --> 02:30:06,210
use it.

2156
02:30:07,430 --> 02:30:07,620
Well,

2157
02:30:07,620 --> 02:30:08,453
I haven't got that

2158
02:30:11,540 --> 02:30:12,730
all

2159
02:30:22,700 --> 02:30:23,480
wrong.

2160
02:30:23,480 --> 02:30:24,313
You

2161
02:30:25,780 --> 02:30:26,613
shouldn't be

2162
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:31,320
sorry.

2163
02:30:31,320 --> 02:30:32,430
You don't know.

2164
02:30:32,670 --> 02:30:33,503
No,

2165
02:30:34,490 --> 02:30:35,323
no,

2166
02:30:37,110 --> 02:30:37,943
no.

2167
02:30:39,820 --> 02:30:40,653
You haven't.

2168
02:30:41,250 --> 02:30:44,180
You should know like

2169
02:30:55,600 --> 02:30:56,433
knowing

2170
02:31:02,490 --> 02:31:03,323
the

2171
02:31:05,620 --> 02:31:06,453
area

2172
02:31:09,750 --> 02:31:10,583
around

2173
02:31:13,490 --> 02:31:14,870
delivering depaul.

2174
02:31:15,550 --> 02:31:16,383
No,

2175
02:31:19,220 --> 02:31:20,053
in

2176
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:24,720
real life

2177
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:28,390
what the consequences.

2178
02:31:29,950 --> 02:31:31,200
That's what thinks is normal.

2179
02:31:35,270 --> 02:31:36,103
Pre

2180
02:31:42,670 --> 02:31:47,670
and post with water pollution.

2181
02:31:51,210 --> 02:31:52,370
Describing what?

2182
02:31:53,800 --> 02:31:55,850
Here's the problem and this is

2183
02:31:59,300 --> 02:32:04,300
going to have a war and
see what probate cases.

2184
02:32:08,400 --> 02:32:09,233
Grant

2185
02:32:10,710 --> 02:32:12,320
grant already knew

2186
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:15,533
she was right,

2187
02:32:16,860 --> 02:32:17,693
not

2188
02:32:23,920 --> 02:32:25,990
packs and

2189
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:32,893
he just started

2190
02:32:35,180 --> 02:32:38,220
on the journey and that's not

2191
02:32:41,960 --> 02:32:42,793
own

2192
02:32:45,180 --> 02:32:47,510
for the architect

2193
02:32:51,550 --> 02:32:52,620
to

2194
02:33:03,790 --> 02:33:04,623
the

2195
02:33:12,100 --> 02:33:12,933
rule

2196
02:33:21,710 --> 02:33:22,543
in

2197
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:25,880
rule three

2198
02:33:33,150 --> 02:33:35,160
different people

2199
02:33:38,020 --> 02:33:40,140
who are very fearful

2200
02:33:42,250 --> 02:33:43,083
and

2201
02:33:44,510 --> 02:33:45,343
very,

2202
02:33:45,460 --> 02:33:46,293
very

2203
02:33:47,630 --> 02:33:48,463
bad.

2204
02:33:56,920 --> 02:33:59,980
It's like you're not happy.

2205
02:34:01,160 --> 02:34:03,120
You're bitter about

2206
02:34:08,370 --> 02:34:09,203
working

2207
02:34:10,710 --> 02:34:14,850
way from sharing the good
news take to the shop.

2208
02:34:29,050 --> 02:34:29,883
Stop.

2209
02:34:33,200 --> 02:34:34,033
None

2210
02:34:35,900 --> 02:34:37,780
of that.

2211
02:34:41,500 --> 02:34:42,690
So you.

2212
02:34:54,590 --> 02:34:55,423
Yeah,

2213
02:35:10,770 --> 02:35:11,603
so

2214
02:35:22,060 --> 02:35:22,893
learn

2215
02:35:24,280 --> 02:35:25,113
how to

2216
02:35:26,750 --> 02:35:27,583
say

2217
02:35:41,830 --> 02:35:42,663
here's the

2218
02:35:44,870 --> 02:35:45,703
consequences

2219
02:35:48,090 --> 02:35:50,860
and be the consequence.

2220
02:35:51,380 --> 02:35:53,650
Both his brains out in the bunker,

2221
02:35:53,670 --> 02:35:56,400
under related in Europe is on fire.

2222
02:35:57,600 --> 02:35:58,680
What was the motivation?

2223
02:35:59,580 --> 02:36:00,780
Suicidal apocalypse.

2224
02:36:02,240 --> 02:36:06,830
That's how do you generate a map?

2225
02:36:07,390 --> 02:36:12,390
How do you get profitable and
stayed in that matter anymore?

2226
02:36:13,280 --> 02:36:18,120
Thoughts and get to an agreement
after the self means and you let your

2227
02:36:18,450 --> 02:36:19,940
imagination run wild.

2228
02:36:20,250 --> 02:36:23,470
You become a mask and that's it.

2229
02:36:24,400 --> 02:36:29,400
And it wasn't like a date after
World War One was grooved.

2230
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:33,840
Riverside creative capacity.

2231
02:36:34,190 --> 02:36:39,190
I find every decent artwork
measurement lost all their savings and

2232
02:36:46,830 --> 02:36:47,900
it was rotten.

2233
02:36:50,370 --> 02:36:51,203
Terrible.

2234
02:36:54,390 --> 02:36:58,600
And it was just the Guy and knowing that

2235
02:37:03,160 --> 02:37:05,590
is loosely

2236
02:37:07,160 --> 02:37:10,290
resentments and eight.

2237
02:37:12,660 --> 02:37:13,493
Yes,

2238
02:37:18,320 --> 02:37:19,370
we lost him.

2239
02:37:26,930 --> 02:37:27,763
Yeah.

2240
02:37:32,570 --> 02:37:34,180
Logan is

2241
02:37:41,190 --> 02:37:42,023
stories.

2242
02:37:48,160 --> 02:37:48,993
It's

2243
02:37:52,410 --> 02:37:53,243
so the

2244
02:37:58,700 --> 02:38:00,820
reason that I'm doing that.

2245
02:38:05,490 --> 02:38:07,940
Why do you

2246
02:38:17,780 --> 02:38:18,613
cycle

2247
02:38:26,110 --> 02:38:27,780
radical Islam?

2248
02:38:28,550 --> 02:38:30,570
The sovereignty

2249
02:38:49,360 --> 02:38:50,193
consistent.

2250
02:39:04,130 --> 02:39:04,830
Yeah,

2251
02:39:04,830 --> 02:39:05,663
and I'm.

2252
02:39:10,970 --> 02:39:11,803
I'm

2253
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:14,183
overwhelming.

2254
02:39:18,490 --> 02:39:19,890
You have

2255
02:39:22,680 --> 02:39:25,990
to make this all work.

2256
02:39:28,340 --> 02:39:29,173
I knew I

2257
02:39:30,580 --> 02:39:31,690
didn't do it.

2258
02:39:32,870 --> 02:39:33,703
We'll see.

2259
02:39:38,490 --> 02:39:43,100
Thank

2260
02:39:44,920 --> 02:39:46,310
you.

2261
02:40:14,970 --> 02:40:15,803
Well,

2262
02:40:17,130 --> 02:40:18,190
having said that,

2263
02:40:18,210 --> 02:40:21,290
with all these superhero movies,

2264
02:40:26,220 --> 02:40:27,053
more

2265
02:40:30,530 --> 02:40:31,363
expensive,

2266
02:40:35,770 --> 02:40:36,603
most

2267
02:40:37,710 --> 02:40:38,543
expensive.

2268
02:40:39,040 --> 02:40:39,873
That's

2269
02:40:41,600 --> 02:40:42,433
interesting.

2270
02:40:50,430 --> 02:40:54,550
Driving communication world big process

2271
02:40:57,060 --> 02:40:59,740
and so what are.

2272
02:40:59,741 --> 02:41:03,630
What's happening is something
far more significant.

2273
02:41:05,050 --> 02:41:05,883
I think

2274
02:41:07,050 --> 02:41:11,700
we froze our butts itself.

2275
02:41:14,220 --> 02:41:16,240
Forms and

2276
02:41:21,030 --> 02:41:23,690
generally that's the thing.

2277
02:41:24,960 --> 02:41:26,570
They're hearing boxes.

2278
02:41:32,170 --> 02:41:34,770
We started with cities and the kids

2279
02:41:37,220 --> 02:41:38,053
were

2280
02:41:39,230 --> 02:41:39,720
genuine.

2281
02:41:39,720 --> 02:41:40,553
Being

2282
02:41:42,550 --> 02:41:43,383
genuine

2283
02:41:45,810 --> 02:41:46,950
in rowing.

2284
02:41:48,180 --> 02:41:49,540
She said,

2285
02:41:52,460 --> 02:41:53,293
we'd

2286
02:41:54,890 --> 02:41:55,723
say,

2287
02:41:56,200 --> 02:41:56,550
well,

2288
02:41:56,550 --> 02:41:57,383
Mrs

2289
02:42:02,820 --> 02:42:03,653
will

2290
02:42:04,760 --> 02:42:05,593
about

2291
02:42:11,970 --> 02:42:12,803
on

2292
02:42:16,640 --> 02:42:21,640
building their own kids to read six books

2293
02:42:23,670 --> 02:42:24,503
that

2294
02:42:29,290 --> 02:42:30,123
and

2295
02:42:31,330 --> 02:42:32,163
things,

2296
02:42:37,440 --> 02:42:40,240
but it wasn't to drive to the store

2297
02:42:53,460 --> 02:42:54,293
the

2298
02:43:00,790 --> 02:43:02,010
past.

2299
02:43:25,030 --> 02:43:30,030
Thank you.
