1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,363
Trudeau,

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,040
our prime minister's
great example of that.

3
00:00:10,041 --> 00:00:15,041
So back I think it was in
2015 he announced that half
of his cabinet was going

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:20,721
to be women because it was 2015 or some
like muddle headed virtue signaling,

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,540
signaling excuse for not thinking.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,310
I think only 20% or 25% of
the elected mps were female.

7
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:33,510
So the proper balance on
average would it be 25% female,

8
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:35,040
75% male.

9
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,160
What he should've done
was figured out who,

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:41,820
what qualities would make for
a competent cabinet minister,

11
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:45,540
because it's actually quite important
to have competent cabinet ministers and

12
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:50,520
then selected from among his people
for nothing other than competence,

13
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:54,600
but he could virtue signal and then
he set up the most important board,

14
00:00:54,601 --> 00:00:54,991
let's say,

15
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:59,130
of the entire comp country
on a quasi random basis.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,030
Jesus,

17
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,020
how pathetic.

18
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:04,620
He should've been pilloried
by Canadians for that.

19
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,850
But we're so clued out and and also
in this situation that you described,

20
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,590
it's like if I say,

21
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:10,801
well,

22
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:13,710
50% of Trudeau's cabinet
shouldn't have been women.

23
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,520
It's like,

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:14,761
oh,

25
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:15,840
you're a misogynist.

26
00:01:15,841 --> 00:01:16,201
It's like,

27
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:16,860
no,

28
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,980
only 25% of the elected
officials were women.

29
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,761
Now you might say,

30
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,031
well,

31
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:23,610
it would be better if
50% of the were elected.

32
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:24,060
It's like,

33
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,410
maybe it would be better,

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,610
but it didn't happen.

35
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,590
So you can't,

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,110
you can't fix it at the top end.

37
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,340
It was appalling.

38
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,670
So it's a hard argument to make,

39
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:34,921
you know,

40
00:01:34,921 --> 00:01:39,921
because you need to know that there's
more difference within groups then between

41
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:43,320
them in order to be able to come
up with a credible argument,

42
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,130
you know?

43
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,990
And then so yeah.
