1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,500
The fundamental story of
genesis is something like this.

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:11,280
Yeah,

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,860
and it's perhaps the most brilliant
contribution of Judeo Christian thought to

4
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,730
world history.

5
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,953
It's,

6
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,440
it's total impact is
virtually in calculable.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,050
The idea is this,

8
00:00:24,051 --> 00:00:28,190
that chaos can be conceptualized as
something that has an essentially feminine

9
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:32,540
aspect as a matrix and a matrix is a
structure from which other structures

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:37,340
emerge and the story of genesis
makes the hypothesis that logos,

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,780
which is the word of God,

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,500
a phenomenon associated with
speech and communication and logic,

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:45,620
logos,

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:46,453
logic,

15
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,750
rationality,

16
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,430
courage,

17
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,450
exploration,

18
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,830
all combined into a single
entity or trait logos.

19
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:58,100
The combination of logos and chaos
is what brings order into being.

20
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:00,170
That's what the story in genesis means.

21
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,540
It's not a empirical description
of the origin of objects.

22
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:09,320
It's a phenomenological description
of the origin of experience.

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,680
The idea of being that
without the piercing glance
of whatever consciousness is,

24
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,820
whatever the background of experience is,

25
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:24,590
the matrix chaos cannot
be conceptualized as real.

26
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,400
It takes the interplay between the
feminine principle chaos and the masculine

27
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:31,520
principle logos in order to produce being

28
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:37,550
now thoughts of substantial importance
when you give some consideration to the

29
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,710
fact that immediately in genesis,

30
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,700
after the establishment of livable order,

31
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,510
the day of the Yahuah identifies as
the individual human being with logos,

32
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,280
right made in God's image.

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,860
That's the essential
characteristic of the human being.

34
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,630
And what that means is that the
logos that operates in human beings,

35
00:02:00,631 --> 00:02:03,180
which is this capacity to
make order out of chaos,

36
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:07,230
is identical to the principal that gives
rise to the cosmos from a mythological

37
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:08,064
perspective.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,840
So it partakes of the day.

39
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,080
Eddie,

40
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,080
in a very direct sense in so far as being
itself is dependent on its operation.

41
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,150
Okay?

42
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:20,790
Now it's still possible to claim,

43
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,150
given that perspective that a story with
that sort of structure is superstitious

44
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,470
and then it doesn't bear any relationship
to what actually constitutes reality.

45
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:34,950
But you have to understand
that that story old as it is,

46
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:39,951
it's predicated on older stories and it's
on the ground that those older stories

47
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:43,500
established that our entire
concept of natural rights rests.

48
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:48,950
So if you believe that natural rights
have an existence that's more than merely

49
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:50,004
arbitrary,

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,920
the reason you believe that
is because they're predicate.

51
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,920
Those rights are predicated on the
ideas that are expressed in these myths.
