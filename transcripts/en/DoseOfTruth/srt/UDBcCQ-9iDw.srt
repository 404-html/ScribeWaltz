1
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,040
I'm not surprised.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:08,230
I want to thank you because what was
surprising about your electric today?

3
00:00:08,231 --> 00:00:10,190
It was his concept of altruism.

4
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:13,580
I think you've been able to just put
everything together and at the end come

5
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,500
with a higher value of altruism.

6
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,630
And to me it was a surprise.

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,250
You don't come in here and
I have a relationship with
altruism and the one that

8
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:26,360
I find it's difficult for me is that
there's an evolutionary process of my

9
00:00:26,361 --> 00:00:26,810
brain.

10
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,190
It's an organ is developed,

11
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,024
you know,

12
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,580
and,

13
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,840
and I'm amazed at how often
I think of three people,

14
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,020
me and myself and I to the point where
where I've actually written down counter

15
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:41,560
all of the iterations of me,

16
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,050
myself and I and either my thoughts or
my speech or even in someone else's and

17
00:00:45,051 --> 00:00:49,700
you'll get a page and saw them do we
think of wheat as far as I've been able to

18
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:54,440
ascertain is because I have to expend
energy to think about someone else.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,440
And,

20
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:55,781
and,

21
00:00:55,781 --> 00:01:00,781
and yet yet I'm addicted to ease and
comfort because my natural evolution is

22
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:02,360
going to be some comfort.

23
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:02,861
And you hear it in,

24
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:04,430
in alcoholics anonymous.

25
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:04,590
Well,

26
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,480
booze ain't the problem.

27
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:07,010
You're addicted to ease and comfort.

28
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:10,880
How do I overcome my,

29
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,150
what I think is my sense of ease and
comfort to be able to make altruism

30
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,200
a more natural state of being good.

31
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:20,670
Good,

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,503
good question.

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,490
So the question is,

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,180
the first was a comment about the emphasis
in my talk today on altruism in the

35
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,530
second is how do I,

36
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,120
how do people overcome their proclivity
to only act on their own behalf?

37
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:36,541
Okay.

38
00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:41,541
So the first thing I will say is that
I don't believe that what I spoke about

39
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,230
today was in favor of altruism.

40
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,590
And and I,

41
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:47,730
that's not a negative
comment on your question,

42
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,840
but there,

43
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:51,030
so there's a,

44
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:51,510
there's,

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,331
there's a pro,

46
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:54,300
here's a primary religious injunction.

47
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,780
Treat the other person like you
would like to be treated yourself.

48
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,200
That does not mean be
nice to other people.

49
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:06,650
It does not mean sacrifice
yourself excessively for
other people it means think

50
00:02:07,771 --> 00:02:09,270
about the other person has,

51
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,890
if they were you,

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,180
and figure out how you can mutually
interacts to better both of you.

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,600
At the same time you have to
build yourself into the equation.

54
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,980
It's an equation.

55
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:21,570
It's not that.

56
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:23,700
It's not that the others
are more valuable,

57
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,230
it's that we're all valuable,

58
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,220
were equally valuable.

59
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:26,791
And then you think,

60
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:28,440
well how do you remind yourself of that?

61
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:33,000
And the answer to that is through
terror because terror is the genuine

62
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:33,570
motivator.

63
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,470
So they save

64
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,340
fear of God is the
beginning of all wisdom.

65
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,810
Well what does that mean?

66
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,750
It means first that you
don't get away with anything.

67
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,580
And it's really useful to know that
because if you really know that you won't

68
00:02:47,581 --> 00:02:50,580
try to get away with while you still
will because people are stupid but,

69
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,520
but at least it will
mitigate the possibility.

70
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,890
So here,

71
00:02:55,891 --> 00:02:57,360
I'll tell you something that young said,

72
00:02:57,361 --> 00:02:58,080
this is quite,

73
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,960
this is quite profound and,

74
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,550
and it's,

75
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,080
I think the right answer to this question.

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,850
So young believed he was interested
in the emergence of higher morality.

77
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,490
Uh,

78
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:09,350
something that the
developmental psychologist,

79
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:11,530
Sean Piaget was also interested in.

80
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Here's a thought.

81
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,380
We started out as individuals.

82
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,570
Then we learned to play
games with other people,

83
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:17,320
kids,

84
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,450
children learn how to play
games without the children.

85
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:20,410
And that made them social.

86
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,240
So our society is a game.

87
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:26,800
It's a giant game that we're all
playing together voluntarily.

88
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,170
And so children were first
learned how to play the game,

89
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,110
and only later did they
learn the rules of the game.

90
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:35,410
And he learned how to play the game
first and then learn the rules to how to

91
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,244
speak the rules.

92
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:39,850
And then at some point they realized that
they were also creators of the rules.

93
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:45,550
And so that's moral development
on a continual on a,

94
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,600
it's not a continuum,

95
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:46,771
it's,

96
00:03:46,771 --> 00:03:47,061
it's,

97
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:50,020
it's a fractured staircase upward.

98
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,790
But young was interested in elements of
moral action that were higher than that.

99
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,610
And so he conceptualized it symbolically.

100
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,630
So imagine this,

101
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,020
you did this in the last book he
wrote called mysterium connectionists.

102
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,480
So imagine that you're exist so that
your conceptual structures and your

103
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:10,210
emotions are an uneasy
relationship with one another.

104
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,330
So you're sort of a house
divided amongst yourself.

105
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,780
And so what you have to do is you have
to put together your mind and your,

106
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,790
and your emotion so that
they're working as a,

107
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:19,863
as a unit.

108
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,930
And you do that in part by actually being
forthright about what it is that you

109
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,570
want for yourself and to other people.

110
00:04:25,571 --> 00:04:27,010
And to learn how to negotiate that.

111
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:29,110
So that inner tension disappears.

112
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,790
And so now you're a unified,

113
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:36,270
you're a unified entity of emotion and
thought they're not conflicting with one

114
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:36,850
another.

115
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:39,880
And then what you do is
you take that entity,

116
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,780
which is still in some sense separate
from your body because you're not acting

117
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:45,400
these out and you bring
those two together.

118
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,720
And he thought about
that as the psychological
equivalent of the incarnation

119
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,321
had.

120
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:53,140
So it's integrated spirit
integrating with the body.

121
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,610
And what that means is that you take your
emotions and motivations and capacity

122
00:04:57,611 --> 00:05:01,730
for thinking that are now one thing
and you act out those things you.

123
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,340
So you embodied them in the world.

124
00:05:03,341 --> 00:05:05,230
And that's another thing
that brings integrity.

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,340
And then there was a step past out in
the step past that is to understand that

126
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:10,030
there's no deal.

127
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:12,310
So you have the integrated spirit,

128
00:05:12,311 --> 00:05:13,390
mind and body

129
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,390
in opposition to the world.

130
00:05:16,391 --> 00:05:17,020
And this,

131
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,140
the next thing you do is realize that
there is no opposition with the world.

132
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,020
Is that what you are as a,

133
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,811
and this is very,

134
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:23,680
very complicated.

135
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,130
You're walking down the street.

136
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
[inaudible] street is a good example of
this in Toronto and they're decimated

137
00:05:30,161 --> 00:05:30,741
alcoholic,

138
00:05:30,741 --> 00:05:31,361
schizophrenia.

139
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,790
It's littering the landscape so to speak.

140
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,140
You walk around them,

141
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:35,531
you say,

142
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:36,250
well,

143
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,390
that's not me.

144
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:37,691
It's like,

145
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:38,524
yes it is.

146
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,740
It's you in so far as your tendency is
to react in a negative way and to skirt

147
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:45,724
the territory.

148
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,160
It's,

149
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,670
it's a disturbance in your field of being.

150
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,620
It's you now,

151
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:53,500
you don't know what to do about it and I
wouldn't recommend that you do anything

152
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:55,030
because you'd probably just make it worse.

153
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,520
It's a very big problem that's
lying there on the sidewalk.

154
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:02,510
And it may be well beyond
your capacity to fix it.

155
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:05,930
But in so far as it's a
disturbance in your field of being,

156
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,793
it's you,

157
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
it's you and all the problems
that are in the world that,

158
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,070
that you experienced there you,

159
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,720
and so you stop thinking about things
in terms of an opposition between what's

160
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,630
good for you and what's good for the
world because there is no difference.

161
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,430
There's no difference between the two.

162
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:27,760
And that that doesn't mean that the
pathway from what's good for you in your

163
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,460
more limited domain to what's good for
everyone is an easy one to compute.

164
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:31,881
It's very,

165
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:32,750
very difficult.

166
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,040
But there is no,

167
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,590
there is no technical
difference between them,

168
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:37,491
you know?

169
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:42,491
So if I'm engaged in a psychotherapeutic
dialogue with my clients when I'm doing

170
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:43,454
it properly,

171
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,310
it's not like they're learning from me.

172
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,710
It's that we're learning together.

173
00:06:48,711 --> 00:06:52,100
And every time I solved one of their
problems or help them solve one of their

174
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:52,610
problems,

175
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,310
I help myself solve one of my problems.

176
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:55,791
You know,

177
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,680
because people bring to me,

178
00:06:57,681 --> 00:07:02,120
bring into my sessions the terrible
things that go wrong with people in life.

179
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,830
Their partner has cancer,

180
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:04,650
their father's hasn't,

181
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:05,750
father has Alzheimer's,

182
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,640
they're suffering with alcoholism.

183
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,410
Their career is collapsing.

184
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,900
Like these aren't things
that are happening to them.

185
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,420
These are things that happen to everyone.

186
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,230
And to figure out how to solve that for
someone is to figure out how to solve it

187
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:18,801
for yourself.

188
00:07:18,801 --> 00:07:20,300
There's no difference whatsoever.

189
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,350
And so,

190
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,420
and then so there's to know that,

191
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:23,620
to,

192
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,920
to think of that and certainly works in,

193
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,070
in an intimate relationship.

194
00:07:28,071 --> 00:07:31,790
If you think that you're somehow
different than your wife,

195
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:35,630
while certain she's going to
remind you otherwise constantly.

196
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,321
But it's an,

197
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:37,250
it's an error.

198
00:07:37,251 --> 00:07:38,780
It's an error because you're,

199
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,880
you're tied together so tightly that
whatever happens to one inevitably happens

200
00:07:45,261 --> 00:07:45,861
to the other.

201
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:46,790
And that's true in,

202
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:49,280
in the network reality
that we all inhabit.

203
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:50,970
So then the,

204
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:55,520
the terror thing emerges when you start
to realize that those problems that you

205
00:07:55,521 --> 00:08:00,470
don't address that or may be magnified
by your impulsive and foolishly self

206
00:08:00,471 --> 00:08:02,930
centered and instrumental behavior,

207
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:06,140
you're manipulating the world on
behalf of your own narrow interests.

208
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,100
Those,

209
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,260
we'll come back to haunt you.

210
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:13,520
And so it's a terrifying
thing to think through.

211
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,070
But once you think through
it and understand it,

212
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:19,610
then what happens is you're
more afraid of acting selfishly,

213
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,860
then you are willing to do it.

214
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,670
You think,

215
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:22,911
no,

216
00:08:22,911 --> 00:08:23,744
I'm not doing that.

217
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,170
Why?

218
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:28,160
Because I know all hell will break loose
if I do that and I'm not going there.

219
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,770
And so the terror element has a huge one.

220
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:31,420
It makes it,

221
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,730
it,

222
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,180
it,

223
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,210
it fortifies your cause you can't just act

224
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,850
properly.

225
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,130
You don't have the moral
fortitude for that.

226
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,070
You can aim at the good and
run from what's terrible,

227
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:43,760
then you're,

228
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,810
then you're motivated.

229
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,193
So

230
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,853
with your environment,

231
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,240
uh,

232
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,480
reaching out to your environment,

233
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:57,314
doesn't it,

234
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,790
that expenditure of energy
rather as an investment?

235
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:00,781
Yes.

236
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:01,501
It's an investment.

237
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,670
That's a very good way of putting it.

238
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,120
Yes.
