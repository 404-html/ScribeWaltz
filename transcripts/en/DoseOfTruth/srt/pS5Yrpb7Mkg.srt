00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:08,840
Professor Peterson,

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,230
just a two second.

3
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:12,600
Thank you very much for my
community and the Jewish community.

4
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,800
So many people have been inspired by you
to be better people and I wouldn't be

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,820
able to speak to you that saying that.

6
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:18,720
So thank you very much.

7
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,163
Um,

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,493
a couple of things.

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,120
The first thing I wanted to do is make
a quick comment that you might find

10
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:26,520
interesting that in the
Jewish astrological calendar,

11
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:27,330
um,

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,960
we read the release cycle of the five
books of Moses and it just so happens that

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,790
we are reading this part of the,

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,870
of the tourist story.

15
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,131
Very interesting.

16
00:00:35,131 --> 00:00:35,940
That's cool.

17
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,020
And a synchronistic,

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,320
which brings me into a question
that I wanted to ask you about,

19
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,500
which is one question with two
parts about your knowledge of,

20
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:43,840
of,

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,673
of Hebrew.

22
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:45,180
Um,

23
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,240
because if you look at the Torah
scrolls that you find in the synagogue,

24
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:49,350
there are no vowels,

25
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,220
there are no sentences there.

26
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,721
It is a,

27
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:53,430
it is chaos,

28
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:55,620
chaos and order is trying
to be bought into it.

29
00:00:55,621 --> 00:00:58,680
I'm wondering how knowledge
knowledgeable are you of the Hebrew,

30
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:00,200
which has many layers of,

31
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:00,570
of,

32
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,030
of dimension staggering
the ignorant of it.

33
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:04,940
So you know,

34
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,170
I read a lot of commentaries,

35
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,501
right?

36
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,570
I'm trying to zero in on the,

37
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,050
like with each of the phrases
that we went through today,

38
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:15,300
I probably looked at 10
different commentaries.

39
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,523
And so,

40
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:22,090
and then I have this underlying
psychoanalytic knowledge
that it's sort of like

41
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:27,820
if you have a bunch of different templates
to look at things through and then

42
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,910
something shines through all
those templates at the same time,

43
00:01:30,911 --> 00:01:32,110
that's very unlikely.

44
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:33,310
And so then you can,

45
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,363
you know,

46
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,680
a coincidence is one thing,

47
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,410
but five coincidence is that's
no longer a coincidence.

48
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:41,400
That's something else.

49
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,660
And so I think,

50
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,150
I'm hoping that despite
the fact that there's many,

51
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:49,620
many things that I don't know that there's
enough things that I do know to kind

52
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:53,100
of weave my way through this
with some degree of utility,

53
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,180
if not certainty.

54
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,241
Yeah.

55
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,074
Cause I just,

56
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:56,921
which is the second part,

57
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:58,090
which I guess maybe you don't know,

58
00:01:58,091 --> 00:01:58,481
but the,

59
00:01:58,481 --> 00:01:59,314
the Midrash,

60
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:02,950
the Jewish oral stories that date
back almost as long as these stories,

61
00:02:02,951 --> 00:02:05,290
which filling a lot of
mindblowingly crazy,

62
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,124
random,

63
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,140
so many details about these stories.

64
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:10,710
And I was just wondering if you had
encountered any of them before I've

65
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:11,760
encountered some of them,

66
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,301
but again,

67
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:12,870
it's a,

68
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,980
it's well,

69
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:14,551
as you know,

70
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,061
it's a very,

71
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,470
very rich tradition.

72
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:20,040
And so I haven't encountered enough of it.

73
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,420
Were you thinking of anything in specific
specifically in relationship to this

74
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,190
story?

75
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,120
Not In particular.

76
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:27,020
I actually forgot it.

77
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,320
I was,

78
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,820
I was intending to bring you a,

79
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:30,850
a book of midrashic stolen.

80
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,600
That's a hell of a thing to say now.

81
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,151
Well,

82
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:35,600
it just,

83
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,040
I dunno.

84
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,300
I,

85
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,850
I felt like I had to say that.

86
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,720
Um,

87
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:38,961
but yeah,

88
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:40,600
maybe for the exodus version,

89
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,443
I'll bring you the bird.

90
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,861
All right.

91
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,694
That would be good.

92
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,260
Yeah.

93
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,590
Okay.
