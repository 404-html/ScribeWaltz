1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,400
It's the approach that Dostoyevsky talked
to his characters when he wrote this

2
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:14,750
great novels and it's also the approach
that all great novelists taped to their

3
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:16,970
character because if
you're a great novelist,

4
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:19,400
you put yourself inside
the head of the murderer,

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,400
right,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,360
and Dostoyevsky was great punishment.

7
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:24,194
For example,

8
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,350
the main character was going to cough
is a lawsuit and he's all upset because

9
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:35,060
he's lost his faith in God and he's got
all these weird ideas that emerged in

10
00:00:35,061 --> 00:00:38,030
Europe at the end of the 18
hundreds that if there's no god,

11
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:39,380
everything is permitted,

12
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,670
and so he's thinking,

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,151
well,

14
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:42,980
am I moral just because I'm a coward,

15
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:45,440
which was a Nietzschean
proposition actually meets,

16
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:48,260
you said most morality is cowardice.

17
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,120
He didn't say that morality was cowardice.

18
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,560
He said most of the time when
people are being cowardly,

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,840
they pretend that it's moral,

20
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:54,980
which is absolutely right.

21
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,113
Anyways,

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,090
he's wrestling with this idea that,

23
00:00:59,091 --> 00:00:59,360
oh,

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:03,500
morality is just cowardice and once
fundamental beliefs have disappeared,

25
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:06,290
you can do anything you want and the only
thing that's there to stop you is your

26
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:07,124
own fear.

27
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,280
So that's rattling around
in the back of his head.

28
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,190
Now at the same time,

29
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:14,600
he's more or less starving to death
and his sister is going to essentially

30
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:18,180
prostitute herself to raise enough
money so that he can stay in law school.

31
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,410
No,

32
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,490
it's not exactly that.

33
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,790
She's going to go off and marry this guy
that she doesn't love who's quite rich

34
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,070
and she's going to do that
to keep him in law school.

35
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,890
So that's sort of sucks,

36
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,581
you know,

37
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:29,780
he's not very happy about that.

38
00:01:29,781 --> 00:01:34,781
And then he's living in this horrible
flop house and the woman who runs it is

39
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,670
Dostoyevsky sets this up quite nicely.

40
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,720
She's the sort of person that if
she was run over by a horse cart,

41
00:01:41,721 --> 00:01:43,250
everyone would be pleased.

42
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:44,383
She's grasping,

43
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,450
admitted at miserly and horrible and mean
and malevolent and cruel and all those

44
00:01:49,491 --> 00:01:49,731
things.

45
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:51,050
And then to make it even worse,

46
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:55,220
she has this niece who isn't very bright
that she basically treats as a slave

47
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:57,170
and tortures in orders
around all the time.

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,930
And then she has all these people
who are living in her building,

49
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:03,050
which she doesn't take care of and she's
just grasping money out of them all the

50
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:03,301
time.

51
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,400
And she'd have to do anything with money.

52
00:02:04,401 --> 00:02:08,930
She just puts it in a little chest and
she lives like a on bread crumbs and

53
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,071
dust.

54
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:10,904
And so,

55
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,120
so Dostoyevsky's very careful
to set the situation up.

56
00:02:14,121 --> 00:02:14,451
It's like,

57
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:15,284
okay,

58
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,780
is there such a thing as right or wrong?

59
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,840
[inaudible] he's pretty
positive about that.

60
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,290
Plus he's hungry and he's drinking
too much and you know he doesn't eat

61
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:24,860
properly.

62
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,910
Well that's why he's hungry.

63
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:30,940
And so his head is a little on the adult
side and then he's got this terrible

64
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,030
moral conundrum.

65
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:34,940
It's like there's this horrible
woman she's torturing and her niece,

66
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:38,990
and then his sister is going to go into
a loveless marriage and he can't stay in

67
00:02:38,991 --> 00:02:39,824
law school.

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,290
And so we rationalize it.

69
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:41,631
He says,

70
00:02:41,631 --> 00:02:42,170
Oh,

71
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:42,951
here's a solution,

72
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:43,430
man.

73
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,140
I'll just get rid of that old woman.

74
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,520
No one's gonna miss her.

75
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:49,160
Now I'll be doing the world a
favor by getting rid of her.

76
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,440
And then I'll take your money.

77
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:54,500
And then my sister doesn't
have to become a prostitute,

78
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,351
roughly speaking.

79
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:57,740
And I get to go to law school
and I'm going to be a good guy.

80
00:02:57,741 --> 00:02:59,000
And so poof.

81
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,591
Perfect.

82
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:01,330
And if there's no
ultimate right and wrong,

83
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,460
I,

84
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,293
I'm sad.

85
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,840
It's an instrumental argument.

86
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,674
Right?

87
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,071
Well,

88
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:07,390
so he kills her.

89
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,753
Well,

90
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,640
and you have to read the book if
you want the rest of the story.

91
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:19,720
Suffice it to say that things do
not go exactly as he predicted.

92
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,340
So the first thing he figured this out
is that the person you are before you hit

93
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:28,870
someone with someone with an ax and the
person you are immediately after you hit

94
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:31,680
someone with an ax or
not the same persons.

95
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,311
So you know,

96
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:38,311
he assumes constancy of identity across
every experience that turns out to be

97
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,370
seriously wrong.

98
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,380
So Dostoyevsky man,

99
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,214
and he does such a,

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,750
it's a terrifying book.

101
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:45,790
It's the most psychologically
accurate book I ever read,

102
00:03:45,791 --> 00:03:46,624
I think.

103
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:50,920
But the reason I'm telling you about it
is this is what made Dostoyevsky's so

104
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:51,551
courageous.

105
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:52,384
It's like he,

106
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:57,390
he generated up a murderer
who is basically him as a
young man and he gave this

107
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:01,770
kid every reason to murder every,

108
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,111
and he,

109
00:04:02,111 --> 00:04:02,591
everyone,

110
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:03,300
he could think up,

111
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,090
he tried to make the case for murder
as strong as he could possibly make it.

112
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,870
So he wasn't generating,

113
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:09,341
not some,

114
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,174
you know,

115
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,790
two dimensional bad guy.

116
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,100
And then he has the,

117
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,360
then he has the argument.
