1
00:00:05,090 --> 00:00:05,923
Each year is,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,000
is very interested in
the problem of value.

3
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,810
And the problem of value fundamentally
is not the problem of what is the world

4
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:18,840
made up or even how
does the world function,

5
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:23,700
which are more in some sense more
specifically scientific questions.

6
00:00:23,701 --> 00:00:27,120
But how is it that you should
conduct yourself in the world?

7
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:28,740
How should you act?

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:33,690
And people act towards aims in a sense,

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,170
because we're active creatures and
we're moving from one point to another.

10
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,770
We're moving towards things that we want.

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,080
And that means that we're guided by our
desires and we're not only guided by

12
00:00:46,081 --> 00:00:49,470
desires insofar as we
have individual desires,

13
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,860
we're guided by the structure
that consists of how those
desires are related to

14
00:00:57,361 --> 00:00:58,194
one another.

15
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,820
So for example,

16
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:01,470
if you have a room full of people,

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:04,350
say a room full of children,

18
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,810
they're active and they're each
pursuing their individual desires.

19
00:01:09,811 --> 00:01:13,680
But at some point they may choose
to organize themselves into a game.

20
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,590
And if they organize
themselves into a game,

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,670
what they're doing,

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,180
for all intents and purposes
is producing a little society,

23
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,620
a little micro society.

24
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,480
And within that micro society,

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,490
they're deciding what desires will be
currently expressed and how they'll exist

26
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:30,930
in relationship to one another.

27
00:01:30,931 --> 00:01:35,931
And that means that they can cooperate
without too much conflict and that they

28
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:39,630
can jointly move towards,

29
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,620
um,

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,380
a joint AME without

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:45,990
and,

32
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,560
and,

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,870
and gather all the benefits that
might be associated with that.

34
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:52,350
And that might be the
accomplishment of the Ame,

35
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:52,951
whatever it is.

36
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:56,670
But it also might be just the enjoyment
that's to be had in the pursuit of that

37
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:57,504
activity.

38
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,760
Now people do that

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,950
socially because we have to do that in
order to get along with other people

40
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:10,010
because our designers have to be
melded with those of other people.

41
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,200
But we also do it psychologically.

42
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:17,600
And those two things exist in a dance
because as I'm interacting with other

43
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:18,434
people,

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,010
the demands of the fact
that we're interacting make,

45
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:30,220
require each of us to arrange our desires
in a way that's acceptable to everyone

46
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,064
else.

47
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,780
But at the same time,

48
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:33,531
while we're doing that,

49
00:02:33,531 --> 00:02:37,970
we're also observing the process
by which those desires are ordered.

50
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:41,840
And then we internalize that process
and use that to order our own desires.

51
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,490
And then so there's a constant

52
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,950
mutually informative dance between
the individual and the group.

53
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,030
And the culmination of
that is the organization of
society and the simultaneous

54
00:02:53,031 --> 00:02:54,440
organization of the psyche.

55
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,250
And it's that process that needs
you is talking in these paragraphs.

56
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,430
Now you might ask yourself,

57
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:04,721
well,

58
00:03:04,721 --> 00:03:09,721
what's the utility of articulating such
things and conceptualizing them and

59
00:03:10,091 --> 00:03:10,940
understanding them.

60
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:14,470
And the answer in some ways,

61
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,460
it's straight forward.

62
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,590
If you don't want to run a
foul of the your own desires,

63
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,820
you have to organize them

64
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,890
because some of them are short term and
some of them are medium term and some of

65
00:03:26,891 --> 00:03:27,760
them are long term.

66
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,030
And some of the main meant
this and some of the main that.

67
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:36,031
And it isn't necessarily the case
that those desires allow for mutual

68
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:36,881
fulfillment.

69
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:37,870
So for example,

70
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,010
maybe you're very interested in pursuing
a sexual relationship with someone,

71
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,850
but you're also very interested in having
a family and some stability in your

72
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:46,684
life.

73
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,590
Or maybe you're interested in pursuing
a sexual relationship with a whole

74
00:03:50,591 --> 00:03:51,640
sequence of people,

75
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:54,910
but you're also interested in having
a family of stabilizing your life.

76
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:59,911
It's not obvious that those desires
can exist in the same universe without

77
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:05,320
producing what you might think about
as a war and some of that might be a

78
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,460
psychological war,

79
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:11,461
but some of it's also going to be a war
that actually occurs in the existence.

80
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,151
Well,

81
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:17,260
you're fighting through the contradictory
consequences of wanting to pursue many

82
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:20,200
people and formulate a stable
relationship with one person.

83
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,530
Well part of the reason that you want
to think about these sorts of things is

84
00:04:26,531 --> 00:04:31,531
because if you think about them and
get your thoughts and your value system

85
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,890
intelligently and coherently
and cogently laid out,

86
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,360
then when you act out that
value system in the world,

87
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,620
you're going to run into less conflict
and less uncertainty and less misery and

88
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:51,790
you're going to have a higher probability
of getting what it is that you want.

89
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,110
But you're also going to have a higher
probability of getting what you want in a

90
00:04:56,111 --> 00:05:01,111
way that allows you to cooperate with
other people without entering into too

91
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:02,530
much conflict with them.

92
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,880
And so in some sense the
purpose that you think,

93
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,620
the reason that you think are the purpose
of thinking is so that you can sort

94
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:16,621
out how you're going to move forward in
the world without having to directly run

95
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:23,020
headlong into all the obstacles that you
might run into if you were doing such a

96
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:23,854
thing blindly.

97
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:25,510
And so then you might ask yourself,

98
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:25,631
well,

99
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,020
why would you bother reading philosophy?

100
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,020
The philosophy written
by someone who's great.

101
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:33,010
And the answer to that is,

102
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:38,011
is that they can help you think these
things through in a manner that you would

103
00:05:39,071 --> 00:05:41,230
not be capable of doing on your own.

104
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:41,891
You know,

105
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,920
because Nisha,

106
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,650
I mean it's,

107
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,650
it's difficult to estimate how
intelligent needs you wise,

108
00:05:47,651 --> 00:05:51,730
but I suspect he was
perhaps one in a billion,

109
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:56,800
which would put him far beyond
the 99.99 ninth percentile.

110
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,470
And there's a massive difference between
the ability of people to think as you

111
00:06:03,891 --> 00:06:07,910
move farther and farther out into
the extremes of intelligence.

112
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:12,911
And when you have the writings of
someone who's one in a billion,

113
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,840
then you can interact with those
writings in a way that enables you,

114
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:19,550
if you'll put the time into

115
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,920
benefit from the spectacular
fact of that intelligence.
