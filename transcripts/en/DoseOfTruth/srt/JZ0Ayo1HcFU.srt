1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:03,233
Hm

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,060
consciousness kind of overrides the
concept of time at the beginning and then

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:19,120
your consciousness just returns to where
it was and that the physical body and

4
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:23,910
brave is just a temporary instantiation
of consciousness in the physical bead.

5
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:28,090
But this goes back to some other
place and then there's like a figure,

6
00:00:28,091 --> 00:00:30,850
we don't have the words to even
conceive of what that means.

7
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:33,520
And that is that the western language,

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:34,760
the way science is taught,

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,860
I can't really capture what he's
talking about it in that sense.

10
00:00:38,861 --> 00:00:43,861
And so that's why I think we kind of hit
an epistemological wall there where you

11
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,960
have to actually get into introspection,

12
00:00:46,961 --> 00:00:47,830
meditation,

13
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,630
and that the deeper parts
of that tradition that I've
never been able to really

14
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:53,650
get into personally.

15
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,480
So I can't say I understand it,

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,410
although I kind of see where
he's coming from in that regard.

17
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,210
So,

18
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:02,340
so let me ask you some
questions about that.

19
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:07,341
So the first might have to do with
this idea of the ontological primacy of

20
00:01:07,891 --> 00:01:08,730
consciousness.

21
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,140
No.

22
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,980
One of the things I've learned
from studying mythology
is that the mythological

23
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,551
worldview,

24
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:14,971
first of all,

25
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:19,560
I think the mythological worldview
conceptualizes the world as a place to act

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,900
rather than as a place of things.

27
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:23,670
So it's sort of like Steven Jig,

28
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:27,120
Jay Gould's idea of two
magistarium don't overlap.

29
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:30,600
There's a moral magistarium
materialist magistarium say,

30
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,850
but it's been striking to me,

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:36,280
looking at the archetype will foundations
of mythological thinking that,

32
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,850
that in the scientific world view,

33
00:01:38,851 --> 00:01:41,970
there seem to be two
fundamental causal elements.

34
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:43,490
You could say nature and nurture,

35
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,400
something like that,

36
00:01:44,401 --> 00:01:46,260
or biology and society.

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,530
And then technically sophisticated
western academics argue about the relative

38
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:54,720
contribution of each to any given,

39
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,710
uh,

40
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,940
existential phenomenon.

41
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,470
But in the mythological worldview,

42
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:00,000
there's always three actors.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,230
There is nature.

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,400
Um,

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,790
usually personified as female
or experienced is female,

46
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,830
cause personified isn't
quite the right word.

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,993
There's culture,

48
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,170
but there's also the individual and the
individual seems to be the same thing as

49
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:14,040
the conscious actor.

50
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,120
And that would be the hero of
the dragon slaying hero saves.

51
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,770
And there's that,

52
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:21,510
there is a kind of primacy given to that.

53
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:23,280
And so in the oldest creation myths,

54
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:27,120
you always see this
interplay between the mother,

55
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:31,980
often mother earth and the father that
the sky and then the hero who separates

56
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:33,300
the two and somehow bring,

57
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,430
and perversely in some sense,

58
00:02:35,431 --> 00:02:40,431
although being their product clearly
as the offspring is also the thing that

59
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,120
gives rise to them at the same,

60
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,680
at the same time.

61
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,300
And it seems to be something that's in
keeping in some sense with our lived

62
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,350
experiences that we confront
the social world obviously,

63
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,500
and our beneficiaries and victims of it.

64
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:58,860
And we confront the natural
world in the same matter.

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,020
But we also seem to be a agentic actors
and without us as a gender doctors,

66
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,300
the idea that there's a reality seems to,

67
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,190
it seems to be full of paradoxical holes
like reality without a conscious actor.

68
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,540
And I think that's the sort of thing that,

69
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:17,650
that generates the thinking that you
referred to as characteristic of,

70
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,660
of Deepak Chopra and the people who,

71
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,430
who make those sorts of claims.

72
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:22,803
So,

73
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,063
I mean,

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,470
what's your,

75
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,640
what's your take on,

76
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,400
on consciousness and its role in being?

77
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,583
Well,

78
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,071
the one,

79
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:34,360
and it's everything because,

80
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,700
um,

81
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,770
it's what I tell what I tell deep,

82
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:39,520
like what I write about
in that chapter is that,

83
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,480
um,

84
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,110
you're,

85
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:42,880
you're familiar with
the anthropic principle.

86
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,080
So I call this the,

87
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,970
that the week consciousness
principle that,

88
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:46,840
um,

89
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,800
without consciousness,

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,450
without consciousness,

91
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,460
nothing exists.

92
00:03:50,461 --> 00:03:50,650
You know,

93
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,461
this is one of the points.

94
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:52,790
The book makes a,

95
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:54,940
and for me and you personally,

96
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,830
if we're dead or we're not conscious,

97
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:58,570
the world doesn't exist for our brains.

98
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,404
It's gone.

99
00:03:59,410 --> 00:03:59,860
Nothing.

100
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,693
There's nothing.

101
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,023
Uh,

102
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:02,320
but,

103
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,220
but he goes further than that.

104
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:03,491
He says,

105
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:06,040
this is what I call the strong
consciousness principle.

106
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:08,530
That that consciousness is required.

107
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:12,150
Our consciousness is required
for material things to exist.

108
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:12,984
And,

109
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,260
and so there I have a discussion of what,

110
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,110
um,

111
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:16,240
uh,

112
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,200
Donald Hoffman,

113
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:20,130
the cognitive scientists
at Uc Irvine Colosseum is,

114
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,513
um,

115
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,120
uh,

116
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,920
interface perception theory.

117
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,001
Uh,

118
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:26,170
I don't know if you're familiar with this,

119
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:27,610
but his analogy is like,

120
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:27,840
you know,

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,410
your laptop screen here.

122
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,630
Then you'd have these icons on the screen.

123
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,270
They had like the little trashcan
icon looks like a Trashcan,

124
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,370
but of course there's no trash.

125
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:37,204
Get the Oakland,

126
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,530
the open your laptop,

127
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,520
there's no can in there.

128
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,000
You know,

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,110
these are just kind of icons that
represent something that we think of as a

130
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:44,860
trashcan.

131
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,430
And,

132
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,263
um,

133
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:46,511
you know,

134
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:47,040
this is,

135
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,831
gets to the problem of,

136
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:48,011
you know,

137
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:49,150
what it's like to be a bat.

138
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,343
Uh,

139
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,930
I can't know if like bolted on some,

140
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,460
some huge ears.

141
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:54,701
And I,

142
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:58,690
and I had an echo location system and
the neural processes to process that

143
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:00,270
information until,

144
00:05:00,271 --> 00:05:02,440
and I would have some sense
of what it's like to be a vet,

145
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,360
but they had everything on
to actually be a bad thing.

146
00:05:06,361 --> 00:05:08,380
And I would just be a bat
and I wouldn't even be,

147
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,230
I wouldn't even know I was a human
wondering what it's like to be a fat.

148
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:11,371
Okay.

149
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:13,480
So at some level we can't actually know,

150
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,530
um,

151
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,420
you know what it's like
to be something else.

152
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:17,254
And so you,

153
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:17,831
again,

154
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:20,440
with Deepak and I and these
kinds of traditions like that,

155
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:23,530
we hit this system
illogical wall of language.

156
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,900
It's difficult to say what
you mean by certain things.
