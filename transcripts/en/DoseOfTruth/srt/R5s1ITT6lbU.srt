1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,190
So on to Sigmund Freud,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,890
we're going to give him
somewhat short shrift,

3
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm afraid because we only have
an hour to talk about Freud,

4
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,423
but that's okay.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:15,300
Uh,

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,710
we could get a fair way through it.

7
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,113
Um,

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,370
he's still persona non grata,

9
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:24,210
I would say among experimental
psychologists and probably
clinical psychologists

10
00:00:24,211 --> 00:00:24,690
swell.

11
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,630
But that seems to me to be very unfair.

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,290
Um,

13
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,123
Freud,

14
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:31,140
Freud is one of those thinkers who,

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,063
uh,

16
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,301
all the laughter,

17
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:38,301
his mistakes and the reason for that is
that everything that he discovered or

18
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:42,720
put forward is so entrenched
in our culture now that we
think it's self evident.

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:47,610
And so everything correct
has been assimilated and
that just leaves everything

20
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:50,550
that's more or less floating
on top to look wrong.

21
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,391
And,

22
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:54,720
but Freud is also one of those thinkers
who was always wrong in an interesting

23
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:55,554
way.

24
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,060
And that's very useful.

25
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,894
And so,

26
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:58,500
um,

27
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,260
I also think that many of the
things that he put his finger on,

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,450
that our ups of still disputed,

29
00:01:03,451 --> 00:01:04,051
for example,

30
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:08,220
the idea of the Oedipus complex are much
more useful than people are willing to

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,433
admit,

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,030
especially in the clinical realm.

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,650
Because the oedipal complex,

34
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:14,940
which we'll talk about quite a bit,

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,360
is actually a description of a fairly
stable form of familial psychopathology

36
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:29,520
where child gets trapped within the
confines of a family because the

37
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:34,521
relationship with one parent or the
other or both is so tight that they can't

38
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:35,520
break beyond it.

39
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:40,500
And maybe because of their own
inability to move towards independence,

40
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:42,810
but more frequently because of,

41
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:43,710
uh,

42
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,910
what you might describe as a kind of
conspiracy between the sun and the parent

43
00:01:47,911 --> 00:01:49,350
or the child and the parent,

44
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,250
uh,

45
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:55,250
that prevents them from moving towards
autonomous life and keeps them in a state

46
00:01:57,031 --> 00:02:00,390
of essentially a state
of childhood dependence.

47
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,630
Freud said,

48
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,140
I started my professional activity as a
neurologist trying to bring relief to my

49
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:10,140
neurotic patients under the
influence of an older friend.

50
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,530
And by my own efforts I discovered
some important new facts about the

51
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:15,120
unconscious and psychic life,

52
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,730
the role of instinctual urges and so on.

53
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,430
Out of these findings grew a
new science psychoanalysis,

54
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:24,580
a part of psychology and a new
treatment for the neuroses.

55
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,250
I had to pay heavily for
this bit of good luck.

56
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:31,300
People did not believe in my facts
and thought my theories unsavory.

57
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,030
Resistance was strong and unrelenting.

58
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,090
In the end I succeeded in inquiring
pupils and building it up,

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,250
an international
psychoanalytic association,

60
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,840
but the struggle is not over.

61
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,020
He made that recording just
shortly before he died.

62
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:44,854
He moved to La,

63
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,020
to England to escape the Nazis.

64
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,141
Before Freud,

65
00:02:50,141 --> 00:02:50,974
I guess

66
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,500
the mind was,

67
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,950
it's complicated because Freud of course
was not the only person to be thinking

68
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,630
along the lines that he thought.

69
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,640
Pierre Jenay who was one of his teachers
had originated and started to develop.

70
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:09,310
Many of the ideas that I would
say were popularized by Freud,

71
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:10,144
but

72
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,890
the idea of the unconscious mind was not
certainly not as well developed prior

73
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:21,460
to Freud as it became afterwards and

74
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:23,921
before that.

75
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,754
I suppose

76
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,880
you might say that in so far as
people thought of the mind at all,

77
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:35,350
they they thought in philosophical terms
and the mind would be that part of you

78
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:39,700
that's that you're aware of like in
the dark and the Cartesian sense.

79
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:40,391
Descartes said,

80
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:45,100
I think therefore I am and it kind of
seems in some sense self evident that

81
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,840
you're aware of and have control
over the contents of your own mind.

82
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,500
But that was what Freud really
questioned and he questioned it,

83
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:54,161
deeply said,

84
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:59,161
well first of all the idea that you're
one thing like one mind is a dubious idea

85
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:04,900
to begin with because people are full
of internal contradictions and then the

86
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:07,810
idea that your mind is all of one type,

87
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,970
it's all of one form was also very
questionable as far as Freud was concerned

88
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:17,971
because you could be fractionated into
subcomponents and you know the idea for

89
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,581
example,

90
00:04:18,581 --> 00:04:22,300
that your anger or your sexual desire
could be an autonomous part of your

91
00:04:22,301 --> 00:04:26,200
personality in some sense that it
could overtake you and control you.

92
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,060
That's really a Friday and idea and one
of the classic Freud and ideas really is

93
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:36,061
that people are made out
of sub personalities and
those subpersonalities are

94
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:36,964
alive.

95
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,120
And that's one of the things I really
like about the psychoanalytic thinkers

96
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:45,121
because even the psychologists who say
over the last 30 years or there abouts

97
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,230
since maybe longer now anyways,

98
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:52,060
since the demise of
behaviorism as an ideology

99
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,280
and the admission by
psychologists that there were,

100
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,420
there is an active unconscious
or many active unconsciousness,

101
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:02,860
which is a better way
of thinking about it.

102
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,510
Psychologists still really haven't come
to terms with the idea in any deep sense

103
00:05:07,511 --> 00:05:11,440
that these unconscious
processes are living things.

104
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:15,580
You know there when when psychologists
talk for example about the cognitive

105
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,181
unconscious,

106
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:21,100
they're talking about something that
they described it more machine like with

107
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:23,980
more machine like metaphors
and that's not reasonable.

108
00:05:23,981 --> 00:05:28,810
You you understand things a lot better
if you understand that the subcomponents

109
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,160
that make up people,

110
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,750
the fragmentary bits of them and also
the biological subsystems that that are

111
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:39,250
part and parcel of your being are
much more intelligently viewed as

112
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:40,260
personalities there.

113
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,020
They're kind of unit dimensional
personalities in some sense so that for

114
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:44,411
example,

115
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,101
if you're angry,

116
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:46,300
you're nothing but angry.

117
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,670
I mean that's an overstatement obviously.

118
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,310
Or if you're afraid you're nothing
but afraid or if you're hungry,

119
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,600
you're nothing but hunger.

120
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,010
While that's certainly true,

121
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:57,200
if you get hungry enough or thirsty
or too hot or any of those things,

122
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:57,510
you,

123
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,060
you kind of collapsed to
a simpler personality that
only has one motivation in

124
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:02,451
mind.

125
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:06,560
And we'll talk a lot as we progress
about the grounding of those unit

126
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:09,470
dimensional motivational
systems in biology.

127
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:14,471
But I'd have to say that Freud was
among the first read least the first to

128
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,960
synthesize a coherent theory of this
multiplicity and to put it forth,

129
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:26,140
well also insisting that much of what was
happening to you and inside of you was

130
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,050
not immediately accessible
to your awareness.

131
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,950
And it's a very profound,

132
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:35,690
it's very profound discovery.

133
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:41,650
It means among any among many other
things that you can formulate ideas.

134
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,551
First of all,

135
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:48,350
it means that you can act out things that
you don't understand for reasons that

136
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,400
you don't understand.

137
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:55,480
It also means that your memory can contain
things that's represented in one way,

138
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:57,830
but that can't be understood in another.

139
00:06:57,831 --> 00:06:58,790
So for example,

140
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,150
and we know this is true because
there are independent memory systems,

141
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:04,640
there's an independent
memory system for procedures.

142
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,930
That's for actions.

143
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:10,790
There's an independence memory system for
what you might describe as imagination

144
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:11,360
for,

145
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,100
for the memory that uses images.

146
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,480
And then there's uh,

147
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,240
another system that articulates knowledge.

148
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,370
That's the semantic memory system.

149
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:24,110
And it's not obvious at all that the
contents of all of those are equivalent.

150
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,460
And that's why,

151
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:26,294
for example,

152
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:28,790
you can dream things that you don't know.

153
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:32,780
Cause one of the things you might think
is that your dreams watch you act and

154
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:36,350
they watch other people act and then
they make a little drama out of that.

155
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,120
And that drama has information in it.

156
00:07:38,121 --> 00:07:40,820
But you don't necessarily know
what that information is in that.

157
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:42,980
You can't describe it consciously.

158
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:43,941
Right.

159
00:07:43,941 --> 00:07:44,051
It's,

160
00:07:44,051 --> 00:07:49,051
it's akin to the Ph Eddie and idea that
kids can play a game and you can take

161
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:52,220
them away from the game and then they
won't know how to describe the rules,

162
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,450
even though they can play the game.

163
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:58,451
And so dreams can contain information
that's full of the encoding of behavior

164
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:02,120
that has information in it that
you're not consciously aware of.

165
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,780
And so then you can become consciously
aware of that in kind of a revelation

166
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:06,380
side.

167
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,410
Maybe that's what you do when you become
aware of the meaning of a dream or the

168
00:08:09,411 --> 00:08:11,420
meaning of a fantasy
or something like that.

169
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,190
And that's all,

170
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:18,170
all our ability to think that way in
some ways can be traced back to France.
