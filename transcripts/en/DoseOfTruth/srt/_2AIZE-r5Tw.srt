1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,020
Let me,
my life for the last year has been so

2
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,640
busy that I haven't had proper time to
reflect on what's been happening.

3
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,720
And even if I did,
I wouldn't,

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,190
I'm not exactly sure I would be able to
understand it anyways because it isn't

5
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:22,380
sure I'm not,
I don't think I have a framework of

6
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:27,381
reference within which to put it.
So I started working for this company

7
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:31,320
called Television TV Ontario about 1516
years ago.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,350
I had talked to a producer,
his name was Waldeck Shimberg,

9
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,920
he's emigrate,
Polish Jew and a really smart guy.

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,200
And he phoned me up at the university.
And one of the things that distinguishes

11
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:46,950
me to some degree from my colleagues is
that I'll talk to the press and that I'm

12
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:49,890
actually not afraid of them or
distrustful love them.

13
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:53,790
Like a lot of my colleagues,
not all of them are like,

14
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,330
they're critical of the press,
partly in an arrogant way and partly in

15
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,050
a defensive way.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:58,471
They say,
well,

17
00:00:58,471 --> 00:01:00,390
they always get it wrong.
It's like,

18
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:02,340
well,
first of all there isn't that they and

19
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,250
they don't always get it wrong.
And you know,

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:05,910
they,
they,

21
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,600
they'll also shy away from the press as
if they're being intruded upon when the

22
00:01:09,601 --> 00:01:13,200
truth is generally speaking,
the ideas that they're putting forward

23
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:16,350
aren't of sufficient interest to draw
public attention anyways.

24
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:19,140
And so,
but I talked to what EC for a long time

25
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:23,680
and he invited me to go on a couple of,
of shows and then uh,

26
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,880
then I ended up on [inaudible] the
agenda,

27
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:28,830
which is a pretty good public affairs
show.

28
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:33,220
It's one of the few,
I would say deep new shows left that

29
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,600
that are on normal broadcast TV and you
know,

30
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:39,870
they go into issues in some depth,
although they fragmented that up a bit

31
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:44,640
in recent years.
And I became a fairly common guest on

32
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,850
those shows and people seem to like what
I was saying,

33
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:49,020
which always surprised me.

34
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,610
I mean,
but,

35
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:53,940
but it was good because you know,
it must be pretty damn horrible to put

36
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:58,920
yourself out in the public eye and face
primary criticism for what you're doing.

37
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,890
I think that would be unbearable in some
sense unless you were very,

38
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:04,800
very strongly constituted.
And then,

39
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,470
well that went on for awhile and we'll
deck was running this a series called

40
00:02:10,471 --> 00:02:12,840
big ideas,
which was actually quite prescient,

41
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,650
you know,
so he had lecturers come to Toronto and,

42
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,730
and he had all pretty much all the major
public intellectuals in the world over a

43
00:02:20,731 --> 00:02:22,890
period of about five years or six years
or so,

44
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:27,891
come and deliver bare bones lectures of
this sort fundamentally need taped them

45
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:30,360
and put them on TV,
you know,

46
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,200
and,
and uh,

47
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,910
that was sort of unheard of.
The production quality was well high but

48
00:02:35,911 --> 00:02:39,160
not overproduced weren't multiple
cameras and edits and,

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,330
and intelligent commentary from people
in the background.

50
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:45,120
It was purely content driven,
you know,

51
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:50,070
and it actually got pretty popular on,
on iTunes and you can still find the

52
00:02:50,071 --> 00:02:52,830
lectures there,
but Tvo couldn't they,

53
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,560
they,
they,

54
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,980
they,
they pulled the show even though their

55
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,520
primary mandate from the government was
to educate the public.

56
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:05,050
And this was a very low budget show with
very high quality minds that people were

57
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,720
actually watching and downloading a lot
on iTunes.

58
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:10,900
But they,
they didn't seem to take the non

59
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,700
standard media with any degree of
seriousness.

60
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:16,570
And you know,
that's kind of a common human attribute,

61
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,100
which is that if you don't know about
something,

62
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,810
you don't take it seriously.
Right.

63
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,291
And it's,
it's,

64
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:21,850
cause if you don't know about it,
well,

65
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,070
it's just gray and fuzzy,
right?

66
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,850
You have no differentiated knowledge.
So it's easy to oversimplify it.
