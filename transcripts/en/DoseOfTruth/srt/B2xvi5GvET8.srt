1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,660
Political correctness,

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:12,280
the seems to be taking up more and more
space now when you've been quite vocal

3
00:00:12,281 --> 00:00:13,114
against it,

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,990
but it feels like a lot of people
don't really understand what it is.

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,020
It is often mixed up with common courtesy.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,503
For an example,

7
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:24,010
can you define political
correctness for us?

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,750
Why is it not,

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,583
not good?

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,240
Well,

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,240
political correctness I would say is
fundamentally a collectivist doctrine and

12
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:39,630
collectivist doctrines insists that the
proper way of parsing up the world is

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,340
through the lens of group identity.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:45,070
So you could think about it as the,

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,890
as part of the expression
of identity politics,

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,630
which is something that script the left,

17
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:54,400
probably something that cost Hillary
Clinton the election law in the United

18
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,720
States in the last election cycle.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,153
And so,

20
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,970
and the the people who are politically
correct insists that individuals are

21
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:09,331
basically avatars of their group and that
the world is a battle ground of groups

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,470
vying for dominance,

23
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,000
power competition.

24
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,580
It doesn't matter who
you are as an individual,

25
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,680
it's only what group you belong.

26
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:18,330
Yes,

27
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:18,580
well,

28
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,580
I would say in in within the confines
of the politically correct doctrine,

29
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:25,300
there aren't individuals.

30
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,120
There are only groups vying for power.

31
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:32,890
That's why the politically
correct types oppose free speech.

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,050
It isn't that they oppose it.

33
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,280
It's worse than that.

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,210
It's that from within the confines
of the politically correct doctrine.

35
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,240
There's no such thing as free speech
because what you claim as your free speech

36
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:49,420
is actually nothing but your justification
of the hierarchy that gives your

37
00:01:49,421 --> 00:01:50,380
group dominance.

38
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:54,610
That's everything from the politically
correct perspective and so there's no

39
00:01:54,611 --> 00:01:59,230
real possibility even for dialogue
between well meaning individuals because

40
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,400
there's no such thing as dialogue to
begin with and there's no such thing as

41
00:02:03,401 --> 00:02:08,200
well meaning individuals and so it's
almost impossible to overstate how

42
00:02:08,201 --> 00:02:09,880
pernicious that doctrine is.

43
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:14,980
It demolishes the idea of individual
sovereignty and the possibility of

44
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:16,750
communication across individuals.

45
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,760
That's why it produces ideas like

46
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,490
cultural appropriation because there's no,

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,170
all that happens.

48
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,290
If you utilize the artifacts
of another culture,

49
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:33,040
it isn't that you admire the more that
it's a part of trade or that is part of

50
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,540
the free expression of ideas.

51
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:40,020
It's that your taking away the artifacts
of power from that other group in an

52
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:43,810
attempt to foster your
own group dominance.

53
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,030
Everything's viewed
through that lens as if I,

54
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,930
if I would dress up as an
Indian for a costume party.

55
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:50,650
Yeah,

56
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:50,921
yeah.

57
00:02:50,921 --> 00:02:51,520
Well that's,

58
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,390
you know that that sort of thing has
caused all sorts of trouble in American

59
00:02:55,391 --> 00:03:00,160
universities where because their end
and they've produced about Halloween

60
00:03:00,161 --> 00:03:00,821
costumes,

61
00:03:00,821 --> 00:03:05,821
I mean it's absurd in many ways as if
the dressing up in Mexican national

62
00:03:05,951 --> 00:03:06,550
uniform,

63
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:10,270
let's say national clothing or Dutch
national clothing for that matter is some

64
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,200
kind of insult.

65
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,230
It isn't an insult and even if it was,

66
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,070
that's Halloween,

67
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,510
is it time to break rules?

68
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,860
That's the whole point of the,

69
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,030
of the,

70
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,470
of the celebration.

71
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,240
So political correctness has
corrupted the university.

72
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:28,360
So lots fields as far
as I'm concerned it has.

73
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:31,750
And the universities are doing everything
they can to corrupt other institutions

74
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,171
and their,

75
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,920
and the other institutions are
foolishly going along for the ride.

76
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,461
So you see,

77
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,294
for example,

78
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,910
and this is probably more true
in the u s than anywhere else,

79
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:41,140
although also in Canada,

80
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,340
Australia as well,

81
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,880
that corporations are under the pressure
of this politically correct fostering

82
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:53,830
of guilt are admitting despite the fact
that there's no scientific validity for

83
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:54,970
this claim whatsoever,

84
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,550
that their employees are on Mohs,

85
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,200
structurally racist,

86
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:03,310
and that people are viewing the world
through the lens of implicit bias and that

87
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:07,990
we're all fundamentally racist and that
that should be rectified through like

88
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:09,070
reeducation.

89
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,780
So,

90
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,300
um,

91
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,960
what unconscious bias retraining
programs for which there is,

92
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,950
there is no evidence whatsoever that
those programs work and it's a substantial

93
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,780
amount of evidence that
they're counterproductive.

94
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:25,110
And the implicit association test that
has been put forward hypothetically to

95
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:26,494
diagnose,

96
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,310
uh,

97
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,971
racism.

98
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:32,440
Implicit racism is not a valid or
reliable test and cannot be used for those

99
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:33,220
purposes.

100
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,990
And even the makers of the test,

101
00:04:34,991 --> 00:04:39,991
Brian Nosek and Anthony Greenwald have
admitted publicly that their test is

102
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,930
being misused.

103
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:41,893
All of that's,

104
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,761
it's all of that.

105
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,110
That's extraordinarily dangerous.

106
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:46,480
And if corporate executives had any sense,

107
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:51,190
they would stop rushing to admit that
are corporations are structurally racist.

108
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,840
It's a very bad idea.

109
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,810
And this is all under the influence.

110
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:00,250
You say off postmodernism
and neo meal monks,

111
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,863
those things,

112
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,220
two separate things,

113
00:05:03,221 --> 00:05:04,480
they're completely separate.

114
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,000
You know,

115
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,940
and this is something
I've been criticized for.

116
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:11,000
Dr. Peterson doesn't understand the
difference between neo Marxism and

117
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,000
[inaudible] and postmodernism.

118
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,010
It's like I understand
the difference perfectly.

119
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:17,680
Well it isn't me that's conflating them.

120
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:21,850
It turns out that the people who push
postmodern doctrines in the university

121
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:26,910
almost always ally themselves with the
Marxist viewpoint and that is logically

122
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,223
incoherent.

123
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,470
But I would say the postmodernists
really don't give a damn for logical

124
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:36,650
coherence because they regard that
as part of the oppressive Patriarchal

125
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,780
Eurocentric view of the world.

126
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,620
The idea that there's an objective reality
and all of that and that you can deal

127
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:42,550
with it with logic.

128
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:43,863
Um,

129
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,850
I think that there is a,

130
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:49,660
an alliance between the postmodern
types and the Neo Marxists.

131
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:51,430
And as far as I can can tell,

132
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:54,100
when I looked at the
development of postmodern ideas,

133
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,490
which,

134
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,590
which really came to prominence in France,

135
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:00,170
it was all failed Marxists who
pushed the doctrine forward.

136
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,430
And I think it's,

137
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,590
it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.

138
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,310
Identity politics is just
Marxism under a different guise.

139
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,310
So instead of the narrative being
the privileged economic class,

140
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:17,600
the z against the proletariat that
didn't sell so well and produce tens of

141
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:19,881
millions of deaths,

142
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,110
that fundamental narrative,

143
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,060
there was this slight of hand and said,

144
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:23,271
well,

145
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:25,730
it's not economic class.

146
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:29,570
It's race or it's gender
or ethnicity or it's sex,

147
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,260
but it doesn't matter because the
fundamental narrative is still victimizer

148
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,190
versus victim.

149
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,650
And so it's Marxism under another guise.

150
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:41,651
And the fact that
postmodernists technically are
skeptical of Meta narratives

151
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:47,480
like large scale explanatory structures
should mean that they're equally

152
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,110
skeptical about Marxists claims
because that's a grand narrative.

153
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,660
But in practically speaking,

154
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:55,010
that isn't how it works out.

155
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,840
And so this alliance does exist,

156
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:59,750
even though conceptually
it's completely incoherent,

157
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,500
says,

158
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,090
I really don't believe that the post,

159
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:05,000
that postmodernism is
something in and of itself.

160
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,080
I think it's a,

161
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,970
it's a camouflage for,

162
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:10,040
for Marxism under another name.

163
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,650
And these ideas of yours,

164
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,920
they are the ones that gain you
the largest groups of enemies and,

165
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:18,670
and you,

166
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,503
yes.

167
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:19,851
Well,

168
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:22,550
the thing is the left is
the radical leftist types.

169
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:25,040
And I would say they're the
leftist collectivists and I'm,

170
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:25,521
by the way,

171
00:07:25,521 --> 00:07:27,290
no fan of right wing collectivists.

172
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:30,290
So either it's just that they
don't threaten the universities.

173
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,990
There's no right wing
collectivists in the universities.

174
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:33,830
Like none.

175
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,030
There's no right wingers,

176
00:07:35,031 --> 00:07:36,100
there's no conservatives.

177
00:07:36,101 --> 00:07:38,210
There are hardly any
liberals in most of the,

178
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,190
in most of the activists,

179
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,073
uh,

180
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,953
disciplines.

181
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,040
Um,

182
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,311
yeah,

183
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:46,310
the radical left types
don't like me at all.

184
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,710
And that's okay because
the feeling is mutual.

185
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,810
I think that the veil,

186
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:55,380
they can orchestrate vicious attacks
and hit pieces in the biggest media as

187
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,270
well.

188
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,410
And I've been,

189
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,711
you know,

190
00:07:57,711 --> 00:08:00,050
I've had the full gamut
of treatment in the media.

191
00:08:00,051 --> 00:08:02,300
I would say in Canada for example,

192
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,980
there's a handful of outstanding
journalists who act as individuals.

193
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:07,610
Um,

194
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,361
a dozen of them,

195
00:08:08,361 --> 00:08:11,030
let's say a maybe slightly less than that,

196
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,140
and they've been firmly
supporting me the whole time.

197
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,240
And the post media group in Canada,

198
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,450
which was a consortium
of 200 have newspapers,

199
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,600
came out in favor of my free speech stance
in relationship to bill [inaudible].

200
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:27,590
And so I've been treated very well by the,

201
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,840
by some elements of the media,

202
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:35,230
but it's definitely the case that I've
also been pilloried as a and caricatured

203
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:38,570
and stereotyped as a,

204
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,490
as an outright figure,

205
00:08:40,491 --> 00:08:41,330
I suppose.

206
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,570
Sometimes there's a far right
figure for that matter by,

207
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,030
by venues that have,

208
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,430
that should have known much that
of should have known better.

209
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:52,370
And BC did a terrible
video hit piece on me.

210
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,930
It was an appalling piece of,

211
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:55,770
of careless,

212
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,600
provocative journalism.

213
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:57,861
It was,

214
00:08:57,861 --> 00:08:58,120
it,

215
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,440
it was.

216
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,400
They were exposed.

217
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,330
They were exposed.

218
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:00,631
Very,

219
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:01,710
why was it was,

220
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,300
I couldn't believe it when I watched it.

221
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,780
I thought,

222
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:05,490
not only are you people crooked,

223
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,470
but you're stupid and incompetent.

224
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,480
You should get one of those things right.

225
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,940
He shouldn't be all three of
those things at the same time.

226
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,130
They interviewed me for 90 minutes and
it was a contentious interview conducted

227
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,780
by a narcissistic interviewer,

228
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:24,060
and then they chopped it into like a
three minute teaser that was just outright

229
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,163
falsehoods.

230
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,760
And then people on Youtube took the actual
interview and the edited version and

231
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:33,870
juxtapose them showing that
they'd actually reversed
the meaning of some of the

232
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:34,740
things I said.

233
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,510
I sold it to so and,

234
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,880
but so far the attacks have been,

235
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,340
I would say highly counterproductive.

236
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,700
And I've been in this
very strange situation,

237
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,840
which I have.

238
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:46,674
No,

239
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,490
I have,

240
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:47,791
I mean,

241
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:52,791
I feel that it's a tenuous situation
that every time there's been a protest,

242
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,130
say against my appearance
on the university campus,

243
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
which has happened many times,

244
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,790
or an attack piece,

245
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,270
then like it's very stressful and,

246
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,050
and the potential for damaging
my reputation appears high.

247
00:10:07,051 --> 00:10:11,850
But that medium to longterm consequence
of that is that the journalists end up

248
00:10:11,851 --> 00:10:13,320
more discredited than me.
