1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:07,923
Alright,

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,900
now I talked to you about these fingers
before and I was trying to make,

3
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:17,291
so here's,

4
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:20,800
here's kind of an overview of what
I'm attempting to describe to you.

5
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:21,700
So one,

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,360
there's one category of representation
that has to do with the territory that

7
00:00:25,361 --> 00:00:29,860
you inhabit and that you understand
that's primarily social territory and it

8
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:34,740
tends to be symbolized by masculine
and usually like older male symbols.

9
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:36,430
So that's the patriarchal structure.

10
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,810
I really think what it is is a,

11
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:43,120
it's a personified representation of
the dominance hierarchy structure.

12
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:44,360
So,

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,740
um,

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,120
if remember the lion king,

15
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:47,470
you know the pride rock thing.

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,050
So the pride rock has sort
of associated with the,

17
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:51,700
with the symbols father.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,073
And so that's,

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,140
that's that category of symbol is
the symbol that I'm talking about.

20
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,070
So he used that,

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:01,450
that high place on the mountain as
an indicator of dominance structure.

22
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,870
You saw that at the opening of the lion
king movie where all the animals come,

23
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,040
they gather around,

24
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,550
they all bow before the,

25
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,340
the rock with the king on top of it.

26
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,151
And the king,

27
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:11,470
like the lion is a symbol,

28
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:15,700
generally a symbol of something like
solar power because the lion is a top

29
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:16,181
Predator,

30
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:19,630
it's apex Predator and it
lives in Africa under the sun.

31
00:01:19,631 --> 00:01:21,640
And it has a main that sort of like a son.

32
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:26,110
And then later in the lion king will
actually see this today you'll see the,

33
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,040
the Father Lion Mufasa,

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:30,513
yes,

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,390
he appears in the sky with
a solar halo around him.

36
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,380
So,

37
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,090
so that's the masculine category.

38
00:01:37,091 --> 00:01:40,420
And then the feminine category I told
you a little about a bit about is a more

39
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:42,880
chaotic category and it's a,

40
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,720
it's a chaotic and plastic category
out of which new forms emerge.

41
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,470
And then one of the categories that we
haven't talked about is the category of

42
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:54,580
the individual and the individual is
the hero and hero stories and is the

43
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,590
initiate an initiatory routines.

44
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:02,010
And so the hero is the person who is
attempting to become a complete biological

45
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:08,101
and historical entity personality
so that they're capable not only of,

46
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,310
of,

47
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:10,090
of,

48
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:10,923
um,

49
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:13,150
adopting independent existence,

50
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,460
but if adopting independent existence
that's productive and that's productive in

51
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:20,620
a way that's also a
benefit to the community.

52
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:25,330
So it's a particular pattern
of development and that
that needs to be catalyzed

53
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:29,530
by human societies because
in order for a society to,

54
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,340
to maintain its structure and for
the people within it to thrive,

55
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,540
the developing individuals have to mature
to the point where they can take care

56
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:40,780
of themselves in a way that doesn't
disrupt the whole social structure.

57
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,370
And so that's the path.

58
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,380
It's a natural path for human beings.

59
00:02:44,381 --> 00:02:45,370
I would say to some degree,

60
00:02:45,371 --> 00:02:47,980
because we're such
intensely social creatures,

61
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,900
but because we're also quite malleable
and complex and also grounded in history

62
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:54,010
and cultural creatures,

63
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,360
it's also something that has to be
taught both from the perspective of

64
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,220
invitation and explicitly.
