1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,750
Your University,

2
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:09,130
your online university.

3
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:12,160
You and I spoke about that yesterday
a bit and you were telling me that the

4
00:00:12,161 --> 00:00:12,994
modules,

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:13,900
um,

6
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,730
are in place or are sort of impressed.

7
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:16,620
We're starting to design,

8
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,290
well we've,

9
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,930
I can tell you some of the
guiding principles of the,

10
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:23,710
it's the first thing we did was lay out
a set of principles that the university

11
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:24,640
will operate under.

12
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,474
So we want to,

13
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,590
right now it costs about
$50,000 a year per student,

14
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:32,380
which I think is about 10 times
more expensive than it should be.

15
00:00:32,381 --> 00:00:33,730
So we want to cut the price.

16
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,130
We want to cut the price by probably a
factor of 10 and hopefully a factor of

17
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:39,964
50.

18
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:45,340
We want to make the humanities education
and science education universally

19
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:46,870
except accessible.

20
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,430
We want to distribute,

21
00:00:48,431 --> 00:00:52,000
we want to make it an open
source university in some
sense so that there's no

22
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:53,440
centralized administration.

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,980
We're going to put it outside of the
reach of administrators and probably

24
00:00:56,981 --> 00:01:01,570
outside of the reach of the regulations
that are credit universities in general

25
00:01:01,571 --> 00:01:03,730
because we're going to set up
our own accreditation system.

26
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:07,540
So we want to operate
completely independently of
the traditional university

27
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:12,541
environment and we're going to make
it a truly internet university.

28
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:15,880
It's not going to be lectures
and multiple choice questions.

29
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,280
We want to take advantage
of the technology.

30
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:23,200
So the first module we're designing
and we want to teach people to write,

31
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,440
speak and think that's,

32
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,440
that's the goals as well as to familiarize
themselves with the treasures of the

33
00:01:29,441 --> 00:01:29,951
past,

34
00:01:29,951 --> 00:01:30,784
let's say.

35
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:36,280
So the first thing we've
designed is a writing module.

36
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:39,610
We're going to release it in modules
so that we can test them against the

37
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,080
potential market.

38
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,030
Instead of,

39
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,540
you know,

40
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,430
designing the whole
university and launching it.

41
00:01:45,431 --> 00:01:46,150
We don't want to do that.

42
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,530
We want to do it piece by piece.

43
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,290
The first thing we're going
to do is to set up a system,

44
00:01:50,291 --> 00:01:51,580
little enabled people to,

45
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,170
to leaf through paragraphs
of from different topics.

46
00:01:56,171 --> 00:02:00,940
So there'll be listed by topics so that
you can find a paragraph pertaining to

47
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:04,780
some philosophical or scientific issue
that's or literary issue that strikes

48
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:05,381
your interest.

49
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:09,340
And then you'll have a chance
to write a summary of it,

50
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,460
to rewrite it or to
write a commentary on it,

51
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,400
then to vote on other people's summaries,

52
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:17,050
commentaries or rewrites.

53
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,543
Um,

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,020
so that there'll be,

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,980
there'll be a competition for writing of
the highest quality and so that all of

56
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:30,760
the topics can be expanded
and annotated and so,

57
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,370
and we'll use crowd

58
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,330
the crowd intelligence essentially to,

59
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,933
to,

60
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,230
to do the evaluations.

61
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,030
So that will be distributed as well.

62
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,253
And then your,

63
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:49,330
your accreditation points will be
dependent on how well you're evaluated

64
00:02:49,331 --> 00:02:50,560
essentially by your peers.

65
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,160
And we'll,

66
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,690
we'll give people more voting power as
they progress through the courses so that

67
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,390
when you first start and you
haven't taken any courses,

68
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,210
then you're voting power
will be very restricted.

69
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:04,540
But as you take more and more courses
and become more and more qualified,

70
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,660
then the power of your vote will improve.

71
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,390
So those are some of the ideas so far.

72
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:10,811
Yeah.

73
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:11,980
I know all my professors,

74
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:15,550
you still lament the fact that students
couldn't write and they would complain

75
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,540
about this religiously,

76
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,360
that the writing standard of
essays and research papers,

77
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,380
they said it was atrocious,

78
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:21,910
atrocious,

79
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,743
atrocious.

80
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,540
I've had in my fourth year seminar,

81
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,340
I have 20 kids.

82
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:28,120
Basically,

83
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,420
they're pretty damn bright because it's
hard to get into psychology owners.

84
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:32,410
It's an honor seminar.

85
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:34,330
It's hard to get into psychology honors.

86
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,830
They're hardworking kids.

87
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,550
Um,

88
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,050
they're devoted to those classes

89
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,870
and they can't.

90
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:41,920
When the first test,

91
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,990
I have them write the
same essay four times,

92
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,280
it gets a first time,

93
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:46,120
it's four pages,

94
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:47,590
then it's six pages,

95
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:48,580
then it's eight pages.

96
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,900
I think that's maybe it's three times and
each time I provide them with a lot of

97
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:55,770
feedback,

98
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,121
tear terror,

99
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,040
their papers apart.

100
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:00,850
The first papers are so
bad that they're actually,

101
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,680
I would say physically painful,

102
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:04,480
degrade choices,

103
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:05,230
bad.

104
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,620
The words aren't integrated
properly into the sentences.

105
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:11,560
The sentences aren't organized
properly into paragraphs.

106
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:13,600
The paragraphs aren't sequenced properly.

107
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,040
The essay isn't coherent.

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,840
There are there,

109
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,430
I would say they're terrible.

110
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:22,180
They really deserve 70% of
them likely deserve an f.

111
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,300
Now what happens is that I only,

112
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,800
the first essay is only worth 5% so I
could just slash it to death without

113
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:35,950
hurting their chances for a
decent grade in the course.

114
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,630
By the second essay,

115
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:39,430
things have improved quite a lot and by,

116
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,270
I think I do do it four times by the
third and the fourth by the fourth essay,

117
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:46,120
and that's the only one semester
the students are writing,

118
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:46,691
well,

119
00:04:46,691 --> 00:04:47,141
first of all,

120
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:48,610
the best essays they've ever read,

121
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:53,910
they all tell me that and essays that
are in comparatively better to the ones

122
00:04:54,011 --> 00:04:55,750
that they had started with,

123
00:04:55,751 --> 00:05:00,130
and it's really sad because it shows
that they have never been taught to write

124
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:04,000
despite the fact that they're very
bright and now they have 16 years of

125
00:05:04,001 --> 00:05:04,834
education,

126
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,280
they've never been taught to write.

127
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,550
So we really want to solve that
problem and we want to make people into

128
00:05:09,551 --> 00:05:13,300
effective speakers and effective
thinkers and that'll be about a five year

129
00:05:13,301 --> 00:05:13,751
project,

130
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:14,561
but it's well underway.

131
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,830
I got two people working on it now
we're sketching out the modules.

132
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:23,360
I'm going to devote a lot of time and
resources to it over the next well into

133
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:26,140
the foreseeable future because
it's a really exciting project.
