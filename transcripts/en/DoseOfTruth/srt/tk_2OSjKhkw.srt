00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,610
Should artists wastes
their time in art school?

2
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:08,881
No,

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:10,470
you shouldn't waste your time ever.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,510
I think your question is,

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:16,710
is it necessarily a waste
of time to go to art school?

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,660
And I would say it depends very much on
the art school and they're on what you

7
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,860
do while you're there.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,073
Um,

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:29,540
if you go to art school and you really
work at it like mad and you devote

10
00:00:30,181 --> 00:00:33,690
yourself to it and you're in the library
and you're studying the great masters

11
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:37,110
and you're crafting your technique and
you're at a school where that's actually

12
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:37,680
possible,

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,680
then you can educate yourself and going
to art school can give you an identity

14
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:47,871
that allows you to investigate
that possibility free
from undue social pressure

15
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:50,460
for some period of time,

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,970
which is really the case with an arts
degree or something like that as well.

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,150
So if you can take advantage of it,

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:01,980
if you're disciplined enough and if you
can find a school that isn't completely

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:07,100
appallingly postmodern and and social
justice oriented instead of oriented

20
00:01:07,921 --> 00:01:08,610
towards art,

21
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,770
then I don't think it has
to be a waste of time.

22
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:13,710
But I think there's a high
probability that it will.
