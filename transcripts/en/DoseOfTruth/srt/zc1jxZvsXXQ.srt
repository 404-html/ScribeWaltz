1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:02,021
Well,

2
00:00:02,021 --> 00:00:06,220
I called this series to psychological
significance of the biblical stories for a

3
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:06,880
reason,

4
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,211
you know,

5
00:00:07,211 --> 00:00:12,211
and the reason was that I'm partially
qualified to talk about such things when I

6
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:17,320
step outside of that.

7
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,263
Okay.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,340
Then I'm not where I should be.

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,460
Okay.

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,580
I don't think that,

11
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,451
see,

12
00:00:31,451 --> 00:00:32,860
I don't think that this is,

13
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:34,450
I'm not going to get this right.

14
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,100
I can't get the words exactly right.

15
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:38,950
This isn't about what
I believe personally.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,800
It's partly because I
don't know what I believe.

17
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:45,640
I don't know what I believe the
world's a very strange place.

18
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:48,190
I've had some very
strange experiences in it.

19
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:54,930
I don't think it's helpful for me to
to step outside my my jurisdiction and

20
00:00:55,241 --> 00:00:55,930
speculate.

21
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,763
Precisely.

22
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,710
The easiest thing would be to say,

23
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:04,651
I think I said,

24
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:08,520
but I had to say today I don't think that
we know what the upper limits of human

25
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,510
possibility are.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,170
Yeah.

27
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:12,160
I don't know what that means.

28
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:12,821
Metaphysically.

29
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:17,320
What I do understand from the gospels
is that even the accounts of Christ's

30
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:20,260
resurrection are complex
and difficult to understand.

31
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:27,910
I think from reading you in large part
that you can make a very strong case for

32
00:01:28,311 --> 00:01:30,860
the symbolic meaning of
the death and resurrection.

33
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,920
I think it does stand for the capacity
of the human logos to die and resurrect

34
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:38,060
continually as it strives upward.

35
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,450
I'm not willing to say that that's
all it means because I don't know what

36
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:49,451
everything means and I don't know about
the fundamental metaphysics of being

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:55,220
like I do believe that it's accurate to
construe being as a battleground between

38
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:56,054
good and evil.

39
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,043
I believe that.

40
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,100
I believe that is the most
accurate way of representing being.

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,340
It's not that most accurate way of
representing the objective world.

42
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,720
That's not the same thing.

43
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,350
Being is that set of experiences which
we inhabit and that's only partly

44
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:15,650
objective and it's not obviously
reduceable to the material.

45
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,830
Not In any straight forward way because
we don't understand the material

46
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:20,390
substrate of being at all.

47
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,421
You know it's,

48
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,254
it's,

49
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,500
and when we do attempt to understand it,

50
00:02:24,501 --> 00:02:25,460
say at the quantum level,

51
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:28,490
we run into mysteries
that that baffle the most,

52
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,060
the most intelligent of us and aware.

53
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,210
So I'm going to have to
leave the question hanging,

54
00:02:35,211 --> 00:02:36,290
but partly because,

55
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,140
partly because I don't know what I think,

56
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,760
but partly because,

57
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:43,780
okay,

58
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,180
there has to be aligned
between what I believe in,

59
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,073
what,

60
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,850
what I can communicate.

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,713
You don't,

62
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,360
what do you believe is beyond your
capacity to articulate if you the most,

63
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:55,780
if the deepest levels of belief,

64
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:00,520
and I can only share with you what I
have actually come understand and there's

65
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:02,980
things that I don't understand
and that's definitely one of them.

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I don't know how to draw a line between
the symbolic significance of the

67
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,180
biblical events,

68
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,780
say the symbolic in psychological
significance of the biblical events and a

69
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,490
metaphysics that's underneath them.

70
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,690
And I think you'll see the same thing
in young because when you own rights,

71
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,360
technically,

72
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,193
informally,

73
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,450
he never talks about God.

74
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:24,340
He always talks about the image of God,

75
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,720
which is not the same thing.

76
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,200
The image of God would be your
subjective experience of God.

77
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:33,040
It says nothing about the objective
reality of God because your subjective

78
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,230
experience can't say much
about objective reality,

79
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,360
but even in young you get this mix.

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,110
You know,

81
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,580
sometimes it's psychological,

82
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,414
but then he,

83
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,250
he makes a metaphysical move.

84
00:03:42,251 --> 00:03:44,530
And I think that reflected also his,

85
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,430
the limits of his knowledge because
you don't have profound revelatory

86
00:03:48,431 --> 00:03:50,380
experiences if it was
a very strange person,

87
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:51,491
you know?

88
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:52,540
And I,

89
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,740
I think

90
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:56,411
so.

91
00:03:56,411 --> 00:04:01,411
I think what's best for me is to stay on
the ground that I'm competent on and to

92
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:07,081
say what I can say about the psychology
and to reach beyond that briefly when

93
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:08,501
it's necessary.

94
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:09,251
But other than that,

95
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,280
to leave it the hell alone
till I understand that better.

96
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:13,480
Assuming that I ever do.
