1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,100
No,
that the snake is

2
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,160
utilize conceptually and metaphorically
as representation of transformation,

3
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:09,350
right?
Because the snake is something that can

4
00:00:09,351 --> 00:00:13,460
shed its skin and be reborn.
We know that a snake is something that's

5
00:00:13,461 --> 00:00:17,840
innately attractive and terrifying human
beings and other primates,

6
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:22,700
so that if you come across a snake,
you're likely to be at least startled,

7
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:26,600
if not horrified by it,
but also attracted to it in a way that

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,390
is underneath your voluntary
consciousness,

9
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:31,610
right?
Because snakes attract orienting reflex

10
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:35,300
isn't they activate the systems
underneath your consciousness that

11
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,670
actually govern the structure of that
consciousness.

12
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,040
We know that the snake can be well
represented as well as internal chaos.

13
00:00:43,041 --> 00:00:47,570
So imagine this,
imagine that it's not unreasonable for a

14
00:00:47,571 --> 00:00:52,571
self conscious mind searching for a mode
of self representation to remark on the

15
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:57,050
parallels between the structure of the
snake and the spine and the brain.

16
00:00:57,051 --> 00:01:00,710
Given that a snake is essentially a
spine with a brain.

17
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:05,480
And then imagine as well that the most
archaic aspects of our nervous system,

18
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:10,250
those that govern novelty and orienting
and anxiety responses are in fact

19
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:15,251
precisely those that were described by
Mclean as nested inside the reptilian

20
00:01:15,831 --> 00:01:18,290
brain.
And then imagine along with the Hindu

21
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,140
Yoga,
is that the purpose of Kundalini Yoga is

22
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:24,740
to activate the circuitry that's
associated with that snake,

23
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:28,790
so to speak,
to produce a permanent state of alert

24
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,430
wakefulness.
It's associated with consciousness.

25
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,103
Ooh,

26
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,770
so imagine this,
imagine an animal like like a zebra

27
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:44,980
grazing mindlessly in the herd with no
consciousness whatsoever.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:49,790
And then imagine it's relatively
undeveloped cortical structures

29
00:01:49,791 --> 00:01:54,791
activated suddenly by the movement of a
lion off in the perimeter.

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,970
And then imagine for that brief moment
that thawed zebra is actually conscious,

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,150
a state that requires a tremendous
amount of energy on difficult to

32
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:04,970
maintain,
but because the threat and the

33
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:09,971
uncertainty manifest itself within the
zebras mode of consciousness,

34
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:13,880
it wakes momentarily.
And then imagine that human beings are

35
00:02:13,881 --> 00:02:17,990
like that.
Zebra always because we've become self

36
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:21,800
conscious because we know that the
unknown is around us all the time.

37
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,770
Even when we think we're safe,
we're never safe.

38
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,530
Imagine that.
The reason we're so conscious is because

39
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:32,270
as a consequence of our discovery of the
possibility of our own mortality,

40
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,100
all of this underlying circuitry that in
other animals is only apparent when

41
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:40,160
they're startled or afraid or interested
or curious.

42
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,050
In human beings.
It's on all the time.

43
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,380
And that's what makes us conscious.
And the reason for that is because we

44
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:50,381
developed enough cortical elaboration to
note that we're always threatened by

45
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:53,150
everything that's around us.
And then imagine that,

46
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:54,920
well,
that's pretty awful,

47
00:02:54,921 --> 00:02:57,500
isn't it?
Because it's at the basis of all our

48
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:01,660
innate existential,
but then imagine as well that without

49
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:06,661
that terror pushing us forward and and
our constant reference to the dangerous

50
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:10,330
aspect of the unknown,
we would have never been motivated to

51
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,120
produce the kind of societies that we've
produced,

52
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:18,121
which are essentially very remarkably
elaborated devices that enable us to

53
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:22,660
find some protection from that unknown
and to manipulate,

54
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:27,280
manipulate it effectively.
And then remembering that story we will

55
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:32,281
return to genesis young says the snake,
his was regarded by early gnostic

56
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:40,020
Christians as a kind of daddy who's
faculties were more developed and

57
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:43,530
advanced than the original daddy that
actually structured the world.

58
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:48,060
The idea there being that the world
initially was a pretty dismal place.

59
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:51,720
Everyone wasn't conscious.
We all existed at the level of the

60
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,660
animal and then the snake came along and
said,

61
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,000
wake up,
wake up.

62
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,830
And the movement from that state of
unself consciousness paradise to this

63
00:04:01,831 --> 00:04:06,831
profane state of awakening can be
regarded not so much as a descent,

64
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,200
but as an asset of sorts,
even though a painful one.

65
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:16,320
And then you have your,
at this commentary from Mephistopheles,

66
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,980
his representation of Satan and his
capacity for temptation,

67
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:24,850
who says,
follow the adage of my cousin's snake

68
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,250
from dreams of God.
Like knowledge.

69
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:32,251
You will wake to fear in which your very
soul shell quake a statement associating

70
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:39,450
the human tendency to attribute to all
revolutionary sources of new

71
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:42,100
information,
uh,

72
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:47,101
kind of demonic being.
And then you have the problem of the

73
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:50,590
woman.
Now we know that within the context of

74
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:54,430
the Judeo Christian tradition,
women have unduly suffered for their

75
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:59,431
role and tempting humanity in the
embodied form of Adam towards higher

76
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,110
order self consciousness.

77
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:02,943
And then you think,
well,

78
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:07,240
let's just take a look at how human
beings and their mating relationships

79
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:11,740
differ from those of other animals like
chimpanzees to whom we are very closely,

80
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,680
genetically related.
And if you look at the mating strategies

81
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:18,430
of female chimpanzees,
you see that they really don't care who

82
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,200
they sleep with,
so to speak.

83
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,180
Any old chimpanzee will do.
Now the last dominant male chimps tend

84
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:27,790
to be chased away by the more dominant
male chimps.

85
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:31,900
But if a female and less dominant chimp
can get the hell away from the watchful

86
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:35,170
gaze of the dominance hierarchy,
they're perfectly happy to mate.

87
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,850
Human females are not like that.
There is selective matters,

88
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,140
and there's a tremendous body of
evolutionary psychological information

89
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:49,120
that suggests that although both genders
value intelligence and physical

90
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:53,740
appearance,
females value the ability to attain

91
00:05:53,741 --> 00:05:57,950
dominance,
hierarchy status in men far than men,

92
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,880
admire the ability to attain dominant
status in women,

93
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:06,910
which is to say that men don't care what
a woman has with regards to potential

94
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:08,330
for attaining status.

95
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,660
Whereas with women,
it's one of the strong determinants of

96
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:13,160
mating preference.
So Len,

97
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:14,060
let's say,
look,

98
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,690
we don't know why the hell our cortex is
expanded so rapidly,

99
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,300
somewhere between five and 3 million
years ago.

100
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:24,710
Let's offer this as a hypothesis.
The women started to get choosy,

101
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,690
and because they were so damn
complicated,

102
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:31,670
the whole human species had to
exaggerate it's cortical growth prior to

103
00:06:31,671 --> 00:06:36,671
any even use for that cortical growth,
just so that the men had an even hand in

104
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,330
the competition,
right?

105
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,430
So women put tremendous selection
pressure on the human being to develop

106
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:46,190
tremendous,
tremendous cortical expansion.

107
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:49,490
Now,
we already know that from a mythological

108
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:52,070
perspective,
that women are frequently casting to the

109
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:56,810
same conceptual domain,
the temptress domain as the benevolent

110
00:06:56,811 --> 00:07:00,200
aspect of the unknown.
And we know as well from representations

111
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:03,920
of hero mythology that it is the
individual who goes out to confront

112
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:06,410
chaos,
who's most likely to free from the

113
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:08,220
Dragon,
not only treasured,

114
00:07:08,221 --> 00:07:11,120
but a virgin,
say in the case of mythological

115
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:13,850
representations like Saint George and
the Dragon.
