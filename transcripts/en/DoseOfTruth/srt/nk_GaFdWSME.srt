1
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,050
So what's the logic?

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,680
Something like,

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:13,801
well,

4
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:16,410
there's an infinite number of
interpretations of the world.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,500
Okay.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,990
You can't tell which of
those are canonically crap.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,853
Correct.

8
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,430
The basic narrative of human struggle,

9
00:00:25,431 --> 00:00:27,020
his oppressor versus oppressed.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,610
We use category structures to can
constrain that infinite number of

11
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:36,050
interpretations because the basic
narrative is oppressor versus oppressed.

12
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:40,760
We choose those narratives that
serve our function as old pressers.

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:44,150
So it's

14
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,450
deeply cynical but credible.

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:50,751
You know,

16
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:55,751
and you can say if you're not naive that
people are motivated by power and that

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,610
our interpretations of the
world can be self serving.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,410
I mean we do want to serve ourselves
after all because otherwise we die and so,

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,730
and we are centered in one place and
so we can't see everything and we're

20
00:01:10,731 --> 00:01:11,564
biased.

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,913
So,

22
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,840
so there is the probability that the
way that we look in the war at the world

23
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:23,230
will be tainted by narrow self interest
and maybe even tainted by ingroup

24
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,400
interests beyond narrow
individual self interest.

25
00:01:26,401 --> 00:01:27,530
And we know this is true,

26
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:29,240
but it's also not all bad.

27
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:29,481
You know,

28
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:34,481
like we a good person takes care of his
or her family or does that mean it means

29
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:36,800
you prefer your family and outsiders?

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,510
You we're going to get rid of that.

31
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,070
It's a form of prejudice.

32
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:45,080
Like it really is like your choice of
sexual partners as a form of prejudice,

33
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,303
right?

34
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,880
I mean maybe it should be
distributed in an egalitarian manner.

35
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,103
Hey,

36
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,750
that would be a lot funnier
if it isn't a possibility.

37
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,310
And like in,

38
00:01:58,311 --> 00:01:58,521
in,

39
00:01:58,521 --> 00:01:58,911
in,

40
00:01:58,911 --> 00:01:59,540
in,

41
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,760
in Huxley's brave new world,

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,560
that was the rule you,

43
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:07,490
you shared yourself with whoever asked
because it was rude not to and you know

44
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:09,920
what it is actually rude not to.

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,870
It's seriously rude.

46
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:12,321
Now,

47
00:02:12,321 --> 00:02:14,210
is that something you want
to take away from people?

48
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,450
You want that to be distributed
in an egalitarian fashion.

49
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,800
How prejudice star you when you
choose someone to sleep with,

50
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,550
you choose that person
and not everyone else.

51
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,500
It's the ultimate in prejudice.

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:27,941
If Hey,

53
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:28,180
you say,

54
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,390
well that's not prejudicial.

55
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:29,871
Oh yes,

56
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:30,680
it is.

57
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,320
Usually go for the most
attractive partner you can find.

58
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,870
Usually go to for the healthiest partner.

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,131
You,

60
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:39,560
you go for the best person you
can find who can tolerate you.

61
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,850
It's prejudicial in,

62
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,640
in every possible way.

63
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,990
So.
