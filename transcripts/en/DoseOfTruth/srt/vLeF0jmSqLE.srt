1
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:04,270
The Prieto distribution,

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,210
it looks like this.

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,000
It doesn't look like
a normal distribution.

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:11,810
A lot of you guys had been told about
not normal distributions and how many

5
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:15,050
things follow a normal distribution.

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,010
Most things,

7
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:19,190
but that's really a limited case.

8
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,130
You can understand a Prieto distribution.

9
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:22,964
If you,

10
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:24,350
you've all played monopoly,

11
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:29,351
I presume at the beginning everyone
has the same amount of money.

12
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,090
We'll include property,

13
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:33,320
the same amount of wealth.

14
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:37,430
Then what happens as the game progresses
and really as a function of chance,

15
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:40,100
I mean I know yet we have to use
your head a little bit and monopoly,

16
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:43,160
but the basic rule is just buy
everything you can get your hands on

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,670
and then trade meanly,

18
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,540
something like that.

19
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:52,990
So at the beginning everybody has the
same amount and then as you begin to play,

20
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,220
if you had enough players you would
develop an a normal distribution because

21
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:02,420
some people would win relatively
consistently and some people would lose

22
00:01:02,421 --> 00:01:03,710
relatively consistently.

23
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,090
And so the money starts to be
distributed in a normal distribution.

24
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:12,860
But the thing about money and the
thing about lots of things is that

25
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,840
zero is involved in zero is a weird
place because if you're playing a trading

26
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:23,360
game and you hit zero,

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,913
then you're done.

28
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:26,721
And so,

29
00:01:26,721 --> 00:01:30,560
and it's very hard to recover from
zero and you know it's really hard to

30
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:30,951
recover.

31
00:01:30,951 --> 00:01:32,690
You know when you're doomed in monopoly,

32
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:33,230
you know,

33
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,660
you can tell you've got some resources,

34
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:40,870
but there's going to be some crisis when
you land on some hotel and you're going

35
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:41,901
to get wiped out,

36
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,381
you know it.

37
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:45,890
So there's a point at which
you're headed for zero.

38
00:01:45,891 --> 00:01:49,970
Even if you have something you
know and you might be rescued by

39
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,323
luck,

40
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,020
but you know when you're doomed.

41
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:04,040
So what happens is that as you continue
to play monopoly more and more people

42
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:09,041
stack up at zero and fewer and fewer
people have more and more money.

43
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,960
And when the game is over,

44
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,920
everyone has nothing except one
person and they have all of it.

45
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,990
Now the funny thing about that is that
in some sense that's how trading games

46
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:21,800
work.

47
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,430
You know,

48
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:22,850
you got,

49
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:23,900
you might wonder why is that?

50
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:27,970
Why there is inequality in a society and
it's easy to consider that it's because

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,740
the society is corrupt and perhaps,

52
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:31,790
you know,

53
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:34,910
society's ours somewhat
or horribly corrupt.

54
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:36,890
That's the variation.

55
00:02:36,891 --> 00:02:41,891
There's no society that's without its
criminal criminal element and fixed

56
00:02:42,351 --> 00:02:44,360
element anyways.

57
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,600
Trading Games tend to produce a Prieto
distribution so that very many people

58
00:02:50,601 --> 00:02:55,250
have very little and a tiny
minority have a tremendous amount.

59
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,710
That's the 1% that you hear about.

60
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,633
Right?

61
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,950
And you know the thing about that 1% is
that that's happened in every society

62
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,030
that's ever been studied.

63
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,420
It doesn't really matter what the
governmental system is and it certainly

64
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,610
handled it certainly
happened under the Soviets,

65
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,630
that's for sure.

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,500
And there was a lot of people who
had enough zero so they just died.

67
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,350
So you know,

68
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,343
the,

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,720
the Utopian dream was
completely unimplementable
for a variety of very complex

70
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:26,800
reasons.

71
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,780
One is that it's very hard to fight
against that distribution pattern when

72
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,680
people are trading.

73
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:34,930
Because mere statistics,

74
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:35,741
we'll do that.

75
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:36,780
And then there's other things that,

76
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,350
and I should tell you as well,

77
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,350
that the Prieto distribution
that governs a lot of things.

78
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,213
So

79
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,560
if you look at books,

80
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,360
if I remember properly last year there
was something like a million English

81
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:50,710
language books published

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,660
and I think 500 of them sold more
than a hundred thousand copies,

83
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:56,681
which is none,

84
00:03:56,681 --> 00:03:56,921
right?

85
00:03:56,921 --> 00:03:57,670
That's none.

86
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:02,590
And of that 500 you can be sure that one
of them was by Stephen King and he took

87
00:04:02,591 --> 00:04:07,591
half the money because there's like five
authors in the English language who are

88
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,400
on every airport paperback stand,

89
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,280
occupying the top rung.

90
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,720
And that's massive real estate,

91
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:16,901
right?

92
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,250
Cause it's replicated everywhere.

93
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:23,640
And because there are so prominent and
because there are no names when people

94
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:26,290
are in a hurry and they
just want something to read,

95
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:28,750
they just grabbed that and then
more money goes to those people.

96
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:29,381
And so,

97
00:04:29,381 --> 00:04:30,214
you know,

98
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,850
success breeds success and
failure breeds failure.

99
00:04:33,851 --> 00:04:35,500
And it's not necessarily linear.

100
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,470
And that's a really
difficult thing to deal with.
