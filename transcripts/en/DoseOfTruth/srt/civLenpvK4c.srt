1
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,653
Nope,

2
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,770
I can't hear you.

3
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,223
Yes.

4
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,763
Oh,

5
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,353
no,

6
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,323
no,

7
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:30,973
no.

8
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,643
Oh,

9
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,103
no.

10
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,803
Shut up.

11
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,390
Ah,

12
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,043
your hobbies.

13
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,213
Okay.

14
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:16,690
Oh,

15
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,450
that would have been good.

16
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,283
You're dumb.

17
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,413
Okay.

18
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:11,280
[inaudible]

19
00:03:59,010 --> 00:03:59,843
yeah.

20
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,560
Supremacy.

21
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:57,510
[inaudible] [inaudible]

22
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:54,450
[inaudible]

23
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,120
barely hear it.

24
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,360
Whoa.

25
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:16,470
[inaudible]

26
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,303
in terms of

27
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,413
speak,

28
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,240
your mind

29
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,500
wants to hear

30
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,720
absolutely no excuse whatsoever.

31
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,650
Even those who

32
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,210
you serve with your university

33
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,850
pandering to the audience and say,

34
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,103
right?

35
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,333
Oh,

36
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,803
no.

37
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,973
Okay.

38
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,130
I feel like we can take that.

39
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,313
Yeah.

40
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:53,630
I'm actually not even like ascension.

41
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,340
He's only here.
