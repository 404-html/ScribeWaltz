1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,800
Any advice for a person with intense
chronic pain that wants to become,

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,160
who wants to become a uh,

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,773
uh,

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,451
oh,

5
00:00:15,451 --> 00:00:16,284
sorry,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:21,690
it switched on the other we go crayola
sheeps has any advice for a person with

7
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,990
intense chronic pain who wants to
become a contributing member of society,

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,200
specifically having the self
discipline to push through pain,

9
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:29,790
to take care of responsibilities?

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,541
Well,

11
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,390
the first thing I would say is that
if you have intense chronic pain,

12
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,050
them,

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,750
my heart goes out to you
because that's really awful.

14
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,810
And so I think that you
can cut yourself a break.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:44,880
I think the fact that you want to become
or continue being a contributing member

16
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:48,330
to society of society is a
testament to your fortitude.

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:52,170
I guess the first thing I would ask
you is if your pain has been reasonably

18
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:52,830
managed,

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,820
you probably know this,

20
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:56,790
and I'm not giving you any
medical advice because I can't,

21
00:00:56,791 --> 00:01:01,320
but you might want to note that there
are antidepressants that are quite

22
00:01:01,321 --> 00:01:03,630
effective as longterm pain medications,

23
00:01:03,631 --> 00:01:04,890
and you may already know that,

24
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,724
but if you don't,

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,290
then you should check that out because
they're not addictive and they can be a

26
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,520
very effective adjunct.

27
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:16,530
I would also say that the literature on
chronic pain tends to indicate that more

28
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:19,290
activity is better than less and that,

29
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,700
and that's partly because when you get
engaged in something that's meaningful,

30
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:24,534
let's say,

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,310
and important to you,

32
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,510
that that activates the
dopaminergic system,

33
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:34,830
the same system that cocaine activate
sound that can produce a fairly pronounced

34
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:35,910
analgesic effect.

35
00:01:35,911 --> 00:01:40,620
So I would say everything that you can
do to get yourself occupied with things

36
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:43,620
that you regard as important
and worthwhile is actually
probably going to help

37
00:01:43,621 --> 00:01:44,940
you manage your pain better.

38
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,940
It looks like inactivity is a bad,

39
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,313
is bad.

40
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,400
Generally speaking,

41
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,270
for chronic pain,

42
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:51,630
I mean,

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,160
obviously that's not the case.

44
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:58,050
If the sort of activity that you're
engaged in is of the type that will

45
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:01,860
aggravate an underlying chronic
physiological condition.

46
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,450
But I would say,

47
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,290
uh,

48
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,130
make a plan,

49
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,480
make a daily plan,

50
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,770
make a weekly plan,

51
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:08,640
um,

52
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,473
make it,

53
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,081
you know,

54
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:14,430
push yourself a little bit farther than
you can go comfortably on a weekly basis

55
00:02:14,431 --> 00:02:16,350
and see how far you can get any year.

56
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,550
That's because,

57
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,420
what's your choice?

58
00:02:18,421 --> 00:02:19,254
I mean,

59
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,550
you're laying there,

60
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:24,270
suffering is not preferable
to doing things and suffering,

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,740
not generally.

62
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,370
So I would say like more
power to you for trying and,

63
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:29,940
but,

64
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,340
but also do keep in mind that activity,

65
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,310
meaningful activity is a good analgesic.

66
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:36,144
So,

67
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,020
um,

68
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,250
Eric Butler says,

69
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,500
sheesh Canadians never get it.

70
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,131
Well,

71
00:02:41,131 --> 00:02:41,911
I didn't know we'd get it.

72
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,770
Sometimes there are,

73
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:43,500
come on now,

74
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,333
you know,

75
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,151
give us a break.

76
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:45,511
We're just,

77
00:02:45,511 --> 00:02:47,730
Canadians were freezing
to death half the time.

78
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,630
So,

79
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:48,931
you know,

80
00:02:48,931 --> 00:02:52,800
we do pretty well given the fact that
every day here in the winter is the

81
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,910
equivalent of a national
catastrophe in the u s so anyways,

82
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,613
um,

83
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,760
Betsy Kirk lender says,

84
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,500
if the second amendment is taken away,

85
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:04,720
there will be nothing to
protect your freedom of speech.

86
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,010
That is how important it is.

87
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:06,341
Yes,

88
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,860
well not is certainly the
argument that people who are,

89
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,340
um,

90
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,530
motivated to protect the
second amendment make.

91
00:03:13,531 --> 00:03:15,160
And I'm not going to oppose that.

92
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,490
So.
