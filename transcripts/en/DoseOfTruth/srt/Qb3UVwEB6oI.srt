1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:08,180
Point is that I,

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,320
one of the things that I told you,

3
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:11,550
if you are going to be my client,

4
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,630
as you just don't,

5
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:14,790
you don't just tell your
audience your assaults,

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,800
you owe your audience your life.

7
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:17,230
Uh,

8
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,230
Jordan had helped me 20
years to articulate what I
meant by that and it's simply

9
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:26,900
that if deserve to be a superstar,

10
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,183
then you,

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,290
you will become an iconic figure.

12
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:35,590
And 12 year old kids will paste posters
this view up on their bedroom walls and

13
00:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,071
you will be,

14
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:37,341
you know,

15
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:38,750
the concept of the Trellis.

16
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:40,760
You wrote a tomato plant on a trellis.

17
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:46,020
Well you will be the trellis on which
people row you will be the role model.

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,710
So your life is one of the most
important things you have to offer.

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,630
But I wasn't just after
their superficial life.

20
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,510
I was after I was after this.

21
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,600
When you sit down,

22
00:00:57,601 --> 00:00:57,930
okay,

23
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,800
of an afternoon,

24
00:00:58,801 --> 00:01:01,620
let's say at two o'clock in the afternoon
with a blank computer screen or a

25
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:04,590
blank piece of paper and
you need to write a lyric.

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,330
You feel as if you could,

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,940
you don't know how you've ever
written a lyric in your life.

28
00:01:08,941 --> 00:01:11,280
You certainly know you can't
write another one again.

29
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,480
And by four o'clock in the afternoon,

30
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,830
on a good day,

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,890
there's a lyric in front of you
like four o'clock in the afternoon.

32
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:18,671
A really,

33
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,740
really rare good day.

34
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,870
That lyric is so perfect in itself,

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,730
but it feels like it
wrote itself through you.

36
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:25,780
Yeah.

37
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,040
When you go on stage,

38
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,200
if you see the dog,

39
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:31,210
the pupils of the audience dilating,

40
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:33,430
if you see their faces melting,

41
00:01:33,431 --> 00:01:35,290
losing individual characteristics.

42
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:39,430
If you see their energy fusing into
a collective energy rather than just

43
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,540
individual energies.

44
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:43,210
And if that collective force reaches,

45
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:43,950
uh,

46
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,301
a,

47
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:48,730
a pseudopod out to you and hooks into
something inside of you that's bigger than

48
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:49,750
yourself and again,

49
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,100
you'll feel like an empty
pipe and something inside
you was transmogrifying all

50
00:01:54,101 --> 00:01:57,070
of this energy and flooding
it back down to the audience.

51
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,280
In a riverbed Vitori circuit and
you have an out of body experience.

52
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:04,750
You Watch yourself from the ceiling as
you are dance that self inside of you,

53
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,400
the dances you onstage,

54
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,290
that is your fucking goddamn soul.

55
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,400
And that's mark by and 10 to find.

56
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:13,860
And that's what I intend
to introduce you to.

57
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:14,963
Why?

58
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,890
Because you are about to become an icon.

59
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,750
And if you become an icon,

60
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,930
you have to be a force that takes hundreds
of thousands or even tens of millions

61
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,880
of kids who feel lost in the world,

62
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,990
who don't dare express their feelings
because there are no except socially

63
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:35,350
acceptable words for their
feelings and who feel crazy,

64
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,990
isolated and alone.

65
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:38,101
And you,

66
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:40,200
by revealing what's deep inside of you,

67
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:42,840
will validate what's deep inside of them.
