1
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:10,500
Thanks,

2
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,890
thanks.

3
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,100
Thanks

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,840
Dan.

5
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,030
Thanks

6
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,820
Dan.

7
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:03,500
Thank

8
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,730
you.

9
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,980
Where

10
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,820
you're not attempting to
actually communicate to

11
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:10,510
super position in what's essentially a
dominance hierarchy and using your verbal

12
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:13,150
techniques in order to

13
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:20,070
give me some temporary from
an intellectual perspective
and I think there's a

14
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,820
place for that sort of thing.

15
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,083
Awesome.

16
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,500
Although it pales in comparison to
the utility of a genuine conversation,

17
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,871
you know,

18
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:37,150
and I was asked today or times

19
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:45,460
correspondent part from
you today and asking you

20
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,650
about conversational style.

21
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,373
No.

22
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,460
One of the things that I've mentioned to
her voice that I would have rather have

23
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,050
the conversation with Kathy
Newman be a genuine conversation,

24
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,750
did not contest with a victory.

25
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,700
Even though I was fortunate enough in
that circumstance I would say to come up

26
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,720
with that doesn't mean the way that
when quest for the best I can have

27
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,630
collateral effects.

28
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,190
You're just like having a
reciprocal theater council.

29
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,690
My car that were very positive,

30
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,970
but it would've been a lot better.

31
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,830
I would think it would have been a much
better indicator of the health of our

32
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:33,670
culture.

33
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,000
If we could have just had an intelligent
discussion about what was the.

34
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:41,380
We were talking about extending something
that resembled hand to hand combat,

35
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:41,681
you know,

36
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:44,680
in a very modified form on television.

37
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:49,230
I think that one of the reasons
that the neuron online media,

38
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,250
our classroom incredible rapidity is
because much of our public dialogue has

39
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,460
degenerated into dominance hierarchy
conversation where one person up and gabby

40
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:05,800
three eight perspective is correct.

41
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,170
You know the problem with
demonstrating that your eight,

42
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,530
your eight perspectives threat
isn't what the hell you know.

43
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,290
You know,

44
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:19,460
we just don't run into
anyone ever who sold wise,

45
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,980
been deployed is absolutely
everything they open could be,

46
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,580
you know,

47
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,000
it only takes seconds of self reflection.

48
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,550
I understand that there's
a lot you don't know,

49
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,760
which is really cool because what you
know is insufficient to provide me with

50
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,110
everything you need.

51
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,990
And so the fact that there's a
lot more that you don't know,

52
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:44,800
it was about the most helpful thing you
can possibly imagine because there's

53
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:48,340
always the possibility that you might
learn something that you really need to

54
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:52,330
know and there's always the possibility
that the person that you're talking to,

55
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,530
even if you disagree with them or maybe
even because you disagree with them.

56
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,710
My the key to something that
you agree to meet John Hall.

57
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:01,300
You know what?

58
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,220
I've learned this.

59
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,290
I'm going to tell you a
story about Carl Rogers.

60
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,400
I recommending books by
women had one called on me.

61
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:11,234
For example,

62
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,283
Roger,

63
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,120
you know,

64
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,230
handful of cameras.

65
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:20,231
So clinicians from the 20th century were
pretty outstanding teachers in regular

66
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:20,701
thing.

67
00:06:20,701 --> 00:06:23,540
I to say is not the speed useful.

68
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,280
You know,

69
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,760
when these people usually put in 25,000,

70
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:28,693
30,000,

71
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:33,780
50,000 hours of intense conversation with
people who were really in trouble most

72
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:37,710
of the time to go see a
clinical psychologist,

73
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,500
to be doing things that have gone astray
in some ways that you can imagine.

74
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,820
Some of the conversations that you have
with the psychotherapist are generally

75
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:47,830
extremely serious.

76
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Have endless opportunity to engage in
complex discussions with people who were

77
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,440
trying to solve extraordinary
difficult problems,

78
00:06:57,441 --> 00:07:00,810
and one of the things I
liked about Roger says he,

79
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,190
he sort of formalized the idea,

80
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:03,890
Freud,

81
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:08,540
Freud in some sense invented the idea
that conversation could be curative,

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,860
but he never really thought about,

83
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,550
but as the conversation
itself being curative,

84
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,050
he thought about it as the revelation
of secrets that were toxic.

85
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,350
It's something like that.

86
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:23,351
So if you had an extremely negative
experience sometime in your life,

87
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,710
joy,

88
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,710
it would be useful for you
from an emotional perspective
to be able to express

89
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:32,770
that emotion at that
women faculty curator.

90
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,790
That actually seems to be wrong.

91
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,960
Sometimes great thinkers are growing
and productive and interest in waves.

92
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,390
So Freud was right,

93
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,340
that careful conversation
that could be curative,

94
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:44,850
but he was wrong about the mechanisms.

95
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,380
It doesn't the expression of
emotion that appears to be curative.

96
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,360
It's the articulation of the
situation and the analysis of it.

97
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,980
So then you understand why it happened
so that you don't do it again or so that

98
00:07:57,981 --> 00:07:59,240
it doesn't happen to you again.

99
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,220
National expert.

100
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,210
The purpose of memory.

101
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:01,821
You think,

102
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:01,971
well,

103
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:05,330
the purpose of memories to
remember the past and that's wrong,

104
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,223
the grinch,

105
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,320
if you don't do the same damn stupid
thing over and over again so your mind

106
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,140
isn't satisfied with his representation
of the negative event until you've

107
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:22,770
analyzed of so you can find
out why put in that situation,

108
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:27,350
even if you're the anxiety,

109
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:28,943
your

110
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,730
or someone else,

111
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,690
they want to know exactly why it happened
and then they want you to come up with

112
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:37,700
a strategy so it doesn't happen again,

113
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,560
and so that's the real secret to the
curator power of therapeutic conversation.

114
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,980
It's something that's worth doing just
in your day to day life when you're

115
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:49,640
talking to people because if someone has
something that's troublesome that they

116
00:08:49,641 --> 00:08:53,480
need to relate to you free of what
they're trying to do is articulate out the

117
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:57,810
causal sequence that led to
negative consequences and
to come up with a strategy

118
00:08:57,811 --> 00:08:59,280
for avoiding that in the future.

119
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,510
Patient listening can really
help them through that.

120
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,121
Generally,

121
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,140
if you're a therapist,

122
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,390
mostly what you do is listen.

123
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,040
You know what you find,

124
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,400
and this is something brought
yourself outlined quite carefully.

125
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,720
You find that if you ask people,

126
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,300
they will tell you what's
wrong in their life.

127
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,410
They're figuring out what
they don't want them.

128
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:23,790
They'll think through and
can think through solutions
and your job is to listen

129
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:28,590
so they can most people think by
talking and maybe to ask questions of

130
00:09:28,591 --> 00:09:29,640
clarification.

131
00:09:29,641 --> 00:09:32,460
So of my clients are talking to me.

132
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,150
Um,

133
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,340
and what I'll do is I sit and listen.

134
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,800
It's sort of a meditative state or not
trying to impose a few point part of it

135
00:09:39,801 --> 00:09:41,340
because I don't want to write like,

136
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,260
I don't know what your
throne will be as you know,

137
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:44,310
but whatever it is,

138
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:49,140
it's not my problem they have and I
don't necessarily know what the solution

139
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:50,100
should be for you.

140
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,780
And so I'd be very hesitant,

141
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,830
hesitant to even suggest that
it might be because you know,

142
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,780
you're your own particular being.

143
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,170
Your solution isn't going to be.

144
00:09:58,171 --> 00:09:59,100
I get to public line.

145
00:09:59,101 --> 00:10:02,320
And then if you asked just no,

146
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,440
I never questioned why people are
anxious that just makes sense,

147
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,560
are anxious all the time
and it's the same pain.

148
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:12,650
It's like you're in pain.

149
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,630
It's unsurprising.

150
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:14,970
It's like life is pain,

151
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,320
pain,

152
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,310
that's the real miracle.

153
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:20,610
You should be on your piece about that
because it's not gonna last very long.

154
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,740
So Roger's idea is this,

155
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,650
he said a couple of things.

156
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:30,570
So the first thing is if you're
going to have a conversation,

157
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:33,650
you have to decide that you want
things to be better rather than worse.

158
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,720
And so that's,

159
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,540
that's hard because you know what it's
like when you're angry with someone you

160
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:42,780
might be willing to take a couple of
blows to the head if you could just punch

161
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:46,680
them four or five times more and so you
know you're willing to take a fair bit

162
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:48,850
of pain if you can
inflict even more knots.

163
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,200
And so that's something we probably want
to see if you can overcome right at the

164
00:10:52,201 --> 00:10:52,930
beginning.

165
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,251
I think,

166
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:58,140
well I get irritated at you and I can
think of all the things I'd like to

167
00:10:58,141 --> 00:10:59,220
reflect some pain,

168
00:10:59,221 --> 00:11:04,221
but maybe I can regulate itself like
intelligent person work for the student to

169
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:06,200
be better.

170
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,440
So that's the first thing you phone and
I think that's part of the commitment of

171
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:15,500
marriage or a relationship
or marriage in particular.

172
00:11:15,781 --> 00:11:19,770
It's one of the things that you sort of
square onto Indians that you're actually

173
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:22,680
going to try and make things
better for each other.

174
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,110
And for yourselves as a cop that's.

175
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,050
And you know,

176
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,580
we fall short of that because people
aren't paying any stretch of the

177
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,251
imagination.

178
00:11:32,251 --> 00:11:32,671
Perfect.

179
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,130
But this is what you're hoping for her.

180
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,640
It's like,

181
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,740
why else would you ever bought it with it?

182
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,310
You know,

183
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:41,060
it's just a hopeless costs
right from the beginning.

184
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,470
You're in before you got to Orient
yourself to try to make things better.

185
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:51,320
Then the other person mastery pain
because one of the things Roger says,

186
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:54,720
apart from the fact that you're going
to get dr whatever the problems happened

187
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:55,270
to be,

188
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,100
perhaps as the perpetrator,

189
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,000
which is a big problem,

190
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:01,090
then you're gonna have to come down
with yourself ethically and all of that,

191
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:05,150
which is unbelievably annoying
and difficult because you
will like what you find

192
00:12:05,151 --> 00:12:06,000
most of the time.

193
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,090
So.

194
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:09,290
But you also have to be patient.

195
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,060
But the first one or three of sort
of landscape of trouble and pain,

196
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:17,250
and they're going to do that badly and
stupidly in they never take manner.

197
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:19,260
Maybe you want to help them with that.

198
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,001
You know,

199
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:23,650
like you know what are the things
that you might want to think too,

200
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:26,890
especially if you're the person who wins
the arguments is that maybe you don't

201
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:27,724
want them to do so.

202
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:33,370
Maybe you want to to formulate the
arguments even more powerfully so that you

203
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:37,690
configure that you can help them solve
it so that you don't have to be the

204
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:41,530
stupid winter all the time because
it's not a good longterm solution.

205
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:45,370
So now it's a funny thing because you
don't generally think or maybe it would be

206
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,400
a good idea to help your opponent make
even better arguments that they make.

207
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,510
But if you have to be married to them
or if they're a close knit part of your

208
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,410
immediate community,

209
00:12:53,411 --> 00:12:55,510
that that's exactly what you want to do.

210
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,710
So Rogers would say,

211
00:12:56,711 --> 00:12:56,891
well,

212
00:12:56,891 --> 00:13:00,580
you listen to the person and he
asked questions of clarification.

213
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:04,180
You Orient Yourself so that you're
willing to change if necessary,

214
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,900
because Roger's also pointed out that
one of the impediments to listening is

215
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:11,710
courage because people will tell you
things that will require change on your

216
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,940
part that's destabilizing and unsettling
and required to soul search if you

217
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:16,481
don't want that.

218
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:21,481
So it requires courage to to actually
listen and it requires courage to try to

219
00:13:21,771 --> 00:13:22,640
make things better.

220
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,940
So let's say you have in place,

221
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,750
he asked questions and
clarification and see.

222
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,501
One of the things,

223
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:29,801
again,

224
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:31,720
I'll refer to that Kathy Newman,

225
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,400
a interview.

226
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,530
What you kept saying to me was so new.

227
00:13:35,531 --> 00:13:38,590
You're saying so what you're saying was,

228
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,280
and then she would provide a summary
of what I was hypothetically say,

229
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:45,640
which had absolutely nothing
to do with what I say.

230
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:49,870
So I mean African striking the
evidence to me very rapidly,

231
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,330
but I think to everyone who watched
the interview as it progressed,

232
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:54,610
what you're supposed to do to say,

233
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:54,941
okay,

234
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:58,600
well here's what I think you said and
you don't want to be a smart ass about.

235
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,780
You don't want a strong man,

236
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:03,910
your opponent because then you're in
the position of like trivial victor,

237
00:14:03,911 --> 00:14:04,570
you know,

238
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,130
if I listened to you
when you say something,

239
00:14:06,131 --> 00:14:11,131
even if it's not that love formulated and
parody of and satirize it feeding back

240
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:12,240
to you.

241
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,450
It's like it's demonstration.

242
00:14:13,451 --> 00:14:16,540
Maybe by momentary
intellectual superiority,

243
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,740
but probably not,

244
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,560
but it's not helping with
the damn conversation call.

245
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:25,650
What Roger was recommended was then you
restate what the person said that to

246
00:14:25,741 --> 00:14:30,741
them in terms they agree with and so
sometimes that means to do make your

247
00:14:30,761 --> 00:14:33,220
argument for them better
than they needed themselves.

248
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:36,730
That's actually an indication that you're
really listening so the person lays

249
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:37,900
out their problem,

250
00:14:37,901 --> 00:14:38,681
whatever it happens to be,

251
00:14:38,681 --> 00:14:39,041
and you say,

252
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:39,801
okay,

253
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:41,680
as far as I can tell,

254
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,600
here's what you meant,

255
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:49,260
and the second rule for
the Rogerian dynamic and
conversation was the person who

256
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,740
has to agree with you summary,

257
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:53,630
and so that's real stringent task,

258
00:14:53,631 --> 00:14:53,900
right?

259
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,260
Especially if someone is criticizing you.

260
00:14:56,261 --> 00:14:56,571
It's like,

261
00:14:56,571 --> 00:14:56,841
okay,

262
00:14:56,841 --> 00:14:58,460
I'm listening to the damn criticism.

263
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:58,780
It's like,

264
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,890
I'm not going to just roll
over and agree with it,

265
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:02,510
but I'm going to listen to it,

266
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,240
so then you tell me what your
problem is with me and I think,

267
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:05,511
okay,

268
00:15:05,511 --> 00:15:07,130
as far as I can tell,

269
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,340
this is what you think the
problem is and if you agree,

270
00:15:10,341 --> 00:15:10,701
it's like,

271
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,870
well then I was listening.

272
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,390
Well then what are the
things Roger's pointed out?

273
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,420
They're not?

274
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,580
Which is true,

275
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:19,040
but law actually like it's true.

276
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,280
If you interact with someone and
you're not acting like that's true,

277
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,180
they're not going to be happy with you
because if I interact with you like

278
00:15:26,181 --> 00:15:27,380
you're not valuable,

279
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,660
we're not going to have a
very pleasant conversation.

280
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,900
It certainly not going to be the
grounds for any continuing relationship,

281
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,590
so we definitely treat each other when
we're treating each other like it works.

282
00:15:36,591 --> 00:15:40,490
We treat each other like we have a spark
of divinity within us and it's at the

283
00:15:40,491 --> 00:15:41,750
core of our law,

284
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:46,810
so it's like all so always the possibility
that it's true possible in what's the

285
00:15:47,001 --> 00:15:49,580
alternative that we have
no value whatsoever.

286
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,530
No transcendent value whatsoever.

287
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:56,300
At least we're conscious beings that
confront reality and give it shape.

288
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,500
That's something.

289
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,880
It's not trivial

290
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,910
so well with speed.

291
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,293
Well birthday,

292
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,320
fake her up one day.

293
00:16:10,321 --> 00:16:11,154
Now you want.

294
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,880
You want more misery.

295
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,340
There's enough damage.

296
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,960
Misery as far as I can tell,

297
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:17,880
right?

298
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:22,880
So maybe lead actually
broadened my misery in the

299
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,533
evening.

300
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:30,980
The family bringing ecosystem
is a visit that's back,

301
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:36,020
but evil is the breeding of misery into
existence for the sake of the mission

302
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,670
and you don't get that.

303
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,370
Then you have thought about
yourself very much at all,

304
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,140
all the time.

305
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,110
Try and make it worse than they have to
be delighted in the faculty naturally,

306
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:51,410
even if it's directed
towards himself that time,

307
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:54,400
she might just start by doing that,

308
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,450
like just decided,

309
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,293
well,

310
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:59,570
I'll try to purposely make things worse.

311
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,710
How would that be?

312
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,053
Well,

313
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,500
you can run it as an experiment.

314
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:03,921
You might think,

315
00:17:03,921 --> 00:17:04,041
well,

316
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,870
what if you turned down
for three or four years,

317
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,450
so I cannot really do anything
that makes things worse.

318
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:09,480
Well,

319
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,313
how much better would it be?

320
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,570
And that's just kind of
didn't really do nothing.

321
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,960
It wasn't that good motto,

322
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,891
do no evil,

323
00:17:18,891 --> 00:17:20,460
and they dropped that back.

324
00:17:20,770 --> 00:17:21,640
I noticed

325
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,890
finger on what you want,

326
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,570
so here's something to want.

327
00:17:35,571 --> 00:17:37,300
There's this philosopher named Emmanuel,

328
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,270
the end of this idea for like an epic,

329
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:42,230
and he said,

330
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:47,530
don't do anything that you would want
to be expressed as a general universal

331
00:17:47,781 --> 00:17:48,614
rule.

332
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,310
So you're gonna make a decision.

333
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,091
You think,

334
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:51,361
okay,

335
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,240
well this is the decision that
everyone would make everywhere.

336
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:55,620
How would that work out?

337
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,640
That's a good way of judging whether
or not your decision is acceptable

338
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,853
day.

339
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,660
Let's say you want things to be good.

340
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,460
That's good.

341
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,291
Okay,

342
00:18:10,291 --> 00:18:11,990
so let's think about what good means.

343
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,021
Well,

344
00:18:13,021 --> 00:18:15,700
certainly it means an
absence of stupid software.

345
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,400
We can all agree on that.

346
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:19,300
So less offering it would be good.

347
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,850
We can start fast like,

348
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:21,800
well,

349
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:25,740
there's positive of goods that you can
only vision and so we won't reciprocity

350
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,330
in human history.

351
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:30,080
I think it's partly because
there's so many items,

352
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:30,290
right?

353
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:35,070
The step of building that
will be 9 million before
population starts to decline.

354
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,840
That'll happen about 30 years,

355
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,550
so we can probably manage that.

356
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:38,790
Right?

357
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,010
We've probably managed building.

358
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,260
It doesn't look like we're going to
overpopulate the planet and but also looks

359
00:18:45,511 --> 00:18:47,160
to me like we could
have anything we wanted.

360
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:50,130
No Gates,

361
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:50,741
Bill Gates,

362
00:18:50,741 --> 00:18:51,121
you fingers.

363
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:54,420
You can get rid of the five
most significant transmissible
diseases in the next

364
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:55,254
20 years.

365
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:59,880
We have the rate of poverty in
the world from the year 2000 2012.

366
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,300
We're hoping about 300,000 people a
day with the power grid right now.

367
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,170
Like obesity is a bigger problem
than starvation by a huge margin.

368
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:07,920
So I can.

369
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,390
There's the devil victory for you.

370
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,350
So you know,

371
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,710
and of course there's a million
insane genius silicon valley who are,

372
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,920
who are coming up things so fast
that they can't even keep track.

373
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,200
We're going to have intelligent
machines in no time flat.

374
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,610
So we've got to decide.

375
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:36,511
You might think,

376
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,020
well,

377
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,320
maybe it's time for us collectively and
I truly believe is the case to be the

378
00:19:41,321 --> 00:19:43,650
face of what we want

379
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,970
and why not?

380
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,530
We're all British know certain people
are Richard and other people definitely

381
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,920
were Richard than in any human beings
have ever been in the entire history of

382
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:00,973
the

383
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:02,880
opportunity.

384
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,720
In front of us,

385
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:05,290
we can make of that what they wanted,

386
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,130
but we have to be discipled.

387
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:12,840
We'd have to sharpen yourself openness
and determine whether we want to recreate

388
00:20:12,841 --> 00:20:16,980
the hell of the 20th century to do at
the drop of a hat or whether we want to

389
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:21,480
bring something new and remarkable being
I would say the way we're going to do

390
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:24,390
that isn't really even by
collective decision making,

391
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,730
perhaps not even by policy,

392
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,080
but by because no,

393
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,320
nobody knows what's coming.

394
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,160
Right?

395
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,140
Things are coming down so fast
but don't know what it is.

396
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,070
It's like so what do you do when things
are coming at you so fast that you can

397
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:36,600
prepare and that's risk.

398
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:40,710
Get to get ready so that you can.

399
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:44,370
You can contend with whatever comes your
way and you do that by straightening

400
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:46,870
your cell phone and God
only knows I was straight.

401
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:51,430
We get and so and you don't have anything
better to do than to try and trying to

402
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:55,090
justify as the suffering of life
and stops you from being bitter.

403
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:58,780
So what's the downside to that?

404
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,200
Adopt the responsibility.

405
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,281
That's it,

406
00:21:03,281 --> 00:21:04,410
but the responsibilities,

407
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,251
the meaning in life,

408
00:21:05,251 --> 00:21:05,650
it's like,

409
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:05,861
well,

410
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:06,760
that's not so bad.

411
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,910
Is it a responsibility or an opportunity?

412
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,530
It's a responsibility.

413
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:12,660
If someone forces and dawn,

414
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,533
you know,

415
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,810
opportunity if you decide
to do it voluntarily,

416
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:18,903
so

417
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:24,400
it's a nice place to stop.

418
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,820
Thank you.
