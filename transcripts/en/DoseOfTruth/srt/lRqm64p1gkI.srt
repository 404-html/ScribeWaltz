1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,580
One of the things that people are very
much confused by in the modern world is

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,150
what our tech people meant by Gods.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,250
And that's because whatever the day
these were that had the motive force,

4
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:21,550
that archaic people attributed to the
Gods seemed to have disappeared in modern

5
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,803
culture.

6
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,620
Now the young end hypothesis is that's
because they turned into psychological

7
00:00:26,621 --> 00:00:29,710
traits fundamentally
or motivational forces.

8
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:30,820
So what the,

9
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,700
what archaic societies
would describe as Gods,

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,770
we would describe as motivational forces.

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,000
So for example,

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,680
Venus is a goddess,

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,521
the goddess of love,

14
00:00:39,521 --> 00:00:44,521
and we would associate her power
with love and sex fundamentally.

15
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,280
And the reason that that's an reasonable
association from the archaic standpoint

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:55,650
is because the motive quality that
makes up what Venus represents is

17
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:56,890
transpersonal,

18
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:01,891
which means it's not limited to one person
and it's immortal in that the motive

19
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:06,400
force that characterizes
sexual affiliation exists,

20
00:01:06,401 --> 00:01:08,740
whether or not a single individual exists.

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,300
So it's transpersonal has the force of
a personality because if you fall in

22
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:14,134
love,

23
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:18,400
you're motivated by a certain set
of standards and perspectives,

24
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:18,611
right?

25
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,260
If you're gripped by beauty,

26
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:25,261
say or if you're gripped by lust that
imposes a particular view of the world on

27
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:30,490
you and impels your action sometimes
despite your will and so that would be

28
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:34,990
equivalent from the archaic perspective
to possession and it's clearly the case

29
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,110
that archaic societies who are
engaged in warfare for example,

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,850
would conduct rituals to ensure that the
warriors that made up their societies

31
00:01:42,851 --> 00:01:45,220
were in fact possessed by the correct God.

32
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:49,330
So it might be Mars for example the Roman
God of war so that on the battlefield

33
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:53,080
they exhibited the proper characteristics
of somebody who was in a battle,

34
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:53,530
right,

35
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,220
rage,

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:55,450
you can think rage,

37
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:00,190
so possession by the god of war would be
equivalent to this possession by state

38
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:00,580
of rage.

39
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,410
Now it's not quite that simple.

40
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,390
It isn't only that archaic
people externalized motive
forces and gave them the

41
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:08,470
status of Daddy's.

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,420
What they did was more complex than not.

43
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:13,090
And I think you can understand that
a little bit better if you start to,

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,130
if you start to give some thought to
the modern behavioral notion of the

45
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:20,410
stimulus and the stimulus is a very,

46
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:24,850
very weird concept because the behavior
is who weren't interested in taking

47
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:29,200
apart what was inside the brain would
attribute motive force to the stimulus,

48
00:02:29,201 --> 00:02:29,471
right?

49
00:02:29,471 --> 00:02:31,570
They'd say if you present
an animal with the stimulus,

50
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,370
he will therefore act.

51
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,730
And that meant that their behaviors
were making the presupposition that the

52
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:40,930
motive power resided in
some manner in the stimulus.

53
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:41,380
Well,

54
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,681
why,

55
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:42,970
why would they think like that?

56
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:43,151
Well,

57
00:02:43,151 --> 00:02:45,220
it's an archaic mode
of thought in a sense.

58
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,410
You could imagine a child saying,

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,273
um,

60
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:51,670
one of my friends today
made me really angry.

61
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,001
Right?

62
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:56,410
Which means that the child is essentially
conflating his or her own internal

63
00:02:56,411 --> 00:03:00,070
emotional state with the proximal
stimulus that rise to that state.

64
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:04,330
And you see complex associations like
that taking place with regards to the

65
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:05,380
apprehension of beauty.

66
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:05,621
Say,

67
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,610
because beauty is a very,

68
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:09,610
very complex and difficult
to localize phenomena.

69
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:11,620
If you're very attracted to someone,

70
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,110
are you attracted by them?

71
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:14,501
Well,

72
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,041
in a sense,

73
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,560
of course you are
because they are the art.

74
00:03:16,561 --> 00:03:17,980
But in another sense you're not at all.

75
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:22,981
Because what's happening is that you're
engaged as much in the attraction as

76
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,960
anything that's motivating
you from the outside world.

77
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:29,200
And I think that partly accounts
for your sense of foolishness,

78
00:03:29,201 --> 00:03:32,470
especially if the person that you're
attracted to doesn't return your

79
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:33,130
attraction.

80
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,963
I mean,

81
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,710
you know that from your
perceptual perspective,

82
00:03:38,711 --> 00:03:41,200
you're attracted and
dominated by the object.

83
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:42,430
But by the same token,

84
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:47,230
you know entirely that easy as it is to
presume it's them and their faults say

85
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,480
pretty much it all has to do with you.

86
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,750
So in the modern world where we've been
able to separate out the object and the

87
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:56,320
motive force of the object,

88
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,010
the day of these have sort of moved
inside of us and becomes psychological

89
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:00,551
forces.

90
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:03,430
But you can understand if you think about
it in this manner that things weren't

91
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:06,370
so clear prior to the
dawn of the empirical age.

92
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,850
That gives you a little bit of background
with regards to what the notion of

93
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:20,851
Daddy meant to archaic societies who
still utilize those notions as ex

94
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:23,080
explanatory terms.
