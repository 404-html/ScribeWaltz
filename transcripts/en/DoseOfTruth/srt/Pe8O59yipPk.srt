1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,990
So let's say that we're going
to play repeated trading games,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,240
and if you're a very agreeable,

3
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,120
then you're going to
bargain harder on my behalf,

4
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:10,800
then you're going to
bargain on your own behalf.

5
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,450
Whereas if you're very disagreeable,

6
00:00:12,451 --> 00:00:13,440
you're going to do the reverse.

7
00:00:13,441 --> 00:00:14,274
You're going to think,

8
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,120
I mean this trading game for me and
you are going to take care of your own

9
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:20,200
interests where an agreeable
person is going to say no,

10
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:20,760
no,

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,800
at best this is at worst,

12
00:00:22,801 --> 00:00:26,190
this has to be 50 50 but I'd
like to help you every way I can.

13
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:27,121
Okay,

14
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:27,870
now the credit,

15
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,141
okay,

16
00:00:28,141 --> 00:00:28,690
so you Kinda,

17
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,670
you kinda understand that.

18
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:33,000
Now the advantage to being agreeable
then is that you're good in teams and

19
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:35,820
you're very much likely to give
other people credit that bad.

20
00:00:35,821 --> 00:00:38,970
The downside of being agreeable is that
you're not very good at putting forward

21
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,870
your own interests.

22
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,350
And so one of the things that
predicts salary across time,

23
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,184
for example,

24
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,060
is agreeableness.

25
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,350
And it predicts it negatively.

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,320
And so it's part of the reason
why women get paid less than men.

27
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:53,850
And this is something for the women in
the class to really listen to because

28
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:54,660
you,

29
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,840
how you get paid across time depends
on a very large number of things,

30
00:00:57,841 --> 00:00:58,051
right?

31
00:00:58,051 --> 00:01:01,710
It depends on your skills
and your abilities and your
position and your social

32
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:02,700
network and all of that,

33
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,790
but the other thing it depends on is
whether or not you actually go ask for

34
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:09,990
money or maybe that you don't even ask
because actually you don't ask for money.

35
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,380
You tell people that you need to be paid
more or something they don't like will

36
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:15,390
happen and I don't mean as a threat.

37
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,070
I mean that you have to be willing
when you're negotiating to have an

38
00:01:20,071 --> 00:01:20,640
alternative,

39
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,610
you go talk to your boss who isn't
going to give you money because everyone

40
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:24,300
wants money,

41
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,510
right?

42
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,650
It's a competitive game.

43
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,693
You're going to have to be,

44
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,960
you're going to have to go there and say,

45
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:28,560
look,

46
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,820
here's what I do.

47
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,410
Here's why it's useful.

48
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,280
Here's why you have to give me more
money and this is by opportunities.

49
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,270
If you don't,

50
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,140
and then you're not taking your boss's
money anyways because it's very seldom,

51
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:43,320
very frequently the case that he's
working for a whopping big company,

52
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,630
but he needs an excuse to give you money
because everyone's asking for money all

53
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,350
the time.

54
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:54,330
And so you have to put your case
forward powerfully and disagreeable.

55
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,751
Now,

56
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,510
you don't want to do it to disagree and
bleed because then he's going to think

57
00:01:57,511 --> 00:01:58,350
that you're a son of a bin.

58
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,880
Maybe he's not going to give you anything,

59
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:02,310
and maybe you'll get fired for
being mouthy and all of that.

60
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,980
And that certainly happens to
people who are too disagreeable.

61
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,630
You got to get the balance right,

62
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:08,160
but it's definitely the case.

63
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,680
And the other thing that happens
to women that's also worth noting,

64
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:13,560
and this is probably because
they're higher negative emotion,

65
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:17,310
is they tend to underestimate their
own utility in business settings,

66
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:17,821
right?

67
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:21,930
Because if you're trying to evaluate
what you're like and you're more tilted

68
00:02:21,931 --> 00:02:25,320
towards negative emotion than the things
that you do that are wrong are going to

69
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,220
stand out more,

70
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,920
more on the foreground and the
things that you do that are right.

71
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,180
So if you go into a negotiation and
you're uncertain already because you have

72
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:36,450
self doubts and then you're
agreeable in the negotiation,

73
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:40,080
what's going to happen is that
you're not going to win as often.

74
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:44,190
And winning in in a business setting or
in a career development setting means

75
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,940
more opportunity for promotion
and more revenue generated.

76
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,410
Now the downside of that,

77
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:49,831
of course,

78
00:02:49,831 --> 00:02:53,430
is as you climb the business hierarchies
that you also have to take on more

79
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:54,390
responsibility.

80
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,780
And that responsibility is
sometimes unpleasant as well,

81
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:01,690
especially to people who are agreeable
because you're not necessarily liked if

82
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:05,380
you're in a position of authority and
agreeable people really like to be liked.

83
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:09,100
It's their primary motive motivator
because they're concerned about the

84
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:09,551
maintenance,

85
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,031
I would say,

86
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:10,810
of of,

87
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,320
of,

88
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,600
of intimate positive relationships.

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,700
But that also makes
them conflict avoidant.

90
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,601
Okay.

91
00:03:16,601 --> 00:03:19,030
So now you guys can think about this,

92
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:19,864
but,

93
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,760
but I'll,

94
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,760
I'll tell you why.

95
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:25,450
I think the personality differences
between men and women exist now,

96
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,850
these are speculative hypotheses,

97
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:30,460
but they're reasonably well documented by,

98
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,780
by the relevant literature.

99
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,171
So let's,

100
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:32,951
let's think about it.

101
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:36,280
The first thing we might think about is
what's the difference between men and

102
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:36,760
women?

103
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:36,941
Well,

104
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:37,774
how do they differ?

105
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:38,771
Well,

106
00:03:38,771 --> 00:03:42,310
the first thing we might observe is that
if you look at personality differences

107
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,700
between p pre pubescent boys and girls,

108
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,930
they're not very large.

109
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:49,480
Boys and girls don't
differ in terms of their,

110
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,010
their trait neuroticism,

111
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,844
for example.

112
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,160
What happens is that
when puberty kicks in,

113
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:58,780
women's trait neuroticism rises and it
stays higher than men for the rest of

114
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,500
their life.

115
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:03,430
And this is why you see this reflected
in the different kinds of psychopathology

116
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:04,031
that be set,

117
00:04:04,031 --> 00:04:04,721
the two sexist.

118
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:07,390
So men are overrepresented in alcoholism,

119
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,171
drug abuse,

120
00:04:08,171 --> 00:04:09,430
antisocial personality,

121
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:13,000
and a host of learning disorders as
well as add attention deficit disorder.

122
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:16,870
And women are overrepresented in
depression and anxiety primarily.

123
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,230
That seems to be tightly associated
with higher levels of trait neuroticism

124
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:24,130
because maybe it's if you're at
the 95th percentile or higher,

125
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,200
let's say in trait neuroticism,

126
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,860
there isn't much different than difference
between that and being somewhat prone

127
00:04:29,861 --> 00:04:31,060
to depression and anxiety.

128
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,460
And because the curves overlap,

129
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,060
you know,

130
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,670
th th th the curves aren't identical.

131
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:39,040
The normal distributions are
identical for men and women.

132
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,510
You tilt the one to the,

133
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,081
to the right,

134
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,400
to the women's curve,

135
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,740
to the right towards higher
levels of neuroticism.

136
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,430
You go out,

137
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,630
you look for the person in 20 who has
the highest levels of negative emotion,

138
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,030
it's much more likely
to be female than male.

139
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:52,691
Okay,

140
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,250
so let's see if we can figure out why.

141
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,050
So we're going to tell you some things,

142
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:57,760
basic differences between men and women.

143
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:59,800
And you can tell me what you
think about it if you are,

144
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,030
if you agree or disagree.

145
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,810
Okay.

146
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,830
First size differential emerges
between men and women at puberty,

147
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:06,700
right?

148
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,790
Because boys and girls are roughly the
same size and roughly the same strength.

149
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:13,510
But men get bigger at puberty
when the testosterone kicks in.

150
00:05:13,511 --> 00:05:14,590
And more importantly,

151
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,750
not only do they get taller and heavier,

152
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,090
but their upper body
strength is much higher.

153
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,010
And that's a real issue for for
combat because human beings punch.

154
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,420
There's other animals that do that.

155
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,710
Kangaroos do that two ways.

156
00:05:26,711 --> 00:05:27,520
So we're not the,

157
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,870
we're not the only people that punch,

158
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,790
but we have clubs on the ends of our arms.

159
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,780
So That's interesting.

160
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:32,291
So okay,

161
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,320
so there's a bar,

162
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,490
there's a body size difference that's
important to strength differential,

163
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:37,324
that's important.

164
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,830
Next thing I think.

165
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,180
So let's assume that the reason that women
are higher in sensitivity to negative

166
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:46,300
emotion is because the world is
actually more dangerous to women.

167
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,470
I think that women's nervous
systems are not adapted to women.

168
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,840
I think women's nervous systems are
adapted to the mother infant dyad.

169
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:59,480
And because you are not the same
creature when you have an infant,

170
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,440
not at all,

171
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,670
you're way more vulnerable.

172
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,780
And it's partly because you have to
express their vulnerability of the infant

173
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,340
and you also have to care for it.

174
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,031
Right?

175
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:09,860
So you think about an infant,

176
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:11,360
especially under nine months.

177
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,313
So let's say,

178
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:16,220
how are you going to be wired up if you're
going to optimally care for an infant

179
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,060
under nine months?

180
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,380
And I'm saying under nine months,

181
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:22,370
because women generally do the bulk of
childcare for infants who are under nine

182
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:23,060
months old.

183
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,230
And part of the reason for that,

184
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,730
there's a whole host of reasons,

185
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:28,340
but part of the reasons for that
obviously is that they breastfeed.

186
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:32,210
But imagine what you need to be wired
up biologically in order to care for an

187
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:32,690
infant.

188
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,523
First of all,

189
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,450
they're very demanding,

190
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,830
right?

191
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:41,030
Because they're completely helpless and
they're demanding 24 hours a day and

192
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:41,864
it's quite,

193
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:43,010
it's quite,

194
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,550
uh,

195
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,061
it's quite,

196
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:44,390
uh,

197
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,440
emotional load.

198
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,140
And an infant under nine
months is never wrong,

199
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,310
right?

200
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:52,400
What you do to an infant under nine
months is when they're in distress,

201
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,960
you always respond.

202
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,970
You never tell the infant,

203
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,430
get your act together and stop whining,

204
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:58,880
right?

205
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,780
Which you can do,

206
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:00,590
say to an end,

207
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,180
to a child that's 18 months old,

208
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:04,190
you can start having that
sort of conversation,

209
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,610
but under nine months it's like
nothing is the infant's fault.

210
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,300
It's surrounded in an
extraordinarily threatening world.

211
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,230
And you have to be responsive to what
it needs regardless of what you want.

212
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:17,960
And you have to be very sensitive
to the threats that emerged in the

213
00:07:17,961 --> 00:07:18,794
environment.

214
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,090
And so I think the price that women pay
for that ability to have an intimate

215
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:27,110
relationship with infants in the very
earliest stages of development is that

216
00:07:27,111 --> 00:07:31,370
their nervous systems are actually
wired so that they can perform that role

217
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,353
optimally.

218
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:36,470
And the disadvantage to that
is that having a temperament
like that doesn't work

219
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:39,080
that well when you're
dealing with adult men,

220
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,260
especially when you're dealing with them
and in a business environment because

221
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,640
it's not the same thing.

222
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,541
Not at all.

223
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,770
It's a competitive environment.

224
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:46,401
So,

225
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:46,641
okay,

226
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:48,920
so agreeable people are
compassionate and polite.

227
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,720
What are disagreeable people like?

228
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,550
They're tough minded.

229
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,563
They're blunt,

230
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,650
they're competitive,

231
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:56,960
and they won't do a damn
thing they don't want to do.

232
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,240
So it isn't exactly
that they're aggressive,

233
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:02,420
although they will push you the hell
out of their way if you're in the way.

234
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,110
They're not.

235
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:05,870
They're not like volatile like you are.

236
00:08:05,871 --> 00:08:07,700
If you're high in neuroticism,

237
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:09,050
it isn't defensive aggression.

238
00:08:09,051 --> 00:08:10,670
It's more like predatory aggression.

239
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,470
It's dominance behavior.

240
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,180
And so for someone who's high,

241
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,103
who's high,

242
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,460
highly disagreeable,

243
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,780
they look at the world as a place
in which they can compete and win.

244
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,400
And I'll tell you a story,

245
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,234
I have a friend,

246
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,480
I gave him my personality test,

247
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,450
the Big Five aspects scale that Colin
de Young developed tongue in my lab.

248
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,673
And uh,

249
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,360
I knew he is a disagreeable guy
and by interacting with them,

250
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:39,140
I mean he's even rude to people
sort of spontaneously on the street.

251
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,340
I actually liked them quite a bit.

252
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:40,641
He's very,

253
00:08:40,641 --> 00:08:41,181
very funny.

254
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,140
He's also very conscientious
so you can trust them,

255
00:08:43,141 --> 00:08:44,870
but it's disagreeable as hell.

256
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,273
And uh,

257
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:49,460
so I gave him this task because I thought
it would be funny and he came out as

258
00:08:49,461 --> 00:08:54,461
the most disagreeable person in 10,000
so reasonably reasonable in compassion,

259
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,810
both 30th percentile but
like 0.001 in politeness.

260
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:04,200
So he's extraordinarily blunt and
he'll just say absolutely anything,

261
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,700
no matter how horrible it is.

262
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:09,330
And he was often brought into
corporations to sort of clean them up.

263
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,090
So if a corporation was
tilting and not doing well,

264
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,570
they bring him in to find out how
the useless people were in fire them.

265
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,950
And I talked to him about that because
I've had the miss opportunity to have to

266
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,900
not have graduate students in my lab,

267
00:09:21,901 --> 00:09:22,411
for example,

268
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:23,340
that weren't performing well.

269
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:24,061
And I'd find it very,

270
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:24,990
very difficult to,

271
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,561
you know,

272
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,990
dress someone down and certainly
difficult to fire them.

273
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,360
I just hate it because I'm
actually quite an agreeable person,

274
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,320
much to my chagrin.

275
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,660
And I asked him about that and I said,

276
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:33,811
well,

277
00:09:33,811 --> 00:09:34,620
what do you do?

278
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,180
You have to fire people all the time.

279
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,140
How do you handle out?

280
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:37,411
He says,

281
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,130
handle it.

282
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,210
I enjoy it.

283
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:40,523
And I thought,

284
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:40,951
wow,

285
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,200
that's so interesting that
someone would have that response.

286
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:43,501
I said,

287
00:09:43,501 --> 00:09:43,591
well,

288
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:44,790
what do you mean you enjoy it?

289
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:45,031
He said,

290
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:45,331
look,

291
00:09:45,331 --> 00:09:49,710
I go into these companies and I analyze
the performance of groups of people,

292
00:09:49,711 --> 00:09:49,991
right?

293
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:51,180
And there's in those groups,

294
00:09:51,181 --> 00:09:52,560
there are people who are really striving,

295
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:56,550
really trying hard and working themselves
really hard and being productive.

296
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,070
And then there's these people
that are just doing nothing.

297
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:00,000
They're completely in the way.

298
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,380
They don't carry their weight at all.

299
00:10:01,381 --> 00:10:03,360
They take advantage every chance they get.

300
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,610
And they're always whining
about why they can't work.

301
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:08,940
It's like I find out who they are and
call them into my office and I tell them

302
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:10,200
exactly what they've been doing.

303
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,610
It's like hit the road buddy.

304
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,480
You've had your,

305
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,710
you've had your run of it.

306
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,873
And I thought,

307
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,630
Oh yeah,

308
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,110
okay,

309
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,943
fair enough.

310
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:17,221
You know?

311
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:17,611
Well,

312
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:18,450
I can tell you,

313
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:18,721
you know,

314
00:10:18,721 --> 00:10:22,890
I've had situations in my lab where I
had underperforming graduate students and

315
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,520
one of the things that was really awful
about that was that it was really hard

316
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:28,440
on the high performing graduate students,

317
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,071
you know,

318
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:33,480
because they felt that even being in the
same category as the people who weren't

319
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,870
working hard and pulling their
weight devalued what they were doing.

320
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:37,561
You know?

321
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:38,730
And that's exactly right.

322
00:10:38,731 --> 00:10:40,130
And so this is also why there's,

323
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,880
there is a conscientiousness trait
and it agreeableness trait because

324
00:10:44,881 --> 00:10:47,910
conscientious people judge
you on your accomplishments,

325
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:48,510
right?

326
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,220
They don't give a damn
about your feelings,

327
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:50,910
not a bit.

328
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:51,570
It's like,

329
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,100
are you doing the work or not?

330
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,540
Whereas agreeable people think,

331
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:54,781
well,

332
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,470
you know,

333
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,090
your mother is sick and you know you've,

334
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,440
you've got a bunch of family problems and
we all have to take care of each other

335
00:11:01,441 --> 00:11:03,250
and it's no wonder that
you're having a rough time.

336
00:11:03,251 --> 00:11:06,990
And like you can't say that one of
those attitudes is correct and the other

337
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:07,824
isn't correct.

338
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,970
You can't say that.

339
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,630
There wouldn't be those two dimensions
if there wasn't something correct about

340
00:11:12,631 --> 00:11:13,410
both of them.

341
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,380
But you can certainly point
out that often they conflict,

342
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:16,981
you know,

343
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:18,240
and so the demand for,

344
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,010
for inclusiveness and unity and care and
the demand for high level performance

345
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,510
in a hierarchical structure,

346
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,030
they're very different
orientations in the world.

347
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:32,010
And so it's complicated for people
who are agreeable and conscientious.

348
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:37,260
And actually I think often that
large corporations and large,

349
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,590
large institutions of any sort run on
the unheralded labor of people who are

350
00:11:43,321 --> 00:11:45,950
high in agreeableness and high
in conscientiousness and they're

351
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,350
disproportionately women in my
experience in large institutions,

352
00:11:49,351 --> 00:11:53,790
has been that if you want to hire
someone to exploit appropriately,

353
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,931
not appropriately,

354
00:11:54,931 --> 00:11:57,840
if you wanted to hire someone
to exploit productively,

355
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
you higher middle aged women who are
hyper conscientious and who are agreeable

356
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,630
because they'll do everything.

357
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,790
They won't take credit for
it and they won't complain.
