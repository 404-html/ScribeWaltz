1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,001
No.

2
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:11,400
There's this idea in very deep
idea and clinical psychology,

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,930
a fundamental idea,

4
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:14,940
which is that if someone's
anxious about something,

5
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:15,930
what you do is you,

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,610
and it's getting in their way.

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,510
You take what they're anxious about,

8
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:20,700
new,

9
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,950
define it cause that already d limits it,

10
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:23,221
right?

11
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:25,920
Because one of the problems with being
anxious about something as you won't

12
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:26,754
speak of it,

13
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,960
it's like Voldemort.

14
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,490
And then if you don't speak of it,

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,560
it's way bigger than it should be.

16
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:32,790
As soon as you start talking about it,

17
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,960
you cut it down to size.

18
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,453
And so,

19
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:35,781
and it,

20
00:00:35,781 --> 00:00:36,900
it's for a bunch of reasons.

21
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:37,734
It's because you're not as,

22
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,690
you're not as afraid of as many things
as you think and you're braver than you

23
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:43,524
know,

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,120
and more and more capable.

25
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:48,690
So as soon as you're brave enough to
start talking about what you're afraid of,

26
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,050
then you see that there's more to you
than you thought and that there's less to

27
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,460
the problem than you thought.

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,430
And then you can decompose it further
into smaller problems and then you can

29
00:00:57,431 --> 00:00:59,530
figure out how to approach
those smaller problems.

30
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,693
And so,

31
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:04,060
and then it doesn't seem to meet
to be that you get less frightened.

32
00:01:04,061 --> 00:01:06,160
It seems to be that you
get more courageous,

33
00:01:06,161 --> 00:01:09,070
which is way better than
being less frightened because
there's lots of things to

34
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:09,761
be frightened about.

35
00:01:09,761 --> 00:01:12,340
So if you're courageous that
that really does the trick.

36
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,790
Now the question is what
happens if you like,

37
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:20,650
let's say that you're a very socially
inept and you don't know how to introduce

38
00:01:20,651 --> 00:01:24,610
yourself or to make any established
the initial parts of relationship with

39
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:25,420
anyone.

40
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:29,620
And so then you start putting yourself
in situations where you're required to do

41
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:30,340
that.

42
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:31,510
And so then the question is,

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,900
how is it technically that you transform?

44
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:35,561
You say,

45
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:35,741
well,

46
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:36,760
you learn well,

47
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:39,010
we want to be more specific about that.

48
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,360
What does it mean that you learn?

49
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,021
Well,

50
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:44,800
if you're dealing with someone who's
particularly socially inept and you're

51
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:45,880
doing psychotherapy with them,

52
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:49,960
you might teach them how to
shake someone's hand properly
and say their name and

53
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:51,400
remember the other person's name.

54
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,260
So you just practice that with them so
that they have the motoric routine down.

55
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,990
So that form of knowledge is
built right into your body.

56
00:01:58,991 --> 00:01:59,291
It's like,

57
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,400
look at the person,

58
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:01,720
put out your hand,

59
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,291
shake it.

60
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,570
Don't not like a dead Halibut,

61
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,030
but you know with a reasonable grip,

62
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,440
say your name,

63
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:09,250
don't mumble it.

64
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:09,550
Look,

65
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,200
look at them so that they can hear you.

66
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,580
And then when they say their name,

67
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:13,540
tried to remember it,

68
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,570
and that's men.

69
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,600
So you can practice that with people.

70
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:18,970
And so then they develop
something that's motoric,

71
00:02:18,971 --> 00:02:19,181
right?

72
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,620
It's embedded right in their body.

73
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,053
And so,

74
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,870
and then you can say to them,

75
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:27,980
well the other thing you can do is when
you start a conversation is don't sit

76
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,990
there thinking about what
you're going to say next.

77
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,620
Because then you won't be paying attention
to the person and you'll make a fool

78
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:38,450
out of yourself because
you'll manifest nonsequitors.

79
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:38,780
Right?

80
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,820
Because you'll get out of,

81
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,800
it's like if you're dancing and all
you're paying attention to is where your

82
00:02:42,801 --> 00:02:43,634
feet are,

83
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,740
then you're going to step on
the other person all the time.

84
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:50,180
So you want to pay attention to the other
person and then whatever automatized

85
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:52,880
social knowledge you have
will come to the forefront.

86
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,100
So it's a good thing to know
if you're socially anxious,

87
00:02:55,101 --> 00:02:55,610
right?

88
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,720
If you're socially anxious,

89
00:02:56,721 --> 00:03:01,120
one of the things you should do is pay
way more to the person you're talking to

90
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,440
rather than less.

91
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:05,410
And you should pay as little
attention as possible to yourself.

92
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,380
So if you feel yourself falling
in because you're anxious,

93
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,860
then what you do is you
push your attention out and
pay attention to the person

94
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:13,960
because to the degree that
you've been socialized,

95
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:16,290
then all your automatic
responses will kick in.

96
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,141
So,

97
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:17,661
but anyway,

98
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:21,400
so you go out into the social world and
you learn to shake someone's hand and

99
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:25,540
you learn how to listen to them and ask
them questions because that's the next

100
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:25,781
thing.

101
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,830
Because people love,

102
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,230
you can't just ask them random questions,

103
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:29,771
obviously.

104
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,790
But if they start talking to you and you
don't understand something about what

105
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,700
they're saying or maybe something they
said is interesting and you ask them a

106
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,480
question,

107
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,270
they're pretty damn happy about that
because it means you're actually paying

108
00:03:40,271 --> 00:03:44,230
attention to them and people actually
love to be paid attention to because it

109
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,670
hardly ever happens.

110
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:46,691
So they really,

111
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:47,441
really like it.

112
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:48,274
And so,

113
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:48,581
okay,

114
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:49,030
so,

115
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,050
so what's happening?

116
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,070
Well first of all,

117
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,850
you're mastering the
automated motor movements,

118
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:55,480
right?

119
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,710
Where to point your eyes,

120
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,880
where to put your hands,

121
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,170
how to move your lips,

122
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:01,030
like really embodied knowledge.

123
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:04,120
It's a special kind of memory
and you're practicing that.

124
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,060
And so that's building new skills for you.

125
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:11,050
And then by listening to the person
and watching yourself interact,

126
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,480
you're also generating new,

127
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,130
new abstract information that enables
you to conceptualize the world in a

128
00:04:18,131 --> 00:04:18,940
different way.

129
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:23,380
So if you go out to 10 you go out
and talk to 10 different people or 50

130
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:24,220
different people,

131
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,550
then you get to listen to
what those 50 people said.

132
00:04:27,551 --> 00:04:28,840
You get to watch how they're,

133
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,040
how they express themselves and
you gather a corpus of knowledge,

134
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:33,611
the changes,

135
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:36,670
the way you perceive that
broadens you as a social agent.

136
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,361
Okay.

137
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:38,830
So that's two forms of knowledge.

138
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:41,110
But then there's a third one
which is really interesting,

139
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:42,880
which is that you know,

140
00:04:42,881 --> 00:04:47,710
you have a lot of biological potential
and it's hard to know what potentially

141
00:04:47,711 --> 00:04:47,861
is,

142
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:52,861
but part of it is that you're capable
of generating proteins that you haven't

143
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,220
been generating.

144
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,870
So you should get right
on that by the way.

145
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:56,953
So,

146
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,400
but what the way that works in part is
that if you put yourself in a radically

147
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,420
new situation,

148
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,790
then your brain that,

149
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,020
that there are genetic switches that
turn on because of the demands of the new

150
00:05:08,021 --> 00:05:08,854
situation,

151
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,690
that code for new proteins.

152
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,890
So it's as if you have latent software.

153
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:18,790
That would be one way of thinking about
that will only be turned on if you go

154
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,010
into the situation where that's necessary.

155
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,390
And so then you might think,

156
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:22,780
well,

157
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,890
if that's the case,

158
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,220
how much have you could be turned on
if you went a whole bunch of different

159
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,054
places.

160
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,260
And that's a really,

161
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:29,620
really,

162
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:34,620
that's a profound question because one
