1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,280
So
let's say,

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,000
let's say you go into a,
you can do this in a room,

3
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:15,970
it's quite fun to do it just when you're
sitting in a room like a room,

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,250
maybe your bedroom,
you can sit there and just sort of

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:19,210
meditate on it.
Think,

6
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:22,570
okay,
if I wanted to spend 10 minutes making

7
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:25,540
this room better,
what would I have to do?

8
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,250
And you have to ask yourself that,
right?

9
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:29,830
It's not a command.
It's like our genuine question and

10
00:00:29,831 --> 00:00:31,780
things will pop out in the room that you
know,

11
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:34,990
you like there's a stack of papers over
there that's kind of bugging you and you

12
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:38,350
know that maybe little order there would
be a good thing and you know,

13
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:40,990
you haven't.
There's some rubbish behind your

14
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:44,650
computer monitor that you haven't
attended to for like six months and the

15
00:00:44,651 --> 00:00:47,920
room would be slightly better if it was
a little less dusty and the cables

16
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:49,480
weren't all tangled up the same way.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,280
And like if you,
if you allow yourself just to consider

18
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,910
the expanse in which you exist at that
moment,

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,840
there'll be all sorts of things that'll
pop out in it that you could just fix.

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,850
And you know,
I might say,

21
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:05,590
well,
if you were coming to see me for

22
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:08,860
psychotherapy,
this easiest thing for us to do first

23
00:01:08,861 --> 00:01:10,750
would just be to get you to organize
your room.

24
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:11,681
You think,
well,

25
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:13,960
is that psychotherapy?
And the answer is,

26
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:16,660
well,
it depends on how you conceive the

27
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:21,661
limits of your being.
And I would say start where you can

28
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:22,990
start,
you know,

29
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,810
if,
if something announces itself to you,

30
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,640
which is a strange way of thinking about
it,

31
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:31,090
as in need of repair that you could
repair,

32
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:33,130
then hey,
fix it.

33
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,320
You fix 100.
Things like that.

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,830
Your life will be a lot different.
Now,

35
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:42,880
I often tell people to fix the things
that you repeat every day because people

36
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:45,010
tend to think of those as trivial,
right?

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,350
You get up,
you brush your teeth,

38
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,000
you have your breakfast.
You know,

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,280
you have your routines that you go
through everyday.

40
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,430
Well,
those probably constitute 50 percent of

41
00:01:54,431 --> 00:01:57,430
your life and people think,
well there Monday and I don't need to

42
00:01:57,431 --> 00:01:58,540
pay attention to them.
It's like,

43
00:01:58,541 --> 00:01:58,871
no,
no,

44
00:01:58,871 --> 00:02:01,360
that's exactly wrong.
The things you do every day,

45
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:05,050
those are the most important things you
do hands down.

46
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,350
All you have to do is do the arithmetic.
You figure it out right away,

47
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:13,530
so 100 adjustments to your broader
domain of being and there's a lot less

48
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:20,380
rubbish and there's a lot less rubbish
around at a lot fewer traps for you to

49
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:25,381
step into and so that's in keeping with
[inaudible] idea about erasing the dis.

50
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,970
Once you've got your mind and your
emotions together and once you're acting

51
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:34,630
that out,
then you can extend what you're willing

52
00:02:34,631 --> 00:02:39,631
to consider yourself and start fixing up
the things that are a part of your

53
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:40,930
broader extent.

54
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,640
Now sometimes you don't know how to do
that,

55
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:45,130
so you might say,
imagine you're walking down bloor street

56
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:48,820
and there's this guy who's like
alcoholic and schizophrenia and has been

57
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,780
on the streets for 10 years.
He sorta stumbled towards you and you

58
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:53,770
know,
incoherently mutters something.

59
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,480
That's a problem and it would be good if
you could fix it,

60
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:00,760
but you haven't a clue about how to fix
that.

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,620
You just walk around that and go find
something that you could fix because if

62
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:09,430
you muck about it that not only is it
unlikely that you'll help that person,

63
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:11,740
it's very likely that you'll get hurt
yourself.

64
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,790
So you know,
just because while you're experiencing

65
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:19,030
things announced themselves as in need
of repair,

66
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,970
it doesn't mean that it's.
You write that in there that should

67
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:24,280
repair them.
You have to have some humility.

68
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,860
You know,
you don't walk up to a helicopter that

69
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:28,840
isn't working and just start tinkering
away with it.

70
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,690
You have to stay within your domain of
competence.

71
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,420
But most of the time if people look at
their lives,

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,960
you know,
it's very interesting thing to do.

73
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,660
I liked the,
I liked the idea of the room because you

74
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:42,840
can do that at the drop of a hat.
You know,

75
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,830
we go back to where you live and sit
down and think,

76
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:47,590
okay,
I'm going to make this place better for

77
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:52,180
half an hour.
What should I do it they have to ask and

78
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,320
things will just pop up like mad and
it's partly because your mind is a very

79
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,300
strange thing.
As soon as you give it a name,

80
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,320
a genuine aim,
it'll reconfigure the world and keeping

81
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:05,350
with that aim that that's actually how
you see to begin with.

82
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,980
And so if you set it a task,
especially if you have to be genuine

83
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:11,080
about it,
which is why you have to bring your

84
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,040
thoughts and emotions together and then
you have to get them into your body so

85
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:16,330
you're acting consistently.

86
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,650
You have to be genuine about the aim,
but once you aim the world will

87
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:24,880
reconfigure itself around that aim,
which is very strange and,

88
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:26,400
and it's,
it's,

89
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,200
it's technically true.
You know,

90
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:33,280
the best example of that,
you have all seen this video where you

91
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,410
watch the basketballs being tossed back
and forth between members of the white

92
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:41,710
team versus the black team.
And while you're doing that,

93
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:44,590
a gorilla walks up into the middle of
the video and you don't see it.

94
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:47,410
It's like you know,
if you thought about that experiment for

95
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,780
about five years,
that would be about the right amount of

96
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:53,260
time to spend thinking about it because
what it shows you is that you see what

97
00:04:53,261 --> 00:04:57,340
you aim at and that man,
if you can get one thing through your

98
00:04:57,341 --> 00:05:00,640
head and as a consequence of even being
in university,

99
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:01,600
that would be a good one.

100
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,540
You see what you a map and so because
one

101
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,520
inference you might draw from that is be
careful what you aim at.

102
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:13,630
Write it.
What you aim at determines the way the

103
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,960
world manifests itself to you,
and so if the world is manifesting

104
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:21,790
itself in a very negative way,
one thing to ask is,

105
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,830
are you aiming at the right thing?
Now,

106
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,450
you know I'm not trying to reduce
everybody's problems to an improper aim.

107
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:31,000
People get cut off at the knees for all
sorts of reasons.

108
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,100
You know they get sick,
they have accidents.

109
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:35,860
There's a random element to being,
that's for sure,

110
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,200
but and so you don't want to take
anything.

111
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,280
Even that particular phrase too far.
You want to bind it with the fact that

112
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,240
random things do happen to people,
but it's still a great thing to ask.

113
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,450
Okay,
so rogers was a phenomenologist and he

114
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,284
was interested in.

115
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,650
He didn't start his philosophy from the
perspective of subject versus object or

116
00:05:56,561 --> 00:06:00,080
from the idea of psyche,
like sort of inside you,

117
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:04,790
your mind with its layers.
That's not how we looked at it and so

118
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:08,130
let's go through.
Well,

119
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
I'll introduce you to rogers I think,
and then we'll talk about it more next

120
00:06:11,841 --> 00:06:14,300
time.
I'm going to start though with something

121
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,050
that I learned from him that I think it
was of crucial importance and so we'll

122
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:22,550
set the stage for the further discussion
with this and I'm going to read it to

123
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:26,240
you.
Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to

124
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:28,580
be in contact and to receive
communications.

125
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,500
We may say that the greater the
community,

126
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:33,560
the communicated congruence of
experience,

127
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:38,060
awareness and behavior on the part of
one individual,

128
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,290
the more the ensuing relationship will
involve a tendency towards reciprocal

129
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:46,130
communication with the same qualities,
mutually accurate understanding of the

130
00:06:46,131 --> 00:06:49,400
communication's improved,
psychological adjustment and functioning

131
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,590
in both parties and mutual satisfaction.

132
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:54,200
In the relationship,
it's quite a mouthful.

133
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,130
What does it mean?
Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to

134
00:06:58,131 --> 00:07:00,500
be in contact and to receive
communications.

135
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,690
Okay,
we're having a conversation.

136
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:06,860
I'm deciding I'm going to listen to you.
Right?

137
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,940
That's different than how people
generally communicate because usually

138
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:13,370
when they communicate,
they're doing something like,

139
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,740
okay,
we're going to have a conversation and

140
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:18,830
I'm going to tell you why I'm right and
all win.

141
00:07:18,831 --> 00:07:23,660
If you agree or maybe you're having a
conversation where I don't know what

142
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:25,430
you're trying to do,
maybe you're trying to impress the

143
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:27,590
person you're talking to so you're not
listening to them at all.

144
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,510
You're just thinking about what you're
gonna say next.

145
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,550
Okay,
so that's not this.

146
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:35,900
This is.
You might have something to tell me and

147
00:07:35,901 --> 00:07:40,040
so I'm going to listen on the off chance
that you'll tell me something that would

148
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:44,090
really be useful for me to know,
and so you could take about it as an as

149
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:45,800
an extension of the Piagetian.

150
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,130
Piaget talks about the fundamental,
the fundamentally important element of

151
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:54,890
knowledge being to describe how
knowledge is sought,

152
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,810
the process by which knowledge is
generated.

153
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,680
Well,
if you agree with me and I find that

154
00:08:00,681 --> 00:08:02,540
out,
I know nothing more than I knew before.

155
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:06,830
I just know what I knew before and maybe
I'm happy about that because it didn't

156
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:09,560
get challenged,
but I'm no smarter than I was before,

157
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,480
but maybe you're different than me and
so while I'm listening to you,

158
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:14,570
you'll tell me something I wouldn't.
I don't like.

159
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,720
Maybe it's something I find contemptible
or difficult,

160
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:19,730
whatever.
Maybe you'll find you'll tell me

161
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:23,750
something I don't know and then I won't
be quite as stupid and then maybe I

162
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,810
won't run painfully into quite as many
things.

163
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,970
And that's a really useful thing to
know.

164
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:32,870
Especially if you live with someone and
you're trying to make longterm piece

165
00:08:32,871 --> 00:08:35,930
with them as they are not the same as
you and they're away.

166
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,510
They look at the world and the facts
that they pull out of the world aren't

167
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:43,511
the same as your facts and even though
you're going to be overwhelmed with the

168
00:08:43,581 --> 00:08:45,920
proclivity to demonstrate that you're
right,

169
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,890
it is the case.
The two brains are better than one,

170
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:54,730
and so maybe nine of the 10 things they
tell you are dispensable or maybe even

171
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,460
49 out of 50,
but one thing all you need to get out of

172
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,830
the damn conversation is one thing you
don't know.

173
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,870
And one of the things that's very cool
about a good psychotherapeutic session

174
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:11,520
is that the whole conversation is like
that all you're doing is trying to

175
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,610
express the truth of the situation as
clearly as possible.

176
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,760
That's it.
And so now rogers' proposition,

177
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,760
and I'll tell you why he derived it,
was that if you have a conversation like

178
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:32,610
that with someone,
it will make both of you better.

179
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,610
It'll make both of you is
psychologically healthier.

180
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:40,790
So there's an implicit presupposition
that the exchange of truth is curative.

181
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:43,110
Well,
that's a very cool idea.

182
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,000
I mean,
it's a very deep idea.

183
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,850
Uh,
I think it's the most profound idea.

184
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:51,210
It's the,
it's the idea upon western civil upon

185
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:54,840
which Western civilization,
although not only Western civilization,

186
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:58,680
is actually predicated the idea that
truth produces health.

187
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:01,080
But for Rogers,
that was the entire purpose of the

188
00:10:01,081 --> 00:10:04,680
psycho therapeutic alliance.
You come to see me because you want to

189
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:08,220
be better.
You don't even know what that means

190
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:09,600
necessarily.
Neither do I.

191
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,600
we're going to figure that out together,
but you come and you say,

192
00:10:12,601 --> 00:10:15,660
look,
things are not acceptable to me and

193
00:10:15,661 --> 00:10:17,460
maybe there's something I could do about
that.

194
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,400
So that's the minimal precondition to
engage in therapy.

195
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,340
Something's wrong.
You're willing to talk about it

196
00:10:23,341 --> 00:10:25,230
truthfully and you want it to be better.

197
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,680
Without that,
the therapeutic relationship does not

198
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,870
get off the ground and so then you might
ask,

199
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:33,200
well,
what relationships are therapeutic and

200
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,520
answered.
That would be if you have a real

201
00:10:35,521 --> 00:10:37,350
relationship,
it's therapeutic.

202
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,260
If it isn't,
what you have is not a relationship.

203
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:42,660
God only knows what you have.
You're a slave,

204
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,780
they're a tyrant.
You know you're both butting heads with

205
00:10:45,781 --> 00:10:48,180
one another.
It's a primate dominance hierarchy

206
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,560
dispute.
Oh,

207
00:10:49,561 --> 00:10:52,020
I don't know what you're like,
two cats in a barrel or two people with

208
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:56,070
their hands around each other's throats,
but what you have is not a relationship.
