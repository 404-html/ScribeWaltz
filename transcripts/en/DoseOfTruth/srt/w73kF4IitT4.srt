1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:00,450
I've,

2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,350
I've been telling people online in various
ways and in lectures that they should

3
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:07,380
start fixing up the world
by cleaning up the room.

4
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:10,650
And I wanted to just elaborate on that
a little bit before I get back to the

5
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:12,510
lecture itself.

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,560
So I'd say it's become this
Internet weird Internet meme,

7
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,394
you know,

8
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,630
and it's a joke and good,

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:22,464
it's a joke.

10
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,460
I really happy about the fact that so
much of this has got like the leaving of

11
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:29,790
humor and it's really important
because that's what stops things from

12
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:30,810
degenerating into,

13
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,730
into conflict humor.

14
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:36,810
And I was thinking about this idea of
cleaning up your room in relationship to

15
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:37,860
the mustard seed idea.

16
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:40,500
And you see the thing about
cleaning up your room,

17
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:44,730
this is also something I learned from
Carl Young and his studies on alchemy

18
00:00:44,731 --> 00:00:46,440
because for young,

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,100
when the outcomist was attempting to make
the philosopher's stone and he was not

20
00:00:50,101 --> 00:00:52,680
only engaged in the transformation
of the material world,

21
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:57,681
but he was engaged in a process of self
transformation that occurred at the same

22
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,411
time as the,

23
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,430
as the chemical trend,

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,110
as the chemical transformation.

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,120
So it was a psychological
work in some sense.

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,140
Let's say you want to sort out your room
and beautified cause the beauty is also

27
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:07,800
important.

28
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:10,710
And let's say that all you have is just
a little room like you're not rich,

29
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,170
you're poor and you don't have any power.

30
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:13,861
That's another thing.

31
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:17,250
But you've got your damn room and you've
got this space right in front of you.

32
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:17,790
You know that,

33
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:22,320
that that's a part of the cosmos that
you can come to grips with and you might

34
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:22,531
think,

35
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:24,810
well what's there in front
of you right in front of you?

36
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:26,010
And the answer to that is,

37
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:27,870
it depends on how open your eyes are,

38
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,190
that that's the proper answer.

39
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:30,630
Because you could say,

40
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,370
w William Blake said this,

41
00:01:32,371 --> 00:01:33,210
for example,

42
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,320
eldest Huxley made comments that were
very similar that in a transcendent state,

43
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:39,150
you can see infinity in the finite.

44
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,050
And you might say,

45
00:01:40,051 --> 00:01:40,691
well you can say,

46
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:44,160
and you can see infinity in
what you have within your grasp.

47
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:45,350
If you look and you could say,

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,040
maybe that's the case with your room.

49
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,740
And so you want to clean up your room.

50
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,460
Well.

51
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,030
Okay,

52
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,811
how do you do that?

53
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:52,644
Exactly?

54
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,191
Well,

55
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:55,530
the room is a room is a place to sleep.

56
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,110
And so if you set your room up properly,

57
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,260
then you figure out how to sleep and
when you should sleep and how you should

58
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:01,591
sleep.

59
00:02:01,591 --> 00:02:04,320
And then you figure out when you
should wake up and then you figure out,

60
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,170
well what clothes you should wear because
they have to be arranged properly in

61
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:07,621
your dresser.

62
00:02:07,621 --> 00:02:09,450
And then you have to have some
place to put your clothes.

63
00:02:09,451 --> 00:02:10,620
And if you're going to have some clothes,

64
00:02:10,621 --> 00:02:12,900
you have to figure out what you're
going to wear those clothes to do,

65
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,010
right.

66
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:16,650
And then that means that
you have to figure out what
you're going to do and then

67
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:20,280
your room has to serve that
purpose because otherwise
it isn't set up properly.

68
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,140
And if it doesn't set up,

69
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,300
if it doesn't serve your purposes,

70
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,030
you will be unhappy and
not happy in the room.

71
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:32,031
Because the way that we perceive the world
is as a place to move from point a to

72
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:33,630
point B in.

73
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,980
And then if the place that we're
in facilitates that movement,

74
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:39,210
then we're happy to be there.

75
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,290
And if the place that we're in serves
as an obstacle to that movement,

76
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,030
then we're unhappy to be there.

77
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,720
And so what it means to set up your room
is that you have to have somewhere to

78
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,130
go that's worthwhile.

79
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:53,550
Or You can't set up your room and then
your room has to be set up to facilitate

80
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:54,300
that.

81
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,620
And then the next thing is,

82
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:55,741
well,

83
00:02:55,741 --> 00:02:57,390
maybe you have to make it beautiful,

84
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,500
but that's not easy,

85
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:58,711
right?

86
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,430
That means you have to have some taste.

87
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,200
And that doesn't mean
you have to have money.

88
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,093
It doesn't,

89
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,540
because you can be garish with money
and you can be tasteful with nothing.

90
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,920
All you need is taste and taste beats
money when it comes to beautifying things.

91
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,580
You know what I mean?

92
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,380
Not that money is
trivial because it's not,

93
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,550
the taste is crucial.

94
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:19,870
And people who are very artistically
oriented can make beautiful things out of

95
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,800
virtually nothing.

96
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,791
And not only that,

97
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,940
the literature suggests that if
you're going to make beautiful things,

98
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,740
putting real constraints on,

99
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,390
on what you allow yourself to do,

100
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,420
facilitates creativity instead
of interfering with it.

101
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,420
Because let's say you have to
make something out of nothing,

102
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,110
right?

103
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,030
Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,

104
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:37,780
right?

105
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,870
You have to make something out of nothing
and you have to be creative in order

106
00:03:40,871 --> 00:03:41,704
to do that.

107
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,450
And so then to beautify your room means
that you also have to develop your

108
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:47,860
capacity to be creative.

109
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,640
And so then you can make your room shine.

110
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,790
But then what'll happen is that
if your family isn't together,

111
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,080
they will interfere with that.

112
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,320
You will interfere with that because
you won't have the discipline to do it

113
00:03:59,321 --> 00:03:59,711
properly.

114
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,600
But then when you start building this,

115
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,260
this,

116
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:06,130
this little microcosm of perfection
with what you have at hand,

117
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:09,910
then it'll evoke all the pathologies
of everyone in your household.

118
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:11,560
The wonder what the hell
you're up to in there.

119
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,620
And they won't necessarily
be happy because if you're,

120
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,390
if they're in a lowly place,

121
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:16,841
let's say,

122
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,471
and so are you,

123
00:04:17,471 --> 00:04:21,370
and you're trying to move out of that
then that the higher you move out of that,

124
00:04:21,371 --> 00:04:23,560
the more the place they're in looks bad.

125
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,551
And you might say,

126
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:24,701
well,

127
00:04:24,701 --> 00:04:28,180
what they should do is celebrate
your victory over chaos and evil.

128
00:04:28,181 --> 00:04:29,410
But that isn't what will happen.

129
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,650
What will happen instead is that they
will attempt to pull you back down.

130
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:33,880
They'll attempt to,

131
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,610
and I mean obviously all
families don't do that,

132
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:37,060
but,

133
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:42,060
but all families do that to some degree
and some families do almost nothing but

134
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:42,850
that.

135
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:46,330
And so what that means is that if
you're going to organize your room,

136
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,390
then you're going to have to
confront the devils in your house.

137
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:50,500
And that's often,

138
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:54,910
that's often a terrifying thing because
some of those devils have have lineages

139
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,990
that go back many,

140
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:56,351
many,

141
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,580
many generations.

142
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,240
And God only knows what you have to
struggle with in order to overcome that.

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,840
And so and so to sort yourself out into
fix up your room is a nontrivial matter.

144
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,140
You know,

145
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,910
and you,

146
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,060
you can do that.

147
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:11,560
You'll learn by doing that.

148
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,470
And then maybe you'll learn enough by
doing that so that you can fix up your

149
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:15,370
family a little bit.

150
00:05:15,371 --> 00:05:16,900
And then having done that,

151
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,410
you'll have enough characters so that
when you try to operate in the world at

152
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:20,951
your job,

153
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:23,320
or maybe in the broader social spheres,

154
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,740
that you'll be a force for good instead
of harm because you'll have learned some

155
00:05:26,741 --> 00:05:31,741
humility by noting just how difficult it
was to put your damn room together well

156
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,340
and yourself for that matter.

157
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:37,810
And so you'll proceed cautiously
with your eyes open towards the good.
