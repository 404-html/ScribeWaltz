1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,373
Okay.

2
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:10,553
What time is it?

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,360
Eight 50 I started when [inaudible] sorry.

4
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,194
It's been

5
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,503
six 30.

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,860
I should stop them.

7
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,020
[inaudible]

8
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:41,390
I'm going to go for five more
minutes and then I'll wrap this up.

9
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:46,270
I want to talk about intersectionality
and and white privilege a bit.

10
00:00:46,271 --> 00:00:47,104
Yeah.

11
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,613
So,

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,670
so I first said,

13
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:55,090
well,

14
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,350
we analyzed Marxism.

15
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:56,800
We out,

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,240
I analyze postmodernism.

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:00:59,960
Okay.

18
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,250
I suggested that postmodernism was a way
for the Marxists to keep going under a

19
00:01:04,251 --> 00:01:05,084
new guys.

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:10,040
I suggested that Marxism was fundamentally
based on hatred rather than sympathy

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:11,323
and empathy.

22
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,820
I suggested that the carbs is where the,

23
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,500
the evidence for that.

24
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:16,250
Um,

25
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:19,640
I told you why I think postmodernism
is fundamentally wrong.

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,333
MMM.

27
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,510
Now I want to talk to you a
little bit about white privilege.

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:27,990
Yeah.

29
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,930
So the first thing that I can,

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,760
and I haven't got this
quite figured out yet,

31
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,500
I can't quite figure out why the
postmodernists have made the canonical

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,101
distinctions.

33
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,480
They made race,

34
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,920
ethnicity,

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,960
sexual proclivity,

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,180
sexual gender identity.

37
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:49,080
Let's say those are four
dimensions along which people vary.

38
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,800
But there's a very large number of
dimensions along which people vary,

39
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,131
right?

40
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:53,964
In fact,

41
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,590
given that there's an infinite number
of ways of interpreting the world,

42
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,040
you can immediately point out if there's
an infinite number of dimensions along

43
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:03,090
which people vary.

44
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:06,630
And so then the postmodern question is
why would you privilege some of those

45
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:07,950
dimensions over the other?

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,881
And I would say,

47
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,121
well,

48
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,760
because it sustains your
bloody Marxist interpretation.

49
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,211
That's why.

50
00:02:12,211 --> 00:02:14,700
But you're not going to say
that cause it marginalizes,

51
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,300
right?

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,460
You've marginalized that
so you can ignore it.

53
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,490
So that's one of the fun
things about postmodernism.

54
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,240
You can,

55
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,073
you can.

56
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,650
I have a very vulgar image in my mind,

57
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,713
but

58
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,630
I won't share that with you,

59
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,680
but you can infer it.

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,230
Here's some ways people differ.

61
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:34,921
Intelligence,

62
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:35,491
temperament,

63
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:36,330
geography,

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,650
historical time.

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,510
You live now and not a hundred years ago.

66
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Attractiveness.

67
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:41,250
That's a big,

68
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,083
that's a big one.

69
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,433
That's a big one.

70
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,640
Would you imagine?

71
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:44,970
You,

72
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,803
you could.

73
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:47,620
You won't.

74
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,460
We won't go there either.

75
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:51,700
You eat it's advantages to be young.

76
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:53,890
You've got potential
disadvantageous to be old.

77
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:54,820
You've got wealth,

78
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,361
health,

79
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:56,194
that's a good one.

80
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:58,840
Sex women have advantages.

81
00:02:58,841 --> 00:02:59,980
Men advantages.

82
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,480
Maybe one has more than the other.

83
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,470
It's not self evident.

84
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,120
Women live about eight years longer.

85
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,500
They're multiorgasmic,

86
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,180
athleticism,

87
00:03:12,181 --> 00:03:12,551
wealth,

88
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,440
family structure,

89
00:03:13,441 --> 00:03:13,981
friendship,

90
00:03:13,981 --> 00:03:14,814
education.

91
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,520
Well then there's the classic,

92
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,280
you know,

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,091
postmodern once,

94
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:20,511
race,

95
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:21,051
ethnicity,

96
00:03:21,051 --> 00:03:21,884
et cetera.

97
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,760
Why not those other
dimensions of variation,

98
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:28,490
there's no evidence that
they're less important.

99
00:03:28,491 --> 00:03:28,881
In fact,

100
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,980
there's quite a bit of evidence
that they're more important,

101
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,960
so like why not consider them?

102
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:34,610
Then you get intersectionality.

103
00:03:34,611 --> 00:03:36,470
This is one of the things
that's really comical,

104
00:03:36,471 --> 00:03:40,570
I think because the postmodernists
identity politics types actually realized

105
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:40,761
this.

106
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:41,510
They thought,

107
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:41,691
well,

108
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:41,931
okay,

109
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:42,890
race and gender.

110
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,913
Fair enough.

111
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,000
What if you're,

112
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,170
what if you're a black woman?

113
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,420
But that's a problem because well
now you've got two dimensions of

114
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,290
differentiation.

115
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,460
What the hell are we
going to do about that?

116
00:03:54,461 --> 00:03:55,294
And what if you're,

117
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,280
what if you're gay and black and female?

118
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:58,421
Well,

119
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:01,210
then what if you're not very bright
and gay and black and female,

120
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,260
and then what if you're ugly and not
very bright and gay and black and female

121
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:07,480
and like you can keep playing that game.

122
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,380
You can keep playing that game and
infinite number of ways because there's an

123
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:13,450
infinite number of ways
to categorize things.

124
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,190
As the postmodern authority pointed out.

125
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,460
And so the intersectionality
theorist came along to plug the hole,

126
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,720
but they don't know where they're going.

127
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,770
They don't understand that the logical
conclusion of intersectionality is

128
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:28,771
individuality because there's so many
different ways of categorizing people's

129
00:04:29,051 --> 00:04:33,160
advantages and disadvantages that if you
take that all the way out to the end,

130
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:33,461
you say,

131
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,300
well the individuals,

132
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,350
the ultimate minority.

133
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,700
And that's exactly right.

134
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:38,440
And that's exactly what
the West discovered.

135
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:41,770
And you know the intersection lists of
get there if they don't kill everyone

136
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:42,604
first.

137
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,740
So on to white privilege.

138
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:56,000
So it's really interesting to find out
where these ideas come from cause it's

139
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,770
usually the scholarship is so awful,

140
00:04:57,771 --> 00:04:59,690
you just cannot possibly believe it.

141
00:04:59,691 --> 00:05:01,130
It's just absolutely,

142
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,743
it wouldn't.

143
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,270
At the University of Toronto
in the psychology department,

144
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,600
the original paper on white privilege
wouldn't have received a passing grade for

145
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:14,900
the hypothesis part of a
undergraduate honors thesis.

146
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,550
We're not even close.

147
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,050
There's no methodology at all.

148
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,160
The person who wrote it,

149
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,520
it was called white
privilege and male privilege.

150
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
A personal account of coming to see
correspondences through work in women's

151
00:05:28,251 --> 00:05:29,084
studies.

152
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:30,021
Well,

153
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:30,591
first of all,

154
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:31,550
personal account.

155
00:05:31,551 --> 00:05:31,881
It's like,

156
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:32,391
sorry.

157
00:05:32,391 --> 00:05:33,224
No,

158
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,421
so she,

159
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,970
she listed a bunch of
ways that she thought.

160
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:45,200
She says these are personal personal
examples of her unearned privilege or

161
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,820
unearned privilege that she saw as she
experienced in the 1970s 1980s so this,

162
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:50,241
by the way,

163
00:05:50,241 --> 00:05:50,410
that,

164
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:55,310
so this idea is the opinion of one
person who wrote one paper that has

165
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:56,840
absolutely no empirical backing,

166
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,330
which is a set of hypotheses which had
never been subject to any statistical

167
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,164
analysis.

168
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,210
Like if I ask you a bunch of questions,

169
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,270
it's not obvious how many questions
I'm asking you because I could say,

170
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,500
how tall are you?

171
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,671
Or I could say,

172
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,750
if you're laying on the ground,

173
00:06:11,751 --> 00:06:13,550
how extended would you be?

174
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,091
It's like that.

175
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:14,930
Two questions.

176
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:15,471
It's like,

177
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:15,651
no,

178
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:16,550
it's one question.

179
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,990
It's just as two ways and the way you
figure out if you ask someone a bunch of

180
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:21,441
questions,

181
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:24,590
how many questions you're asking them
is by doing something called a factor

182
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:25,071
analysis,

183
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:26,900
which is kind of an an elementary form.

184
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:27,800
Okay.

185
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,350
Now of social science investigation.

186
00:06:30,351 --> 00:06:33,320
If you make a questionnaire you have to
subject it to a factor analysis cause

187
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:36,050
you got to find out how many questions
you're asking because you might think

188
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,060
it's 60 but it's probably not.

189
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:39,080
It's probably five.

190
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:40,730
That's the big five by the way.

191
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,930
Anyways,

192
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,190
who cares about that?

193
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,780
There's no such thing as methodology.

194
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:45,470
Anyways,

195
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:49,730
that's all part of the oppressive
white male European patriarchy,

196
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:53,990
so we can just not bother with that
and we can pen a few notes about how we

197
00:06:53,991 --> 00:06:58,340
think the world is constructed and then
we can screw up the entire political

198
00:06:58,341 --> 00:07:00,110
system two decades later.

199
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:01,851
Okay,

200
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:03,800
so here's your white privilege lists.

201
00:07:03,801 --> 00:07:04,221
Some of it,

202
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:06,110
there's like 50 things I can,

203
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:10,280
if I wish arrange to be in the company
of people of my race most of the time if

204
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:11,091
I should need to move,

205
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,210
I can be pretty sure of renting or
purchasing housing in an area which I can

206
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:16,280
afford and in which I would want to live.

207
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,590
That's actually a wealth thing by the way.

208
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,980
I can be pretty sure that my neighbors
in such a location will be neutral or

209
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:22,814
pleasant to me.

210
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,890
I can go shopping alone most of the time,

211
00:07:24,891 --> 00:07:27,260
pretty well assured that I will
not be followed or harassed.

212
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,890
I can turn on my television or open
to the front page of the paper and see

213
00:07:30,891 --> 00:07:33,950
people of my waist race
widely represented.

214
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:34,710
Okay.

215
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:37,950
When I am told about our national
heritage or about civilization,

216
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,370
I am shown that people of
my color made it what it is.

217
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,240
Okay.

218
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:42,680
Oh,

219
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,790
there's 50 of those I think.

220
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:44,624
Something like that.

221
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:45,583
Okay.

222
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,330
Okay.

223
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,310
Is that white privilege?

224
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:50,000
Is that like majority privilege?

225
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,340
Okay.

226
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,061
It's the same tree.

227
00:07:52,061 --> 00:07:52,721
You go to China,

228
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:53,381
you're Chinese.

229
00:07:53,381 --> 00:07:53,891
It's the same.

230
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,111
True.

231
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,000
If you're Chinese

232
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:59,180
does the majority privilege and
if it's majority privileges,

233
00:07:59,181 --> 00:08:03,470
like isn't that just part of
living within your culture?

234
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,840
So let's say you live in your culture.

235
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,240
You're privileged as a
member of that culture.

236
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:08,451
Well,

237
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:11,000
obviously that's what the culture is for.

238
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,440
That's what it's for.

239
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,430
Why would you bother building the damn
thing if it didn't accrue benefits to

240
00:08:16,431 --> 00:08:16,550
you?

241
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,241
Now you might say,

242
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:17,421
well,

243
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:21,620
one of the consequences that it accrues
fewer benefits to those who aren't in

244
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:22,454
the culture.

245
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,300
Yeah,

246
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,730
but you can't immediately
associate that with race.

247
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,530
You can't just do that.

248
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:28,940
Say It's white privileged.

249
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,030
There's many things it could be certainly
could be wealth and the intersection

250
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,600
people have already figured out that
there's many things that could be.

251
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,230
Yeah,

252
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,820
so like what the hell?

253
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,660
Seriously.

254
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:38,961
Well,

255
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:42,620
what's going on while we left these
pseudo disciplines into the university

256
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:44,780
because we're stupid and guilty.

257
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,860
Seriously,

258
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,050
and they have no methodological
requirements and plenty
of power and plenty of

259
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:56,051
time to produce nonsensical research
and produce like resentful activists and

260
00:08:56,371 --> 00:08:58,050
now we're bearing the fruits of that.

261
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,560
It's not pretty so white privilege.

262
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:01,981
Well,

263
00:09:01,981 --> 00:09:06,981
the other thing you might notice is that
to attribute to the individuals of a

264
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,334
community,

265
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:13,430
the attributes of that community on the
basis of their racial identity is called

266
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,400
racism.

267
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,590
That's what racism is.

268
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,270
There's no other way of defining it.

269
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,520
It's attributing to the individual the
characteristics of the group as if the

270
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,110
group was homogenous.

271
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:29,040
Now the intersectional people have
already decided that's not a fair game

272
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,170
because there's so many
differences between people.

273
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:35,250
But the postmodernists don't care about
logical coherence because they regard

274
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,450
logical coherence.

275
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,780
Here it comes again as
a creation of the white,

276
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:44,280
European male patriarchal structure
that's designed to oppress the oppressed.

277
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,290
And that's technically the case.

278
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,120
So logical incoherence,

279
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,051
it doesn't matter.

280
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:49,651
And you could say,

281
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:50,430
well,

282
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:53,220
if you act out your logically
incoherent ideas in the world,

283
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:55,950
you're going to run face
first into a brick wall.

284
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,880
And the postmodern answer to that
is there's actually no real world.

285
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,290
It's all interpretation.

286
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,700
So there's no,

287
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,890
there's no having that discussion,

288
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,280
but the postmodernists don't care because
they don't believe that discussion

289
00:10:08,281 --> 00:10:10,320
between people of different
power groups as possible.

290
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:10,950
Anyways.
