1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,910
And for young,

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:10,490
those were equivalent in
some sense to the loss gods.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:11,840
And so for young,

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,650
your,

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,650
your interest was being manipulated behind
the scenes by unseen forces that were

6
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:20,600
associated with your character or
logical development across time.

7
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,580
That was the manifestation of the self.

8
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,380
So the self is this,

9
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,230
the,

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,600
the potential you,

11
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:27,434
let's say,

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,310
and the way it operates in the present
is by gripping your interest in directing

13
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:32,144
it somewhere.

14
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,820
And that's part of the
instinct of self realization.

15
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:36,800
It's a mind boggling idea,

16
00:00:36,801 --> 00:00:37,041
man.

17
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:37,874
Really it's,

18
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:39,260
I think it's correct.

19
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:39,411
I,

20
00:00:39,411 --> 00:00:41,000
I can't see how it can't be correct.

21
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:42,620
It doesn't mean I
understand it completely,

22
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:45,470
but it certainly seems
phenomenologically correct.

23
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:47,030
And I mean,

24
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,710
the potential that you are has to manifest
itself somehow in the here and now.

25
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:52,790
It has to.

26
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,760
And what better way than by
directing your attention,

27
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,031
you know,

28
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:56,361
it's like,

29
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:59,630
it seems like this might be useful for
you or maybe you get attracted to this

30
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:00,260
person.

31
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,930
Maybe you admire this person
that happens with kids a lot.

32
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:04,580
They'll admire someone and then copy them.

33
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,570
And you can see that that's obviously
part of their developmental progression,

34
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,141
right?

35
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:10,430
It's a form of hero worship,

36
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:13,640
but kids are very imitative and they
hear a worship at the drop of a hat,

37
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:15,230
and so they're,

38
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:17,630
they're entranced by the,

39
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,700
the next stage of development.

40
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:21,530
And if they see someone who embodies that,

41
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,020
especially if it's in the
zone of proximal development,

42
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:24,191
it's,

43
00:01:24,191 --> 00:01:24,840
it's some,

44
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,740
it's something they could
achieve stretching a bit.

45
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,070
They find someone who embodies that
next stage of development and then they

46
00:01:31,071 --> 00:01:33,490
start to imitate them and act like the,

47
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,040
well,

48
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,450
we're adults are no different.

49
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,381
We're no different.

50
00:01:36,381 --> 00:01:37,160
We're just,

51
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,310
we do it at a perhaps more abstracted,

52
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,490
sophisticated level.
