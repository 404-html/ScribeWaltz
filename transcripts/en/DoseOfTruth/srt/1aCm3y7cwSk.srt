1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,910
Okay,
let's go back to the pigeon hole thing

2
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,680
here.
How do you clean your room when your

3
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,410
spouse doesn't share that goal?
Huh?

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,820
Well,
that's another one of those questions.

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:22,370
It's really hard to answer because I
don't have the details,

6
00:00:22,371 --> 00:00:24,290
you know,
how do you clean your room?

7
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,460
What goals does your spouse have?
That's the first take.

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,580
I mean,
is there some commonality?

9
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,710
I mean,
it might be maybe your spouse as much

10
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:37,280
more disorderly than you or less
conscientious or irritated at you for

11
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,490
all sorts of reasons.
You know,

12
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,640
the first thing you could do is,
um,

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,140
try to lead by example and see how that
works.

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,570
But you may have to argue and fight it
out,

15
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,433
you know,
um,

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,590
break it down into sub tasks and,
and see if you can distribute the tasks

17
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,010
and,
and negotiate you have to negotiate.

18
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:02,760
And without further information,
I can't say much more than that.

19
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:04,350
You know,
you can say why you're doing it,

20
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,070
what you think the goal we're and goal
was and that you'd like some help and

21
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,110
maybe there's something you could offer
in return.

22
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,900
Um,
if you can't negotiate at all with your

23
00:01:12,901 --> 00:01:14,820
spouse,
then you have a much broader problem

24
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:18,210
than how do you clean your room when
you're supposed doesn't share that goal

25
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,050
because the real problem would be how do
you learn to negotiate with your spouse?

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,280
I could talk about that a little bit.
I mean,

27
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,200
the first thing that you have to do,
if you want to negotiate with someone is

28
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,030
be able to say no.

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,510
The second thing is to have something to
offer.

30
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:38,870
The third thing is to find out what they
want and to know what you want.

31
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:40,830
You know,
because often people,

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,140
especially with people that love them,
they say,

33
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:44,280
well,
if you really knew,

34
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,830
if you really love me,
then you'd know what I want.

35
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:47,461
It's like,
no,

36
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:50,760
that's just wrong.
The person that you are in love with or

37
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:54,420
living with isn't any smarter than you.
And so you pretty much always have to

38
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,110
tell people straight out what you want
and then you have to let them be really

39
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,390
stupid about giving it to you for quite
a while.

40
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,720
You know?
So sometimes I've recommended to my

41
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:07,230
clients that they take their wife or
husband out on a date and of course

42
00:02:07,231 --> 00:02:11,820
they're all skeptical about that and
cynical about it and then they go on a

43
00:02:11,821 --> 00:02:14,220
date and they have a terrible time and
they come back and say,

44
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,260
oh,
I told you that was a stupid idea,

45
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,280
and I tell them that,
hey,

46
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:22,320
you're not gonna do anything romantic
with your spouse for the next 40 years.

47
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,800
That's your plan.
That's the plan is that it's like you

48
00:02:25,801 --> 00:02:30,450
might have to go out to a movie after
you haven't been good to each other for

49
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:33,000
like five years.
You might have to go out to movie 10

50
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,690
times movie and dinner,
say before it starts to become fun

51
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,330
again.
It's like it's hard to do that sort of

52
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:40,164
thing,
right?

53
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,840
You don't.
People think those things are easy and

54
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:46,020
they're not.
So anyways,

55
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,080
you have to,
you have to learn to negotiate with your

56
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,390
spouse.
And that's a very difficult thing to do.

57
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,040
So I'm figuring out what you want is a
good way to start.

58
00:02:59,190 --> 00:02:59,640
So.
