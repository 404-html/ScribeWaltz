1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,570
Can we take the biblical,

2
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:09,950
Andrew Wells asks,

3
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:13,970
can we take the biblical story seriously
enough with those without also keeping

4
00:00:13,971 --> 00:00:15,200
biblical traditions?

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,250
What's the psychological impact
of group gathering church going?

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,260
I think we could take the
biblical stories seriously enough,

7
00:00:26,261 --> 00:00:29,380
but I don't think that
it's particularly easy.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,813
Um,

9
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,160
the traditions bind
the community together.

10
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:35,470
Now I'm saying that and
I don't go to church,

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,131
you know,

12
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:39,940
and the reason I don't go to church
is because while it drives me crazy to

13
00:00:39,941 --> 00:00:40,241
speak,

14
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:40,900
frankly,

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,400
I haven't been able to sit in a
situation like that ever since I was,

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:46,200
whatever.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,033
Really.

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,910
That's really the truth of it ever.

19
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,183
Um,

20
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:54,790
I'm not convinced that that's a good
thing because I do believe and I've had

21
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,560
good conversations about
this with Jonathan Patio,

22
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,580
I do believe that communal return to
the source of the community's ethics is

23
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:05,470
actually a necessary thing.

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:10,540
And maybe I'm atoning for my past sins
by doing these biblical lectures at the

25
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:10,841
moment,

26
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:12,160
which is something that's communal.

27
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,353
So,

28
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:17,980
and then because there's also something
about going where a bunch of other

29
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:21,400
people are to reaffirm your commitment to,

30
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,980
to the good that you're all aiming at,

31
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,800
that's got some power in it.

32
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,530
And,

33
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:29,590
and I don't think that that's
something that we should forgo.

34
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,520
I think it's dangerous.

35
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:30,731
I mean,

36
00:01:30,731 --> 00:01:31,564
look,

37
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:34,990
even if you're cynical about church
and I guess I would put myself in that

38
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:35,824
category,

39
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,460
it's certainly the case that communal
church going in the 19 fifties say,

40
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,970
provided the average person with at
least an hour a week where they were

41
00:01:45,971 --> 00:01:50,971
contemplating no matter how poorly
the purpose of ethics in life and,

42
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,890
and the idea of a higher purpose
and higher meaning in life.

43
00:01:56,891 --> 00:02:00,460
And you got to think that spending an
hour a week thinking about that is better

44
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:01,870
than never doing it at all.

45
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,330
So I don't know how to,

46
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:07,450
that tradition can be
revivified in a meaningful way,

47
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,440
but I think it's.

48
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,770
I really do think it's a catastrophe that
we've lost it because we don't have a

49
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:12,604
center,

50
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,750
an ethical center that holds
our community together.

51
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,850
And the consequence of that is
that we're fragmenting quite badly.

52
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,630
So.
