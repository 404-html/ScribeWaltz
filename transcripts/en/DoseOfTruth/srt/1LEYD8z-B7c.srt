1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:07,153
Yeah,

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:11,470
I don't think my wife loves are
internationally adopted daughter and she

3
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:15,400
won't go to counseling with me.
My house is filled with tyranny and

4
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:16,930
anger.
Any advice?

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:19,810
Anonymous.
Wow,

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,210
that's a loaded.
That's a set of loaded questions,

7
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,400
man.
I don't think my wife loves are

8
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:43,030
internationally adopted daughter.
Well,

9
00:00:43,031 --> 00:00:48,031
the first question would be why not?
Was she in on the adoption,

10
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:50,110
for example,
was it partly her decision?

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,070
Here's a possibility.

12
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:02,050
Maybe you could ask her under what
conditions.

13
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:07,570
Ask her more specifically why she
doesn't like your internationally

14
00:01:07,571 --> 00:01:10,480
adopted daughter.
It's too vague.

15
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,620
I don't think my wife loves are
internationally adopted daughter.

16
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,500
Break it down.
Maybe it's something like there are 15

17
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:21,850
things about our life with our
internationally adopted daughter that my

18
00:01:21,851 --> 00:01:24,850
wife does not appreciate.
Now maybe some of those things are the

19
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:27,730
way that the daughter behaves.
I don't know how old she is or anything

20
00:01:27,731 --> 00:01:32,650
else about her and
differentiate your problem.

21
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,860
It's too vague.
You'll never solve it this way because

22
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:39,700
love isn't the right word.
See if you can write down 30 reasons why

23
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:44,110
your wife is annoyed about your current
situation and maybe you'll have to

24
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:46,600
differentiate each of those 30 into 10
more,

25
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,150
right?
Maybe there's 300 reasons and then see

26
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:54,151
if you can start asking her about fixing
some of the reasons that you

27
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,850
differentiate it because obviously you
can't go up to her and say you have to

28
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:01,630
start loving are internationally adopted
daughter that's just not gonna work and

29
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:06,631
you already know that.
But if you break that down into the 20

30
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:09,070
reasons why she doesn't like your
daughter,

31
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:14,320
then maybe you can figure out a way that
some progress might be made on one of

32
00:02:14,321 --> 00:02:17,500
those problems.
And maybe if you take that approach for

33
00:02:17,501 --> 00:02:21,250
a whole year,
then she'll go from like,

34
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:25,000
she'll at least hit neutral or something
like that.

35
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,363
Um,

36
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:32,840
that's the best I can do given that I
only have three sentences to go on.

37
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,220
So differentiate the problem and then
solve the smaller problems.
