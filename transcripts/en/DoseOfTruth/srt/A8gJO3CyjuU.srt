1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:07,480
I didn't say they couldn't do it.

2
00:00:07,481 --> 00:00:08,710
I said it was a bad idea.

3
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,903
Okay.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,830
Okay,

5
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:12,663
so you don't have,

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,400
well I think,

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,190
I think that Dave,

8
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,120
I really do believe,

9
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:17,080
and I'm sad about this,

10
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:19,850
I do believe that they've bitten off more
than they can chew and then it's going

11
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:20,530
to be,

12
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:20,771
it's,

13
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:21,070
it's,

14
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,050
it's one small,

15
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:24,551
it's a,

16
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:29,080
it's a warning side with regards to
these media conglomerates that are

17
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:33,730
attempting to produce large scale public
discourse because now they've taken on,

18
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,430
they've taken the role of sensor
onto themselves and they'll find it.

19
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:39,760
That's a never ending role
that produces endless trouble.

20
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:42,520
They've got themselves into endless
trouble as far as I'm concerned.

21
00:00:42,521 --> 00:00:45,760
And for as it from a perspective
of a clinical psychologist,

22
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:49,720
I would also say the worst thing you
can do to someone who's paranoid,

23
00:00:49,721 --> 00:00:53,800
the most ill advice thing you can do
to someone who's paranoid is persecute

24
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:54,530
them.

25
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,363
So now that,

26
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,720
I mean Alex Jones is always talking
about if the little I know about him,

27
00:00:58,721 --> 00:01:02,140
he's always talking about are
conspiracies of one form or another.

28
00:01:02,141 --> 00:01:07,030
And now what has all the appearance of
a conspiracy between four or five very

29
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:09,520
large media conglomerates
is aimed squarely at him.

30
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,210
So all the people who are watching him
who are conspiracy minded and somewhat

31
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:14,470
paranoid are going to think,

32
00:01:14,471 --> 00:01:14,800
well,

33
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,950
Jones must be onto something because
otherwise these big conglomerates wouldn't

34
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:19,180
have clamped down on him.

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,381
That's a very,

36
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,220
very bad idea.

37
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:22,720
And millions of people watch him.

38
00:01:22,721 --> 00:01:23,390
So these holes,

39
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:23,930
well thought,

40
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,050
these are people who thought that Podesta
had an unheard sex ring in a pizza

41
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:27,411
parlor.

42
00:01:27,411 --> 00:01:29,900
So I don't really think that this is
necessarily the straw that broke the

43
00:01:29,901 --> 00:01:30,740
camel's back.

44
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,610
Um,

45
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,443
it sounds to me,

46
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:33,740
so I want to make sure that clarify.

47
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,170
Are you not amongst the
people who believe that,

48
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:36,770
uh,

49
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,120
these big platforms like youtube,

50
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:40,070
Facebook should be treated
like public utilities?

51
00:01:40,071 --> 00:01:43,910
Because there are a lot of right
wingers who do believe that like phone,

52
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,121
yeah,

53
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:47,150
I think they should be treated as public
utilities because otherwise they can't

54
00:01:47,151 --> 00:01:51,290
exist because there's no possible way
that these corporations can handle

55
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,690
monitoring that they're content.

56
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,920
There's too much content.

57
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,640
So they'll run,

58
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,910
they'll run out of manpower
to make the decisions.

59
00:01:59,320 --> 00:01:59,841
I mean now what,

60
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:00,111
okay,

61
00:02:00,111 --> 00:02:01,760
so Alex Jones is now being banned.

62
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,790
What do you think about people
who've interviewed Alex Jones,

63
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:05,720
should they be banned?

64
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:07,760
That would include Joe Rogan for example.

65
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,680
Cause he interviewed Alex Jones.

66
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,250
Yeah.

67
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:11,360
So it should be banned him.

68
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,320
Well and if not,

69
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:12,880
why not?

70
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,470
So you think that Facebook,

71
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,131
youtube,

72
00:02:15,131 --> 00:02:15,431
Google,

73
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,270
these companies that,

74
00:02:16,271 --> 00:02:16,540
you know,

75
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,830
basically startup in garages,

76
00:02:17,831 --> 00:02:21,340
these tech startups and invest millions
of dollars and they grow to become

77
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:26,341
successful and then you
support the government stepping
in and an authoritarian

78
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:30,640
fashion and telling them who they
have to allow on their platforms.

79
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,470
I didn't say the
government should step in.

80
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,640
I said that they made a
mistake by deciding to act
as sensors and that they'll

81
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:37,181
pay for it.

82
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:39,940
I didn't say anything about anybody
stepping in and changing it.

83
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,230
I said it was a mistake.

84
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,360
Well if they're to be treated like
public utilities and that would be the

85
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,160
government stepping in
cause right now they're not.

86
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,900
Well if they were to be
treated as public utilities,

87
00:02:48,901 --> 00:02:51,300
that would be a transformation
in the way they were regulated.

88
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,180
So that really doesn't have anything
to do specifically with the Alex Jones

89
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,014
issue.

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,140
Don't support it.

91
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,011
You would support it.

92
00:02:57,011 --> 00:02:57,510
Okay.

93
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,120
And that's the question because I'm
the one having to come up with all the

94
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:02,290
complex answers.

95
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,190
All right,

96
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:07,810
so how would you propose that
these complex corporations
decide which content is

97
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:08,644
acceptable?

98
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,990
Exactly.

99
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,160
How would you propose specs?

100
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,070
I don't think there does
need to be a proposal.

101
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,200
I mean I think this is where
actually I would be on your side.

102
00:03:16,201 --> 00:03:19,560
Let the free market decide and the free
market is youtube and Facebook and if

103
00:03:19,561 --> 00:03:21,330
they don't want to host content,

104
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:23,910
I don't think they should
be forced to host content.

105
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:27,270
I don't think they should be
compelled to host content.

106
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,460
Well obviously they shouldn't be that.

107
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,570
That's not the issue.

108
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:34,050
The issue is how are they going to go
about making the decisions and how are we

109
00:03:34,051 --> 00:03:36,390
going to be sure that that
won't go dreadfully wrong?

110
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:36,811
I mean,

111
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:39,600
obviously it's the case that
censorship can go wrong.

112
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,700
You certainly see that
in places like China.

113
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,710
Once you start with censorship,

114
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:44,520
how do you know?

115
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,870
How do you have any idea?

116
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:49,740
How are you going to put proper boundaries
around it and decide who's acceptable

117
00:03:49,741 --> 00:03:49,921
you're,

118
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:53,040
they're going to let your listeners decide
that or you're going to decide it and

119
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,770
then you're going to find out that
you've taken on a huge weight of decision

120
00:03:55,771 --> 00:03:57,030
making that you can't handle.

121
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,261
Or maybe I'm wrong.

122
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,160
Maybe that won't happen,

123
00:03:59,161 --> 00:03:59,700
but it's certain.

124
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:03,780
Certainly I would be very low to decide
what needs to be censored because the

125
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,720
number of decisions I'd have to
make with multiplied beyond end.

126
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:07,650
Well,

127
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,400
I'm not saying what any
specific individual does.

128
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:10,741
I'm saying,

129
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:11,910
let the free market decide.

130
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,540
If people don't want a
Alex Jones on Youtube,

131
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,580
then youtube doesn't have to provide it.

132
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:18,750
If people watching youtube,

133
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,990
I already agreed that youtube
doesn't have to provide it.

134
00:04:20,991 --> 00:04:23,180
I said it was a mistake
to engage in censorship.

135
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:23,900
Sure.

136
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,990
Just because people are allowed to do
something doesn't mean it isn't a mistake

137
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:27,824
upon occasion.

138
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,390
So I'm not asking for
government regulation and the
idea that transforming these

139
00:04:32,391 --> 00:04:35,570
corporations into something approximating
utilities would be a form of

140
00:04:35,571 --> 00:04:37,540
regulation is really an and,

141
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:40,880
and what would you say it's an ill
formed way of posing the question.

142
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,530
It's a matter of classification.

143
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,170
Do you think that Alex Jones
should be able to use a phone?

144
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,910
I do think Alex Jones to be able to
use a phone as long as he pays for it,

145
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,150
as long as the phone company
wants to offer him their services.

146
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,731
Right.

147
00:04:52,731 --> 00:04:56,390
So the phone company offers everyone
equal access to the services regardless of

148
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:57,224
content.

149
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,930
And I presume you to object if the
phone service started to decide that

150
00:04:59,931 --> 00:05:01,940
conversation shouldn't
be allowed to occur.

151
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,390
And so it it,

152
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,710
you can make a reasonable argument that
these large scale media distribution

153
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:07,940
companies played the same role.

154
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,140
But on a larger scale.

155
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,190
It's not necessarily the case that
it's an argument without flaw,

156
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:14,570
but it's a reasonable argument.

157
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,910
But I don't think that
there's any real alternative.

158
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:21,980
I don't see how companies like Facebook
and Youtube can possibly police their

159
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:25,700
content without producing far
more trouble then they'll save.

160
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,800
That's the issue.

161
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,011
Well,

162
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,310
I'm not so much just concerned about the,

163
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,111
in the content.

164
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:31,090
What I'm concerned with
is let's say we did it.

165
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,340
So the public utilities sort of option,

166
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:33,770
right?

167
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:34,603
Um,

168
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,720
what I'm concerned with is the free market
will be able to provide alternatives.

169
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:37,961
You know,

170
00:05:37,961 --> 00:05:40,060
Alex Jones can go there if we believe,

171
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,700
if we're consistent and we believe in
freedom of speech and the freedom of

172
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:44,290
market as it applies thereof,

173
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,360
we should be free to accept,

174
00:05:46,361 --> 00:05:49,560
we should believe follow this
down the logical trail that a,

175
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:52,290
there'll be an alternative
platform for Alex or no?

176
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,331
Yes,

177
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:54,290
there probably will be.

178
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:57,680
And that's also why I think it was a
mistake for these companies engage in the

179
00:05:57,681 --> 00:06:00,770
censorship because I think that they're
signing their own death warrant by doing

180
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:01,490
so.

181
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,320
It will probably take 10 years to unfold.

182
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,820
But it's a big mistake.

183
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,980
And so that is what will happen is because
people will stop trusting youtube and

184
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:10,491
Facebook.

185
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:13,970
And so forth to provide
uncensored access to content.

186
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:15,290
And as a consequence,

187
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,124
other forms of,

188
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,290
of information distribution will emerge.

189
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,040
So it's,

190
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,770
that's why I thought it was bad
decision from corporate perspective.

191
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,510
They had every right to make it,

192
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:24,980
but I think it's bad decision,

193
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:25,110
right?

194
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,621
If I were to,

195
00:06:25,621 --> 00:06:27,030
if I were to walk into your house,

196
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,780
okay,

197
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,380
if I were to walk into your house right
now and just and harass you and call you

198
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:35,760
all sorts of names and get right up in
your face and not leave after you've

199
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:39,360
asked me to leave and
continue harassing you,

200
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,050
uh,

201
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,883
without any,

202
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,761
without any,

203
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:42,061
any,

204
00:06:42,061 --> 00:06:43,560
a refuge for you,

205
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,220
would you think that that is
a crime for me to do that?

206
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,010
I don't know why you're
asking the question.

207
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:50,830
So let me tell you why that's,

208
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,140
so now again,

209
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,200
this is why we were talking
about the constitution in guns.

210
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:56,850
Now I have fully automatic air
fifteens and things change,

211
00:06:56,851 --> 00:06:57,001
right?

212
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:57,571
Times change,

213
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:58,530
we need to adapt.

214
00:06:58,531 --> 00:07:00,210
And we've both agreed
on that to some extent.

215
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,980
Now Online,

216
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:03,210
people like Alex Jones,

217
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,240
they have the ability to invade your
house digitally continually and harass and

218
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:11,160
berate shut off.

219
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,390
Not necessarily.

220
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:12,901
That's the thing.

221
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:13,291
You can't,

222
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:14,250
you can't shut off everything.

223
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:15,180
You can't block people.

224
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:16,950
He can't mute people on every platform.

225
00:07:16,951 --> 00:07:19,140
Then they can have your email on youtube.

226
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:19,291
You,

227
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:19,741
you know,

228
00:07:19,741 --> 00:07:24,690
it shows up in your suggested for the
point is as fast as you can just shut the

229
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:25,860
whole thing off if you want.

230
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:26,880
So it's a silly argument.

231
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:28,470
It's not like someone invading your house.

232
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:31,530
So because you can shut
it off at any time.

233
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,380
Okay.

234
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,210
It's just not,

235
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,350
that's just not going anywhere.

236
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:34,980
That argument.

237
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,101
Well,

238
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:38,370
what if someone has a computer in their
house then if they have a computer now

239
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:38,730
son,

240
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,070
it means that someone can invade their,

241
00:07:40,071 --> 00:07:41,160
their house that way digitally.

242
00:07:41,161 --> 00:07:41,580
There's,

243
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,860
there's no way to find
a space away from me.

244
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,230
Particularly people like Alex Jones,

245
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,200
most egregious offenders,

246
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:46,381
right.

247
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:50,700
Who spread conspiracies and effectively
like lead to doxing of people.

248
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,480
Um,

249
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,313
I mean

250
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:53,891
the thing is too,

251
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,730
it's again,

252
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,500
again the,

253
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:56,820
the,

254
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,480
the question is more fundamental.

255
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,780
Let's assume that it's a bad idea for
poorly supported conspiracy theories to be

256
00:08:04,811 --> 00:08:06,310
formulated and distributed.

257
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,510
Let's assume that,

258
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:08,590
yeah,

259
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:08,981
fine.

260
00:08:08,981 --> 00:08:09,191
Well,

261
00:08:09,191 --> 00:08:10,600
we don't need to put it in air quotes.

262
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:11,920
We could probably both assume it.

263
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,400
The question is what should you
do with people who are doing that?

264
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:17,200
And that one answer is well,

265
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,990
do what you can to silence them
and drive them underground.

266
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,680
The other is let them talk and let
people make up their own minds.

267
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:25,240
And my sense is,

268
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:31,020
is that people are wise enough to listen
to people of that sort and decide that

269
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,800
that's too extreme.

270
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:33,671
Now,

271
00:08:33,671 --> 00:08:34,331
not every one,

272
00:08:34,331 --> 00:08:35,164
because

273
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,300
conspiracy theorists can find followers
among people who are disagreeable and

274
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:41,170
somewhat paranoid,

275
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:42,730
but it's best for everyone,

276
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,950
including the conspiracy
theorists themselves,

277
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:48,010
that those things are aired in public
discussion because it helps keep people

278
00:08:48,011 --> 00:08:48,844
saying,

279
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,091
you know,

280
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:51,160
like I've known people who
are a little bit on this.

281
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,810
Disagree.

282
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,060
Yeah,

283
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,010
but that's because you don't
know what you're talking about.

284
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:54,990
I have no incorrect.

285
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,171
Listen,

286
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:55,980
there are more Americans

287
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,710
who believe in angels
then in climate change,

288
00:08:59,070 --> 00:08:59,380
uh,

289
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,740
the top shows that are Kardashians.

290
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,680
Look at what's on television.

291
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:03,360
I don't believe that the American public,

292
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,700
that anyone should be granted the same.

293
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:06,611
Yeah.

294
00:09:06,611 --> 00:09:07,710
And as you see that they should be,

295
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:08,200
there should be,

296
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,050
why should treat them wise enough?

297
00:09:10,051 --> 00:09:13,470
I'm saying I don't think they're wise
enough and that's why the compared to the

298
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,340
alternatives.

299
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,180
Okay.

300
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:15,361
You know,

301
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:18,840
your system in the United States was never
set up under the presumption that the

302
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:19,920
people were wise.

303
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,440
It was set up under the
presumption that the people,

304
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:23,520
regardless of their wisdom,

305
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,110
had the right to self determination.

306
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:29,010
And even more importantly that although
the people themselves might not always

307
00:09:29,011 --> 00:09:29,521
be wise,

308
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:33,120
there isn't a better source of
authority than the people themselves.

309
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:36,630
So that no matter how corrupt and
foolish the people happen to be,

310
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:40,320
whatever systems you put in place
to supplant them will be worse.

311
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,083
And so I think,

312
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:43,620
and you might not believe that,

313
00:09:43,621 --> 00:09:43,841
but that,

314
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:44,581
and that's fine,

315
00:09:44,581 --> 00:09:46,840
but that is the founding
principal of the dark blue.

316
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:47,911
I don't believe it.

317
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:48,001
Yeah,

318
00:09:48,001 --> 00:09:48,601
that's fine.

319
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:49,434
You don't believe it.

320
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,160
Don't believe that.

321
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,610
I don't believe that Alex Jones
and anyone with a Facebook page is,

322
00:09:53,611 --> 00:09:54,360
for example,

323
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,800
as qualified and a,

324
00:09:55,801 --> 00:09:59,250
and as I say for the American public as
Walter Cronkite or people in the Senate

325
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:02,400
and house who are qualified
to make these determinations.

326
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,881
I don't,

327
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:03,900
that's just a disagreement,

328
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:04,800
but I'll let people,

329
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:05,251
you know,

330
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:07,080
let's switch just a diff disagreement.

331
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:10,020
It's actually a disagreement about the
fundamental structure of the entire

332
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:13,950
political system because you'd think
that it's possible to produce banks of

333
00:10:13,951 --> 00:10:17,700
experts of one sort or another who can
supplant the fundamental will of the

334
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:18,121
people.

335
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,080
And I don't think,

336
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:20,850
I think that that's a very bad idea.

337
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,220
And I think that history
shows that that's a bad idea,

338
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:26,550
at least with democracy itself
tends to be self correcting.

339
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:28,230
So if people make egregious errors,

340
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,300
they correct them in the next election.

341
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:30,870
Well,

342
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:31,703
okay,

343
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:32,491
sorry.

344
00:10:32,491 --> 00:10:33,031
I want to,

345
00:10:33,031 --> 00:10:33,880
I want to give you a quote.

346
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,411
So again,

347
00:10:34,411 --> 00:10:39,090
that is self authoring.com if you want
to take your quiz and the book 12 rule

348
00:10:39,091 --> 00:10:41,190
for life is available at places.

349
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,090
Um,

350
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,010
so let me,

351
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:43,860
uh,

352
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,693
final question.

353
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,623
Do you ever,

354
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,780
does it ever concern you that you
might be on the wrong side of history?

355
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,700
Okay.

356
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:56,030
What mostly concerns me is whether
I make a mistake when I'm talking.

357
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,050
And so I,

358
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,570
I,

359
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,380
I'm not thinking about the
wrong side of history precisely.

360
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:01,843
So

361
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:05,810
I might be making mistakes
that concerns me all the time.

362
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:06,851
But,

363
00:11:06,851 --> 00:11:07,160
um,

364
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:07,970
I thought most,

365
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:11,420
I thought the things that I say
through very carefully and you know,

366
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,150
I'm perfectly willing
to live or die by them,

367
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:14,810
let's say.

368
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,450
So,

369
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,283
um,

370
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,451
well I asked you that,

371
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:17,751
cause you know,

372
00:11:17,751 --> 00:11:19,430
we've gone through a litany of,

373
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:19,850
of,

374
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,210
of,

375
00:11:20,210 --> 00:11:20,391
you know,

376
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:24,260
using people's preferred pronouns
of the idea of compassion,

377
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,183
um,

378
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,360
neither of which do you support.

379
00:11:26,361 --> 00:11:29,270
And then we've gone through things like
Alex Jones and extremists and social

380
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,830
media and these are ideas that you do.

381
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:36,080
I wonder if you constantly finding
yourself defending just bad,

382
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,160
like bad people.

383
00:11:37,161 --> 00:11:38,270
And even if you're not one,

384
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:38,631
if you have,

385
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:43,370
mostly what I find myself doing is I'm
being supported by a very large number of

386
00:11:43,371 --> 00:11:44,930
people and being,

387
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:45,500
um,

388
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,161
what would you call,

389
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:49,010
put on the spot in various
uncomfortable ways by a tiny,

390
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:52,190
noisy minority of let
radical collectivists.

391
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,900
So that's mostly I feel are
more mostly what I experienced.

392
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,941
So isn't it,

393
00:11:56,941 --> 00:11:58,120
what side of history,

394
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,150
isn't it your buddies who says sacks
don't care about your feelings?

395
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,620
So that's how you feel.

396
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:03,481
I'm sorry,

397
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:04,990
that's not my intent here.

398
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,011
Uh,

399
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:06,671
but again,

400
00:12:06,671 --> 00:12:10,430
that is self authoring.com
12 rules for life.

401
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,653

402
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,230
uh,

403
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:14,800
Dr. Jordan Peterson tongs
for taking the time.

404
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,580
Um,

405
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,140

and I'll have mine and uh,

409
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,113
I mean there it is.

410
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:22,361

so you can hit the notification bell.

414
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:31,920
I know that that Schuyler was incredibly
unpleasant with Dr. Jordan Peterson.

415
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,240
I wanted to kick his ass,

416
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:34,990
so I get it.

417
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:35,591
