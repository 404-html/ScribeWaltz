1
00:00:01,930 --> 00:00:05,230
Why bother with this
strange we'll book at all.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:06,873
And

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,790
that's a good question.

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,790
You know,

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:12,623
um,

6
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:15,560
it's a contradictory

7
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:20,720
document that's been cobbled
together over thousands of years.

8
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,640
It's outlasted kingdoms,

9
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:22,971
many,

10
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:23,781
many kingdoms.

11
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:24,061
You know,

12
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:24,330
it's,

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:24,530
it's,

14
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,310
it's really interesting that it turns
out that a book is more durable than,

15
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,451
than stone.

16
00:00:29,451 --> 00:00:30,890
It's more durable than a castle.

17
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:32,540
It's more durable than an empire.

18
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,400
And that's really interesting.

19
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:34,641
You know,

20
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:34,970
that,

21
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:37,100
that it's something in some sense,

22
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:40,640
so evanescent can be so long living.

23
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:42,920
So there's that,

24
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:44,060
that's kind of a mystery.

25
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,960
I'm approaching this whole scenario.

26
00:00:47,961 --> 00:00:52,280
This is the biblical stories as if
they're a mystery fundamentally be,

27
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,061
because they are,

28
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,250
there's a lot we don't
understand about them.

29
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,070
We don't understand how they came about.

30
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,280
We don't really understand
how they were put together.

31
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,740
We don't understand why they had such
an unbelievable impact on civilization.

32
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,800
We don't understand how people
could have believed them.

33
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,310
We don't understand what it means
that we don't believe them now or,

34
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,830
or even what it would mean
if we didn't believe them.

35
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,743
They're theirs.

36
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:19,580
And then on top of all that,

37
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:21,500
there's the additional problem,

38
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,050
which isn't specific to me,

39
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:28,400
but it's certainly relevant to me
that no matter how educated you are,

40
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,020
you're not educated enough to discuss
the psychological significance of the

41
00:01:33,021 --> 00:01:34,040
biblical stories.

42
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,200
But I'm,

43
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,200
I'm going to do my best and partly
because I want to learn more about them.

44
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:45,560
And one of the things I've learned is
that the best way to learn about something

45
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:46,820
is to talk about it.

46
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,920
And when I'm lecturing,

47
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:49,754
I'm thinking,

48
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,061
you know,

49
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:50,201
I'm,

50
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:53,450
I'm not trying to tell you what
I know for sure to be the case,

51
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:56,840
because there's lots of things I
don't know for sure to be the case.

52
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,760
I'm trying to make sense out of this.

53
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:00,800
And I have been doing
this for a long time.
