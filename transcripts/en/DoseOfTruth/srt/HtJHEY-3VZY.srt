1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,323
So

2
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:13,003
all right,

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,940
so Sarah dies.

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:22,380
Abraham makes a bargain with the

5
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:28,920
hittites to purchase a burial place for
her and they offer it as a gift and he

6
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:30,420
insists upon paying for it.

7
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,950
It's a little story that basically
indicates two things that Abraham was the

8
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:39,900
kind of guy that you trust pretty
much when you see him and that even if

9
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,370
something is offered to them as a gift,

10
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:45,000
he's going to do everything
to be reciprocal about it.

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:49,440
And so it's not a massively
important part of the story,

12
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:52,920
but it's in keeping with
the same narrative flow.

13
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,440
And so if Ron,

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,160
who's a hittite,

15
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,950
offers a burial place as
a gift and Abraham says,

16
00:00:58,951 --> 00:00:59,161
no,

17
00:00:59,161 --> 00:00:59,431
you know,

18
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:00,690
you have to let me pay for it,

19
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:03,090
and everyone says he will.

20
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:04,590
And that works out very well.

21
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:07,470
And so he has a good
burrito place for his wife.

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,953
And then

23
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:14,300
Abraham decides that Isaac needs a wife.

24
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,020
And so he sends his eldest
servant to miss a potassium.

25
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,780
You have to find a wife for Isaac.

26
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:24,614
And

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,960
there's this strange
ritual that's performed.

28
00:01:27,961 --> 00:01:32,961
So it says in the story that the servant
places his hand under Abraham's thigh

29
00:01:33,061 --> 00:01:33,894
to,

30
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,730
to swear,

31
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:36,930
but that isn't really what it means.

32
00:01:36,931 --> 00:01:41,931
It means that he places his hand don't
know exactly how to say this properly.

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:42,991
Well,

34
00:01:42,991 --> 00:01:44,220
use your imagination.

35
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,054
How about that?

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,720
And the idea is that as far as I can
tell that he's swearing on the future,

37
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,770
he swearing on future people.

38
00:01:52,771 --> 00:01:53,730
It's something like that.

39
00:01:53,731 --> 00:01:54,041
So that,

40
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,500
that sort of what testified means,

41
00:01:55,501 --> 00:01:56,334
right?

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,320
Think about the route
while I'm not kidding,

43
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,113
I'm not kidding.

44
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,730
That is what that is the derivation,

45
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:02,971
right?

46
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:04,230
If it is the derivation.

47
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,093
So,

48
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:05,581
so,

49
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:06,414
uh,

50
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,081
so anyways,

51
00:02:07,081 --> 00:02:08,370
this is a serious issue.

52
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:10,860
And so that servant has
to go and find Isaac,

53
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:14,460
a good wife and he
wants him to find Isaac,

54
00:02:14,461 --> 00:02:19,461
a wife who is willing to accept
the same fundamental belief system,

55
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:23,520
which is something like the belief
in a God that's a unity rather than a

56
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,354
plurality.

57
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:24,781
You know,

58
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:29,760
the other thing that young was very
insistent upon was that there was a

59
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:31,230
relationship between

60
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,990
polytheism and psychological confusion
and monotheism and psychological

61
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,020
unification.

62
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,940
I really liked that idea too,

63
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,940
that you know that that
what you're trying to do,

64
00:02:43,941 --> 00:02:45,200
because you are a plurality,

65
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:48,170
that that's one of the
things the psychoanalysts
were really good at figuring

66
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:51,950
out that the cognitive scientists
haven't touched yet as far as I can tell

67
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:55,310
they're way behind the psychoanalysts
and that element of thinking is that you

68
00:02:55,311 --> 00:03:00,311
are composed of sub personalities which
all have their own desires and their own

69
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:01,010
viewpoint,

70
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:05,440
their own thoughts and their own
perceptions and they're in a war with each

71
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,790
other constantly,

72
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,850
maybe even a Darwinian war.

73
00:03:08,851 --> 00:03:09,280
It's been.

74
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,280
It's been portrayed that way by certain
neuroscientists and that that one of the

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:20,220
goals of life is to integrate all of that
plurality into a hierarchical ethical

76
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:26,320
structure that has some
canonical ethic at the pinnacle.

77
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:26,630
Right.

78
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,790
We've talked a little bit about that and
it's not obvious what should be at the

79
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,331
pinnacle,

80
00:03:31,331 --> 00:03:32,830
but we can guess at it.

81
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,081
It's.

82
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,930
It's that which we admire.

83
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,340
That's one way of thinking about it.

84
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,140
It's that that describes fairplay
across a sequence of games.

85
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,790
That's another good way
of thinking about it.

86
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,260
It's.

87
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,890
It's the heroic ideal.

88
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,690
That's another way of thinking about it,

89
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,880
but it's combined with generosity,

90
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,250
you know,

91
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,880
because the hero,

92
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,490
the mythological hero goes out into the
unknown and slays the dragon and gets

93
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,333
the gold,

94
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,000
but then it comes back to the
community and distributes what's found.

95
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:01,360
And so it's courage
plus generosity and um,

96
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,250
and so all of your,

97
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:08,670
all of that interior struggling
that you're doing is an
attempt to bang yourself

98
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:14,350
against the world with challenge
constantly to hit everything together.

99
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:16,110
Like you're beating on a piece of iron to,

100
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:16,900
to,

101
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,320
to,

102
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,340
to cure it,

103
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,174
let's say,

104
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,370
so that you don't,

105
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,930
you're not an internal contradiction.

106
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,240
You're not massive competing God,

107
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:29,800
something like that because it's just
too psychologically stressful and hard on

108
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:32,620
everyone else and impossible
for them to get along with you,

109
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,431
with your one thing,

110
00:04:33,431 --> 00:04:34,630
one moment and another thing,

111
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:35,320
another moment.

112
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,520
And so.

113
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:38,981
So anyways,

114
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:43,981
Abraham insists that Isaac find a wife
from among people who are likely to carry

115
00:04:44,471 --> 00:04:46,540
off forward the monotheistic tradition.

116
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:50,320
And I'm not sure that the monotheistic
tradition is actually indistinguishable,

117
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,920
is actually distinguishable from
the individualistic tradition.

118
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,120
I think they might be the same thing
at different levels of analysis,

119
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,020
you know,

120
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,640
so because the individual means
and divided in some sense,

121
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:03,791
right?

122
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:08,791
To be an individual means to be one
thing and the other thing that mitigates

123
00:05:09,431 --> 00:05:12,760
against the idea of life is happiness
is it isn't obvious to me that it's

124
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:13,421
happiness.

125
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,050
That is what molds you and shapes you.

126
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:16,550
You know,

127
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:20,170
it's something more like optimal
challenge voluntarily undertaken.

128
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,190
It's something like that.

129
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:21,761
Right?

130
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:25,330
And I think that's echoed in the idea
that everyone has a moral obligation to

131
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,950
raise their cross,

132
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,880
something like that,

133
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:31,360
to accept the fact of their
mortality voluntarily.

134
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,170
I believe that that's the case and
I do actually think that that's a

135
00:05:35,171 --> 00:05:39,250
prerequisite to proper psychological
development because if you're not willing

136
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:43,180
to take your mortality on voluntarily,

137
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:46,300
like if you're kicking and fighting
about it constantly and you have every

138
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:47,830
reason to don't get me wrong,

139
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,220
then you can't act
forthrightly in the world.

140
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:51,731
Right?

141
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:54,340
You're going to be afraid
and when you're afraid,

142
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,950
then you can't voluntarily take on a.

143
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,750
and then if you can't take
voluntarily take on a challenge,

144
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:00,860
then you can't develop.

145
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:01,880
And so again,

146
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:05,750
the life seems to be something
like if it's a proper life,

147
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:10,751
is the voluntarily voluntary taking on
of great challenges and maybe that's

148
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:12,290
better than happiness.

149
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,030
I can certainly more noble,

150
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,750
you know,

151
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,850
it's not a word we use very much anymore.

152
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,330
The idea of nobility because
we're so obsessed with happiness.

153
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:21,770
But I think happiness is a,

154
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,150
like if it comes along,

155
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:23,421
man,

156
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:23,800
great,

157
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,200
you know,

158
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:24,890
wonderful.

159
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:25,723
Don't,

160
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,230
don't take it lightly or for
granted because it's fleeting.

161
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:35,620
But the idea that that's what you should
be for in some sense to seems to me if,

162
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,750
if that's what life is for
than maybe it shouldn't be.

163
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,020
Maybe that's correct because
that isn't what life is,

164
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,520
but it also doesn't.

165
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,950
It isn't obvious to me that
that's what life should be,

166
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:46,830
you know?

167
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,420
I mean,

168
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,140
if you really love someone like,

169
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:49,941
like your son,

170
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:50,774
let's say,

171
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:51,861
would you say,

172
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:53,450
well I hope he has a happy life,

173
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,463
or would you say,

174
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,200
I hope he accomplishes great things.

175
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:01,760
It seems to me that that's better than
the accomplishing of great things.

176
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:04,640
And because that's admirable,

177
00:07:04,641 --> 00:07:05,360
you know,

178
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,220
it's like a happy person
is a happy person,

179
00:07:07,221 --> 00:07:10,190
but a noble person has
an admirable person and,

180
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,480
and that's,

181
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,010
that's better man.

182
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:15,500
And so maybe there are
better things than happiness.

183
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,980
And so you can't judge being on the basis
of the ratio of suffering to pleasure,

184
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,011
something like that.

185
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:22,700
It's.

186
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
And I don't think we do that.

187
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,160
I don't believe we do that.
