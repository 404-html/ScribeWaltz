1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,440
The old kingdom is threatened by scar.
Scar is the evil king of the evil

2
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:15,530
brother of the King.
The king is the parrot.

3
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:20,890
The entity that inhabits the pinnacle of
the pyramid the king always has an evil

4
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:26,451
brother and you know that as well.
And the reason for that is that there is

5
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:31,450
no hierarchy that's so pristine that it
isn't threatened by corruption and scars

6
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,180
presented as a resentful intellect.
And that's a very common trope as well.

7
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,960
That's the evil scientist idea.
It's not the only only the evil

8
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:43,260
scientist idea.
It's the mad scientist it's the evil

9
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:46,800
genius God.
How many movies with a mythological

10
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:51,801
substrate have come out in the last 20
years that prominently feature an evil

11
00:00:51,811 --> 00:00:54,390
genius.
It's like there's dozens of them.

12
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:58,230
There's an inexhaustible hunger for that
representation.

13
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:01,580
I mean in the last avenger movie you had
fantasy right.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:05,760
He's basically the spirit of death who
is an evil genius who thinks that mass

15
00:01:05,761 --> 00:01:10,620
extinction is the answer to the
population problem of let's say the

16
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,454
world.

17
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,610
Something to think about very seriously.
Well the reason for that is that this

18
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:20,100
estate is always threatened by
malevolence always.

19
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,250
The hierarchy can always be come corrupt
and tyrannical and that those the forces

20
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:29,910
of malevolence let's say they are
conspiring behind the scenes tend to

21
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:34,911
tilt every hierarchy towards tyranny and
the proper attitude to take towards that

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,320
universal truth is to stay in the light
and keep your damn eyes open and so well

23
00:01:44,321 --> 00:01:49,090
what happens in the Lion King is that
the evil brother overthrows the rightful

24
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:52,840
king and that again is an unbelievably
common idea.

25
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,920
You see that idea echo throughout the
mythological landscape for centuries.

26
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,650
And the reason for that is it happens
all the time.

27
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,910
That's what happened in Nazi Germany.
That's what's happened in most of the

28
00:02:03,911 --> 00:02:08,380
tyrannical societies of the world and
most societies in the world are

29
00:02:08,381 --> 00:02:11,650
tyrannical.
There's always the possibility that the

30
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:15,610
hierarchies that we live in will become
corrupt and counter-productive and

31
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:19,690
there's multiple reasons for that but
they're summed up in the malevolence of

32
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,830
the arrogant intellect.

33
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,610
It's something like that.
That's it.

34
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,980
That's a very common idea.
That's the character of Milton Satan.

35
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,990
By the way because he's the ultimate in
arrogant intellect Milton Satan is the

36
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:35,980
figure who believes that his knowledge
is sufficient to do without the

37
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:40,660
transcendent to do without the idea that
there is something beyond or that

38
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:44,770
there's still something to learn.
All I know is all that I need to know

39
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,490
which is exactly the belief of the
fundamental tyrant

40
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,900
the evil
brother of the King kills the King Simba

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:59,240
loses his father.
Well that's another common idea because

42
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,440
everyone loses their father in some
sense people grow up and become cynical

43
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:06,140
as teenagers.
And the reason they become cynical as

44
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:11,141
teenagers is because they see that the
corruption of the state is sufficient to

45
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:14,930
undermine their confidence in the
benevolence of the state and they get

46
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:18,380
cynical prematurely because what the
hell do you know when you're a teenager.

47
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:22,250
But you're encouraged in your cynicism
frequently in our culture which is a

48
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:25,820
very bad idea.
No I mean even though it is the case

49
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:30,821
that the structure is always threatened
by malevolence let's say and and human

50
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:36,071
weakness.
Simba ends up fatherless and lost and

51
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:39,200
alienated from his kingdom just like
King Arthur.

52
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,470
It's the same story.
The king is often the rightful king is

53
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:48,471
often dissociated from his kingdom and
forced to occupy a domain that's outside

54
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:51,510
the kingdom.
And that's what happens to Simba.

55
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,510
He loses his father and what happens.
He's

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,160
he adopts the lifestyle of an impulsive
adolescent.

57
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:05,440
That's what happens and so he's out
there in no man's land with his useless

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
teenage friends doing nothing of any
good except living for the moment.

59
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,750
And that's the nihilistic retreat from
the corrupt state.

60
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:19,740
And no wonder and you might say well if
the state is corrupt why should I

61
00:04:19,741 --> 00:04:24,660
participate in its maintenance.
Why should I do anything that's useful

62
00:04:24,661 --> 00:04:27,550
if all I'm doing is furthering the
development of a corrupt state.

63
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,870
And I would say the message in the most
pathological university disciplines the

64
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:35,190
activist disciplines.

65
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,300
That's exactly the message that they're
particularly putting out to young men

66
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:43,320
which is you live in a corrupt
patriarchy and that means any attempts

67
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:48,000
that you make to further yourself in
this life as an individual with regards

68
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,790
to your family.
Another corrupt patriarchal institution

69
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:55,470
with regards to marriage or career that
all that is is furthering the corrupt

70
00:04:55,471 --> 00:04:58,560
patriarchy.
Everything you do that you think is good

71
00:04:58,561 --> 00:05:02,130
in the productive sense is actually
doing nothing but contributing to this

72
00:05:02,131 --> 00:05:07,131
catastrophic tyrannical patriarchy very
demoralizing but also opens the door for

73
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:12,420
you to be as useless as you possibly can
because and there's always a temptation

74
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:16,950
in that direction because it's easier
and you can justify it by saying well if

75
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:21,180
I did anything productive all I would be
doing is furthering the dominance of the

76
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:25,050
corrupt system anyways.
And if you haven't met people who think

77
00:05:25,051 --> 00:05:29,640
that way then you haven't met very many
people because that's an unbelievably

78
00:05:29,641 --> 00:05:34,530
common way of thinking and it's an
excuse but it's also a logical reaction

79
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,930
to the confusion of competence with
power.

80
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:39,810
That's part and parcel of the
collectivist landscape.

81
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:45,530
So Simba grows up so to speak gets older
at least playing this impulsive day to

82
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:51,720
day game.
Rule seven in my book is do what is

83
00:05:51,721 --> 00:05:56,721
meaningful not what is expedient.
And of course symbols lifestyle outside

84
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,200
the rightful kingdom is nothing but
expedients it's impulsive pleasure and

85
00:06:01,201 --> 00:06:06,201
that lasts until until what until his
old girlfriend shows up Nahla and she's

86
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,330
been dealing with the catastrophe of the
state and maybe that's because

87
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,720
women
the demands of family fall heavier on

88
00:06:20,891 --> 00:06:25,891
women at least initially and so they're
more sensitive to the catastrophe of the

89
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:29,020
state.
Nahla shows up and says December

90
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,730
What the hell do you think you're doing.
You're useless.

91
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,340
I liked you when you were a kid.
Here you are.

92
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,790
You're completely useless and
everything's falling apart and the state

93
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,220
has become corrupt and there isn't
enough to eat and there's things that

94
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:43,054
need to be done.

95
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:48,430
And he falls in love with her of course
probably because she criticizes him and

96
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:54,400
and then he's deeply ashamed of himself
because she rejects him because he's

97
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:57,460
useless.
And so she should reject him because

98
00:06:57,461 --> 00:07:00,460
he's useless.
And if she didn't then he'd never figure

99
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:03,700
out why he was useless and do something
about it and that's when he meets his

100
00:07:03,701 --> 00:07:06,490
father.
Remember there's an initiation scene

101
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:06,970
there.

102
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:11,170
The wise old baboon who is supposed to
be a fool and in the early drafts of the

103
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:16,000
movie guides him down underground so
that he can reflect upon himself which

104
00:07:16,001 --> 00:07:21,001
is what he does in a pool down in the
underworld and what he sees reflected in

105
00:07:21,461 --> 00:07:26,461
his own face is the spirit of his dead
father mature face symbol looks like

106
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,360
this right.

107
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,010
He looks like a deer caught in the
headlights.

108
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:35,040
The animators have done a really good
job of capturing that naive and sort of

109
00:07:36,711 --> 00:07:40,640
rotten old adolescent innocence.
You know that's that's outlived its

110
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:45,641
utility and but his father has a very
set face which means he's integrated his

111
00:07:45,951 --> 00:07:50,570
aggression and he sees his father in the
water and then he sees his father in the

112
00:07:50,571 --> 00:07:55,571
sky and his father says you've forgotten
who you are Wake the hell up.

113
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,240
Grow the hell up.
There are things to fix there.

114
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,520
There are things to fix there's
responsibilities to take on and so.

115
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,710
Symbols rather shocked by this encounter
and decides to leave his false

116
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:19,441
adolescent paradise and to go back to
the catastrophically demolished state

117
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,710
and he takes his friends and he sees
this place that where there's nothing

118
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:28,030
but starvation and cruelty and
malevolence and tyranny.

119
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,320
And he fights a battle against evil and
he reclaims his kingdom and as soon as

120
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:37,321
that happens the rain falls and the
plants grow and harmony is restored and

121
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,140
that's fascist mysticism by the way.
So it seems to appeal to a very large

122
00:08:45,411 --> 00:08:48,610
number of people.
Given the popularity of that movie and

123
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:51,590
what is that.
What's it called a responsibility.

124
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,960
It's a fundamental called a
responsibility.
