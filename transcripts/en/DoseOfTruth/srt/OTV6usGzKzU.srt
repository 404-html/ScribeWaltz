1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,320
There's this neuroscientist,

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,790
you're a psychologist
named El Conan Goldberg,

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,520
and Goldberg was a student of Alexander
Luria and Alexander Luria was a Russian

4
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:18,600
neuropsychologist,

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,000
perhaps the foremost neuro psychologist
of the mid to late 20th century.

6
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,510
And he had students Sokolov in vinegar
Dova who discovered the orienting reflex.

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,351
For example,

8
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:34,950
the orienting reflects is the reflex
that orients you win something anomalous,

9
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:37,230
interferes with your
goal directed behavior.

10
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,850
It's a major discovery,

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,010
like one of the,

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,280
one of the four or five most important
discoveries that have ever been made in,

13
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,060
in,

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,720
in,

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,531
in psychology,

16
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:46,861
I would say,

17
00:00:46,861 --> 00:00:47,970
certainly in neuroscience.

18
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:53,150
So Luria was a big deal and he was the
first person who really established the

19
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:55,740
functional role of the
prefrontal Cortex as well.

20
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:56,933
So,

21
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:01,600
and had it very nice overall
view of how the brain functioned.

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,050
His book was written
in 1980 and it's still,

23
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,430
there's still lost in it.

24
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,720
That's really useful,

25
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:09,540
which is pretty strange for a
science that's advanced that quickly.

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,823
Anyways,

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,830
so Goldberg came from a great pedigree,

28
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,000
I believe Larry,

29
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,270
his teacher was Pavlov,

30
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,770
if I remember correctly.

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,540
So anyways,

32
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,883
um,

33
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,910
Goldberg,

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:28,421
you know,

35
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:29,470
you hear,

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,920
some of you may have heard the idea that
the left hemisphere is more linguistic

37
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:39,730
than the right hemisphere is that left
hemisphere is specialized for language

38
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:44,170
and the right hemisphere is
specialized for nonverbal images,

39
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,190
stick communication.

40
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,960
The left hemisphere has a pretty

41
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:52,750
well organized micro structure and the
right hemisphere is more diffuse as well.

42
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,213
And

43
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,940
that's true in lefthanded
males in particular.

44
00:01:57,941 --> 00:02:00,430
So the circuitry can be
switched around a bit,

45
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,480
but it's okay.

46
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:03,310
The modules are basically the same,

47
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,840
although they can be moved a little bit,

48
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,920
but Goldberg thought that it isn't
language versus non language,

49
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:11,890
it's routine versus novelty.

50
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,640
And so the left hemisphere and there's a
neuropsychologist physician named Roman

51
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,410
[inaudible] who's done
some very interesting work,

52
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,743
um,

53
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,620
that's pertinent to this.

54
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:25,180
Maybe I'll tell you a story about him.

55
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,643
Anyways,

56
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,260
Goldberg believed that
the Right Hemisphere,

57
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:34,690
let's say you have very
old systems underneath,

58
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:39,400
boast both cortical hemispheres that do
things like respond to anomaly to the

59
00:02:39,401 --> 00:02:42,490
thing that doesn't fit to
the Predator in the distance.

60
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,190
Some of that's extraordinarily fast.

61
00:02:45,191 --> 00:02:48,940
So that would be like a snake reflects
that can move you away from a snake in

62
00:02:48,941 --> 00:02:50,710
less time than it takes the snake to bite.

63
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,880
And it's really a reflex.

64
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,140
It doesn't even hit your brain.

65
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:54,580
It's really super fast.

66
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,300
And then there's a
defensive crouch that's,

67
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,850
that's instantiated higher
up in the nervous system.

68
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,740
But that's still remarkably fast.

69
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,190
And then there's fear as an emotion and,

70
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,450
and the orientation of attention.

71
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:11,380
And then there's the cognitive processing
and that all streams out across a

72
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,190
timespan,

73
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,401
right?

74
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,320
And maybe that time span is half a second.

75
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,100
So,

76
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,500
and that's really a long time
if something is attacking you.

77
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:21,130
So you got those initial
responses are quite primitive,

78
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,960
but they're extraordinarily fast.

79
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,041
All right?

80
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:28,870
So there's subcortical structures that
orient you towards novelty and prepare

81
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:30,070
you for,

82
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,320
for freezing or for attending.

83
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:36,280
And the right hemisphere seems
to be dominated by those systems.

84
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,080
So imagine that what happens is
that something threatens you.

85
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,310
You Orient towards it.

86
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,700
The right hemisphere produces a bunch
of images about what it might be.

87
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,910
So imagine that's what happens
when a child is afraid of the dark.

88
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,440
The child's on the bed,

89
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,580
they're afraid of the dark,

90
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:54,070
they're crouched cause they're
frozen like a prey animal.

91
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,280
And their right hemisphere is producing
monsters to inhabit the darkness that

92
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,640
are the child's hypotheses
about what might be out there.

93
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,103
Okay.

94
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,670
Because that's what you want to know,

95
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:07,504
right?

96
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,560
You want to know what's out there and
then you want to know what to do about it.

97
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,220
I can tell you two kids' dreams
that are sort of relevant to that.

98
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,610
So when my daughter was about three,

99
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,910
she came into the bedroom that my
wife and I had and she was crying,

100
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:25,600
she'd had a nightmare.

101
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:30,900
And she said that she saw a stream and
there was garbage all over the street.

102
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,130
And she didn't like that.

103
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,540
And so I sat her down and I said,

104
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:34,811
okay,

105
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:37,930
so imagine the stream
with the garbage in it.

106
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:40,810
Now imagine that you're taking the
garbage out and throwing it in the garbage

107
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,213
bin.

108
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,000
And so she,

109
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,480
and I got her to like visualize that
because that kind of puts her back in the

110
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,590
semi dream state.

111
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,710
And then she cleaned up the mess
and then she could go off to sleep.

112
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,490
Now you,

113
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:52,480
you could tell the child,

114
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:54,190
don't worry about the dream isn't real.

115
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,240
But that's not,

116
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,770
that's true because it's not real.

117
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,140
Like other day time things are,

118
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:01,120
but it's not like it's not real.

119
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:02,283
It's a dream.

120
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,850
Like a dream is real.

121
00:05:03,851 --> 00:05:05,590
It's just not the same kind of real.

122
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,950
And so what I did with her was to indicate
to her practically that if she saw

123
00:05:12,551 --> 00:05:13,630
something anomalous,

124
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:15,310
something that was out of place,

125
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,710
right?

126
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,840
Something that was a mass,

127
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:19,720
that it was within her capacity to set it.

128
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:20,554
Right.

129
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,521
Okay.

130
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:21,911
And so,

131
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:22,211
okay,

132
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:26,710
so now your right hemisphere tells
you what monster's might inhabit.

133
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,573
The,

134
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,720
the darkness.

135
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,090
Now what you have to do is figure out,

136
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,680
there's two things you have to figure out.

137
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:37,681
One is what to do about it given
monster and other is to do,

138
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:42,910
what about is to figure out what to do
about the class of all possible monsters,

139
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:44,823
right?

140
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,940
That's a whole different thing.

141
00:05:45,941 --> 00:05:48,160
That's something that only
human beings are capable of.

142
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,660
That level of abstraction.

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,591
Right?

144
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:55,450
And so what you might do
about a particular monster
is hide or go out and get

145
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:58,370
rid of it if was just an actual animal.

146
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,233
Right?

147
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,390
But that doesn't help because they're
sold the other potential predators that

148
00:06:02,391 --> 00:06:03,224
are still there.

149
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,580
And so maybe you can go hunt,

150
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,540
hold them down.

151
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,450
But that doesn't help either because
you can't hunt them all down.

152
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,471
It's not our,

153
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:10,700
it's not very likely anyways.

154
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,570
So instead what you have to do is figure
out how to configure yourself so that

155
00:06:14,571 --> 00:06:18,200
you're in the best possible position to
fight off the monsters when they come.

156
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,940
That's your best bet.
