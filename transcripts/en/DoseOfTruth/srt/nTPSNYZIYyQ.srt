What are your thoughts on
students taking Adderall?

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,280
Are there any long term effects?

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,150
There are long term studies of the
utility of Adderall for attention deficit

4
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:18,841
disorder,

5
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:19,710
hyperactivity,

6
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:21,810
and the results are basically negative.

7
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:27,030
There is no evidence that the medications
help with academic performance over

8
00:00:27,031 --> 00:00:27,864
the long run.

9
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,640
I think that,

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,473
um,

11
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:31,440
Adderall is an amphetamine.

12
00:00:31,441 --> 00:00:32,520
It is addictive.

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:35,880
It can sensitize you to
other dopamine agonists.

14
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,180
So I would generally say
it's something to be avoided.

15
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:42,600
You also want to really watch it
in combination with marijuana,

16
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:43,351
for example,

17
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:47,490
or psychedelics because you can get
unlucky and trigger a psychotic episode.

18
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:51,900
And that is not a good thing because
once you have one psychotic episode,

19
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:55,170
you're a bit on the broken side and it's
hard to put yourself back to the other.

20
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:59,370
So I would say use it sparingly,

21
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:00,300
if at all.

22
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,350
It's not,

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,670
it's not a good plan.

24
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:05,100
And especially not something
good to be doing habitually.
