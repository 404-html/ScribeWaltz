1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,690
You mentioned analyzing one of your wife's
dreams that left you feeling hopeful

2
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:13,370
that will emerge from this chaos.

3
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:14,204
Okay.

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,680
Do you still feel this way?

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,240
Any new signs?

6
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,710
Well,

7
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:19,341
who knows,

8
00:00:19,341 --> 00:00:19,641
right?

9
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:23,570
Because because the future is
complicated and no one's a profit.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,120
I don't know what to think.

11
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,081
I think this,

12
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:32,081
I guess I already mentioned earlier in
this Q and a that on a global level there

13
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:41,150
is all sorts of reasons for real
optimism as far as I'm concerned.

14
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,130
There's reasons for pessimism as well,

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,340
but there's reasons for
real optimism and what,

16
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,030
look,

17
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,230
it looks to me like what's
happening is that the spread of

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:54,260
the western free market,

19
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:59,470
individualist ethos around the world
is producing a substantive increment in

20
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:04,190
wealth,

21
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,170
a substantive decrease in poverty,

22
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:11,740
and the consequence of that decrease in
poverty is also in places like China,

23
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,651
which by the way,

24
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,090
China is reforesting,

25
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:15,200
so that's pretty interesting.

26
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,950
China's now rich enough so that
it can afford to reforest too.

27
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:22,790
There's more forest in China than there
was in 1990 which is quite a remarkable

28
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,360
thing.

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:23,781
Anyways,

30
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:24,441
my point is,

31
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:26,330
is that on the global scale,

32
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,030
things appeared to be very positive

33
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:31,220
and,

34
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:36,220
but then in the West we seem to be
suffering from a crisis of confidence and

35
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:41,330
that's destabilizing us and
making us act foolishly.

36
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,830
And I don't know how much of a threat
that is to the integrity of our political

37
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:46,664
system.

38
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,733
Um,

39
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:51,800
and I'm so much in the
middle of this let's say,

40
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,633
um,

41
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,440
personally that it's hard for me
to have a clear head about it.

42
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:02,660
Now I'm very optimistic about
a variety of things that I see.

43
00:02:02,661 --> 00:02:03,740
I'm very optimistic,

44
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:04,281
for example,

45
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:09,281
about the fact that so many people
have are coming out to these long form

46
00:02:09,621 --> 00:02:14,621
lectures and paying
attention to high complexity,

47
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,470
educational and political
material on Youtube.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,940
There's a real hunger for that.

49
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,590
And I,

50
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,820
as I said before,

51
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,670
the lecture tour that I'm on
has been extremely positive.

52
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,900
Um,

53
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,260
it's really something to see all
these thousands of people come out to

54
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:33,020
concentrate on getting
their lives together.

55
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:35,360
And I do believe that that's
why people are coming out.

56
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:35,571
And then,

57
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:36,404
you know,

58
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,483
I think,

59
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,520
I don't remember if I did a Q and a since
I did the discussions with Sam Harris,

60
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:44,601
but,

61
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:45,434
um,

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,530
I did for discussions
with him for debates,

63
00:02:48,531 --> 00:02:51,290
let's say each of which
was about two hours long,

64
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,460
two in Vancouver,

65
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,470
one in Dublin and one in London,

66
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,460
UK.

67
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,150
And there were about 3000 people at each
of the Vancouver 8,500 people in Dublin

68
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,660
and something approximating
6,500 in London.

69
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,170
And the audience was very attentive
for the two hour stretch for all four

70
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:11,620
discussions.

71
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,290
And so I do see the,

72
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,550
okay,

73
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,550
I see more intelligence in the general
population say then I think we presumed

74
00:03:24,051 --> 00:03:26,930
was there and more hunger
for serious discussion.

75
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:31,931
And I'm hoping that people who are clear
headed and sensible can push back the

76
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,730
idiot collectivist radicals
on the left and on the right.

77
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,403
We'll see.

78
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,100
Okay.

79
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,933
Um,

80
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,931
so yeah,

81
00:03:44,931 --> 00:03:49,931
I'm hopeful because I think that people
are remarkable creatures despite their

82
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:55,061
limitations and the absurdity of our
existence and our proclivity toward

83
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,271
malevolence.

84
00:03:56,271 --> 00:03:57,590
I think that,

85
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,580
yeah,

86
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:02,420
we can,

87
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,190
whatever constitutes our essence
is capable of transcending that.

88
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,710
And I think that people know that.

89
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:13,400
And I think the more people that realize
that consciously and start to implement

90
00:04:13,401 --> 00:04:13,491
it,

91
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:14,540
the better off we'll be.

92
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,870
And so nested inside my extreme pessimism
about the structure of life and the

93
00:04:20,631 --> 00:04:24,260
frailty of human character
is an acceptable optimism,

94
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,500
exceptional optimism about our potential.

95
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,900
So we'll see.

96
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,420
But I would also say to all
of you that are listening,

97
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,680
you know,

98
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,680
it is my firm belief that each of us
have a responsibility to set the world

99
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,950
right in the manner
that we are able to end.

100
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:46,280
That that is a fundamental,

101
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,500
that's a fundamental import.

102
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,570
I really believe in some sense it's
of cosmic import in the same way that

103
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:57,890
consciousness itself is of cosmic
import and consciousness reflects being

104
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:58,724
itself.

105
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,313
And so,

106
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,320
and I do believe that we have the ability
and the responsibility to bring new

107
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:10,550
creation into being and that
our ethical decisions help us

108
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,610
then our ethical decisions,

109
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:18,230
that the value of that new
being is dependent directly
on the ethical decisions

110
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,160
that each of us make.

111
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,000
And I think we can realize
that even though it's a
frightening thing to realize,

112
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:26,360
Marcus Perry asks,

113
00:05:26,361 --> 00:05:27,050
you said,

114
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,980
the narrow bandwidth of TV has made
us think we are stupider than we are.

115
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:35,900
We'll internet center censorship lead to
the same problem once TV is supplanted.

116
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:37,790
Well God,

117
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,190
another incredibly complicated question.

118
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,790
You know,

119
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,590
whenever I think about censorship,

120
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,610
I actually talked to mark Zuckerberg
a while back and we had a good

121
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:50,450
conversation,

122
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,021
you know,

123
00:05:51,021 --> 00:05:56,021
and Zuckerberg who I think is a very
straightforward person as far as I could

124
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:57,554
tell.

125
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,120
Okay.

126
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:58,953
Um,

127
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:05,010
is optimistic about Facebook and does see
it as a platform whose primary goal is

128
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:09,940
to connect people and mostly
at the personal level,

129
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:14,941
although Dave Facebook has made
forays into news provision and that's

130
00:06:15,071 --> 00:06:16,840
complicated their corporate vision.

131
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,040
Now I am not a pro censorship character.

132
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,370
I do not like hate speech legislation
and I am absolutely opposed to compelled

133
00:06:27,191 --> 00:06:30,190
speech legislation of the sort
that's been introduced into Canada.

134
00:06:30,191 --> 00:06:34,810
I think it's violation of the principle
of free speech and free thought and I

135
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,610
think it's exceptionally dangerous.

136
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,470
But having said that,

137
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:39,761
you know,

138
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:43,630
nothing is ever simple and that's part
of the reason that things are so annoying

139
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,493
politically.

140
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:46,150
So you know,

141
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:51,480
one of the things that apple
and Facebook and so forth,

142
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:56,581
those large social media platforms had
to contend with say was the attempts by

143
00:06:57,731 --> 00:07:02,731
organizations like isis to use
their platforms for recruitment.

144
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,220
Now let's say that I'm a
free speech absolutist,

145
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:11,430
which isn't exactly true because
I realized that there are the,

146
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:16,330
the constraints that he evolved in some
sense now truly in the English common

147
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:19,150
law system on free speech
and that they're necessary.

148
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:20,410
You can't libel someone,

149
00:07:20,411 --> 00:07:21,940
you can't outright lie about someone,

150
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,960
you can't slander them,

151
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:26,320
you can't counsel them
to criminal conduct,

152
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,130
et Cetera.

153
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,840
There are restrictions on free speech.

154
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,723
Well,

155
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:35,200
but I think those restrictions
should be minimal.

156
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:35,981
Well,

157
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:39,880
let's say that one of the restrictions
that you assume should be placed on free

158
00:07:39,881 --> 00:07:44,881
speech is that those that you are at
war with are not allowed to use your

159
00:07:45,461 --> 00:07:47,320
platform to recruit,

160
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,310
which doesn't seem to be an unreasonable
proposition and is perhaps even the

161
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:54,520
sort of thing and it a
conservative or a libertarian,

162
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:58,840
much less a liberal or a
left winger might get behind.

163
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,560
Well then that means that you've defined
already a framework in which is that

164
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:06,430
censorship and,

165
00:08:06,431 --> 00:08:08,350
or maybe I'm not thinking
this through clearly,

166
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:09,910
but is that censorship?

167
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,920
It's certainly self protection.

168
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,840
Well then having established the
principle that a certain amount of Mod,

169
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,250
what would you call monitoring of the
use of your platform is necessary.

170
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,720
Where do you stop?

171
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,220
And the answer is

172
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,090
it's complicated.

173
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:27,810
Um,

174
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,810
I think that what Facebook et Cetera
did with Alex Jones was a big mistake.

175
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,100
I think that was because,

176
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,090
well,

177
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:38,820
it wasn't just Alex
Jones that was punished,

178
00:08:38,821 --> 00:08:41,730
let's say it was all the people that
were watching him and not everybody that

179
00:08:41,731 --> 00:08:44,340
was watching him was an
avid follower of him.

180
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,753
Um,

181
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,520
some people were just watching him to see
what the hell he was doing and what he

182
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,110
was up to and that's necessary,

183
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,240
but you don't just sensor the one person,

184
00:08:54,241 --> 00:08:57,570
you censor everybody that's paying
attention to them and then you make him a

185
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:01,080
martyr and you persecute
someone who's paranoid,

186
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:05,160
which all that does is validate his
conspiracy theories is conspiratorial

187
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:08,640
theories and the conspiratorial
theories of his followers.

188
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,283
Um,

189
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,990
I guess one of the things I've really
been wondering is if the wild and woolly

190
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:21,590
reality of Facebook and Youtube and
Twitter are actually sustainable in a

191
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,180
corporate environment or if the radical
freedom that was associated with those

192
00:09:29,401 --> 00:09:34,401
technologies was only something that was
possible when in some sense all of that

193
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,570
material provision,

194
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:41,571
all the provision of that material was
outside the standard legal framework

195
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,400
because it was too new to regulate.

196
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,241
I know,

197
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,080
I can't tell.

198
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,520
I don't know if corporations can manage
something like youtube or Twitter or

199
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:51,840
Facebook for that matter,

200
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,080
because their internal
conservatism and there,

201
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,990
and I mean that in the,

202
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,390
in the temperamental sense,

203
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,690
their unwillingness to take risk is,

204
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:02,951
is,

205
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:07,770
is what I mean in that particular case
is liable to make it impossible for them

206
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:10,530
to be neutral purveyors of information,

207
00:10:10,531 --> 00:10:12,570
some of which is going
to be extremely radical.

208
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:13,823
So

209
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:15,751
well,

210
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,020
so there's,

211
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,250
I have no conclusions to offer there.

212
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,383
I,

213
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,900
and I guess I'm glad in some
sense that these complicated,

214
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,660
these particular complicated
problems aren't mine to solve.

215
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:32,280
I certainly think that the production
of automated sensors is a very,

216
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:33,180
very bad idea,

217
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:37,380
but I'm also someone who's
constitutionally opposed
to such things as closed

218
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,020
circuit TV monitor,

219
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:42,030
monitoring of the general public as well.

220
00:10:42,031 --> 00:10:42,600
And,

221
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,560
and cameras that,

222
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,550
that watch people at stoplights
and any automated system that,

223
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,020
that enforces the law or the,

224
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,620
or what's hypothetically the law
to me is to be regarded with deep,

225
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:56,670
deep suspicion.

226
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,103
So,

227
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,813
okay.

228
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,600
That's that.
