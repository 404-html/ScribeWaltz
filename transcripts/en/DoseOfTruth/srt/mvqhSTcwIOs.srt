1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,183
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:14,010
believe some other things.
This is where I think he gets a little

3
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:15,300
bit optimistic,
but

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,820
Rogers is one of those optimists you
really have to contend with.

5
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,470
Now he believed,
and I think this is a classical

6
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,180
Protestant belief,
this as well,

7
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:32,370
that what evil was was basically the
absence of good and that people had a

8
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:37,551
strong intrinsic impulse towards the
good that you could help them realize

9
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:42,780
and the way you help them realize.
That was by setting the preconditions

10
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:47,781
for the emergence of that good and he
believed that the preconditions were

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,820
the provision of a space for
communication

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,320
where there was no judgment in the sense
of rejection.

13
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,580
And so here's the Rogerian theory with
regards to therapeutic endeavor.

14
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,140
Now the first thing is,
and this seems critical and I think

15
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:22,550
Rogers was right about this,
that the client has to want to change,

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,480
and this is.
This is a funny thing about therapy

17
00:01:26,481 --> 00:01:31,340
because my observation has been that
it's not something you can impose on

18
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:35,480
people unless they've decided that
things could be better and that

19
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,140
alterations in,
in,

20
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:40,280
in something they're doing might make it
better.

21
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,450
It's a nonstarter.
And so I've had clients who were court

22
00:01:44,451 --> 00:01:47,240
ordered to attend therapy and that's
just complete waste of time,

23
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,540
especially if they're more on the
psychopath,

24
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:53,660
that gift of things because you're just,
if they don't want to change,

25
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:56,240
they're not going to learn.
And this is actually another Rogerian

26
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:01,100
principle and because Roger's had an
educational philosophy as well and the

27
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:05,480
educational philosophy was students will
not learn things that are not relevant

28
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:09,560
to them.
And so one of the teachers duties was to

29
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:13,130
make the material at hand relevant
because that would

30
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:17,030
help the students remember it.

31
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,820
Why remembered if it's not relevant to.
One of the things I tried to do in my

32
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:22,880
lectures,
I try to tell people when I'm lecturing,

33
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,880
why they should know this.
And the fundamental answer always,

34
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:29,090
if you push it down far enough,
is that if you know this,

35
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,780
your life will go better and so will the
life of people around you.

36
00:02:32,781 --> 00:02:35,660
So you should listen.
Because then there's some things that

37
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:39,260
are sharp and pointy that you will run
into while you're wandering around in

38
00:02:39,261 --> 00:02:40,970
the fall.
So,

39
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,710
and,
and that's the fundamental issue.

40
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:44,570
It's,
it's necessary to know these things and

41
00:02:44,571 --> 00:02:49,010
so if you're dealing with someone who
hasn't decided that there's something

42
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:50,780
wrong and that they have something to do
about it,

43
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:53,510
then maybe they could change that would
make things better.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,980
You're not going anywhere,
and Rogers would also say that's

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,650
actually a precondition for a
relationship period because he didn't

46
00:03:02,651 --> 00:03:06,430
really make much of a distinction
between a therapeutic relationship and a

47
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,720
genuine relationship because he thought
the genuine relationships with

48
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:14,721
therapeutic and so one of the principles
that you can extract from that is that

49
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:19,921
if you're in a relationship,
one useful proposition is that,

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,780
well,
you're pretty perfect,

51
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:25,300
but you're probably not quite as perfect
as you could be.

52
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:30,250
And so it's possible that your partner,
no matter how deeply flawed they are,

53
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,950
might now and then have something to say
to you that would,

54
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,550
if you incorporated,
would bring you to an even higher state

55
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,990
of perfection.
Right?

56
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:40,480
And so that's,
that means you have to listen.

57
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,740
And it's worse than that.
And this again is a Rogerian

58
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,550
observation.
You might have to help them criticize

59
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,830
you because maybe they're not very good
at it.

60
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,560
You know,
and so there's something they're trying

61
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:57,100
to tell you and they're stumbling way
and it's,

62
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,460
it's an actual thing,
but they can't articulate it and so it'd

63
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,070
be easy for you just to,
especially if you're trying to use

64
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:06,340
language instrumentally and to get away
with it just to,

65
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:11,170
while you could even make fun of the way
they're poorly articulating the problem,

66
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:13,990
that's a really good one because then
you can convince them not to do such

67
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:14,860
things in the future.

68
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,410
But if you take the other stance,
which is,

69
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,230
well,
I've got some things to learn and you've

70
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:23,200
got some things to learn and you've got
some things to teach me and I've got

71
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:26,020
some things to teach you and God only
knows when that's gonna happen,

72
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:29,620
but it might happen.
So the object of the conversation is for

73
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,020
each person to help the other person
make their point.

74
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,120
You know?
And that's a lot different than winning

75
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:36,130
the argument.
And I can tell you one thing,

76
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,200
you will not win an argument with any
intimate partner ever because you're not

77
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,830
playing the game of the argument.
You're playing the game of iterated

78
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:48,640
arguments across time and so if you win
an argument,

79
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:53,500
you just set up another one winning and
solving the problem and the same thing,

80
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:57,400
so from a Rogerian perspective,
winning would be the maintenance of your

81
00:04:57,401 --> 00:05:02,401
current self structure at the cost of
failure to integrate some disintegrated

82
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,310
element of the phenomenological realm.

83
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,530
Maybe it'd be the unhappiness of your
partner.

84
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:10,720
That might be one of them.
Now you can.

85
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,720
If you win the argument,
that's the rationalization issue.

86
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:18,721
Fundamentally you don't have to change,
but the fact is you do have to change

87
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:23,330
because the way you are is giving rise
to this situation and that's not going

88
00:05:23,331 --> 00:05:26,590
to change unless you fix it.
So winning an argument and fixing

89
00:05:26,591 --> 00:05:28,420
something.
Those are completely different things.

90
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,430
You fix the thing.
It goes away and often couples have to

91
00:05:33,431 --> 00:05:37,540
have conflict because there's no
difference between conflict and

92
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,240
thinking.
Thinking is a form of Lore.

93
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,630
It's just that you,
you,

94
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:43,830
you make it an interior form of war,
right?

95
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:47,650
You can't have accomplished without
conflict because life is different,

96
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,410
difficult and people differ from one
another.

97
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,610
So they have different value structures
and so you can't just ignore that you

98
00:05:54,611 --> 00:05:57,890
have to set up a dialogue because it's
not necessarily obvious clues,

99
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,540
right?

100
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,010
Of course rogers bleed that in the
therapeutic round two.

101
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,510
So he thought if therapy is something
that emerged as a consequence of the

102
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:09,110
adoption of certain axiomatic
presuppositions and those were

103
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:15,080
things could be better than they are and
you could make them that way and that's

104
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,440
also true for me.
And then the next presumption is,

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,480
well maybe we can figure out how to do
that in a collaborative with

106
00:06:23,481 --> 00:06:28,481
collaborative communication.
So Rogers believed that the therapist

107
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:31,940
was just as transformed during the
therapeutic process as the person.

108
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,450
In fact,
if that wasn't happening then whatever

109
00:06:35,451 --> 00:06:39,530
was happening wasn't the kind of healing
therapy that Rogers would like to have

110
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:42,050
happen.
And he also said that's all.

111
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:46,250
I'll read you something he said later,
but he also pointed out quite strongly

112
00:06:46,251 --> 00:06:48,290
that that's why people don't really like
to listen.

113
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,690
You know,
like maybe there's some flaw in

114
00:06:50,691 --> 00:06:51,200
yourself.

115
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:55,820
Structure at some fundamental level,
fundamentally axiomatic level,

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,410
you know,
maybe you're narcissistic.

117
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,390
That'd be a good one.
And you know,

118
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,900
if you listen to people,
they're going to tell you you're

119
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:03,950
narcissistic.
Well,

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,940
you don't want to find that out because
it's going to blow a huge hole and

121
00:07:06,941 --> 00:07:09,850
you're gonna blow a huge hole in
yourself.

122
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,860
Structure that's not very fun.
But

123
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:17,780
hypothetically,
that beats running into the obstacles

124
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:22,010
that you will run into if you're
narcissistic repeatedly as you move

125
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:25,820
forward through life.
So you can either live with your flaws

126
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:29,220
are correct.
And then the,

127
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:33,470
the pathway to correction is dialogue,
communication.
