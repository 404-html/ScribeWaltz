1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:11,280
Anyways,
back to the Hypothalamus,

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,810
roughly speaking,
and I'm no expert on hypothalamic

3
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,780
function and I had to pound by way
through Swanson's paper because it's

4
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:22,500
quite complex,
but the hypothalamus is sort of the

5
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,830
nexus between the brain,
the mind and the body.

6
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:29,670
That's one way of thinking about it and
it's very good at monitoring your body,

7
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:33,420
the states of your body and it can
figure out basically when your blood

8
00:00:33,421 --> 00:00:36,810
sugar's too low and when you need water
and when you don't.

9
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,740
Exactly remember how it's,
uh,

10
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,270
associated with the regulation of
breathing because I suspect that that's

11
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:44,940
a different system and I don't remember
that being a subcomponent of the

12
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:48,090
hypothalamus,
but it does also regulate things like

13
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:51,990
sexual behavior and sex,
sexual attraction and temperature

14
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,780
regulation and excretion and,
and you know,

15
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:59,250
all the things that you would associate
with the basic biological functions that

16
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:01,440
come along with being a complex animal.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,740
And you know,
we share those functions way down the

18
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:06,690
evolutionary chain.
You know,

19
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,600
we share a lot of the functions with
everything that moves,

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,510
approach and avoidance.
We share with pretty much everything

21
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:15,450
that moves.
And by the time you get to the higher

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,550
mammalian functions,
you know,

23
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,760
we share those with pretty much all
mammals.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,430
That's partly why we can understand
mammals pretty well.

25
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:25,620
You know,
once you can kind of have a lizard as a

26
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:28,410
pet and some of them are more social
than others,

27
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,300
but you know,
to really have a pad,

28
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:34,050
it has to be a mammal and it's even
better if it's a social mammal like a,

29
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,950
like a dog because you know,
you can understand dogs and they can

30
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:41,040
understand you because they are
hierarchical animals and they have the

31
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:45,180
same roughly the same set of biological
functions that you do.

32
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,450
You know,
their brains are organized around smell

33
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,170
and not around vision.
And almost all animals are like that

34
00:01:52,171 --> 00:01:54,510
except for people.
And maybe hunting birds,

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,430
you know.
So that's one thing that really

36
00:01:56,431 --> 00:02:01,431
distinguishes us from dogs,
but we're similar enough in neuron body

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:04,830
behavior so that we can directly relate
to dogs.

38
00:02:04,831 --> 00:02:06,360
And you know,
they can even play.
