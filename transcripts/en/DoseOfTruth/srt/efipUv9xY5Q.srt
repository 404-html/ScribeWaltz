1
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,831
I did you see,

2
00:00:11,831 --> 00:00:12,760
you see how this works?

3
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:16,330
It's just while here are ways you can
be creative and here are a strata of

4
00:00:16,331 --> 00:00:17,920
accomplishment within those ways.

5
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:20,200
And so then the question
is what does it look like?

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,063
Yes,

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,870
yes,

8
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:25,520
yes,

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:25,931
yes.

10
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:26,550
Fair enough.

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:26,701
And,

12
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:26,980
and,

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,250
and this probably needs to
be updated to reflect that.

14
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,353
So,

15
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,081
so there's,

16
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:33,760
there's the distribution of scores.

17
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,840
Now that's dismal.

18
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,430
That's abysmal thing to look at.

19
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:37,600
You have to understand that,

20
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,510
why look at this zero,

21
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,860
right?

22
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,880
The median person has not done anything
creative ever in their life with

23
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:47,330
anything on any dementia,

24
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,251
right?

25
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:49,690
It's really important to know that.

26
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:51,520
And then you have these
horrible people out here,

27
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:53,890
right?

28
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:54,820
They do everything.

29
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,990
They do everything.

30
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:57,160
Price's law.

31
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,180
Here's price's law.

32
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,220
This is something to
hammer into your heart.

33
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,060
The square root of the number of people
in the domain do 50% of the work.

34
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:05,561
Okay?

35
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:05,921
So let's,

36
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:06,760
let's go through that.

37
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,810
You have 10 employees.

38
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,441
Three of them do.

39
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:10,270
Half the work makes sense.

40
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,133
That's reasonable.

41
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,280
You have a hundred employees,

42
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,560
10 of them do half the work.

43
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,993
That's problem.

44
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,670
So the other 90% are doing the other half.

45
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:20,110
Who cares about them?

46
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:21,520
You have 10,000 employees,

47
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,590
a hundred of them do half the work,

48
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:24,581
right?

49
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:25,091
So here's a,

50
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,590
here's a nasty little law.

51
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,180
As your company grows in,

52
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,580
competence grows exponentially
and competence grows linearly.

53
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:34,990
Got It.

54
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:35,380
Right?

55
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,960
Because with 10 it's three
who are doing half the work,

56
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:40,210
but at 10,000 it's a hundred
that are doing half the work.

57
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:45,211
So 9,900 of your employees are doing as
much as the best 100 you might not even

58
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:47,140
know who the best 100 are,

59
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,230
but probably they know and
maybe their peers know too.

60
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:53,500
And so one of the things that's really
interesting when big companies start to

61
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:53,981
shake,

62
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:55,720
which means maybe they've
had a bad quarter,

63
00:01:55,721 --> 00:01:58,660
two bad quarters and the stock
price starts to tip down.

64
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,673
And the people,

65
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,770
the hot people who have options
are not very happy about that.

66
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,700
And maybe they start to announce layoffs.

67
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,930
All the a hundred people
who have opportunities leave
and they're the ones who

68
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:08,950
were doing half the work.

69
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,430
So boy that puts your company in a pretty
rough situation because now you've got

70
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,200
the 9,900 people left over who were only
doing half the work and the next time

71
00:02:17,201 --> 00:02:20,560
you announced layoffs the next
most productive hundred leave.

72
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:24,850
And so then you're left with nobody
who's productive at a massive overhead

73
00:02:24,851 --> 00:02:27,100
payroll price's law.

74
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:27,911
You can look that up.

75
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:31,870
Does sola price to solar price is
a guy who was looking at scientific

76
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:35,260
productivity and one of the things he
found was when he was looking at Phd

77
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:40,261
students is that the median number of
publications for a phd graduate when he

78
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:41,111
did his work,

79
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:44,530
which was in the early
sixties was one okay,

80
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:48,880
half as many had two half as many as
that had three half as many as that had

81
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:49,440
four.

82
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,660
It's a real step down and one of the
corollaries of that is that there's a

83
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:56,020
certain number of people who are hyper
productive and that's these people out

84
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:56,854
here.

85
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,050
And if you were graphing the,

86
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,850
let's say you graft,

87
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,760
how many people in a
population of 300 head,

88
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,470
$10,000 in a savings account,

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,000
it would look very much like this.

90
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,180
Some of them would have some of them.

91
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,133
Some of them would.

92
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,360
Most people would have
no savings whatsoever.

93
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,030
The median person would
have no savings whatsoever.

94
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:18,220
And then you go up here where the 1% is,

95
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,054
they have all the money.

96
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:23,140
But the thing you want to understand
about that 1% issue that you always hear

97
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:27,640
about is that it applies in every
single realm where there's difference in

98
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,480
creative production.

99
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:29,673
Every realm,

100
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,783
it doesn't matter.

101
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,960
Number of records produced,

102
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,950
number of records sold,

103
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:34,270
number of compositions written.

104
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:34,870
So here,

105
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,220
here's a,

106
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,100
here's an example.

107
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,400
Five composers produce the music that
occupies 50% of the classical rep

108
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,293
repertoire,

109
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:43,690
right?

110
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,080
Bach,

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:44,710
Beethoven,

112
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,400
Brahms,

113
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,270
Tchaikovsky,

114
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:47,890
Mozart.

115
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,341
That's right.

116
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:48,941
Those five.

117
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:49,211
Okay,

118
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:50,320
so here's something cool.

119
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,550
So you take all the music.

120
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:54,490
Those people wrote 5% of the music.

121
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:59,491
All those people wrote occupies 50% of
the music that of their writing that's

122
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:00,814
played.

123
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,241
So,

124
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,670
not only do almost all the
composers never get Alyson,

125
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,790
but even among the composers who do get,

126
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:07,151
listen,

127
00:04:07,151 --> 00:04:09,190
almost none of their
music ever gets played.

128
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,630
So,

129
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,463
so then that's,

130
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,900
that's another example of
this price's law of scaling.

131
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,030
So when it applies to all sorts of things,

132
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:19,090
like number of hockey goals scored
is also distributed this way.

133
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,500
Number of basketball,

134
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:24,790
basketball basketball's
successfully put through the hoop,

135
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:26,290
follows the same distribution.

136
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:26,860
Uh,

137
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:29,110
size of cities follows
the same distribution.

138
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,310
It's a weird,

139
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,190
it's a weird law and you,

140
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,760
you can think about it in part,

141
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,800
why does this happen?

142
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:38,380
While imagine what happens
when you play monopoly.

143
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,330
What happens?

144
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:42,250
Everybody has the same amount
of money to begin with,

145
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:43,533
right?

146
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:44,890
So then you start playing,

147
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:46,300
it's basically a random game.

148
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,510
While some people start to win a bit
and some people start to lose a bit.

149
00:04:49,511 --> 00:04:50,420
And then if you win,

150
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:53,440
the high probability that you'll
keep winning starts to increase.

151
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:54,520
And if you lose,

152
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,920
your vulnerability increases as you lose.

153
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,380
And then maybe you've got say
six people playing monopoly,

154
00:04:59,560 --> 00:04:59,861
soon.

155
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:01,060
One person has zero.

156
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,650
What happens when they have zero?

157
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,013
They're out of the game.

158
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,630
So zero's a weird number
because when you hit zero,

159
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,620
you're out of the game.

160
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,120
So,

161
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,230
so then if you keep playing,

162
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:12,910
people start to stack up at zero,

163
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,690
right?

164
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,040
What happens at the end of the game?

165
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,810
One person has all the property and all
the money and everyone else has none,

166
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,460
right?

167
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,250
That that's what happens if you play
an iterated trading game to its final

168
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,084
conclusion.

169
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,720
And that's part of the law in a
sense that's underlying this kind of

170
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,554
distribution.

171
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,221
So it's a,

172
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:31,060
it's really,

173
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,470
it's,

174
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:31,771
it's,

175
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:35,050
it's not a consequence necessarily
of structural inequality.

176
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,480
It's built into the system
at a deeper level than that.

177
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:38,021
So,

178
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:38,351
you know,

179
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:42,430
people talk about all the time about how
unfair it is that 1% of the population

180
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:46,780
has the vast amount of the money and
1% of the 1% has most of that money.

181
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,260
And 1% of the 1% of the
1% has most of that money.

182
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,513
But it is a,

183
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,623
it's a,

184
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:55,660
it's an inevitable conclusion
of iterated trading games.

185
00:05:55,661 --> 00:05:57,010
And we don't know how to fight.

186
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,030
We don't know how to take from the
people who have and move it to the bottom

187
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:04,190
without an instantly
moving back up to the top.

188
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,480
Different people maybe,

189
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,710
but still back up to the top
because even the 1% churns a lot.

190
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:12,710
Like I think you have a 10% chance,

191
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:13,640
if I remember correctly,

192
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:18,440
you have a 10% chance of being in the
top 1% for at least one year of your life

193
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,480
and a 40% chance of being in the top
10% for at least one year in your life.

194
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,000
That's in Canada and the U
S it's less so in Europe,

195
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,880
so there's a fair bit of
churning at the top end.

196
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:31,340
It's not the same people all
the time who have the money,

197
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,030
but it is a tiny fraction of the people
all the time who have all the money.

198
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,813
Yeah.

199
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,240
Do the people inside redistribute
to recreate the scene?

200
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:48,500
No.

201
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,333
Unusually.

202
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:50,961
I mean they do,

203
00:06:50,961 --> 00:06:52,070
but it's attenuated.

204
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:52,940
Okay.

205
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:57,940
Because the people mean if you reshuffled
the entire company and put everywhere

206
00:06:58,551 --> 00:06:59,151
somewhere else,

207
00:06:59,151 --> 00:07:02,090
there's some probability that some of
those people would rise to the top that

208
00:07:02,091 --> 00:07:03,200
weren't at the top before.

209
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:06,320
But in that company that that
isn't generally what happens.

210
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,900
People get stuck in their
niche and they don't move.

211
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,940
So yeah,

212
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:11,960
this is cool.

213
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:12,800
You wonder sometimes,

214
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:12,981
well,

215
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:14,540
how can companies die so quickly?

216
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,081
Well,

217
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:15,381
they go,

218
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,500
they go into a death spiral that's
almost impossible for them to get out of.

219
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:19,570
So,

220
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,061
and it happened.

221
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:21,530
It can happen extraordinarily quickly.

222
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:22,364
This is why,

223
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,611
you know,

224
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:25,370
the typical fortune 500
company only lasts 30 years.

225
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,293
That's it.

226
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,900
It's not that easy for these Bam Mos
to continue existence across time.

227
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:30,920
So,

228
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,080
and it's because it's really
easy for something to die.

229
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,210
It's very unlikely that it will be built.

230
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,020
It's very unlikely that it will
be successful and one successful.

231
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,290
It's very unlikely that it will continue
to duplicate it success because the

232
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,830
underlying landscape shifts on it
and it doesn't know where to go.

233
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:46,561
And that,

234
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:51,140
that's also partly because it's not that
easy to integrate creative people into

235
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:51,890
your company.

236
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,460
Right.

237
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:54,950
You certainly don't want them at the
bottom because they're supposed to be

238
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:56,630
people who are doing
what they're told to do.

239
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,320
So you filter out a lot of them at the
bottom and then you need them at the top.

240
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:01,670
But they've already been filtered out.

241
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:05,600
And also creative people are troublesome
to work with because they're always,

242
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,820
how do you evaluate a creative person?

243
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,930
You all,

244
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,370
you almost can't by definition because
they keep coming up with new things and

245
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,950
you don't have a good evaluative
strategy for a new thing.

246
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,070
It wouldn't be new if you had a
good evaluative strategy for it,

247
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:19,221
right?

248
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:22,250
It would have to be the member of a
class that you've already encountered

249
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,084
substantially.

250
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,310
So anyway,

251
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:28,130
so the take home lesson from this is zero,

252
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,290
right?

253
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:30,860
Right.

254
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,640
And then that's like,

255
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,790
that's like a graph of of money
and monetary distribution as well.

256
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,450
And the thing,

257
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,750
the problem with being at zero is
very difficult to get out of zero.

258
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,120
And this is also why people
get stuck in poverty.

259
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,660
You know,

260
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,160
you can't get a bank account if you're,

261
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:44,390
if you don't have any money,

262
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:45,253
right?

263
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:49,280
There's a bunch of things that start
to move against you when you're at zero

264
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,450
that you can't shake.

265
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,220
It's very difficult to get out of the.
