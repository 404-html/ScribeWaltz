1
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,360
Drives,

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:11,661
you know,

3
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:12,494
oh look,

4
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,080
Joe down the street just
became an internet millionaire.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,220
What about us?

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:16,761
Well,

7
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:17,001
yeah.

8
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:17,834
What about you?

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,730
Maybe you could be an
internet millionaire too.

10
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:21,861
So lots of,

11
00:00:21,861 --> 00:00:26,360
lots of great things
come out of crazy mania.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:26,870
I mean,

13
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,280
lots of horrible things do too,

14
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:30,380
but there's always a price,

15
00:00:30,381 --> 00:00:30,890
right?

16
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:33,080
The price of success is a lot of failure.

17
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,710
The price of success
is a lot of mediocrity.

18
00:00:36,711 --> 00:00:37,940
So look at a university,

19
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,560
almost all the research that
started the university's wrong.

20
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:43,250
It's mediocre and wrong.

21
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,720
Some of it isn't.

22
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:45,591
Well,

23
00:00:45,591 --> 00:00:46,130
you might say,

24
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:46,311
well,

25
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:47,580
we should increase the amount.

26
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,110
It's good.

27
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,381
It's like,

28
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,214
yeah,

29
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,353
no,

30
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,351
you probably,

31
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,250
you can probably,

32
00:00:52,251 --> 00:00:54,920
what you can do is
increase the total amount.

33
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:58,640
So the total amount of good increases,

34
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:03,020
but I don't think you can do much about
the ratio because most things require a

35
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,510
lot of ways to move forward a lot.

36
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,000
So in a corporation,

37
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:08,390
like you know,

38
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,620
the corporate people are always saying,

39
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:09,860
well,

40
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,570
look at the university's ivory tower.

41
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,800
That's all rubbish.

42
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,230
Because in my experience,

43
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,670
people in universities are way less risk
averse than the chemical person in a

44
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:20,361
corporation.

45
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:21,740
Like a middle manager,

46
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:22,880
that's a shape.

47
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:23,863
Generally,

48
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,441
you know,

49
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:26,180
there's no risk in that guy at all.

50
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:27,860
He doesn't want to stand out at all.

51
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,920
He doesn't want to have a new idea who'd
be associated with what he wants to

52
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:31,191
hide,

53
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,660
where none of the predators can find it.

54
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,640
But even in a corporation,

55
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:35,300
say,

56
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,320
forget about all that,

57
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:41,690
97% of the corporation's activity
is just to keep itself going.

58
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,560
3% 4% 5% is profit.

59
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,640
So gigantic things to move forward,

60
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,780
to produce waste and uselessness all over.

61
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:56,960
And you're lucky if you get
some cream floating to the top,

62
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,740
so maybe you have to live with that.

63
00:02:00,741 --> 00:02:01,574
That's,

64
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,480
that's how it is.
