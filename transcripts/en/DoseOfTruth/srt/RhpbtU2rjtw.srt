1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:09,610
And his brother and went to feed
their father's flock and shuck him.

2
00:00:09,611 --> 00:00:11,860
So they took off and
Israel said unto Joseph,

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,200
do you know what the I brethren feed
the flock and check them common,

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:16,260
I will send thee unto him.

5
00:00:16,261 --> 00:00:19,080
And he said he had and he said to him,

6
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:19,351
here,

7
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:20,184
up here on mine,

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,890
and when they saw him afar off,

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,540
even before he came near onto them,

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,610
they conspired against him to slay him.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,880
Rough people act then,

12
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:30,300
right?

13
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,080
This is,

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,480
this sort of thing is
happening quite frequently.

15
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,813
Um,

16
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:37,080
and they said to one another,

17
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:39,120
behold the dreamer cometh.

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,441
Come now,

19
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,000
therefore let us slay him,

20
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,770
cast him into some pit and we will say
some evil beast has devoured him and we

21
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,930
shall see what becomes of his dreams.

22
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,990
So there's an echo of the Kate
enables story there obviously.

23
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:52,824
You know what I mean?

24
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,780
It's not quite as clear because in the
Kate enables store able is clearly just

25
00:00:58,781 --> 00:00:59,614
doing well.

26
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,190
And here you can't quite get a
handle on Joseph's character.

27
00:01:03,191 --> 00:01:06,940
You can't tell if he is actually the
elect or if he's just a spoiled Brat with

28
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:08,140
delusions of grandeur.

29
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:08,820
You know,

30
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,653
and,

31
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,790
but it doesn't matter because his
brothers are so irritated at his,

32
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,920
the fact that he's favored and perhaps
even the fact that he might be someone

33
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,730
destined for,

34
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,080
for something special,

35
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,650
that they find it perfectly
reasonable to destroy that.

36
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,151
And it's so hard.

37
00:01:29,151 --> 00:01:34,151
It's so interesting how often that
motif of pulling down an ideal manifest

38
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:36,830
itself in these old stories,

39
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:37,440
right?

40
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:37,930
It's,

41
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:38,390
it's,

42
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,580
the pattern is established
in the Cain and Abel Story.

43
00:01:40,581 --> 00:01:42,410
It just repeats and repeats and repeats.

44
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:43,880
And I think that's dead true.

45
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:45,410
I think it just repeats all the time,

46
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,250
is that people are annoyed about
how tragic their lives are.

47
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,900
They're annoyed that they're subject
to malevolence and they're annoyed that

48
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:56,600
they're not doing as well
as other people are doing.

49
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,830
And that makes them,

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,140
that puts them exactly
into this state of mind.

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:00,711
Now,

52
00:02:00,711 --> 00:02:02,450
maybe with modern people,

53
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:06,080
if you're going to kill someone because
you're resentful as a modern person,

54
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,660
you don't generally slay them
and throw them into a pit.

55
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,440
You know,

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,590
what you do is you just killed
them slowly over a few decades.

57
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,350
And it isn't obvious to
me that that's any better.

58
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:20,830
So I've seen plenty of married
couples who were in that situation.

59
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,243
It's like,

60
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,173
it's like,

61
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:24,620
Whoa,

62
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:24,920
there,

63
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,030
this Mitch Hedberg,

64
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:28,130
he used to complain
about turtleneck phase.

65
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,070
It was like being strangled
by a really weak midget,

66
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,503
and

67
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,750
it's probably really
politically incorrect joke,

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,090
but it's a funny joke.

69
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,433
So,

70
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,553
uh,

71
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:42,410
and then you see,

72
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,230
you see relationships that are like that.

73
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,620
It's like each person has their hands
around the neck of the other person,

74
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:52,100
but they don't have enough
courage to actually to squeeze it.

75
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:56,150
Just put enough pressure on to s
cut the circulation off a tiny bit.

76
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,440
So the person just gets like
a die over 30 year period.

77
00:03:00,441 --> 00:03:01,610
Something like that.
