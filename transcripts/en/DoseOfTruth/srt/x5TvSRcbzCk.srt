1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,120
How effectively is the
Chicago statement on,

2
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,350
on how effectively is the Chicago
statement being disseminated?

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,930
How rapidly our
universities signing up or,

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:17,620
or,

5
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:18,400
um,

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,100
you signed on early in this whole crisis,

7
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,950
uh,

8
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:22,430
uh,

9
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,263
Purdue,

10
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:24,370
they're about 10 or 15 that have,

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,260
that have endorsed it
or something like it.

12
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:27,040
Uh,

13
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,720
it's not enough to just endorse something,

14
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:33,750
but if you have leadership that is
committed to creating an open platform in

15
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:35,320
which people can disagree.

16
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,020
Um,

17
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:36,330
and,

18
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,030
and um,

19
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:37,450
one tense,

20
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:38,283
very encouraging.

21
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,650
I've been invited by number of
university presidents to come speak.

22
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,460
We have all kinds of innovations
to heterodox academy to
foster a more inclusive

23
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:51,310
climate in which people can
actually engage with difference.

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,720
There's a lot of interests.

25
00:00:52,721 --> 00:00:56,620
So I think the university
leaders were very slow to react.

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,320
They didn't want to alienate
certain factions of students,

27
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,350
but they're almost all these noble people,

28
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,180
they're almost all liberal left,

29
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,703
not a liberal.

30
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:07,450
They're horrified by what's going on.

31
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:09,460
They know they're sitting
a top of a powder keg.

32
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,450
They don't want things to blow up in
their face has happened at Evergreen.

33
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,360
So this brings us to our,

34
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:15,670
our,

35
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:16,030
our,

36
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,721
another product.

37
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:18,130
The one that we're most excited by.

38
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,650
Uh,

39
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:20,110
so we just went online,

40
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:20,351
uh,

41
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:20,890
actually,

42
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:21,190
uh,

43
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:22,023
today,

44
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,211
uh,

45
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:24,430
it's called the open mind platform.

46
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:27,770
If you go to open mind a platform.org,

47
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:31,090
you can find we've developed an APP.

48
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,390
We have a whole library
of readings and videos.

49
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,760
We do have an APP that guides you through.

50
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,030
We don't just say here's how to
engage with different viewpoints.

51
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,290
We start by saying,

52
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,800
why is it good and we make
the case that you need this.

53
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,850
Everybody needs this.

54
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,193
And to,

55
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,303
um,

56
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,180
we remind people that we're all
basically self righteous hypocrites.

57
00:01:52,181 --> 00:01:55,870
We have quotes from wisdom traditions
around the world and we've all heard this.

58
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,070
So just a little bit of,

59
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:57,581
you know,

60
00:01:57,581 --> 00:01:59,380
you can call it emotional
manipulation if you like,

61
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:03,550
but just get people into a mindset
in which they're willing to say,

62
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,413
oh yeah,

63
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,800
whoa.

64
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,350
You know,

65
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:05,801
calm down.

66
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:06,580
We're all,

67
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,413
we're all uh,

68
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:08,830
and too self righteous here.

69
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:09,800
And then we,

70
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,140
then we teach them some psychology,

71
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,980
um,

72
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,150
about motivated reasoning.

73
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,450
And only then do we teach them to engage
with views that are not their own.

74
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,530
So we've already run this
in about 15 or 20 classes.

75
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:20,950
Um,

76
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,350
the results so far look
promising that at the end of it,

77
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,840
the measures showed that students
are more open to other ideas.

78
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,170
So the open mind platform we think is a
tool that we think a lot of universities

79
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:32,340
are going to adopt their,

80
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:33,430
there's a lot of interest in it.

81
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,950
And if there's leadership,

82
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:40,330
if the professors generally do support
viewpoint diversity and open inquiry,

83
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:44,350
if we change freshman orientation so
that students are trained first and

84
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:47,320
foremost in how to step back,

85
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,970
give people the benefit of the doubt,

86
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,770
be open minded.

87
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,250
If we do that first,

88
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:51,790
you know,

89
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,960
that's like behavioral,

90
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,410
um,

91
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,790
exposure to some degree,

92
00:02:54,791 --> 00:02:55,061
right?

93
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:57,100
The idea would be that if you're,

94
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:02,101
if you're afraid or by something that you
don't understand the appropriate first

95
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,071
treatment,

96
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:03,641
first of all,

97
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:05,680
the treatment is necessary
because otherwise the old,

98
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,350
you'll isolate yourself in the
ways that you already described.

99
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,221
And second,

100
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,690
that brief exposure,

101
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,510
voluntary exposure is going
to be the best curative.

102
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,750
Now it's the opposite of the safe space
idea is that you need to be protected.

103
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,371
Safe space.

104
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:21,580
The safe space idea is the worst thing
you could possibly do for the very people

105
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:21,960
you're trying.

106
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,540
Exactly,

107
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,140
exactly.

108
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,861
I mean the psychology,

109
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:24,694
what you know,

110
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,690
the psychology behind safe spaces and
microaggressions is just the exact

111
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,950
opposite of what we should be doing.

112
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,690
If we want to create kids,

113
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,430
especially black kids,

114
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,264
gay kids,

115
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,410
we made whatever.

116
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:38,440
If you think that they are
vulnerable to more stigma,

117
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,490
more conflict,

118
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,990
if you think that they are vulnerable,

119
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:46,050
that's especially when a safe
space will be temporarily pleasant,

120
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,480
but in the long run bad course.

121
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:47,761
Right.

122
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:51,670
And that's the critical issue too with
regards to safe spaces is that they're

123
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:55,810
sacrificing the medium and longterm
of the students' wellbeing,

124
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,730
let's say to the short term,

125
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:00,120
lack of fear and conflict there.

126
00:04:00,121 --> 00:04:01,630
Infant dialyzing them essentially.

127
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,010
So yeah.

128
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,850
Okay.

129
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,930
So all right,

130
00:04:04,931 --> 00:04:05,820
so are,

131
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,390
I was thinking about the,

132
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,560
the discussion idea.

133
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:13,000
I've got a personality test online now
that's based on this big five aspect

134
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,301
scale.

135
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,150
But it might be interesting
as something for,

136
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,330
for us to think about too,

137
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,080
to find people who are high in openness
and low in conscientiousness or

138
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:24,850
orderliness and offer them the opportunity
to engage in dialogue with people who

139
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,650
have the opposite personality traits,

140
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,311
you know,

141
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:28,144
because,

142
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,541
well,

143
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:28,991
first of all,

144
00:04:28,991 --> 00:04:31,210
because they're going to run
into people like that always,

145
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,030
right?

146
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,490
And,

147
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:32,760
and,

148
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,550
and maybe even establish a
relationship with them inadvertently.

149
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,960
And so being able to tolerate that might
give them the kind of insight that you

150
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:45,790
said you developed when you realize that
the conservative ethos was based on a

151
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,100
reasonable but not complete set of,

152
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,670
of,

153
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:51,730
of beneficial axiomatic presuppositions.

154
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:52,570
So.
