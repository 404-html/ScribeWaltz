1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,010
And I was thinking about
this this week too,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,790
cause I was thinking about Noah's Ark
and there was a phrase in that story that

3
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:06,630
I didn't understand,

4
00:00:06,631 --> 00:00:09,150
which was that Noah was
perfect in his generations.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:09,841
I thought,

6
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:10,860
I don't know what that means.

7
00:00:10,861 --> 00:00:11,910
And you know when you're,

8
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,740
when you're going through
a book like the Bible,

9
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:16,590
if you don't understand a phrase that
actually means you've missed something,

10
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,540
it doesn't mean that that's just not,

11
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,280
that's not Germane to the story.

12
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,300
It means you're stupid.

13
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,351
You didn't get it,

14
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:22,860
man.

15
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,611
You didn't get it.

16
00:00:23,611 --> 00:00:24,720
You didn't understand it.

17
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,063
And so

18
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,530
the idea that Noah was perfect in his
generations and that's why he could build

19
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:36,531
an arc that would sustain him and him
and humanity itself through the flood.

20
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:37,770
It meant that he,

21
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,420
not only did he walk with God,

22
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:42,180
which is something that we talked about
in the context of the sermon on the

23
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:42,660
mount,

24
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:43,021
but the,

25
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:45,450
he established proper
relationships with his family,

26
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:46,680
with his children.

27
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,540
And so what that meant was that his,

28
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,240
not only was he well
integrated as a person,

29
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:54,750
but his level of integration had reached
the point where it stretched out beyond

30
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,340
him and encompassed his family.

31
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:59,430
And so it was Noah and the
family that was in the arc.

32
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:00,390
And I can tell you,

33
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:04,140
and I really understood this this year
because I had a very tumultuous year,

34
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,330
you could think about it
from a personal perspective.

35
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:09,150
I could think about it as a year
that had no shortage of floods.

36
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:09,900
And,

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,560
and part of the reason that
I was able to get through it,

38
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,330
I also had terrible health problems.

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,193
And the only,

40
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,950
one of the reasons I was able to get
through it was because my family really

41
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,120
came together around me,

42
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:21,571
my kids,

43
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:22,051
my wife,

44
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:24,660
my parents and my friends as well,

45
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,440
particularly a certain group of friends.

46
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:32,710
And that's partly all of that came
together in my mind this week.

47
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,031
And I thought,

48
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:33,151
oh,

49
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:37,270
that's what it means to be perfect in
his generations meant that he hadn't just

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,400
straightened himself out.

51
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,930
He'd also straightened out to his
relationships with his family.

52
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,620
And I can tell you that when
crisis strikes you wish it will,

53
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,663
it will.

54
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,720
The flood will come.

55
00:01:48,721 --> 00:01:48,931
Right.

56
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,880
That's why the apocalypse
is always upon us.

57
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,680
The flood will definitely
come in your life.

58
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,810
And to the degree that you've organized
yourself psychologically and also healed

59
00:01:57,811 --> 00:02:00,240
the relationships between
you and your family,

60
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,870
that could be the critical element that
that determines whether you live or die

61
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:04,920
when a crisis comes or,

62
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,050
or whether it's someone in
your family lives or dies.

63
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:12,000
And so the idea of the arc containing the
man who's who walks with God and whose

64
00:02:12,001 --> 00:02:15,810
generations are perfect and that that's
what sustains humanity through the

65
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:16,351
crisis.

66
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,680
It's like you couldn't be more
psychologically accurate than that.

67
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,531
You know?

68
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:22,320
And the other thing I was
thinking about this week,

69
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:23,154
I,

70
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,220
I was thinking about another
line in the new testament.

71
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,930
I think it's from the sermon on the mount,

72
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:29,400
but I'm not absolutely sure.

73
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:34,320
Christ compares the Kingdom
of Heaven to a mustard seed.

74
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,730
And so I was thinking about it.

75
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,780
Mustard seed is a very tiny seed and it
grows into quite a spectacular complex

76
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:40,614
plant.

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,450
And I was thinking about how you should
operate in the world in order to make it

78
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,171
a better place,

79
00:02:46,171 --> 00:02:49,560
assuming that that's what you should
be doing and that is what you should be

80
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:49,861
doing.

81
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:53,040
And there there's lots
in the world to fix.

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,450
Everything that bothers you about the
world and about yourself should be fixed

83
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:58,680
and you can do that.

84
00:02:58,681 --> 00:03:01,570
And my dawning realization,

85
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,710
I have a friend,

86
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,631
he lives in Montreal,

87
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,950
his name is James Simon.

88
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,010
He's a great painter and he's
taught me a lot of things help.

89
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,170
He's helped me design my
house and beautify it.

90
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,830
And I bought some paintings
from him a couple of years ago.

91
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,970
Um,

92
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,630
and he did this series of paintings
where he went around North America and,

93
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,650
and stood in different places and then
he painted the view from here down.

94
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,320
And so it's his feet planted in
different places on roads in the desert,

95
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,154
on the ocean.

96
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,230
I have one actually
hanging over my toilet,

97
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:33,850
which is him standing at a urinal.

98
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,113
Um,

99
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:35,890
yeah.

100
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,101
Well,

101
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:36,341
you know,

102
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,540
he was trying to make a point.

103
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,880
And the point was that wherever you are,

104
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:41,170
it's worth paying attention.

105
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:42,400
And that's cause you know,

106
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,140
so all these places that he visited,

107
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,920
he looked at exactly where he was
standing by the side of the road in the

108
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,610
desert,

109
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,230
sort of mundane in some sense.

110
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,080
But then maybe he put 40
hours into that painting,

111
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:53,291
you know,

112
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,041
and it's very,

113
00:03:54,041 --> 00:03:56,110
very realistic painting
with really good light.

114
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:00,640
And what he's telling you as a painter
is everything is worth paying attention

115
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,260
to an infinite amount,

116
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,590
but you don't have enough time.

117
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:05,290
And so the artists does that for you,

118
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:05,501
right?

119
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:09,250
The artist looks and looks and looks and
looks and looks and then gives you that

120
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:09,671
vision.

121
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:12,160
And so then you can look at the
painting and it reminds you that,

122
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,220
right where you are is there's every,

123
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,530
everything that there is
is right where you are.

124
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,030
And that's a hard thing to realize,

125
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:20,170
but it's actually true.

126
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,000
And so I've,

127
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,870
I've been telling people online in various
ways and in lectures that they should

128
00:04:25,871 --> 00:04:28,900
start fixing up the world
by cleaning up the room.

129
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:32,200
And I wanted to just elaborate on that
a little bit before I get back to the

130
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:34,030
lecture itself.

131
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,080
So I'd say it's become this
Internet weird Internet meme,

132
00:04:38,081 --> 00:04:38,760
you know?

133
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,593
Uh,

134
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,800
and,

135
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,633
and,

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,010
and,

137
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:43,180
and it's a joke and good,

138
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,014
it's a joke.

139
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:48,010
I really happy about the fact that so
much of this has got like the leaving of

140
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:51,310
humor and it's really important
because that's what stops things from

141
00:04:51,311 --> 00:04:54,250
degenerating into and to conflict humor.

142
00:04:54,251 --> 00:04:58,330
And I was thinking about this idea of
cleaning up your room in relationship to

143
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,410
the mustard seed idea.

144
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:02,020
And you see the thing about
cleaning up your room,

145
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:06,250
this is also something I learned from
Carl Young and his studies on alchemy

146
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,960
because for young,

147
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,620
when the alchemist was attempting to make
the philosopher's stone and he was not

148
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:14,200
only engaged in the transformation
of the material world,

149
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:19,201
but he was engaged in a process of self
transformation that occurred at the same

150
00:05:19,241 --> 00:05:19,961
time as the,

151
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:20,950
as the chemical trend,

152
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,630
as the chemical transformation.

153
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,640
So it was a psychological
work in some sense.

154
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,660
Let's say you want to sort out your room
and beautified cause the beauty is also

155
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,320
important.

156
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,390
And let's say that all you
have is just a little room.

157
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,230
Like you're not rich,

158
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,130
you're poor.

159
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,690
And you don't have any power,

160
00:05:34,691 --> 00:05:35,381
that's another thing,

161
00:05:35,381 --> 00:05:38,770
but you've got your damn room and you've
got this space right in front of you.

162
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:43,060
You know that that's a part of the cosmos
that you can come to grips with and

163
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:44,051
you might think,

164
00:05:44,051 --> 00:05:44,201
well,

165
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,330
what's there in front of
you right in front of you?

166
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,530
And the answer to that is,

167
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:51,580
it depends on how open your eyes are
that that's the proper answer because you

168
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,250
could say,

169
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,890
w William Blake said this,

170
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:54,730
for example,

171
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:58,850
eldest Huxley made comments that were
very similar in a transcendent state.

172
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,580
You can see infinity in the
finite and you might say,

173
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:01,731
well,

174
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,510
you can say,

175
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,690
you can see infinity in what
you have within your grasp.

176
00:06:05,691 --> 00:06:06,870
If you look and you could say,

177
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:11,270
maybe that's the case with your room
and so you want to clean up your room.

178
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:11,990
Well,

179
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:12,560
okay,

180
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,341
how do you do that?

181
00:06:13,341 --> 00:06:14,174
Exactly?

182
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:14,721
Well,

183
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,060
the room is a room as a place to sleep.

184
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:19,640
And so if you set your room up properly,

185
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:22,790
then you figure out how to sleep and
when you should sleep and how you should

186
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:23,121
sleep.

187
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:25,130
And then you figure it out
when you should wake up.

188
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:25,880
And then you figure out,

189
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,021
well,

190
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:28,790
what clothes you should wear because
they have to be arranged properly in your

191
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:29,151
dresser.

192
00:06:29,151 --> 00:06:30,990
And then you have to have some
place to put your clothes.

193
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,150
And if you're going to have some clothes,

194
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:34,430
you have to figure out what you're
gonna wear those clothes to do,

195
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,540
right?

196
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,300
And then that means you got to figure
out what you're going to do and then your

197
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:41,810
room has to serve that purpose because
otherwise it doesn't set up properly.

198
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,670
And if it doesn't set up,

199
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,830
if it doesn't serve your purposes,

200
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,560
you will be unhappy and
not happy in the room.

201
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Because the way that we perceive the world
is as a place to move from point a to

202
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:55,160
point B in.

203
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,510
And then if the place that we're
in facilitates that movement,

204
00:06:59,511 --> 00:07:00,710
then we're happy to be there.

205
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:04,820
And if the place that we're in serves
as an obstacle to that movement,

206
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:06,560
then we're unhappy to be there.

207
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:10,250
And so what it means to set up your room
is that you have to have somewhere to

208
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,850
go that's worthwhile or you can't set up
your room and then your room has to be

209
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,380
set up to facilitate that.

210
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,150
And then the next thing is,

211
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:18,920
well maybe you have to make it beautiful,

212
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,030
but that's not easy,

213
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:20,241
right?

214
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,950
That means you have to have some taste.

215
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,720
And that doesn't mean
you have to have money.

216
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,550
It doesn't because you can be garish
with money and you can be tasteful with

217
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,384
nothing.

218
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:33,470
All you need is taste and taste beats
money when it comes to beautifying things,

219
00:07:33,471 --> 00:07:33,711
you know,

220
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:35,930
I mean not that money is
trivial because it's not,

221
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:40,490
the taste is crucial and people who
are very artistically oriented can make

222
00:07:40,491 --> 00:07:42,320
beautiful things out of virtually nothing.

223
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,311
And not only that,

224
00:07:43,311 --> 00:07:46,460
the literature suggests that if
you're going to make beautiful things,

225
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,380
putting real constraints on,

226
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,910
on what you allow yourself to do,

227
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,940
facilitates creativity instead
of interfering with it.

228
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,970
Because let's say you have to
make something out of nothing,

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,630
right?

230
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,550
Which I suppose would be a Godly Act,

231
00:07:58,551 --> 00:07:59,300
right?

232
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,390
You have to make something out of nothing
and you have to be creative in order

233
00:08:02,391 --> 00:08:03,224
to do that.

234
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:03,970
And so then to,

235
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:08,720
to beautify your room means that you
also have to develop your capacity to be

236
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,160
creative and so then you
can make your room shine,

237
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,310
but then what will happen is that
if your family isn't together,

238
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,600
they will interfere with that.

239
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,840
You'll interfere with that because
you won't have the discipline to do it

240
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:21,261
properly.

241
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:23,150
But then when you start building this,

242
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:23,780
this,

243
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,700
this little microcosm of perfection
with what you have at hand,

244
00:08:27,701 --> 00:08:31,430
and it'll evoke all the pathologies
of everyone in your household,

245
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:34,400
the wonder what the hell you're up to
in there and they won't necessarily be

246
00:08:34,401 --> 00:08:36,170
happy because if you're,

247
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,910
if they're in a lowly place,

248
00:08:37,911 --> 00:08:38,391
let's say,

249
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:38,991
and so are you,

250
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:40,400
and you're trying to move out of that,

251
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,443
then the,

252
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,890
the higher you move out of that,

253
00:08:42,891 --> 00:08:45,110
the more the place they're in looks bad.

254
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,101
And you might say,

255
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:46,221
well,

256
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:49,700
what they should do is celebrate
your victory over chaos and evil.

257
00:08:49,701 --> 00:08:50,960
But that isn't what will happen.

258
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,170
What will happen instead is that they
will attempt to pull you back down.

259
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,410
They'll attempt to,

260
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,110
and I mean obviously all
families still do that,

261
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:58,560
but,

262
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,560
but all families do that to some degree
and some families do almost nothing but

263
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,380
that.

264
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,860
And so what that means is that if
you're going to organize your room,

265
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:10,920
then you're going to have to
confront the devils in your house.

266
00:09:10,921 --> 00:09:12,030
And that's often,

267
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,440
that's often a terrifying thing because
some of those devils have have lineages

268
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:17,520
that go back many,

269
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:17,881
many,

270
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:19,110
many generations.

271
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,520
And God only knows what you
have to struggle with in
order to overcome that and

272
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:23,950
so on.

273
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:28,950
And so to sort yourself out into fix
up your room is a non trivial matter,

274
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:29,680
you know,

275
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,590
and you can do that.

276
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,090
You'll learn by doing that.

277
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:36,000
And then maybe you'll learn enough by
doing that so that you can fix up your

278
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:36,900
family a little bit.

279
00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:38,430
And then having done that,

280
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:41,940
you'll have enough characters so that
when you try to operate in the world at

281
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:42,481
your job,

282
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:44,880
or maybe in the broader social spheres,

283
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:48,270
that you'll be a force for good instead
of harm because you'll have learned some

284
00:09:48,271 --> 00:09:52,890
humility by noticing just how difficult
it was to put your damn room together

285
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,870
well and yourself for that matter.

286
00:09:54,871 --> 00:09:59,340
And so you'll proceed cautiously
with your eyes open towards the good.
