1
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,770
You have to ask why it is that you would
if you were a postmodernist yourself,

2
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:15,920
why it is that you would privilege
the idea of power above all else.

3
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,710
It's exactly what is it that
you're pushing to the margin,

4
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:21,740
and so that's something that
we're going to talk about.

5
00:00:21,741 --> 00:00:22,280
Now,

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,110
here's one thing you
might push to the margin.

7
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:29,111
Let's say that you believe that
hierarchies are a consequence of power.

8
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,050
Well then you push competence to the
margin and then applying the postmodern

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,720
mark modernist logic.

10
00:00:35,721 --> 00:00:36,410
You might say,

11
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:36,591
well,

12
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:40,490
the reason you're privileging power is
so that you can produce so that you could

13
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:42,080
push competence to the margin,

14
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,380
and so you want to keep that in mind too,

15
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,000
because that's going to become important.

16
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:50,180
As we discussed the relationship
between postmodernism and Marxism,

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,930
maybe you're after the destruction
of the idea of competence itself.
