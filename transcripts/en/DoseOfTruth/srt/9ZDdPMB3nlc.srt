1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:11,520
So that what we see here is an echo
in some sense of what happens in the

2
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:13,080
Mesopotamian creation story.

3
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:13,914
When [inaudible]

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,410
in the Mesopotamian creation story,

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:21,050
there's the dragon of chaos
tie amat and her consort.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,283
Um,

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,093
absolutely

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,120
freshwater and saltwater respectively
in they're mingled together.

9
00:00:29,121 --> 00:00:29,954
And,

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,780
and that combination of chaos and order
gives rise to the first assembly of the

11
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:35,680
ancient gods.

12
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:40,681
And then the ancient gods
kill Appsu casually and
foolishly and enrage tie a mat

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,340
with their foolishness and ignorance.

14
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:47,230
And she comes back with a vengeance

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,400
in the meantime.

16
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,390
And then she produces this huge army of
monsters and puts Kingu the worst of the

17
00:00:54,391 --> 00:00:57,600
monsters out its head and the decide
she's going to take out her creation.

18
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:03,100
And so that's a little warning from 3000
years ago about foolishly undermining

19
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,830
your tradition.

20
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:08,090
So anyways,

21
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,660
the gods in their friends,

22
00:01:09,661 --> 00:01:11,580
they go out and try to
fight against tie mountain.

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,850
They come back with their tails
between their legs continually,

24
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:17,940
but then a new God appears on
the scene and that's Marduk.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,510
And he's got eyes all the way around his
head and he can speak words of magic.

26
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:27,970
And they know that there's
something new about this newest God.

27
00:01:27,971 --> 00:01:31,450
It's his capacity for vision in
this capacity for articulate speech.

28
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:32,471
And so they say,

29
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:32,591
well,

30
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:35,620
why don't you go out and
try to deal with the chaos?

31
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,030
And Martech says,

32
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:37,331
yeah,

33
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:37,691
okay,

34
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:38,231
no problem,

35
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:39,160
but here's the deal.

36
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,870
You elect me talk God,

37
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,810
and now I determine the
destiny of the world.

38
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:47,040
And so they're desperate because like ty,

39
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:48,130
Matt is coming to get them.

40
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:50,710
That's chaos with the worst
of all possible monsters.

41
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:52,930
They're probably thinking
he's not going to win anyways.

42
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,760
And so they agree and out he
goes and he confronts timeout,

43
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:02,110
who's the goddess of chaos and he cuts
her into pieces and he makes the world

44
00:02:02,111 --> 00:02:03,280
out of her pieces.

45
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,540
And one of his names is he who makes
ingenious things out of the combat with

46
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,583
tire math,

47
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:09,940
which is so interesting.

48
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,380
That's such a remarkable,

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,000
that's a remarkable bit of nomenclature.

50
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:17,340
So who's should be at the pinnacle?

51
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,650
Okay?

52
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,850
The forest that sees and speaks and
goes out to confront chaos voluntarily.

53
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,190
You know how many years it
took people to figure that out.

54
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,020
That's like the pinnacle
discovery of humanity.

55
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,920
That's what that is.

56
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,090
And it's echoed here.

57
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:32,811
You know,

58
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:34,310
you see Simeon and Levi,

59
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,210
they're too angry.

60
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,661
The other brothers,

61
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:41,310
they all have flaws and faults of various
sorts and so they're not elevated to

62
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,210
the highest place.

63
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,231
But Joseph,

64
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:46,260
because he has his coat of many colors
and because he lands on his feet,

65
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:47,340
no matter where he goes,

66
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:52,341
and because he's not resentful and
bitter and malevolent and genocidal and,

67
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,800
and he's not shaking his fist at the
sky or yelling at God because of Trump.

68
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,190
Let's say Dan,

69
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,000
he's the,

70
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,050
he's the right,

71
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,560
he's the right representative
of the 12 tribes.

72
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,540
And so that's brilliant.

73
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:08,680
It's a brilliant story.

74
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,330
All these are the 12 tribes
of Israel and this is it.

75
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:15,220
That their farther spake
unto them and blessed them.

76
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:16,690
Everyone according to his blessing,

77
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:17,524
he blessed them

78
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,490
when Jake had been made an
end of commanding his son.

79
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,890
So it's the last thing he does to state.

80
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,560
He knows that these are
the 12 tribes that will

81
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,250
progress into the future of this
people and now he's trying it.

82
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,870
The last thing he does is to try to
hierarchically organize their relative

83
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:41,680
virtues as an indication
of what has been learned.

84
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,190
And when Jacob has made an
end of commanding his sons,

85
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,640
he gathered up his feet into the bed and
yielded up the ghost and was gathered

86
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:49,474
unto his people.

87
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,020
And Joseph fell upon his father's
face and wept upon him and kissed him.

88
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,610
And Joseph commanded his servants to the
physicians to embalm his father and the

89
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:59,020
physicians embalmed Israel.

90
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,380
And when the days of
his morning we're past,

91
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:04,510
Joseph's spake unto the
house of Pharaoh saying,

92
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,690
if now I have found grace in your eyes,

93
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:08,441
speak,

94
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:10,510
I pray you in the ears of Pharaoh saying,

95
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,910
my father made me swear a saying low.

96
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:14,080
I die in my grave,

97
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,060
which I have digged for
me in the land of Canaan,

98
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,051
their shelter,

99
00:04:17,051 --> 00:04:18,310
I'll bury me now.

100
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,390
Therefore let me go up.

101
00:04:19,391 --> 00:04:21,760
I pray thee and bury my
father and I will come again.

102
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,931
And Pharaoh said,

103
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:24,280
go up and burry thy father.

104
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,810
According as he made the swear for her,

105
00:04:27,811 --> 00:04:31,150
son's carried him into the land of Canaan
and bury them in the cave of the field

106
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:32,050
of Mac,

107
00:04:32,051 --> 00:04:32,500
Pella,

108
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,970
which Abraham bought with the
field for a possession of the,

109
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:39,970
of burying place of effort on the Hittite
before mammary and Joseph returned

110
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:40,601
into Egypt,

111
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:45,601
he and his brother and all that went up
to him and that all and all that went up

112
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:48,030
with him to bury his
father after he is brewed,

113
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,540
after he had buried his father.

114
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:53,440
And when Joseph's brethren saw
that their father was dead,

115
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,693
they said,

116
00:04:55,330 --> 00:05:00,330
Joseph will now hate us and
we'll certainly pay back
to us all the evil which we

117
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:01,714
did unto him.

118
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,400
And they sent a messenger saying they
father did command before he died,

119
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:09,250
saying four shall ye say unto Joseph,

120
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:09,761
forgive.

121
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:13,690
I pray thee now the trespass of thy
Brethren and their sin pretty sniffily,

122
00:05:13,691 --> 00:05:14,524
really,

123
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,970
for they did unto thee evil.

124
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:16,900
And now we pray thee.

125
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:20,740
Forgive the trespass of the
servants of the God of thy Father.

126
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,840
And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.

127
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,930
And his brethren also went
and fell down before his face.

128
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:26,441
And they said,

129
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:26,921
behold,

130
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:28,030
we be thy servants.

131
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:31,000
And Joseph said unto them,

132
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:34,510
fear not for am I in the place of God,

133
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,351
but as for you,

134
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,820
you thought evil against me.

135
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,010
But God meant it unto good to bring,

136
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:39,844
to pass,

137
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,020
as it is this day,

138
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,790
to save much people alive

139
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:46,601
now,

140
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:46,961
therefore,

141
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:47,621
fear you not,

142
00:05:47,621 --> 00:05:49,060
I will nourish you and your little ones.

143
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:51,130
And he comforted them and
spake kindly unto them.

144
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,053
So the,

145
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,100
the idea there is that

146
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,020
there is no evil,

147
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:08,550
so evil that good cannot triumph over it.

148
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,950
And Joseph dwelt in Egypt.

149
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:13,970
He and his father's house,

150
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,740
and Joseph lived 110 years,

151
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:18,770
and Joseph saw frms children
of the third generation,

152
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,570
the children also of Makir,

153
00:06:20,571 --> 00:06:23,510
the son of Manhasset were
brought up upon Joseph's knees.

154
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,360
And Joseph said unto his brethren,

155
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,673
I die,

156
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,640
and God will surely visit you and bring
you out of this land unto the land where

157
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:32,720
he swear to Abraham,

158
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:33,261
to Isaac,

159
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:37,160
and Jacob and Joseph took an oath
of the children of Israel saying,

160
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:38,970
God will surely visit you and she'll end.

161
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:41,030
You shall carry my bones from hence.

162
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,060
So Joseph died being a 110 years old,

163
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,450
and they embalmed him and he
was put into a coffin in Egypt.

164
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,280
And that's genesis.
