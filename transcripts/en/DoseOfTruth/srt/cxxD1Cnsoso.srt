1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:07,550
Anyways,

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:12,550
Jacobs smart enough to get out there and
which is also not really a testament to

4
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:14,450
his integrity.

5
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:15,140
Right?

6
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,610
I mean he's done these terrible things
at the behest of his mother because he

7
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:23,660
wants power and he wants to
get it without deserving it.

8
00:00:23,661 --> 00:00:28,340
And then he finally goes too far and
he hightails it out of there to his,

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,050
to another family member,

10
00:00:30,051 --> 00:00:31,970
to his mother's brother.

11
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:33,163
And so

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:38,030
it's not exactly the
world's most heroic story,

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,893
that's for sure.

14
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,030
And so now there's an interlude here,

15
00:00:41,031 --> 00:00:42,770
and this is a really
interesting interlude.

16
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:43,710
It's,

17
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,230
it's the story of Jacob's ladder.

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,830
So he's off to visit La
band or lab and who's,

19
00:00:48,831 --> 00:00:49,460
uh,

20
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:49,880
his,

21
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:52,610
his mother's brother and on the way he,

22
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,440
he,

23
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,130
he has a sleep and he lighted upon a
certain place and tarried there all night

24
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,790
because the sun was sad and he took of
the stones of that place and put them for

25
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:02,624
his pillows,

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,040
which seems to indicate
very bad planning on,

27
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,760
on his part and,

28
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,510
and lay down in that place to sleep.

29
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:11,750
And he dreamed and behold a
ladder set up on the earth.

30
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:15,530
And the top of it reached to heaven and
beheld the angels of God ascending and

31
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:16,364
descending on it.

32
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,590
And behold the lord
stood above it and said,

33
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,000
I am the Lord God of Abraham,

34
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:22,130
thy father and the god of Isaac,

35
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:26,240
the land we're on Belle liased to
the I will give it and to thy seed.

36
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:32,710
And so this story of Jacob's ladder has
really possessed the imagination of the

37
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:33,620
West.

38
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:34,940
And there's a reason for that.

39
00:01:34,941 --> 00:01:38,780
It's because it's an archetypal story
because the idea of a ladder that reaches

40
00:01:38,781 --> 00:01:41,360
to heaven is one of the
oldest ideas of mankind.

41
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,660
So you'll find it widely distributed
among the shamanic cultures,

42
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:45,470
for example.

43
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,930
And it's a hallmark of
psychedelic experience.

44
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:49,370
That's another way of thinking about it,

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,870
which is a very peculiar thing.

46
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:53,240
So there's one representation of,

47
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,590
of the ladder you see
got up at the top there.

48
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm peeking out from the clouds.

49
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,100
Now you know that sort of where we get
the idea that God is in heaven and the

50
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:05,180
heavens up in the sky.

51
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,020
And,

52
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,570
and that's an easy story to
make fun of because you know,

53
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,530
we've gotten up to the moon
and there is no god there and,

54
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:13,190
and,

55
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:13,520
but,

56
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,240
but this,

57
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,240
this is not a reasonable way of
conceptualizing what these experiences are

58
00:02:19,851 --> 00:02:20,684
about,

59
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,980
these experiences,

60
00:02:21,981 --> 00:02:26,981
what this is the opening up there that's
more like an opening into an alternate

61
00:02:26,991 --> 00:02:27,620
dimension.

62
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,930
That's a better way of thinking about it.

63
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,230
It's beyond like from,

64
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,850
from the Judeo Christian perspective,

65
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:35,090
one of the things you have to understand
is that God is beyond space and time.

66
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,800
He's not in the universe,

67
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,080
he's outside the universe in some manner.

68
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,260
And so the idea that that you have an
experience of God and it's op isn't the

69
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:49,261
APP is the best that the human imagination
can do with what's essentially a form

70
00:02:49,581 --> 00:02:54,260
of extra dimensional experience or
that's the best way to conceptualize it.

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,150
And these experiences aren't rare.

72
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,421
You know,

73
00:02:56,421 --> 00:02:56,800
they,

74
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,633
they make the,

75
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,820
they make up the core of,

76
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,190
of the shamanic tradition.

77
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:03,490
And so there's an intrusion of
the ancient shamanic tradition,

78
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,960
which is tens of thousands of years old
into the biblical stories at this point.

79
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:13,140
Now why Jacob had a essentially shamonic
experience is very difficult to tell

80
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,090
because we don't know what
these old people we're up to.

81
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,390
Right,

82
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:19,900
and we don't know how much
of the Archaic Tradition,

83
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,531
archaic,

84
00:03:20,531 --> 00:03:24,640
religious tradition was still extent
at that at that point in time,

85
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:29,641
but we certainly do know that our
ancient forebears were using psychedelic

86
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,590
substances constantly
like am Anita Mascara,

87
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:33,101
mushrooms,

88
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:33,701
for example,

89
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:36,760
which were widely used in India
before they became extinct.

90
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,481
That's the theory.

91
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:38,314
Anyways,

92
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,140
that seemed to be the
basis of the Chemical Soma,

93
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,270
which a much has been written about,

94
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,840
and so we hear this as a dream or has a
vision and perhaps that's what it was,

95
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:54,220
but perhaps that wasn't what it was either
and perhaps it was an experience that

96
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:59,221
was induced by I by the same processes
that shamonic people have always induced

97
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:04,090
these experiences and so we're going
to go through this a little bit.

98
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,410
So anyways,

99
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,180
there's A.

100
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:08,530
There's a connection between
heaven and earth that opens up.

101
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:08,881
That's,

102
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:09,420
that's,

103
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,253
that's the,

104
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,960
that's the vision and there's
messenger is moving up and down.

105
00:04:13,961 --> 00:04:14,320
Now,

106
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,900
one way you can conceptualize
that is psychologically,

107
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:18,160
as we already discussed,

108
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:19,160
that you know,

109
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:19,570
there,

110
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:24,570
there are forces within you that are
active and alive and you can think of them

111
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:29,200
in some sense as messengers of the higher
self and so you could think about this

112
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,780
as an image of a psychological reality,

113
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,540
but and so we can stick with that,

114
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,374
but,

115
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,363
but

116
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,390
here's some of the representations
that have been made.

117
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,280
I really liked the one on the right.

118
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:43,960
That's William Blake.

119
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:48,961
I liked the a helix idea and I
don't think that that's a fluke.

120
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:52,390
There are helixes and double
helix is in all sorts of images,

121
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,253
imagery,

122
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,310
very ancient and very modern that are
associated with both healing and with this

123
00:04:57,311 --> 00:04:58,144
kind of vision.

124
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,290
So,

125
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,840
and you see it in the
blake representation.

126
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,580
God is associated with,

127
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,430
well really with the sun and with light,

128
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,590
and you see that on the left as well,

129
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:11,050
that wherever God is is where light is.

130
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:14,320
And so that's a very interesting
idea as far as I'm concerned as well.
