1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,670
So anyways,

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,150
Abraham sends his eldest
servant off to his,

3
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,600
the place that God has
granted him to find a wife.

4
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:18,140
And interestingly it,

5
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,920
the borders of the promised land are
quite similar to the current borders of

6
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,930
Israel in these are estimates,

7
00:00:24,931 --> 00:00:25,171
right?

8
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:26,430
Based on on the biblical,

9
00:00:26,431 --> 00:00:28,470
and I didn't mean that's
not a fluke obviously,

10
00:00:28,471 --> 00:00:33,471
but it's interesting to
see the concordance between
these ancient stories and

11
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,970
the present day world.

12
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,150
So I thought that was very interesting.

13
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:41,310
And it shows once again that the past,

14
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,110
you think the past is the past,

15
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:43,770
but it's not,

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:44,380
it's,

17
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,300
it's still here,

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,830
it's embedded in the present.

19
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,340
You know,

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,150
just like the future in somehow in some
ways is folded up inside the president

21
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,230
waiting to unfold.

22
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:55,020
The past is all folded up
inside the present too.

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,410
So anyways,

24
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,390
the servant goes to,

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,120
yeah,

26
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,700
the land that he's been
charged to go to and,

27
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:06,511
and he,

28
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:06,901
he's,

29
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,440
he's trying to figure out how in the
world am I going to find a good wife for

30
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:10,801
Isaac?

31
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:11,011
I mean,

32
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:12,120
I don't know any of these people.

33
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:16,050
And so he has this little dialogue that's
presented in the form of a prayer I

34
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:16,884
suppose.

35
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:17,790
Um,

36
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,170
and he thinks,

37
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:19,351
well,

38
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:21,810
I'm going to go to the
place where you water,

39
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,730
where people get water
and water the animals.

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,140
Um,

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,820
cause that's a place
where everyone gathers.

42
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,660
So that's a good place to find someone.

43
00:01:28,661 --> 00:01:29,130
And,

44
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,471
and it,

45
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:33,840
it's not a place of fun and lightness
and relaxation and impulsivity.

46
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:34,690
It's a place of,

47
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,290
of life sustaining work.

48
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,150
And then he thinks something like,

49
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:44,100
well what would a decent
girl do at a watering place?

50
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:44,881
And he thought,

51
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:49,881
well maybe she would offer a stranger
some water and also offer to water the

52
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:57,291
camels because that would be brave to
approach the stranger and that generous.

53
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,670
And then indicative of,

54
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,530
of the willingness to make an effort.

55
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:04,200
And when you know that a camel,

56
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,940
I think he took 10 camels.

57
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,800
It was quite a few camels anyways,

58
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,723
not just one.

59
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,570
And that a candle can
drink 20 gallons of water.

60
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,250
And Rebecca,

61
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:17,580
who was drawing water from the wet turns
out to be Rebecca is drawing water from

62
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:18,360
the well,

63
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,230
which was hard,

64
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,800
right?

65
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,850
Because water's heavy.

66
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,250
And you have to lift
it up and it's 10 cows,

67
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:23,851
camels.

68
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:25,780
And so that's like 200 gallons of waters.

69
00:02:25,781 --> 00:02:26,280
So,

70
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,491
you know,

71
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:30,570
she has to put herself out a fair bit
in order to make this stranger happy.

72
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,700
And so that's what happens.

73
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:33,750
And then

74
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:39,190
serve it has brought along
gifts and that sort of thing.

75
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:40,450
And anyways,

76
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:40,980
Tilapia,

77
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,940
long story short,

78
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,840
uh,

79
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,840
Rebecca agrees to come back to come
back with the servant and Mary Isaac.

80
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,180
And so.
