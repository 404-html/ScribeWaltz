1
00:00:03,170 --> 00:00:04,470
So you act things out,

2
00:00:04,471 --> 00:00:04,741
right?

3
00:00:04,741 --> 00:00:06,210
Do you act things out?

4
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:08,490
And that's a kind of competence.

5
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:12,360
And then you imagine what you act out
and you imagine what everyone else acts

6
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:12,571
out.

7
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:16,320
And so there's a tremendous amount
of inflammation in your action.

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,610
And then that information is translated
up into the dream and into art,

9
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,020
into mythology and literature.

10
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,080
And there's a tremendous
amount of information in that.

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,310
And then some of that is translated
into articulated thought.

12
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:31,650
And I'll give you a quick
example of something like that.

13
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:36,090
I think this is partly what happens in
exodus when Moses comes up with the law,

14
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:36,421
you know,

15
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:39,340
he's wandering around with the Israelites
forever and the desert and they're,

16
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:42,810
they're like going left and going right
and worshiping idols and like having a

17
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:44,700
hell of a time and um,

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,330
you know,

19
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,380
get in rebellious and Moses goes up on
the mountain and he has this tremendous

20
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:52,800
revelation sort of in the sight
of God and illuminates him.

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,630
And he comes down with the law.

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,051
You think,

23
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:55,620
well,

24
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:55,801
you know,

25
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:57,420
Moses acted as a judge.

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,190
I know this is a mythological story.

27
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,500
Moses acted as a judge in the desert.

28
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:05,430
He was continually mediating between
people who are having problems constantly

29
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:06,660
trying to keep peace.

30
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,150
And so what are you doing when
you're turning to keep pieces?

31
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:11,100
You're trying to understand what peace is,

32
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,730
right?

33
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:13,530
You have to apply the principles.

34
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:13,820
Well,

35
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,880
what are the principles?

36
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,061
Well,

37
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:19,920
you don't know the principals or whatever
satisfies people enough to make peace

38
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,040
and maybe you do that 10,000 times
and then you get some sense of,

39
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:23,251
Oh,

40
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:25,380
here's the principles that bring peace.

41
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,270
And then one day it blasts
into your consciousness like,

42
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,430
like a revelation.

43
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,340
Here's the rules that
were already acting out.

44
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,990
Well that's the 10 commandments.

45
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:34,141
It's,

46
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:37,290
they're there to begin with and
Moses comes forward and says,

47
00:01:37,291 --> 00:01:37,770
look,

48
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,020
this is already basically
what we're doing,

49
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:41,520
but now it's codafide.

50
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,060
Right?

51
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,980
And like that's all historical process
that's condensed into a single story.

52
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:50,520
But obviously that happened
because we have written law,

53
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,061
right?

54
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:52,110
And that emerged in,

55
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,140
in good legal systems that
emerges from the bottom up.

56
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:55,981
That's English.

57
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,750
Common law is exactly like that,

58
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,201
right?

59
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:02,940
It's single decisions that are predicated
on principles that are then then

60
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,650
articulated and made into the body of law.

61
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,070
The body of law is something you act out.

62
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,290
That's why it's a body of law.

63
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,610
If you're a good citizen,

64
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:15,330
you act out the body of law and
the body of law has principles.

65
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:16,171
Okay,

66
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:17,160
so the question is,

67
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,590
there's principles that
guide our behavior.

68
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,450
What are those principles?

69
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:21,871
Well,

70
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:22,710
I think when you,

71
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,640
if you're,

72
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,450
if you want the initial answer
of what the Ark Archaic is,

73
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:29,130
real lights meant by God,

74
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,380
that's something like what they meant.

75
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:31,831
You know,

76
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,570
it's not a good enough explanation.

77
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,910
But imagine that you,

78
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,043
that you have,

79
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,230
that you're a chimpanzee
and you have a powerful,

80
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,300
uh,

81
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,670
uh,

82
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:44,940
dominant figure at the
pinnacle of your society,

83
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,830
that that represents power.

84
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:47,101
Now,

85
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:51,120
more than that because it's not sheer
physical prowess that keeps a chimp at the

86
00:02:51,121 --> 00:02:52,050
top of the hierarchy.

87
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:53,580
It's much more complicated than that.

88
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,511
But you could say,

89
00:02:54,511 --> 00:02:54,661
well,

90
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,230
there's,

91
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,650
there's a principle that the
dominant person manifests.

92
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,301
And then you might say,

93
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,134
well,

94
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,660
that principle shines
forth even more brightly.

95
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:07,510
If you know 10 people who are dominant,

96
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,493
powerful,

97
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,980
and you can extract out what
dominance means from that,

98
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,020
you can extract out what
power means from that.

99
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,920
And then you can divorce
the concept from the people.

100
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:23,050
And we had to do that at
some point because we can
say power in a human context

101
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,490
and we can imagine what that means.

102
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:28,540
But it's divorced from any
specific manifestation of power.

103
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:28,781
Well,

104
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,220
how the hell did we do that?

105
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:33,580
Like that's so complicated
when if you're a chimp,

106
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,280
the power is in another chimp.

107
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,260
It's not some damn abstraction.

108
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,251
Well,

109
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:39,730
so the,

110
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,110
so the question is think,

111
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:41,700
think about it.

112
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,970
We're in these hierarchies,

113
00:03:42,971 --> 00:03:44,590
many of them across centuries.

114
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,260
We're trying to figure out
what the guiding principle is.

115
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,850
We're trying to extract out the core of
the guiding principle and we turned that

116
00:03:51,851 --> 00:03:54,930
into a representation of a pattern of Ba.

117
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,400
Well,

118
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,710
it's something like that.

119
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,820
That's God.

120
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,420
It's an abstracted,

121
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:01,270
the ideal and it's,

122
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:01,600
it's,

123
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,940
it's put in personified form.

124
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,430
It manifests itself in persona find form.

125
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:08,950
But that's okay because what
we're trying to get at is the,

126
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,061
in some sense,

127
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:14,230
the essence of what it means to be
a properly functioning and properly,

128
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:19,150
properly functioning properly social
and property competent individual.

129
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,770
We're trying to figure
out what that means.

130
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,930
You needed an embodiment,

131
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,960
you needed ideal that's abstract and
then you could act out that would enable

132
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:30,220
you to understand what that means.

133
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,080
And that's what we've been driving out.

134
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,000
So that's the first hypothesis.

135
00:04:34,001 --> 00:04:34,840
In some sense,

136
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,520
I'm going to go over some of the,

137
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,830
some of the attributes of this abstract,

138
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,810
that ideal that we've formalized as God.

139
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:45,811
But that's the first sort of hypothesis
is that a philosophical or moral ideal

140
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:51,040
manifests itself first as a concrete
pattern of behavior that's characteristic

141
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,570
of a single individual.

142
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:57,700
And then it's a set of individuals and
then it's an abstraction from that set.

143
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,530
And then you have the abstraction.

144
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:00,610
It's so important.

145
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,320
So here's a political implication.

146
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:03,154
For example,

147
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,980
one of the debates we might say between
early Christianity and the late Roman

148
00:05:17,461 --> 00:05:22,461
empire was whether or not an emperor could
be God literally right to be deified,

149
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:26,460
to put enough to be put in a temple.

150
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,600
And you can see why that might happen
because that's someone at the pinnacle of

151
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:34,380
a very steep hierarchy has a tremendous
amount of power and influence.

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,800
But the Christian response to that was
never confuse the specific sovereign with

153
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:45,150
the principle of sovereignty itself.

154
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,960
It's brilliant to see,

155
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:50,460
see how difficult it is to come up
with an idea like that so that even the

156
00:05:50,461 --> 00:05:54,630
person who has the power is actually
subordinate to something else subordinate

157
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:55,500
to Ah,

158
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,000
let's call it a divine,

159
00:05:57,530 --> 00:05:58,790
for lack of a better word,

160
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,110
so that even the king himself
is subordinate to the principal.

161
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:06,470
And we still believe that because we
believe that our president or prime

162
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:09,290
minister is subordinate to the damn law,

163
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,820
whatever the body of law,

164
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,090
right?

165
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,320
There's a principle inside that that
even the leader is subordinate to.

166
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,191
And without that,

167
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:19,070
you could argue you can't even have
a civilized society because your,

168
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:22,940
your leader immediately turns into
something that's transcendent and all

169
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:23,774
powerful.

170
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,291
And I mean,

171
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:27,260
that's certainly what happened in the
Soviet Union and what happened in Mao's

172
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:30,680
China and what happened in Nazi Germany
because there was nothing for the

173
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,170
powerful to subordinate themselves to,

174
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,870
you're supposed to be subordinate to God.

175
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,220
So what does that mean?

176
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,320
While we're going to tear that idea apart,

177
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,080
but partly what it means
is that you're subordinate,

178
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,500
even if you're sovereign to the
principle of sovereignty itself.

179
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,880
And then the question is,

180
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:49,100
what the hell is the
principle of sovereignty?

181
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:52,850
And I could say we have been working
that out for a very long period of time.
