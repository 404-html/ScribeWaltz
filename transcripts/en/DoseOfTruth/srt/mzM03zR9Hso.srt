1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:05,710
Once leadership,
it's the capacity to see what the hell's

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,420
in front of your face and maybe in every
direction and then the capacity to use

3
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:13,380
your language properly in a
transformative manner and to transform

4
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:16,360
chaos into order and God only know how
those,

5
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,890
how long it took the Mesopotamians to
figure that out and the best they could

6
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:23,610
do is dramatize it,
but it's staggeringly brilliant.

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,431
No,
it's.

8
00:00:24,431 --> 00:00:29,431
It's by no means obvious and this chaos
is chaos is a very strange thing and

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,520
this is the chaos that God wrestled with
at the beginning of time.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,930
Chaos is what?
It's half psychological and half real.

11
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,070
There's no other way to really describe
it.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:43,800
The chaos is what you encountered when
you're thrown into deep confusion,

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:45,780
right?
When your world falls apart,

14
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:47,880
when,
when you encounter something that blows

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,740
you into pieces,
when your dreams die,

16
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:53,100
when you're betrayed,
it's the chaos that emerges and the

17
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:57,310
chaos has everything at once and it's
too much for you and that's for sure,

18
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:59,750
and it pulls you down into the
underworld and all.

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:02,760
That's where the dragons are and all
you've got at that point is your

20
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,910
capacity to bloody well,
keep your eyes open and to speak as

21
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,240
carefully and clearly as you can and
maybe if you're lucky,

22
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:13,050
you'll get through it that way and come
out the other side and it's taken people

23
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:14,790
a very long time to figure that out.
