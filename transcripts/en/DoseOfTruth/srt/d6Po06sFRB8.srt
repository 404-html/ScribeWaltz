1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,570
So Jacob is talking to God and God says,

2
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:11,961
behold,

3
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:16,220
I am with Jessie and it will keep the
an old places where you go and bring you

4
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:19,250
again into this land for I won't
leave you until I have done that,

5
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:20,540
which I have spoken to you of.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,880
And Jacob awakened out of his sleep.

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,161
And he said,

8
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:26,570
surely the Lord is in this place.

9
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:27,381
And I knew what not.

10
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:28,400
And he was afraid and said,

11
00:00:28,401 --> 00:00:29,930
how dreadful is this place?

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,680
This is none other but the house of
God and this is the gate of heaven.

13
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,880
And Jacob Rose up early in the morning
and took the stone that he had put for

14
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:41,240
his pillows and set it up for a
pillar and poured oil on top of it.

15
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,650
That's a sacrifice.

16
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,410
And he called the name
of that place Bethel.

17
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:47,780
But the name of the city was
called [inaudible] at the first.

18
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,820
And Jacob vowed a vow saying,

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,310
if God will be with me and
we'll keep me in this way,

20
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:56,990
that I go and will give me bread to eat
and Raymond to put on so that I come

21
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:58,520
again to my father's house in peace,

22
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:00,200
then shall the Lord be my God.

23
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,401
And this stone,

24
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:03,620
which are set for a pillar
shall be God's house.

25
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,170
And of all of that that is given to me,

26
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:08,840
I will surely give the 10th unto Thee.

27
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:12,590
And that's a pretty good place to stop.

28
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,650
So now I'll just

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,793
conclude.

30
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,670
So you have this very
Morley ambivalent character,

31
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,000
right?

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,560
Who's so far,

33
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,370
pretty much everything he's done
that we're familiar with is not good.

34
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:29,450
So He's,

35
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,100
he's betrayed his brother horribly,

36
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:31,611
twice,

37
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:33,020
badly enough so that he,

38
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,920
his brother wants to kill him and
everyone can kind of sympathize with his

39
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:37,754
brother.

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:38,600
So,

41
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,230
and then he runs away essentially
because his mother tells him too,

42
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:44,720
which is not exactly a
testament to his character.

43
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,310
And despite that,

44
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:48,410
strangely enough,

45
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,850
he has this experience,

46
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:50,811
you know?

47
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,850
And that's heartening,

48
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,013
I guess.

49
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,580
And that's the point is that

50
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:00,440
people are predisposed to terrible error.

51
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:01,820
There's no doubt about that.

52
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,193
And yet

53
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,040
when I was writing my latest book,

54
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,060
I had a friend of mine,

55
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,550
Norman Doidge wrote the foreword and
enormous written a couple of great books

56
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:18,551
and he's Jewish and he read some of what
I'd written and he took me to task for

57
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:22,160
making the God of the Old Testament,

58
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,431
you know,

59
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:25,340
from a Christian perspective
too harsh and unforgiving.

60
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:30,620
And I rewrote a fair bit of it because
of his criticism and because of what I've

61
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:31,880
learned doing these lectures,

62
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:34,010
it's like it's not exactly right,

63
00:02:34,011 --> 00:02:34,310
you know?

64
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,820
I mean what happens in the Old
Testament is if you screw up,

65
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,000
especially if you know you do and you
decide that you're not going to do

66
00:02:41,001 --> 00:02:41,661
anything about it,

67
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,280
so it's conscious and deliberate,

68
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,620
then look the hell out.

69
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,790
You are in serious trouble.

70
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,210
And I actually think that's
also psychologically accurate.

71
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,800
One of the things young pointed out,

72
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,820
and this has always struck me,

73
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:55,460
was that if you don't
know what you're doing,

74
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:58,010
this is actually in the
gospel of Thomas as well.

75
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,400
Interestingly enough is one
of the Gods Gnostic Gospels,

76
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:04,180
Christ tells his followers something
like if you make a mistake and you don't

77
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:04,871
know what you're doing,

78
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,460
then you'll be forgiven for it.

79
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,840
But if you make a mistake knowing what
you're doing and you do it anyways,

80
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,640
then like good luck to you and,

81
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:14,671
and I,

82
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:15,504
and I think that's,

83
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,353
I think that's,

84
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,760
that's psychologically accurate.

85
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,863
Yes.

86
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,080
One of the things that's very interesting
about the judgemental God in the Old

87
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,081
Testament,

88
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:29,591
however,

89
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,990
is that he can be bargained with.

90
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,510
And even if you make mistakes,

91
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,760
especially if you're unconscious of them,

92
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:37,870
if you haven't learned yet,

93
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:38,650
let's say,

94
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:43,390
then you always have the opportunity
to return to the proper path.

95
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:44,590
And that's,

96
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,180
people get cynical about
that cause there's,

97
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:46,391
you know,

98
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:50,290
this mostly Christian idea that you
could live a terribly sinful life,

99
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,790
but if you repented on your death bed,

100
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,840
it's like heaven for you.

101
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:53,420
And it's like,

102
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,100
oh that's,

103
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,480
that sounds like a great deal.

104
00:03:55,481 --> 00:03:55,691
Right?

105
00:03:55,691 --> 00:03:59,350
It's like you can do whatever the hell
you want until just before you die.

106
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,120
Of course you might not know when that is.

107
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:02,050
So that's a problem.

108
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:02,621
You,

109
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:03,311
then you can just say,

110
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:03,491
well,

111
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:04,151
I'm sorry.

112
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:04,691
And you know,

113
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:05,471
everything's forgiven.

114
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:08,620
But the problem with being cynical
about that sort of thing is that it's no

115
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:10,150
trivial matter to repent,

116
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:11,680
you know?

117
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,680
Because to repent means a figure out what
you actually did and the worst things

118
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:18,004
that you did,

119
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,560
the more horrible it is to figure it out.

120
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,790
It's no joke,

121
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,061
right?

122
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:25,930
And there's no genuine repentance without
understanding of the depth of your

123
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,764
depravity.

124
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,130
And so if you lived to particularly
reprehensible life and you come to

125
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:33,400
understand it,

126
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,070
I think that in and of
itself could kill you.

127
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:36,671
You know,

128
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:41,020
it's a terrible thing to wake
up and see what you've done.

129
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:43,120
If what you've done is truly terrible.
