1
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:11,470
And I was reading this other
book while back as well,

2
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,060
which was written by the guy who
ran the heat human genome project.

3
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:18,640
And I don't remember
exactly what it was called,

4
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:20,940
but it was something like
a scientist's case for God.

5
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:21,820
There's something like that.

6
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,460
And one of the things he referred to,

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,730
which didn't strike me as hard
as it should have to begin with,

8
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:29,690
was the he,

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:30,011
he,

10
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:35,011
he thought that one of the phenomena
say that justified a belief in a

11
00:00:35,561 --> 00:00:40,000
transcendent being with something like
the moral intuition of human beings that,

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:40,480
you know,

13
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,810
we have a sense of right and wrong and uh,

14
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:43,541
you know,

15
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:47,150
it's certainly what happens in genesis
and the story of Adam and eve is that,

16
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,120
that that story announces the coming
of the sense of right and wrong,

17
00:00:52,121 --> 00:00:52,331
right?

18
00:00:52,331 --> 00:00:53,380
The knowledge of good and evil.

19
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:55,210
And it isn't something
we ascribed to animals.

20
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,340
It's something that's
unique to human beings.

21
00:00:57,341 --> 00:00:59,950
Animals can be predators and you know,

22
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:01,740
and they can be gentle and,

23
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,790
and you can have a relationship with them,

24
00:01:03,791 --> 00:01:06,490
but you never think of
an evil cat or you know,

25
00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:07,420
or an evil wolf.

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,283
Even though they're,

27
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,041
you know,

28
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:09,940
they're predatory.

29
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,143
Um,

30
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,880
but human beings,

31
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:16,960
we have this capacity to
judge between good and evil,

32
00:01:16,961 --> 00:01:17,620
right and wrong.

33
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,960
And it's really an integral part of our,

34
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:20,883
our being.

35
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,170
And I think you can make an
evolutionary case for that,

36
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:28,171
a biological case for that as you can
make a biological case for most of what is

37
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:32,590
relevant about human beings
because we're biological creatures,

38
00:01:32,591 --> 00:01:35,980
but we don't really understand
the significance of that.

39
00:01:35,981 --> 00:01:38,560
Like what happens in the
story of Adam and eve is that,

40
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:42,070
that's that realization that coming
to the knowledge of good and evil is

41
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:45,040
actually represented as a
shift of cosmic significance,

42
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:45,220
right?

43
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,000
It puts a,

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,090
it puts a permanent fracture in
the structure of [inaudible].

45
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,410
And you know,

46
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:54,280
if you think of human beings
as insignificant and so on,

47
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,190
a tiny dust mote in the
middle of an infinite cosmos,

48
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,220
a cosmos that cares less for us,

49
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,900
then who cares?

50
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,591
Fundamentally,

51
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:06,340
if human beings have the knowledge
to distinguish between good and evil.

52
00:02:06,341 --> 00:02:09,730
But if you give consciousness
a central role in being,

53
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:12,070
and you can make a perfectly
reasonable case for that,

54
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:16,480
because without consciousness there's
no being as far as anyone can determine.

55
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,270
So it may be much more
central than we think.

56
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:19,480
And,

57
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,313
and,

58
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:21,051
and I,

59
00:02:21,051 --> 00:02:23,290
I really don't think there's
a counter argument to that,

60
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,180
like not a solid one.

61
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,850
You can state that consciousnesses
epet phenomenal and,

62
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:30,310
and that the world is
fundamentally materialistic.

63
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:32,350
And it doesn't matter that
there's consciousness,

64
00:02:32,351 --> 00:02:33,310
you can state that,

65
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:35,290
but you can make an equally credible case.

66
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,123
The other way,

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,400
and certainly our lived experience is
that consciousness is crucial obviously.

68
00:02:41,771 --> 00:02:46,300
And we treat each other as if most of
the time we're valuable conscious beings

69
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:50,170
and we wouldn't give up our consciousness
even though it's often consciousness

70
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:51,004
of suffering.

71
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,900
And so then I think another
problem with the book is that it's,

72
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,990
it's sort of predicated on the
idea that life is for happiness.

73
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,150
And I don't think that's right.

74
00:03:01,151 --> 00:03:03,370
And I don't think that's
how people experience life.

75
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,450
And I might be wrong,

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:09,720
but it seems to me that people experience
life as something like a series of

77
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,640
crucial ethical decisions.

78
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,050
It's something like that.

79
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:14,884
I mean,

80
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,320
when I just can't imagine,

81
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,620
maybe I'm being naive about this,

82
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:22,480
but I can't imagine that.

83
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,200
I can't imagine another being
that's like me in most senses,

84
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,780
that isn't constantly wrestling in some
sense with what the next proper thing to

85
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:35,590
do is.

86
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,730
It's not like it's obvious.

87
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:40,930
It's not bloody obvious and it doesn't
mean you'll do the right thing cause you

88
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:45,340
don't law lots of times and you
know that by your own judgment,

89
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:45,600
right?

90
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,080
Cause you're making mistakes all the time.

91
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,810
Sometimes you don't know what you're doing
and maybe it's a mistake and maybe it

92
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,500
isn't.

93
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,590
And who's to say that isn't
what I'm talking about.

94
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,750
I'm talking about when you know that what
you're doing is wrong and you go ahead

95
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:56,584
and do it anyways.

96
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,880
People do that all the time.

97
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,040
And that's also extremely peculiar.

98
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,610
Bloody well think that if you knew it
was wrong and you told yourself that it

99
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:04,300
was wrong,

100
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,850
that that would be sufficient so
that you would just wouldn't do it.

101
00:04:06,851 --> 00:04:08,500
But that isn't what you're like at all.

102
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:08,801
You know?

103
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:12,430
And you can tell yourself something is
wrong a 50 times and you'll do it the

104
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:14,350
51st time and then you'll feel,

105
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:14,651
you know,

106
00:04:14,651 --> 00:04:15,484
like,

107
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,550
like you deserve to feel probably and,

108
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,050
but it doesn't stop you.

109
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,883
And so,

110
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,320
so then I think the
other problem with the,

111
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,400
the viewpoint,

112
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:29,110
the idea that the suffering of life
eradicates its utility is that it's

113
00:04:29,111 --> 00:04:33,880
predicated on the idea that happiness
or lack of suffering even is,

114
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:36,910
is the right criteria
by which to judge life.

115
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,020
And I don't think that's how
we actually experience life.

116
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:46,021
I think what we do instead is put
ourselves through a series of excruciating

117
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:47,590
moral choices.

118
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:48,721
You know?

119
00:04:48,721 --> 00:04:53,200
And one of the things that that's really
significant about the biblical stories

120
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,270
and I think about the,

121
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:59,410
the entire implicit philosophy,

122
00:04:59,411 --> 00:04:59,681
you know,

123
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:01,120
that's embedded in the stories,

124
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:04,810
is that that's how life is
presented in the stories,

125
00:05:04,811 --> 00:05:06,490
is all of these individuals,

126
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,260
first their individuals to not groups.

127
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,363
And second,

128
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:12,550
they're agonizing over their
moral choices all the time,

129
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,563
all the time.

130
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:16,000
And they have a relationship with God.

131
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,140
And,

132
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,973
but it's not,

133
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,230
it's not a directive relationship.

134
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,041
Exactly.

135
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:24,640
Even the people to whom
God speaks directly,

136
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,970
which I suspect is not something
you'd exactly want to have happen,

137
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,470
is it's,

138
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:35,440
there's still the f even the fact that
they have a direct relationship with God

139
00:05:35,441 --> 00:05:39,430
doesn't stop them from being tormented
continually by their moral choices.

140
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,230
And so the world is presented
as a moral landscape,

141
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,483
not as a,

142
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,610
not as a place that justifies
itself by happiness.

143
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,590
It's presented as a moral landscape and
people are presented as creatures who

144
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,750
traverse through the moral landscape,

145
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,230
making ethical decisions that
determine the course of the world.

146
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:02,600
And that seems to me to be right.

147
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:03,440
And that's not a,

148
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,620
that's not the same as happiness
by any stretch of the imagination.

149
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,860
It's a whole different
category of being and,

150
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,160
okay.

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,890
And then I've thought that
through a lot and I think,

152
00:06:13,891 --> 00:06:14,400
well,

153
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,480
we do make choices and what we
do is contend with the future,

154
00:06:18,481 --> 00:06:19,200
you know,

155
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:19,460
and the,

156
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,500
the future seems to appear to
us as a realm of possibility.

157
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:26,850
It that's a more accurate way of thinking
about it then then that the future

158
00:06:26,851 --> 00:06:28,230
presents itself to it.

159
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,800
To us as a realm of determined things.

160
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,400
It's,

161
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,910
it's presents itself as a
realm of possibility and
there's good choices in that

162
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:39,600
realm and there's poor choices or
even evil choices in that realm.

163
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,820
And we're negotiating continually deciding
which of those choices we're going to

164
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:45,810
bring into being.

165
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,680
That seems to me to be
phenomenologically indisputable.

166
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:53,250
And we certainly treat each other as if
that's what we're doing because we hold

167
00:06:53,251 --> 00:06:54,870
each other responsible for our actions,

168
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:55,261
you know,

169
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,370
with some exceptions.

170
00:06:56,850 --> 00:07:01,850
And that we're deciding each moment
whether to make things better or worse.

171
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,733
And

172
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,620
that seems to me to be correct.

173
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:10,490
And I think that that's what
these stories illustrate.

174
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,130
They don't say that directly,

175
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:13,521
you know,

176
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:17,060
although I think it gets more and more
explicit as the narrative unfolds.

177
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,583
But,

178
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,810
and then part of the
realism of the stories,

179
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:21,330
is that right?

180
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,163
Yes.

181
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,230
The people aren't,

182
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,190
the people that are being
presented are by no means good.

183
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:28,611
I mean,

184
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,020
maybe with the exception of Noah,

185
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:31,280
Noah seem to be a pretty good guy.

186
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:31,670
All they did,

187
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,620
he did get drunk and you know,

188
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,040
and,

189
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,460
and,

190
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,700
and end up naked exposed
to his sons and so forth.

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,833
But I mean,

192
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,450
yeah,

193
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:40,761
he,

194
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,910
he isn't talked about
a lot as a character.

195
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:44,080
It's a pretty compressed story.

196
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:44,801
But Abraham,

197
00:07:44,801 --> 00:07:45,071
I mean,

198
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,600
Abraham had plenty of problems,

199
00:07:46,630 --> 00:07:49,450
not least of which was in
his inability to leave home.

200
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:50,250
And then,

201
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:50,500
you know,

202
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,200
he's lying about his wife and there,

203
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,680
there's all sorts of mistakes.

204
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,461
And then Jacob,

205
00:07:54,461 --> 00:07:59,461
who we're going to talk about tonight
is an even more morally ambivalent

206
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:01,534
character.

207
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,050
He's,

208
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,700
especially at the beginning of the story,

209
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:04,534
he's,

210
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,350
it's,

211
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,183
it's,

212
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:11,300
he isn't the sort of person
that you would pick out.

213
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,090
Especially if you are a hack writer.

214
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,640
You wouldn't pick him out
as the hero of the story.

215
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:20,710
He does a lot of things that are really
pretty reprehensible and take some,

216
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,400
an awful long time to learn better.

217
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,650
And yet he's the person who's put
forward as the father of the 12 tribes of

218
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:28,071
Israel.

219
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:31,930
It's from this flawed
person that the people that,

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,070
that maybe that,

221
00:08:34,071 --> 00:08:39,071
whose story you might say is at the
fundamental constitutes the fundamental

222
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:40,940
underpinning of our culture.

223
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:46,040
It's from this deeply flawed
individual that that group emerges.

224
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,650
And so you might think of
it out as a relief too,

225
00:08:48,651 --> 00:08:49,880
because you know,

226
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,220
you're no knight in shining armor,

227
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:52,521
you know,

228
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:52,820
with,

229
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,540
with the,

230
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,680
with the pure moral passed.

231
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:55,921
I mean,

232
00:08:55,921 --> 00:09:00,180
people make mistakes of
catastrophic proportions nonstop,

233
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,043
you know,

234
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,000
and that also means that these stories
put forward something approximating hope

235
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,160
because in their realism,

236
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:09,480
in their moral realism,

237
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,540
they present heroes,

238
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,400
I suppose the heroes of renowned,

239
00:09:14,401 --> 00:09:14,641
right?

240
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:15,840
The Patriarchs of old,

241
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,703
let's say,

242
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:19,200
who are realistic,

243
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:24,201
people who have fits of anger and rage
and who are murderous at times and who

244
00:09:24,421 --> 00:09:25,254
are deeply,

245
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,560
deeply embroiled with family dispute and,

246
00:09:29,561 --> 00:09:30,394
and who,

247
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,400
who have adulterous affairs.

248
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:32,711
And,

249
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:35,940
and like they do all of the
terrible things that people do.

250
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,710
And the weird thing is,

251
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,810
is that God is still with them.

252
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,693
And

253
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:42,761
you know,

254
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:47,140
it isn't obvious what that means
or even if it means anything,

255
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:49,300
but it's very,

256
00:09:49,301 --> 00:09:54,070
it's not disputable as far as I can
tell that a we're conscious and that

257
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,160
consciousness is a
transcendent phenomena which,

258
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,570
which we do not understand.

259
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,900
And that the landscape that
we traverse through his moral,

260
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,970
like every story you ever watch,

261
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:07,000
anything that grips your imagination
on the screen or in the theater,

262
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:10,720
like any story that grabs you
is a story of moral striving.

263
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,000
It's just not interesting otherwise.

264
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:13,690
Right?

265
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:17,320
The person has to be confronted with
complex moral choices and then you see the

266
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:18,370
outcome and you know,

267
00:10:18,371 --> 00:10:22,060
the good guy does it right in the bad
guy does it badly and things don't go so

268
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,860
well for the bad guy generally.

269
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,570
And if it's a bit more sophisticated,

270
00:10:25,571 --> 00:10:28,120
the good and the bad are
in the same individual.

271
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:28,571
And that's,

272
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:28,811
you know,

273
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:30,820
that's a more compelling story.

274
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,223
But

275
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,120
so we could say,

276
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:38,331
well,

277
00:10:38,331 --> 00:10:38,541
let,

278
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:38,781
let's,

279
00:10:38,781 --> 00:10:42,350
we could make the assumption that it
might be worthwhile thinking of the world

280
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:43,184
as a,

281
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:47,870
as it has been thought of classically as
a theater upon which the forces of good

282
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:51,810
and evil continually strive for dominance.

283
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:53,083
And I,

284
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,650
for the life of me,

285
00:10:54,651 --> 00:10:58,580
especially after I started reading deeply
into 20th century history and all the

286
00:10:58,581 --> 00:11:01,940
terrible things that happened in the
20th century and all the terrible,

287
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,290
unbelievably incomprehensible things
that people did to one another,

288
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,510
I just couldn't see seeing things
any other way is realistic.

289
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:12,831
You know,

290
00:11:12,831 --> 00:11:17,460
because I don't think that you can
immerse yourself in 20th century history

291
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,860
without coming to the conclusion
that evil is a reality.

292
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,220
And if it's a reality,

293
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,030
it depends on what you mean by reality.

294
00:11:25,031 --> 00:11:27,250
But it's fundamental
enough reality for me.

295
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:28,930
And if it's a reality,

296
00:11:28,931 --> 00:11:33,310
then I don't see how you can escape
from the conclusion that the cosmos,

297
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:34,480
as we experience it,

298
00:11:34,481 --> 00:11:37,810
at least is a place of moral striving.

299
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,210
And well,

300
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:43,060
that's one of the things that's really
illustrated in the story of Jacob.

301
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:43,550
And,

302
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,370
and I found that quite striking.
