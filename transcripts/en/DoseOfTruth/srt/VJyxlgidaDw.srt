1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,480
The other shoe dropped for
me then because you know,

2
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:10,741
you're,

3
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:13,110
you're talking about
that at least in part,

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:16,650
you're talking about that
ecstatic experience as the,

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,540
as the necessary counter position
to isolation and abandonment,

6
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,130
loneliness and all of those things,

7
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:23,251
which,

8
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,420
which I think is a very,

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,890
a very reasonable way
of thinking about it.

10
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:32,310
It's like meaning as the antidote
to isolation and Tra and tragedy and

11
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,670
malevolence for that matter.

12
00:00:33,671 --> 00:00:35,190
And I think music is,

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,150
you know,

14
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,650
I've thought deeply about music.

15
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:38,180
I've,

16
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,620
I've tried to figure out why it has,

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,290
what it represents and why it
has the effects that it has.

18
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:44,831
And I think,

19
00:00:44,831 --> 00:00:47,320
and this is a neuroscientific
few of it to some degree,

20
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:48,190
and you know,

21
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:53,191
it seems to me that it's better to think
about the world as con as something

22
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:56,830
that consists of patterns rather than
as something that consists of objects.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,460
So it object would actually be a pattern
that sustains itself across time.

24
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,040
It's it,

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,230
that's not all that very,

26
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:03,130
very good insight.

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,750
You get applause for that.

28
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,241
Thank you.

29
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:05,651
Thank you.

30
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:06,011
And so,

31
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:07,120
so then you think,

32
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,060
well for you,

33
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:10,660
you can even think about the way
the visual system works this way.

34
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:11,560
So you know,

35
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,780
we tend to think that there's a world
out there and then there's an image of

36
00:01:14,781 --> 00:01:19,590
that world projected onto our retina
and then the images is reconstructed,

37
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:21,210
say in our visual cortex.

38
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:22,110
And then we,

39
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:22,890
uh,

40
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,510
then we can become conscious of
that image and planner actions in,

41
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:26,920
in a,

42
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,930
in consequence of that.

43
00:01:27,931 --> 00:01:29,460
But that isn't how it works.

44
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,640
The way it works is that
there are patterns in the
world and then the patterns

45
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:37,760
are shifted into patterns
of light of illumination.

46
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:41,090
And then those are shifted into patterns
of neural activity on the retina.

47
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,390
And then those are shifted into
patterns of neural conductance,

48
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:44,870
the law,

49
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,740
the optical nerves,

50
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,020
and then patterns in the visual cortex.

51
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:50,690
And then those are expressed
as patterns of movement.

52
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:55,160
So it's all the transformations of
patterns and the meaning of a visual

53
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:58,490
perception is the pattern of
action that it gives rise to,

54
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:00,950
which is why you need a body
meant to be able to perceive.

55
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,450
And I think the reason that music speaks
so deeply to us of fundamental meaning

56
00:02:05,451 --> 00:02:08,180
is because it's actually the
most representative art form.

57
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:08,781
You know,

58
00:02:08,781 --> 00:02:10,540
because people think
about it in some senses,

59
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,200
the least representative art form,

60
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,430
I don't think that's right at all.

61
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,730
I think it represents the reality that
exists in a profound sense beyond what

62
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:21,230
our census revealed to
us moment to moment.

63
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,220
And so it puts people then when you're
moving to the music and we were all

64
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,180
moving to the music,

65
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,230
or when you're dancing,

66
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,610
let's say with someone else and you're,

67
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,280
and you're as pairs and
you're all dancing together,

68
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,370
it's that the patterns of the cosmos,

69
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,330
so to speak,

70
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:39,680
manifesting themselves as the patterns
of the music manifesting themselves as

71
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:43,220
the patterns of your body and in
syncopation with everyone else.

72
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,310
So it's also a symbolic
representation of a harmonious,

73
00:02:46,311 --> 00:02:47,540
an ideal society.

74
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,120
And there it is something
that's beyond us.

75
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,590
And so it's,

76
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,241
it's interests.

77
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:52,851
So I get it.

78
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:53,121
So,

79
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:54,260
so partly what you're saying,

80
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,280
if I understand you,

81
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,690
is that for you,

82
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:57,460
the,

83
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:01,540
the ecstatic collective that
was associated with music,

84
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,201
for example,

85
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:06,550
in pop music perhaps was you could see
it out very clearly as the antidote to

86
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:07,660
painful isolation.

87
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,041
And,

88
00:03:08,041 --> 00:03:08,800
and I mean,

89
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,300
one of the things that struck me as,

90
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:10,750
as,

91
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,150
as struck me as near
miraculous about music,

92
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,330
especially in the rather
nihilistic and atheistic society,

93
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:20,920
is that it really does fill the void
that was left by the death of God.

94
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,700
And it's partly because you
cannot rationally critique music.

95
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:25,811
You know,

96
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:26,710
it speaks to you,

97
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,790
it speaks of meaning.

98
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,650
And no matter what you say about it,

99
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,420
no matter how cynical you are,

100
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,190
you cannot put a crowbar
underneath that and lifted up and,

101
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:36,770
and,

102
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,350
and toss it aside.

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,290
And music was so,

104
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,590
such a powerful cultural force in
the 60s and the 70s and it's like

105
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,560
overwhelmingly powerful force.
