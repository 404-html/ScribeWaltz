1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,600
Okay,
so this is the individual instead.

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:13,620
So we have explored territory,
unexplored territory or the known and

3
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:18,150
the unknown or order and chaos.
And then we have the thing that mediates

4
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:19,800
between them.
And that's the individual.

5
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:22,500
And this is of medieval representation,
which I really love.

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,140
You know,
there's the dome of the sky there.

7
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:29,160
It's a very archaic idea that the earth
is a dome because it kind of looks like

8
00:00:29,161 --> 00:00:30,840
that if you go out in a flat field,
you know,

9
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:34,740
if you're out in the ocean,
the way the world looks like a dome on a

10
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:37,080
disk.
And so that's sort of the representation

11
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:38,580
here.
It's a very ancient idea.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,880
And this guy at the bottom left of the
pictures poking his head through the

13
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:47,760
comprehensible world and looking at the
chaos beyond.

14
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,890
And so he's a heroic figure.
So the knower is the individual is

15
00:00:52,891 --> 00:00:54,660
always the hero of his story,
right?

16
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,810
The protagonist of a story.
Now it can be an antihero too because

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,340
just like the known has a negative
element and a pause development and the

18
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:04,740
unknown has a negative element and a
positive element.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:08,100
The individual has a negative element
and a positive element.

20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,430
And so there's the hero and the
adversary roughly speaking.

21
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:14,310
And you know,
there's all sorts of movies where the

22
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,640
protagonist is an Antihero,
you know,

23
00:01:16,641 --> 00:01:20,910
and those movies are usually there to
show you bad examples in some sense.

24
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,230
Or you get mixed characters like Batman
and he's tangled up with the joker.

25
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,770
And as the joker points out in that
brilliant performance,

26
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,830
they're mirror images of one another.
And so

27
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,190
the jokers and adversary,
it's,

28
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,050
it's,
it's more complicated than that.

29
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:42,051
But so some of the symbols that commonly
represent the individual in symbolic

30
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:45,930
representations are while,
and also conceptual representations are

31
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:50,340
ego consciousness.
The trickster bugs bunny is a good

32
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:52,560
example of a trickster,
the fool,

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,590
the hero,
the coward spirit as opposed to matter

34
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:58,620
or as opposed to dogma,
the son,

35
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:02,340
the son of the unknown,
and the son of the king.

36
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,230
So,
and those are very,

37
00:02:04,231 --> 00:02:06,450
very common figures.
And I'll walk you through some of that

38
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,550
as we progress today.
So,

39
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,440
and then there's the figure of the
adversary.

40
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:13,530
So you see on the right hand,
left hand side there,

41
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,130
you see.
