1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:06,921
Here's a,

2
00:00:06,921 --> 00:00:08,090
here's a counter example.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,340
Let's say you're trying to smoke,

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,540
trying to quit smoking,

5
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,490
you're trying to quit smoking.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,353
Okay.

7
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:15,440
And your friends smoke.

8
00:00:15,441 --> 00:00:15,681
Okay,

9
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:19,880
so what do they do it like do they
offer you a cigarette at every possible

10
00:00:19,881 --> 00:00:20,481
opportunity?

11
00:00:20,481 --> 00:00:21,500
Cause that's very common.

12
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:22,790
People do that very commonly.

13
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,923
Why?

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,190
Well maybe they're mad that maybe they're
mad that they can put smoking or maybe

15
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:29,380
if you quit and they didn't,

16
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,660
that would cast a bit
them in a bad shadow.

17
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:35,450
Or maybe they're just being malevolent
or maybe it's a game or whatever.

18
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:39,920
But one of the things it isn't is in
the best interest of the person who's

19
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:44,160
trying to quit smoking or
drinking or eating or you know,

20
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:48,470
or behaving in any sort of dismal manner
that's self defeating across time.

21
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,330
And so one of the things that,

22
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:52,003
you know,

23
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:58,300
I had a client just a while back and he
was talking about an older sibling and

24
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:02,030
he used to make these
models very complicated,

25
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,890
more so he was quite young at this time.

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:06,230
His sibling was like a
decade and a half older.

27
00:01:06,231 --> 00:01:08,150
So he was like 10 or something like that.

28
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,250
Make these really complex models.

29
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:14,120
He'd spend a couple of weeks building
them and then when the older sibling came

30
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,470
in and he just smashed them up,

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,290
it's like,

32
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:16,441
well,

33
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:19,010
let's see what kind of
stress this thing can take.

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,371
It's like,

35
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,204
okay,

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,070
what's going on there?

37
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,791
Well,

38
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:27,791
I wouldn't say it's unconditional positive
regard with the aim of encouraging

39
00:01:27,981 --> 00:01:29,720
the person and bringing them to fruition.

40
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:33,410
It's quite the opposite and it's
an instrumental use of action.

41
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:37,700
It send the point is not to
elevate me or you or both of us.

42
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,720
The point is I'm going to be the
monster at the top of the hierarchy.

43
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,730
If you're all crunched up
and lying at the bottom,

44
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,870
that's just fine.

45
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,480
And that's a very common
set of motivations.

46
00:01:47,481 --> 00:01:48,410
And you might ask,

47
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:48,531
well,

48
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:50,030
why isn't that okay?

49
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,021
Well,

50
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:51,920
that's a good question.

51
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,750
I think the right answer to that is,

52
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,030
as a long run game,

53
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:57,050
it's counterproductive.

54
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,360
No one benefits.

55
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:04,220
So there's local benefits to you
for the short in the short term.

56
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,210
So.
