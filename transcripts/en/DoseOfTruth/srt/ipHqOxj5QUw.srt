1
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:11,920
Do you have investigated brain activity
during motor imagery in stroke patients

2
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:14,290
with hemiparesis and be paresis his,

3
00:00:14,291 --> 00:00:14,680
his,

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:14,980
uh,

5
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,330
motor impairment from,

6
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:17,643
from uh,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:18,970
from the stroke.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,840
This work is exact aimed at examining
similarities between motor imagery and

9
00:00:22,841 --> 00:00:23,674
execution.

10
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,060
In a group of stroke patients,

11
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:29,350
11 patients were asked to perform a
visual motor tracking task by either

12
00:00:29,351 --> 00:00:33,310
physically or mentally tracking a sine
wave forest target using their thumb and

13
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:34,144
index finger.

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,103
So they're doing this

15
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,760
during FMRI scanning results.

16
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:44,761
Whole brain analysis confirmed shared
neural substrates between motor imagery

17
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:47,410
and motor execution and
bilateral premotor cortex.

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,750
So that's the part that
I was talking about.

19
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,510
I won't tell you about the
rest of the brain in pride.

20
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,021
A lobule.

21
00:00:53,021 --> 00:00:55,540
This is partly associated
with body recognition.

22
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:01,240
So,

23
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,870
so basically I showed you
that study because it,

24
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:04,360
it,

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,870
it's one,

26
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,020
it's one of the studies that lend credence
to what I was just describing is that

27
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:11,350
imagery is the precursor to
action and that it's associated.

28
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,530
You get the imagery going
here and the action there.

29
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:15,670
Think about,

30
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,800
think about thanking think,

31
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,693
act.

32
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,020
That's roughly how it works.

33
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:23,791
Okay.

34
00:01:23,791 --> 00:01:24,624
Now,

35
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:26,280
now down to cognitive ability.

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,473
Well,

37
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,330
how can you conceptualize intelligence?

38
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,533
Okay,

39
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:37,820
well this is a major problem because
your initial conceptualization determines

40
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:42,680
in part the strategies that you're going
to use to investigate intelligence.

41
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:43,970
And when you say,

42
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,481
when you,

43
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:47,630
when you pair a sentence
down to what is intelligence,

44
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:52,040
the sentence is problematic because
part of it is a question about

45
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:57,050
if and how such a thing might
manifest itself in the world.

46
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:01,970
So there's a fact out there that
are set of facts that corresponds to

47
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:02,511
intelligence.

48
00:02:02,511 --> 00:02:03,350
But the other problem is,

49
00:02:03,351 --> 00:02:06,170
well what do you mean
when you say intelligence?

50
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,240
And you kind of have to nail that down.

51
00:02:08,241 --> 00:02:11,750
If you're going to have a coke
conversation about intelligence,

52
00:02:11,751 --> 00:02:13,430
that doesn't go entirely astray.

53
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,611
And so you've got a,

54
00:02:14,611 --> 00:02:17,630
you've got a definitional problem
as well as an empirical problem.

55
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,913
And so

56
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,110
there have been,

57
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,180
and this was especially true in the 1990s

58
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,930
people have been studying intelligence
Iq intelligence since the 1920s and it is

59
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:32,400
a very well established
branch of psychology.

60
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,470
One of the things I have
to tell you about it,

61
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:39,450
Iq research is that if
you don't buy Iq research,

62
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,210
you might as well throw away
all the rest of psychology.

63
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,290
And the reason for that
is that the psychologists,

64
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:46,831
first of all,

65
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:50,670
who developed intelligence testing
were among the early psychologists who

66
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:55,671
instantiated the statistical techniques
that all psychologists use to verify and

67
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,570
test all of their hypotheses.

68
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,500
So you end up throwing the baby out with
the bath water and the Iq people have

69
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:05,860
defined intelligence in a more stringent,

70
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:10,890
stringent and accurate way than we've
been able to define almost any other

71
00:03:10,931 --> 00:03:12,520
psychological construct.

72
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:15,640
And so if you toss out the
one that's most well defined,

73
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,100
then you're kind of stuck with the problem
of what are you going to do with all

74
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:22,120
the ones that you have leftover that are
nowhere near as well defined or as well

75
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,470
measured or as,

76
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,240
or as or,

77
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:29,860
or who's predictive validity is much
less than it has been demonstrated with

78
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:32,920
much less vigor and clarity anyways,

79
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,480
despite all that people have posited a
number of different intelligences and

80
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,800
reasonably so because there's a,

81
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,850
if you think of intelligence as that
which might move you forward successfully

82
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,234
in the world,

83
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,020
obviously there's a fair number of
phenomena that are associated with

84
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,000
individuals that might
fit into that category.

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,833
So we have

86
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:59,060
people have made these distinctions.

87
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,710
Bob Sternberg for example,

88
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:07,210
is distinguished between practical versus
analytical intelligence and he kind of

89
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:11,860
thinks of practical as like street smarts
and has attempted to dissociate that

90
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:15,250
from the kind of analytical
intelligence that um,

91
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,040
that characterize this
more straight Iq research.

92
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,590
I don't think he's done it
successfully as well at all.

93
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:25,591
And since the 1990s interest in his
practical intelligence has declined

94
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:30,691
precipitously because when it is
matched head to head with standard Iq

95
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:31,594
intelligence,

96
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,420
the IQ intelligence seats
up pull the variability.

97
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:38,260
What's really happened as far as I can
tell so far is that when we're trying to

98
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,960
predict people's course through life,

99
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,850
Iq does a very good job and then one of
the traits does a very good job as well,

100
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:47,800
which is conscientiousness,

101
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,770
but it doesn't do as good a job as Iq.

102
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,280
Now that partly might be because we can't
measure conscientiousness very well.

103
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,320
We're stuck with self reports or maybe
I could gather peer reports about you or

104
00:05:00,321 --> 00:05:04,220
I could gather your parents reports
about your teachers reports and each of

105
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:08,900
those seems to pick up a little bit
more of the pattern because you know

106
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:09,441
yourself,

107
00:05:09,441 --> 00:05:12,980
but other people know you differently
than you know yourself and there's still

108
00:05:12,981 --> 00:05:14,000
some accuracy in that.

109
00:05:14,001 --> 00:05:18,110
You can get multiple rater reports of
something like conscientiousness and

110
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:18,621
that'll up.

111
00:05:18,621 --> 00:05:19,760
It's predictive validity.

112
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:21,410
But in the final analysis,

113
00:05:21,411 --> 00:05:24,710
the best you seem to be able to deal
with conscientiousness is about a 0.4

114
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:26,900
correlation with longterm performance.

115
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:29,120
Whereas with Iq in complex jobs,

116
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:34,121
you can probably get 0.5 and maybe
0.6 and so 0.5 is 25% of the variance.

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,840
You've got to square it.

118
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:41,050
Point six is 30% 36% of the variance
and 0.4 is 16% of the variance.

119
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,490
So even at the low end,

120
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,970
let's say high end for conscientiousness
is 0.4 or 16% low end for Iq is 0.5 or

121
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,160
25% low.

122
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,210
And estimates of Iq make it one and a
half times more powerful than the high end

123
00:05:56,211 --> 00:05:57,044
estimates of.

124
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,330
And I think that's about right.

125
00:05:59,480 --> 00:05:59,931
You'd think,

126
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:01,610
why do we even have to debate this?

127
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:05,240
And because it's so bloody obvious to me
that intelligence is a major predictor

128
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:06,080
of life success.

129
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:07,340
I mean you people,

130
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,890
I've measured the Iq of
University of Toronto people,

131
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:10,730
you know,

132
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:14,240
people in this room who have an
Iq of less than 120 are rare.

133
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:14,961
Well,

134
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:15,794
why?

135
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,340
Well,

136
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:18,200
smart people go to university now.

137
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:20,720
Is that actually a contentious statement?

138
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,760
What shouldn't be a contentious statement?

139
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:23,660
It's self evident.

140
00:06:23,661 --> 00:06:27,350
Universities were actually set up so
that smart people could expand their

141
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:27,861
abilities.

142
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:28,970
That's why they were there.
