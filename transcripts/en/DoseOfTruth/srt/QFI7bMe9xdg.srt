1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,293
The brain is,

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,300
has specialized subsystem,

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,590
but dynamic biological systems so you
can muck about with it quite a bit and

4
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:15,990
it'll set itself up in
slightly different ways.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:21,210
So the systems aren't
necessarily localized exactly
the same place in every one.

6
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,590
But roughly speaking,

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,220
everyone has those systems
and roughly speaking,

8
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:28,020
they're in the same place across people.

9
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,640
Now there's a lot of variability and it's
one of the things that makes you know,

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,430
Mri studies in the life very difficult
to interpret because if you average

11
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,600
across a lot of people,

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,150
what it means is you're blur things out,

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:39,901
you know,

14
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:42,990
cause you can only extract out what the
commonalities and although you know,

15
00:00:42,991 --> 00:00:44,790
they're getting better and
better at dealing with that,

16
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:45,624
so.

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:47,850
Okay.

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:48,683
Okay.

19
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,213
So

20
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,470
there's other ways that you
can think about the brain too.

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,380
These are all approaches
to understanding it.

22
00:00:58,381 --> 00:00:58,650
You know,

23
00:00:58,650 --> 00:00:59,210
there,

24
00:00:59,210 --> 00:00:59,560
I would,

25
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,510
I would say it's a very,

26
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:01,560
very complex thing.

27
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,131
In fact,

28
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,770
it's the most complex thing near it.

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,411
You know,

30
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:09,411
there are more patterns of combinations
of neural connections in your brain.

31
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:12,150
Then there are subatomic
particles in the universe.

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,230
So you are,

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:13,791
I know you,

34
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:15,690
you won't believe that cause
it doesn't seem possible.

35
00:01:15,691 --> 00:01:19,070
But you can do the math and you'll
figure out that it's actually write it.

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,160
So you're the most complicated
thing there is and by a lot.

37
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,120
And so in some sense there's
more space inside your head.

38
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,980
Then there is space outside your head.

39
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,410
It depends on how you conceptualize space,

40
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:31,651
you know,

41
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:36,360
because you can conceptualize space as
the number of ways that something can be

42
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:39,310
configured and that
state space and that's a,

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,910
that's a magnitude measurement,

44
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,211
you know,

45
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:43,770
and the distance between things,

46
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,870
well that's another way
of conceptualizing space.

47
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,150
But if you're wanting,

48
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,720
if you want to think about big,

49
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,730
what's inside you is,

50
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,910
I think that it's bigger
than what's outside.

51
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,860
You would certainly that
way in terms of complexity,

52
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:59,160
unless you factor in the
other brains know so.

53
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,190
So that's very much worth thinking
about means that you know,

54
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:05,610
what we don't understand about
the brain is going to fill many,

55
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:06,361
many books.

56
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:09,720
And one of the things we really
don't understand his consciousness,

57
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,310
people just don't get that.

58
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,960
And it doesn't really look,

59
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,291
you know,

60
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:18,000
you might think that consciousness is
an emergent late evolutionary function,

61
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:18,301
you know,

62
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,770
but it doesn't really look like that,

63
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:20,670
you know?

64
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,031
I mean,

65
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:23,070
when even when people become demented and,

66
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,311
and they,

67
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,710
you lose almost all of their
higher cortical function.

68
00:02:25,711 --> 00:02:27,540
There's no doubt there's still conscious.

69
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,580
And so consciousness might be way,

70
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:29,971
way,

71
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:31,350
way older than we think.

72
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,041
And in fact,

73
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,240
I think it's highly probable.

74
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,030
I don't think a hypothalamic
cat is unconscious.

75
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,460
It's certainly a wake,

76
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:38,371
you know,

77
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:42,030
and distinguishing between awake
and conscious is no easy thing.

78
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:42,661
You might say,

79
00:02:42,661 --> 00:02:42,871
well,

80
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,070
animals aren't conscious.

81
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:44,491
It's like,

82
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:44,910
well,

83
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,743
you know,

84
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,100
here's the thing.

85
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:48,691
You know,

86
00:02:48,691 --> 00:02:53,430
what people norm normally think is that
humans are different than other animals.

87
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:56,640
And so before you
anthropomorphize an animal,

88
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,230
you should be careful.

89
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,190
But I think that's complete rubbish.

90
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,900
I think it's exactly the opposite.

91
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,800
Before you assumed that humans
have attributes that animals don't,

92
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,410
you have to prove it
because there's continuity,

93
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,431
tremendous,

94
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,900
tremendous continuity.

95
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,320
And so it's right to
anthropomorphize animals.

96
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,600
What's wrong is to presume a priority
that humans are qualitatively different.

97
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:19,991
Now,

98
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,940
there are some very
bizarre things about us.

99
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:22,923
Obviously,

100
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,970
you know these,

101
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,470
we have opposable thumbs.

102
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,640
That's a big deal.

103
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,780
We can grip things.

104
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,250
That's a massive deal,

105
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,880
you know,

106
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,700
and it turns out that there's another,

107
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,181
your,

108
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:34,660
your,

109
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:35,170
your,

110
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:40,170
your brain maps your body onto
its surface onto its motor strip,

111
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:41,440
and it's sensory strip,

112
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,630
which are roughly here on the brain.

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,830
And if you take the motor strip or
the sensory strip and you make a

114
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:51,070
representation of how
it represents the body,

115
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:52,470
which is called a Homerun,

116
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,171
keyless wielder,

117
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,410
Penfield wilder Penfield still did
this first at McGill university.

118
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,520
He,

119
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,640
I don't know if you know this and
perhaps you'll be fortunate enough to

120
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,474
experience it,

121
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:06,430
but people who have brain surgery
are conscious when it happens.

122
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,420
And that's so that the surgeons can figure
out whether this little part is doing

123
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,100
anything important
before they take it out.

124
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:12,430
You know,

125
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,900
it's a very horrific thought.
