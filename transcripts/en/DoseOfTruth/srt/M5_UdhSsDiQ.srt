1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:07,060
Given that,

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:10,880
I know that people vary in their
cognitive abilities tremendously and that

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:13,340
that's actually an important
determinant of their life outcome,

4
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,174
it seems to me.

5
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:17,960
So let's say someone tests
out in an Iq of around 150,

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,701
and so you can say,

7
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:19,971
look,

8
00:00:19,971 --> 00:00:20,390
you know,

9
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,500
you're pretty damn smart.

10
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:21,980
You're,

11
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,560
you're up above 85% of
the general population.

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,320
You,

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,153
you could,

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,540
you could probably do a pretty damn good
job as an undergraduate and university

15
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,800
if you were also disciplined,

16
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:31,461
right?

17
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:32,420
If you were conscientious,

18
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,380
he hit the books hard,

19
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,573
you're going to,

20
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,400
you're going to come out in the
top core tile of your class,

21
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,980
assuming that you're not
at a spectacularly success,

22
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:40,850
uh,

23
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,800
spectacularly selective university,

24
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:47,900
but you're going to have a much more
difficult time as a master's student and

25
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:49,580
phd level stuff is going to be,

26
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,400
you're going to be pushing your
luck too to really master that.

27
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:53,643
But you know,

28
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,763
you could be,

29
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:55,400
here's a,

30
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,600
here's a domain of,

31
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,150
of,

32
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,983
of,

33
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,053
uh,

34
00:00:59,090 --> 00:00:59,811
what would you call it,

35
00:00:59,811 --> 00:01:04,010
industrial organizational activity
where you could really be in the top 10

36
00:01:04,011 --> 00:01:04,730
percentile.

37
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,031
You know,

38
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:05,750
it's like,

39
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,750
so if you have an Iq of 115 like you
might make one bang up plumber and you

40
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:14,960
could have a spectacularly successful
career as a plumber and maybe as a manager

41
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:16,580
of other plumbers and all of that.

42
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:17,321
And you know,

43
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:20,570
and I mean I actually happened to
be a real FSCO now two of the trade.

44
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:22,700
So I certainly don't think of
that as something that's a,

45
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:26,210
that's a low quality or low
status occupation in the least.

46
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,523
But we would,

47
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,270
we would like to tell people,

48
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:30,133
okay,

49
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,010
here's,

50
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,383
here's,

51
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:33,973
here's a,

52
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:39,070
here's an intellectual domain that's
probably too high for you to be successful

53
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:40,304
without

54
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,850
working insane hours to,

55
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:44,330
to,

56
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:44,810
to,

57
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,650
to close the gap.

58
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,960
Because you can do that
with insane work up to some,

59
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,160
some limited degree.

60
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,590
But it seems to me that
the logical thing to do,

61
00:01:51,591 --> 00:01:56,000
at least in part is to give people
a sense of what their advantages and

62
00:01:56,001 --> 00:01:57,770
limitations are and then say to them,

63
00:01:57,771 --> 00:01:58,041
okay,

64
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:02,810
well given that here's a place that you
could go where you could be optimally

65
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:03,770
successful.

66
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:04,970
And so,

67
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,241
you know,

68
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:08,120
that's Kinda my take from a
policy perspective let's say.

69
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:09,860
But like what have you thought about,

70
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:10,694
you know,

71
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,870
the massive diversity and intellectual
ability mean what are the implications

72
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:17,360
from a policy perspective
as far as you're concerned?

73
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:17,691
Well,

74
00:02:17,691 --> 00:02:20,120
I think vocational
guidance is clearly one.

75
00:02:20,121 --> 00:02:25,100
I actually did some consulting and some
research for a nonprofit group called

76
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:26,960
the Johnson O'connor Foundation,

77
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:29,390
which is a vocational testing.

78
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,670
They're not that big on g,

79
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:34,010
but they have their own battery of tests.

80
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,130
They bring someone in and do
a full day of cognitive tests.

81
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:44,801
And from that they give some advice about
what kinds of professions match their

82
00:02:46,521 --> 00:02:48,590
cognitive strengths and weaknesses.

83
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,790
And I actually did some brain imaging,

84
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,630
uh,

85
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,480
on their test and was Neil.

86
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,890
Very interesting stuff.

87
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,083
Um,

88
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,560
do you think they do see it?

89
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,640
Cause it's to do the
psychometrics properly with
regards to vocational guidance

90
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,530
because we don't really know.

91
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,030
We don't have a good handle on how to
classify jobs into their various subtypes.

92
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:12,310
Like John Holland has done
some good work doing that.

93
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:12,880
But,

94
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,520
but there's so many jobs
and it's hard to figure out,

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,730
well what makes two jobs
the same or similar,

96
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,280
you know?

97
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:19,431
No,

98
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:23,240
I was at Hopkins when Harlan was there
and some of my friends were graduate

99
00:03:23,241 --> 00:03:27,830
students work for him and I learned
all about that vocational testing.

100
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:28,880
It's very powerful.

101
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:30,500
And as you know it's,

102
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,910
that's more his,

103
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:36,911
his scales have kind of morphed
into more personality like dementia.

104
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:37,550
Yeah.

105
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:38,383
What about that's it.

106
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,050
You want it map the,

107
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,420
well that's exactly the nexus
that we want to play out.

108
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:41,781
It's like,

109
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:42,530
okay,

110
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:43,820
because there is a reason,

111
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,650
I know people have been mapping Hollins
Homans job categories onto the big five

112
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:50,330
and we have a fair bit of success,

113
00:03:50,331 --> 00:03:50,960
you know,

114
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,500
and we're hoping that the differentiation
down to the to 10 levels of

115
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,690
personality will provide
even more precision.

116
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,560
But,

117
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,800
but with more general policy let,

118
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:00,111
okay,

119
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:00,621
so fine.

120
00:04:00,621 --> 00:04:01,190
So

121
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,230
reasonable vocational counseling,

122
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,670
that's a good idea.

123
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,990
When does it start?

124
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,790
Does it start in junior high?

125
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:08,840
Like do you do what

126
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,570
the Europeans do and start
to track people into trades?

127
00:04:11,571 --> 00:04:11,960
And,

128
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,250
and,

129
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,380
and higher education at
that kind of early age.

130
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,070
Europeans seem to have had
great success with that.

131
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,140
So it's certainly the
Germans in particular.

132
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,470
Yeah.

133
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:23,420
So it's reasonable to look at.

134
00:04:23,421 --> 00:04:25,460
But the problem in the United States,

135
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:27,590
there were so many
problems with the way we

136
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:34,630
conceptualize education and
the whole idea of tracking,

137
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,830
I don't know how it is in Canada,

138
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:38,360
but in the United States,

139
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:42,040
this idea of tracking has a
very negative valence to it.

140
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,540
You know,

141
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,920
segregating the smart kids into one,

142
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,300
one a set of classes and the
less smart kids in daughters.

143
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:53,850
And then there's remedial education and,

144
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:55,580
and there's been a tendency,

145
00:04:55,581 --> 00:05:00,581
a strong tendency in the United States
to feel that kids learn from each other.

146
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:04,610
So you don't want homogeneous
groups based on learning ability.

147
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,713
Your want.

148
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:06,321
Yeah.

149
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:06,630
Yeah.

150
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:07,251
So funny.

151
00:05:07,251 --> 00:05:12,230
So because it's so funny because the
people say that with regards to two,

152
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:13,700
let's say academic achievement,

153
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:18,050
but they play exactly the opposite stomach
when it comes to such things as has

154
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:19,250
childhood sports.

155
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:19,791
You know?

156
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:21,890
So if you look at football for example,

157
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:22,281
it's like,

158
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:22,491
well,

159
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:22,821
hey,

160
00:05:22,821 --> 00:05:24,260
let's segregate like ability.

161
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:27,560
It's like you don't have the people who
stumble around on the field dropping the

162
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:28,341
ball all the time,

163
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,140
play with the top end quarterbacks,

164
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:32,150
and nobody thinks there's
a problem with that.

165
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:32,991
If they don't say,

166
00:05:32,991 --> 00:05:33,141
well,

167
00:05:33,141 --> 00:05:35,810
everyone learns from everyone
else in that situation.

168
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:40,811
So to me it speaks more of a refusal to
admit to the stark reality that there

169
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:45,890
are massive cognitive differences between
people and to try to actually start to

170
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,930
address that with some
degree of seriousness.
