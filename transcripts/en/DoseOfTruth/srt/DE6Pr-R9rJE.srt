1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,550
Dark prior to says how can you dispute
the theory that Jesus is just a rewrite

2
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,840
of the Sun God myth?

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,431
Well,

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:16,590
I wouldn't necessarily
dispute that theory.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:17,730
Um,

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,830
although I would dispute the just,

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,480
I mean the strange things
about the biblical stories
and let's say about the new

8
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:28,500
testament stories is that they echo
across multiple levels of analysis.

9
00:00:28,501 --> 00:00:33,501
And so there is an astrological
element to the Christ story.

10
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:34,740
Um,

11
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:37,680
that Yo wrote about a fair
bit in the book called Ion,

12
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:39,120
which is a very terrifying book.

13
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,940
And there are examples of
the myths of the Sun God.

14
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:42,690
And,

15
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,580
but the funny thing is,

16
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,640
and this is one of the things I can't
really understand about the biblical

17
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:48,031
stories,

18
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:52,830
is that they manifest themselves at
multiple levels of interpretation

19
00:00:52,831 --> 00:00:53,850
simultaneously.

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,570
And you could say that that's merely
a consequence of continual historical

21
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:58,231
reworking.

22
00:00:58,231 --> 00:01:00,540
And I suppose that could be the case,

23
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:05,541
but the fact that they manifest themselves
as a personal story and as a cosmic

24
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:10,410
story and as a historical story and as
a mythological story and that it all

25
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,630
works at the same time strikes me as,

26
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,710
as pointing to something that's really
somewhat beyond our current level of

27
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:17,544
understanding.

28
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,853
Um,

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:19,851
again,

30
00:01:19,851 --> 00:01:23,100
to elaborate on that a lot because it
would take us into places that I really

31
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:24,120
would rather not go,

32
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:29,121
but I do believe that like there's
something synchronous using Young's

33
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,330
terminology about the,

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,080
about death and resurrection story.

35
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,420
And the syncronous element is,

36
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,800
is associated with the fact that the
story echoes across so many levels of

37
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,634
analysis.

38
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,030
And my sense is that when something
echoes across many levels of analysis,

39
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:51,150
that means that it's approaching
something like a very deep truth.

40
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,380
So I know that isn't normally how we
go about determining what constitutes

41
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:55,801
truth,

42
00:01:55,801 --> 00:02:00,300
but we don't know everything about how
to determine what constitutes truth yet.

43
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:04,060
And there are many things that
we have yet to figure out,

44
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:04,601
can that,

45
00:02:04,601 --> 00:02:05,371
certainly one of them,

46
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:06,390
as far as I'm concerned.

47
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:09,660
So there is a Sun God myth element,

48
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,570
certainly parallels
between Christ and Horace,

49
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,404
for example.

50
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,071
But,

51
00:02:14,071 --> 00:02:14,904
um,

52
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,540
that doesn't mean you can
just say it's just a rewrite.

53
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,410
Um,

54
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:20,340
I don't think that the,

55
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,510
I don't think that that's historically
or a psychologically accurate.

56
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:25,810
Um.
