1
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,060
Let me read this to you and
then we'll get to the Q.

2
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:10,151
And.

3
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:10,640
A.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,630
I think this,

5
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:16,450
this is the kind of thing that I'd like
to shed light on in any possible lecture

6
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:17,590
series on marks.

7
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:22,150
So this is called invocation
of one in despair.

8
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,260
So God has snatched from me my all
in the curse and rack of destiny.

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,520
All his worlds are gone beyond recall.

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:38,580
Nothing but revenge is
left to me on myself.

11
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,430
Revenge all proudly wreak on that being
that enthroned Lord make my strength a

12
00:00:45,711 --> 00:00:47,530
patchwork of what's week.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,050
Leave my better self without reward,

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,060
I shall build my throne.

15
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,410
High overhead,

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:54,423
cold,

17
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:57,970
tremendous shell at summit
be for it's bulwark,

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,510
superstitious dread for it's Marshall,

19
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,960
blackest agony who looks on it with a
healthy I shall turn back struck deathly

20
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:13,561
Pale and dumb clutched by blind and chill
mortality made his happiness prepare

21
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:15,934
his too.

22
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:20,980
And the Almighty's lightning shell
rebound from that massive iron giant.

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,980
If he bring my walls and towers down,

24
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,591
he turned it.

25
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:28,060
He shall raise them up defiant.

26
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:30,701
Well,

27
00:01:30,701 --> 00:01:32,080
so on that happy note,

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,560
that's perhaps perhaps some insight into
the spirit that motivated our friend Mr

29
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:40,150
Carl Marx.

30
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,343
So

31
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:47,560
I've really been thinking a lot about
the Marxist critique of Western culture,

32
00:01:47,561 --> 00:01:49,330
especially if fundamental,

33
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,693
um,

34
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,750
Marxist critique is something eight
fundamental Mar Marxist critique is a

35
00:01:57,130 --> 00:02:00,520
criticism of the fact that
in capitalist societies,

36
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:01,930
uh,

37
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,480
a disproportionate amount of the spoils,

38
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:09,481
let's say the wealth goes
to a disproportionately
small part of the community.

39
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:12,970
And this is of course a truism by the way,

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,530
it is the case that that occurs,

41
00:02:14,531 --> 00:02:17,980
which is why the richest dozen people
in the world have as much money as the

42
00:02:17,981 --> 00:02:18,910
bottom 2 billion,

43
00:02:18,911 --> 00:02:19,744
something like that.

44
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,860
Um,

45
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,030
it's also the case,

46
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,580
it's part of a more generalized law,

47
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,660
sometimes called price's
law and represented with
the peritoneal distribution.

48
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:33,661
Perico is p a r e t o showing that
not only do the bulk of the spoils,

49
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:38,740
let's say the wealth go to a
disproportionately small number of people,

50
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,330
but the bulk of the productive work is
also done by a disproportionately small

51
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,110
number of people,

52
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,420
not necessarily the same
people that have the wealth.

53
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,140
By the way,

54
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,880
although in a functional society,

55
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:49,870
there's some overlap.

56
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,640
Now Mark's was correct and observing that
that happened in capitalist societies,

57
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,510
but incorrect in assuming that there
are any societies that have ever been

58
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,140
formulated or that could
ever be formulated that would
escape from that destiny.

59
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:06,760
Because you see that same
tremendous Pareto distribution,

60
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:09,370
that proclivity of wealth to,

61
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,940
to accrue in the hands of small
of a small number of people.

62
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,700
You see that in every human
society that's ever been studied.

63
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:16,570
And if it's not wealth,

64
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,500
it's sexual access or reproductive,

65
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,020
well that's the same thing.

66
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:21,520
Reproductive Opportunity,

67
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:22,354
let's say,

68
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,020
or,

69
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:23,853
or,

70
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,723
or,

71
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,230
or material possessions,

72
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:27,730
which is obviously a form of wealth,

73
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:28,564
et cetera.

74
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,920
So one of the things that
characterizes the west is that all our,

75
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,320
although our society's
produced inequality,

76
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,760
like every other society,

77
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,050
including animal societies,

78
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,680
by the way,

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,880
and even among plants,

80
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:40,990
even among stars,

81
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:44,590
a disproportionate number of the
heavenly bodies have most of the mass,

82
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:45,310
by the way,

83
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,460
which is not something that you can
lay at the feet of western capitalism.

84
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,793
Um,

85
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,180
the thing that the West
has been able to do

86
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,630
that other societies haven't been able
to do is to produce wealth along with

87
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,464
inequality.

88
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,390
And that wealth is definitely

89
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:08,370
a fair proportion of that
wealth is actually going to
benefit the people who are

90
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,910
in the diarists straights.

91
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,360
And that process has been
accelerating over the last 20 years.

92
00:04:13,361 --> 00:04:17,650
So from the year 2000 till the year 2012,

93
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:20,260
the level of absolute poverty
in the world has halved,

94
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,680
which is the fastest rate of economic
development in the history of the world.

95
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,810
And I think that rate is accelerating,

96
00:04:25,811 --> 00:04:28,030
at least in part because the Soviet Union,

97
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,631
for example,

98
00:04:28,631 --> 00:04:33,631
isn't around anymore to agitate the
economic masters in leaders of developing

99
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,990
countries into the adoption of
counterproductive collectivist economic

100
00:04:37,991 --> 00:04:38,824
strategies.

101
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,870
And so what appears to be happening is
that as we spread the fundamental western

102
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:48,310
ethos of individuality and private
property and free markets and freedom in

103
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:50,740
general for men and for
women around the world,

104
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:52,420
that the poorest people are becoming,

105
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,010
well at least they're not starving.

106
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:57,220
They're becoming richer even though at
the same time we do pay a price for that

107
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:58,930
in inequality.

108
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,620
So there's a rule and I don't know how
to formulate it exactly are there seems

109
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:07,621
to be a rule which is a given unit of
wealth is produced at the cost of of

110
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,850
certain production of inequality,

111
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,720
a certain number of units of inequality
and that seems to be inalienable to some

112
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:14,554
degree.

113
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,850
So anyways,

114
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,640
that's part of a Marxist
critique the poem first,

115
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:22,840
which is like you want to listen to
that poem a couple of times I would say,

116
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,730
but then more fundamentally a critique
of the Marxist critique of the West.

117
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,211
Yes,

118
00:05:28,211 --> 00:05:29,800
the West produces inequality,

119
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,260
but it's not something that you
could lay at the feet of capitalism.

120
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:32,831
It's a much,

121
00:05:32,831 --> 00:05:34,030
much deeper problem.

122
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,810
And what that means too is that those
people who purport to be on the side of

123
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:41,770
the poor and dispossessed are not being
friends to them by any stretch of the

124
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:46,210
imagination at all by attempting to tear
down the very hierarchies that seemed

125
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:49,930
to be leveraging the world's poorest
people out of poverty as rapidly as

126
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:50,764
possible.

127
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,980
There's evidence as well that people
start to become very concerned about the

128
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:54,431
environment.

129
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:55,990
If you can get their family income,

130
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,250
I think are its GDP,

131
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,370
I think up about 40 f above
about 4,500 us a year.

132
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,700
They start to have a little bit of
spare time to be concerned with the

133
00:06:04,701 --> 00:06:05,720
environment around them.

134
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,610
And so the right way to,

135
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,550
to ecological balance in
the world seems to be,

136
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,480
um,

137
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,770
to make people rich as fast as we possibly
can to make the poor rich as fast as

138
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:16,604
we possibly can.

139
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,130
And wouldn't that be lovely if
that was really the way out.
