1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,140
For coming tonight.

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:17,050
[inaudible] you

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:19,860
need to read this.

4
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:20,760
The second city,

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,790
I just came back from London.

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,680
I talked to Sam parents.

7
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,740
That's Murray,

8
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,740
so I was very interesting and
hopefully those videos in August,

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,581
that's the plan.

10
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:34,380
Once they're all properly edited,

11
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,060
if for some point in all of that,

12
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:39,540
they're not going to be edited
for content just for quality.

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,441
That's the plan.

14
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:41,274
Anyways,

15
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,540
it's very nice to see all of you here
to partake in what I hope will be,

16
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,160
what will be a serious
of useful and meaningful.

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,560
I want him to talk to you tonight.

18
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,100
I told her I'd take you through 12 rules
for life through the lens of courage.

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,940
It's a nice virtue to contemplate a
good entry point into the content of the

20
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:12,001
book.

21
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:16,890
Can I use these lectures as an
opportunity to take past what I've already

22
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:21,891
written to try to make it more coherent
and to try to push my thinking in new

23
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:28,851
directions and so that it stays fresh
and vital and so that I learned something

24
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,870
because you can learn
something by thinking,

25
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:32,670
which is generally why people do it.

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,670
So I wanted to tell you some things.

27
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,980
First of all about stealing.

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,953
Um,

29
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,460
theories and instinct.

30
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,680
We have a separate neural for theater.

31
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:53,460
It's the circuit that's affected by
drugs that you might take like alcohol,

32
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,240
because alcohol is a very
powerful and to anxiety.

33
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,590
Anxiety and fear are very similar.

34
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,671
Technically,

35
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,910
people think of ancient anxiety as a
fear of something that some nonspecific,

36
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:04,290
you know,

37
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,250
you'd like to feel anxiety about going
to a park or a new job or something like

38
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:08,461
that.

39
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,620
Word might have a phobia,

40
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,260
might be afraid of spiders
or snakes or for myself or,

41
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,360
or some port Allen elevators or being
exposed to the outside world that Viagra

42
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,223
phobia.

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,250
So fear is usually if something specific
and anxiety is that something more

44
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,084
general.

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,470
But in any case,

46
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:29,970
we haven't fear circuit,

47
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,770
it's very old.

48
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,350
It's designed to stop
us from being damaged.

49
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:39,180
So essentially you become afraid of
things that might damage it might hurt

50
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,740
review.

51
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,470
We can reframe.

52
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,790
You become afraid of things that might
punish and you have a separate circuit

53
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:45,660
for pain too,

54
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:47,280
which is a response to punishment.

55
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,760
So pain is usually a signal that
something's about to damage.

56
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:55,950
Some that or something is damaging
that's more accurate and pain is a pain.

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,970
Pain can be staved off opiates,

58
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:02,440
right.

59
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,360
Those are technically analgesics.

60
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,740
It's fear and anxiety.

61
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,340
It can be staved off by NGS.

62
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,430
I'll let it's technically speaking.

63
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,380
Those include the alcohol had
been such as paints like Valium,

64
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Xanax and so forth and instruments
which are not very commonly used it more

65
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:24,730
medically or for nonmedical
state recreational purposes,

66
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:30,450
but alcohol is a drug that people
really liked because it dampens fear and

67
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:31,150
anxiety,

68
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,140
which is what people,

69
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,820
it's one of the many reasons
that people use alcohol,

70
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,220
social circumstances.

71
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,340
Alcohol is a variety of neurochemical
effects that vary substantially depending

72
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:45,940
on who it is constricting because people
are differentially sensitive to that

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,770
neurochemical effects of alcohol.

74
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,760
Some people,

75
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,510
especially people with social anxiety
who are sensitive to the anxiety,

76
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:56,290
letting properties like to drink if they
are in a social circumstance because it

77
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,840
makes them less afraid and I sang as
you're seeing other people also get out of

78
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,160
stimulant kicked.

79
00:04:02,161 --> 00:04:02,491
Got It.

80
00:04:02,491 --> 00:04:02,921
Alcohol,

81
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:07,030
if you're one of those people that has
a hard time stopping when you start

82
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:10,660
drinking and you'd probably get a
stimulant and kicking from alcohol,

83
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,860
that's dangerous.

84
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,680
That's one of the things that can be
used and predispose you to alcoholism.

85
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,140
So if you have that response anywhere,

86
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,000
but it also means it,

87
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,110
you really enjoy a level.

88
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,980
So it's harder to be careful that
those circumstances because it's such a

89
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,080
wonderful drug,

90
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,913
if that's,

91
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,090
if that's the situation that you're in.

92
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,950
Do you have a separate fear circuit?

93
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,020
And the point of fear and anxiety is to
stop you when you see things that might

94
00:04:35,021 --> 00:04:39,130
damage pain signals that
you are being damaged,

95
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:42,790
series signifies that
you might be damaged.

96
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,660
And so it's a newer circuit from
an evolutionary perspective.

97
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,613
Then the pain,

98
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,560
because it takes a smarter animal.

99
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,170
It's one thing to get the hell
out of there when you're in pain,

100
00:04:53,171 --> 00:04:56,680
but it's another thing to be
wary when you might be in pain.

101
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:57,990
That's what fear is for.

102
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,890
And so it's a very unpleasant emotion,

103
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,281
of course,

104
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:02,140
although perhaps not as bad as pain.

105
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,353
Um,

106
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,080
and I guess that's the,

107
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,110
that's the logical substitute isn't,

108
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,500
it's not so bad and emotion compared
to pain you need here to protect you

109
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:12,850
because you can be heard.

110
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,270
So there's plenty of
things to be afraid of,

111
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:19,730
an anxious about in the world
because not only can you be hurt,

112
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,540
you know that you can be heard.

113
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:25,450
That's one of the things that really
distinguishes human beings from other

114
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,210
creatures.

115
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:27,100
We have a very,

116
00:05:27,101 --> 00:05:32,101
very clear apprehension of
our borders and limitations.

117
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:36,320
We know that even if there's nothing
that's making us anxious right here and

118
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,180
right now,

119
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,780
we know that there are things that might
come our way that are quite negative in

120
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:41,614
the future.

121
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,640
And so to some degree,

122
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:46,290
part of the reason that you would
beats are always so conscious of hyper

123
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,280
consciousness because we weld
them safe as we aren't right now.

124
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,980
Something is still lurking
around the corner that might,

125
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,780
that might do a CMP.

126
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,940
If you watch animals like
zebras hold on the African film,

127
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,650
they're pretty strange in some ways
that their cognitive resources in their

128
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:08,840
emotional responses are quite limited.

129
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,650
You know,

130
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:13,460
Zebra heard can be surrounded by lions
and as long as the lions aren't getting a

131
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:17,590
hunting configuration is he was don't
really seem to mind the alliance,

132
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,500
which seems a little bit shortsighted on
their part if the Zealand don't seem to

133
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:24,380
be able to figure out what
those sweeping lions are.

134
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:27,710
Also the same lines that are
going to need them tomorrow.

135
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:31,810
But I guess maybe the advantage of
being a zebra and not caring about the

136
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,610
sleeping minds is that while
you don't have to be nervous,

137
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:38,450
except when you're being hunted to where
as human beings in a situation like

138
00:06:38,451 --> 00:06:40,670
that would be thinking those damn lions,

139
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,840
they look like they're sleeping.

140
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,740
But you know what,

141
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,090
they'll be up to tomorrow.

142
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:48,950
And of course we do know what things
will be up to tomorrow and that means we

143
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,770
can protect ourselves and
it's what's coming tomorrow.

144
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:54,710
But it's at the cost of eternal vigilance.

145
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,950
And so that's part of the reason why
we're susceptible to drugs like and spasm

146
00:07:00,261 --> 00:07:00,871
beats and barbecue.

147
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:05,871
It's an alcohol because those drugs
to help us quell our internal anxiety.

148
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,980
And so now with when psychologists
for starting to study fear,

149
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,140
they thought about it wrong.

150
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,890
Um,

151
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:19,280
but I'm going to go through the way they
thought about it because sometimes if

152
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:20,720
you think about something wrong,

153
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,030
you think about it wrong
in an interesting way.

154
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:26,990
And if you think about
something in detail wrong,

155
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,950
at least then you can learn exactly why
you're wrong and maybe you could figure

156
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,780
out how not to be wrong with you.

157
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:33,650
Keep thinking,

158
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,870
which is part of the reason by the way,

159
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:39,770
that free speech is so important
because in order to get to the truth,

160
00:07:39,771 --> 00:07:42,770
you have to do a lot of
wandering through error.

161
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:47,830
And so you have to be allowed and even
encouraged to be stumbling realm and

162
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:48,770
stupid,

163
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,680
careless and objectionable,

164
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,890
offensive and all of those
things in your speech.

165
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,590
Because if you can't come around stupidly,

166
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,270
you're never going to be able to think
anything through because you have to know

167
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:06,920
how to speak properly to begin
with about something complex.

168
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:10,880
If you're going to do it properly and
you don't know how to do complicated

169
00:08:10,881 --> 00:08:14,120
things that you don't understand property
and so you're not going to speak about

170
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:16,550
this very well and so it'd be
good to speak about them at all,

171
00:08:16,551 --> 00:08:17,990
which you have to want
to learn about them.

172
00:08:17,991 --> 00:08:21,520
Then you have to be encouraged
to stumble around badly.

173
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,060
I have this program and that
some of you might be interested.

174
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,650
It's part of the self authoring suite,

175
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:32,000
which is a sequence of writing programs
that my colleagues and I generated to

176
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,980
help people clinically.

177
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:38,981
I would say we were trying to figure out
how we could bring clinically powerful

178
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,900
technologies to a mass
market at a very low cost.

179
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,050
We discovered through reading the
relevant literature and through our own

180
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:51,740
scientific research that if you
had people write about uncertainty,

181
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,980
then that would make them more
productive and more engaged,

182
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,243
healthier.

183
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,930
Many people have done
research of that sort.

184
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,650
No,

185
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,381
not off put by it.

186
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:02,940
It needs to be definitely in my class.

187
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:07,210
The first program was passed off free
program and it helps people write and

188
00:09:07,211 --> 00:09:08,350
structured autobiography.

189
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:12,150
So it helps you divide your life up
into six parts and then great about the

190
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:17,040
emotionally significant events in
each of those epoxy or s section.

191
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,120
There's a hint in,

192
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,650
this is some three to think about.

193
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:22,110
It's very relevant to the
topic of tonight's talk.

194
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:27,560
If you have a memory that's older than
about 18 months and there's a reason for

195
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:28,434
that by the way,

196
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,620
but what we'll say 18 months from now
and when you bring that memory to mind,

197
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:37,440
it's still causes an emotional reaction
and I'm thinking mostly about a negative

198
00:09:37,441 --> 00:09:38,310
emotion reaction.

199
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,350
That means that you haven't
fully processed that memory
and it's still weighing

200
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,340
down on you.

201
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,120
And I mean one of the things your
brain is always trying to do is try to

202
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:50,970
calculate how dangerous
the current environment is.

203
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:54,180
And the answer that is something like,

204
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,113
uh,

205
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,890
your brain assumes the current environment
is dangerous in proportion to the

206
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:01,830
number of things that have occurred in
your life and you haven't been able to

207
00:10:01,831 --> 00:10:02,760
figure out.

208
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,700
So the more things that
you haven't figured out,

209
00:10:05,701 --> 00:10:06,890
the more dangerous you're very,

210
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:09,840
this is the environment is and
the price you paid for that.

211
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:12,650
If you're more anxious and not only that,

212
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,190
you produce more stress hormones,

213
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,450
especially cortisol.

214
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,910
And the problem with
producing excess cortisol,

215
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:18,980
you need to produce some,

216
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:20,190
it helps wake you up in the morning.

217
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:24,180
But if you produce excess excess
portal that makes you cool.

218
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:30,110
And so it contributes to virtually every
degenerative physiological process that

219
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:30,954
we know of.

220
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,960
And so cleaning up your past
is actually a really good idea.

221
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:34,890
You know,

222
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:37,260
if something that happened in a long time,

223
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,340
it goes to a baud assume.

224
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,670
The reason for that is,

225
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:43,050
is that the emotional systems,

226
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:45,750
the underlying emotional systems
that helping process the world,

227
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:49,530
especially the emotions
that are associated with
fear and anxiety are telling

228
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:54,531
you that you have encountered
something in your pathway in,

229
00:10:54,541 --> 00:10:55,170
in your,

230
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,150
in your past,

231
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,870
in your past that you did on master,

232
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:04,620
and it still would present a danger
to you if you encountered begin.

233
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:05,981
And so it's,

234
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:10,230
it's interesting to contemplate that
because we don't often think about the

235
00:11:10,231 --> 00:11:11,310
purpose of memory.

236
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,031
We think,

237
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:12,330
well,

238
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,390
the purpose of memories
to remember the past,

239
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:16,170
that's actually not true.

240
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,580
The purpose of memory is to extract the
information hope from the past so you

241
00:11:20,581 --> 00:11:23,280
don't do the same damn
stupid thing than once.

242
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,950
And then that truly is
the purpose of memory.

243
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:26,960
That is how your,

244
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,830
that's how your memories are constructed.

245
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,660
That's how your mind looks at the past.

246
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:35,790
What you're trying to do is to map
out the world and you use your past

247
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:40,050
experience to elaborate up that map and
then you use that map to orient yourself

248
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:40,950
into the future.

249
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:41,431
Right?

250
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:44,250
So that's the derivation
of wisdom from the past.

251
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,270
And so,

252
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:45,631
you know,

253
00:11:45,631 --> 00:11:46,910
once you mastered fire,

254
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:48,330
you don't have to be burned,

255
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:48,810
right?

256
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,380
You could encounter and truly dangerous
things and you can learn how to master

257
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,580
them and then when you would
come to them in the future,

258
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,470
they're not dangerous.

259
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,610
And so that's perfect.

260
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,790
Like if you have something in
your past can still bought,

261
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,151
I just used.

262
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:04,480
That means that as far as your underlying
emotional systems are concerned,

263
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,760
you are not master of that event.

264
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:11,850
And that bothers some emotion will
never go away until you go back to that

265
00:12:12,641 --> 00:12:17,110
memory and you've figured out how it
was that you rendered vulnerable in that

266
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:21,520
situation and what you would have to do
now in order to reconfigure the way you

267
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:25,720
look at the world or the way that you
act so that that vulnerability with

268
00:12:25,721 --> 00:12:26,620
disappeared.

269
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,580
And so if you do the past offering
programming reasonably carefully,

270
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:31,330
um,

271
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,320
reasonably thoroughly,

272
00:12:32,321 --> 00:12:33,154
let's say,

273
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,023
um,

274
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,170
then you can,

275
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,510
you can find all those
things in your past.

276
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:40,210
If you haven't mastered your over common,

277
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,103
that can,

278
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:45,010
that will update you and it'll
make your map more differentiated.

279
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,000
It will make you more skillful
and drop your stress levels.

280
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:53,770
It's also a useful thing to do from a
conceptual perspective because as I said

281
00:12:53,771 --> 00:12:54,131
already,

282
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:57,970
partly what you're trying to do in
your life is mapped your way forward,

283
00:12:57,971 --> 00:12:58,450
right?

284
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:02,110
Because people are forward
moving creatures who are
always going from point a to

285
00:13:02,111 --> 00:13:02,950
point B.

286
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,181
We're,

287
00:13:03,181 --> 00:13:04,900
we're on a journey or an adventure.

288
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:05,690
And,

289
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:05,990
and,

290
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:06,330
and,

291
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:09,520
and you need to map out your
journey or your invention.

292
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:11,230
What do you need to
know where you're going,

293
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,250
obviously,

294
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,050
but you also have to know where you are.

295
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:14,321
You know,

296
00:13:14,321 --> 00:13:16,480
if you're using a map,

297
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,660
like an actual announcement,

298
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:20,530
it's completely useless to
just know where you're going.

299
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,550
You also have to know where the hell
you are and if you're scattered all over

300
00:13:24,551 --> 00:13:25,360
the place,

301
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
which is which,

302
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:27,460
which is really the case.

303
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:30,880
If there's a lot of things in your
past that are unresolved that it's

304
00:13:30,881 --> 00:13:34,360
extraordinarily hard to map your way
forward because you don't even know where

305
00:13:34,361 --> 00:13:35,350
to start.

306
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,030
And so that's,

307
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,310
that's a useful action socks.

308
00:13:38,330 --> 00:13:41,170
And I often encourage people to do that,

309
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:44,280
exercise that and that

310
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,110
reflects,

311
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:49,330
that's a reflection of what I first said.

312
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:51,040
It bubbles on speech.

313
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,173
Thank you.

314
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:55,000
You have to stumble around and won if
you're going to get to where you're going.

315
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:58,420
And so if you want to write about your
past and bring yourself up to date,

316
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,800
you don't have to do it perfectly,

317
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,620
but you definitely have to do it.

318
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:06,340
You have to confront those things in your
past are weighing you down and making

319
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:09,790
you better and making you're
resentful and freezing you in place.

320
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:10,541
And all of that.

321
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,610
And it's also the case.

322
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,090
We'll get to this in more
detail as we progress that.

323
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,163
Um,

324
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:17,970
you,

325
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:18,803
you

326
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,183
a minute.

327
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,860
So the second,

328
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,300
the second part of the,

329
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,750
of the self authoring suite helps you
identify your virtues and your calls front

330
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,780
of layer stating virtue for thinking.

331
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,820
We talked about faults
in the modern world,

332
00:14:36,821 --> 00:14:38,420
but we don't often talk about virtue to,

333
00:14:38,421 --> 00:14:40,150
it's kind of an old fashioned term,

334
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,030
but I picked it specifically for that
reason because Virtusa useful terms

335
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,510
virtually isn't,

336
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,940
it's an unbelievably useful term.

337
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,541
In fact,

338
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,830
it's fundamentally a term

339
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,980
rather than a moral term because your
virtues are precisely that kit of tools

340
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:01,940
that's that you have in hand
and help you contend the world.

341
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,270
It's best to think of virtues as
tools rather than characteristics.

342
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,080
And so if you've been identifying faults,

343
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,700
those are the things that are
obstacles to your progress.

344
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,300
And so by your own definition,

345
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,400
but say that's how the exercise is set
up and used a pseudonym you want and need

346
00:15:16,401 --> 00:15:16,851
something,

347
00:15:16,851 --> 00:15:17,810
you're pursuing it.

348
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,690
There's going to be elements of their
own character that get in the way.

349
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:22,520
You probably want to do
something about that,

350
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,290
assuming that you want to
get to where you're going.

351
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,990
And of course you do because if you
didn't want to get into areas you wouldn't

352
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,650
the positive as a
destination to begin with.

353
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,590
So obviously they want to
get there and if you are,

354
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,270
if you do want to get there and there
are things about the way you're behaving

355
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:40,610
in the world that are in the way and
obviously it would be better for you to

356
00:15:40,611 --> 00:15:41,330
rectify them.

357
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,950
So that's fair himself rather than,

358
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,750
and then equally it's equally the case
that some of characteristics that you

359
00:15:47,751 --> 00:15:52,580
have that will move you forward into
the world are going to be useful and you

360
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:55,490
should know how to capitalize on them
and you should be conscious of that

361
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:57,350
because why not be conscious of it.

362
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,740
It's useful to know yourself so that
you can use yourself more effectively.

363
00:16:03,211 --> 00:16:08,030
And then the final exercise is
the future authoring program.

364
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,310
We've had lots of fun with that.

365
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:15,640
I designed that years ago when I noticed
in my class this class online maps,

366
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:18,410
it's classical maps of meaning,

367
00:16:18,411 --> 00:16:23,210
which is the vote by well which
just came up in the audio version.

368
00:16:23,211 --> 00:16:23,900
By the way,

369
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,610
do you like 12 rules you might like,

370
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,713
absolutely.

371
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,830
It's a lot harder.

372
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,610
Um,

373
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,930
but it's also about papers.

374
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,580
So if you want to go paper,

375
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,930
well that's going to be harder,

376
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,823
often sleep.

377
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,240
But you know,

378
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,510
if,

379
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:39,590
if you found from 12 rules for life useful
than going deeper might even be more

380
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:40,424
useful.

381
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:42,590
And so the audio version
might be good for that.

382
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:43,663
Um,

383
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,553
when I,

384
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:45,580
that's uh,

385
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:49,790
it's a book about the story of your
life because your life is a story.

386
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:54,350
A story is a description of how you
move from point a to B and what sort of

387
00:16:54,351 --> 00:16:56,390
pitfalls you might
encounter along the way.

388
00:16:56,420 --> 00:17:01,220
How you fall apart in your journey
towards a higher good and how you put

389
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,600
yourself back together.

390
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,523
That's a story.

391
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:08,420
Maps of meaning is about what stories
are and what perhaps with the greatest

392
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:08,931
story is,

393
00:17:08,931 --> 00:17:12,880
which is a good thing to know since you
have to act out as four minus galacto

394
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,870
great one since what?

395
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,390
Since you don't have better

396
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:21,680
words,

397
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,371
they think about,

398
00:17:22,371 --> 00:17:26,900
so because the maps of meaning with
about stories and because I believe that

399
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:31,880
people's lives are misconstrued as stories
and perhaps even the reality itself

400
00:17:31,881 --> 00:17:36,710
as best construed as a story as otherwise
we wouldn't use stories to represented

401
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,970
so continually.

402
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:38,720
Um,

403
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,040
I had people write up,

404
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,340
start to write up the story of their,

405
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:43,640
their future life.

406
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,240
So it's kind of an interesting exercise.

407
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:48,743
Um,

408
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:49,240
it's,

409
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,740
it's,

410
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:53,550
it's related to rule 10 and 12 for life,

411
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,080
which is beat precisely.

412
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,040
You've speak,

413
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,090
no one's ever told me,

414
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,290
no one's ever really told why you
should be precise in your speech.

415
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:06,530
But the reason is for the same reason
that when you shoot a rifle at a target,

416
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,570
you aim at the center,

417
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,130
right?

418
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,190
It's not random.

419
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,080
You don't just sort of pointing your
gun and shoot approximately in the

420
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:17,490
direction of the target.

421
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:20,310
You specify it as precisely as you can.

422
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:22,590
And then you pull the trigger.

423
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,251
You might think,

424
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:23,461
well,

425
00:18:23,461 --> 00:18:28,461
it's a strange thing to use of say a
military analogy and analogy with weapons,

426
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:34,830
but it's not a strange thing at all
because if you think about the things that

427
00:18:34,831 --> 00:18:35,664
people do,

428
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,560
if you think about the
dramatic things that people do

429
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,880
where people are trying to hit the center
of targets all the time and we love

430
00:18:44,881 --> 00:18:45,990
them to see people do that.

431
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:46,830
We knew that with hockey,

432
00:18:46,831 --> 00:18:48,090
we do that with soccer,

433
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,680
baseball,

434
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:50,763
basketball,

435
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:54,900
like the idea of specifying a target
and the hitting the center of it or

436
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,780
something that we're absolutely obsessed
about that we're so obsessed that

437
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,850
together together new stadiums
and watch people do it.

438
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,990
It's only for reading,

439
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,290
contemplating what we're doing.

440
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:10,170
Do you see as a sports team,

441
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:10,501
it's a,

442
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:15,501
it's a cooperative and competitive
attachment to specify and hit a target and

443
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:21,120
we're so excited about that
probably because at least in part,

444
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:25,470
we're built physiologically on a hunting
platform and then throwing platform,

445
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:25,650
right?

446
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:30,580
I mean human beings can throat and we
can throw a punch or throw a ball and

447
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,590
throw a spear.

448
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,700
And that's a big deal.

449
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,290
That's a big part of what we are.

450
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:36,840
So we're target seeking creatures.

451
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,330
And so it'd be precise in your
speeches to specify the target with the

452
00:19:40,331 --> 00:19:40,820
specified.

453
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:44,640
The target is to have an aim and to have
an aim is to have a purpose and to aid

454
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,890
property institute attain your purpose,

455
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,210
at least in principle.

456
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,000
And so partly what we're
doing in the future,

457
00:19:51,001 --> 00:19:56,001
authoring Hams and sizes to specify
your purpose with your precise speech.

458
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,240
And so we asked people to,

459
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,700
well here's another thing to contemplate.

460
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,730
We are Amy creatures.

461
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,710
We're built on hunting platform.

462
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,890
We'd like to hit targets as
possible that we're good at it.

463
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,740
And then what that also
means is that well,

464
00:20:13,741 --> 00:20:16,620
if we aren't good at it and
that's part of what we are,

465
00:20:16,621 --> 00:20:20,200
then if you specify a target
and you might be headed,

466
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,860
and that's a hell of a thing.

467
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,280
There's a,

468
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
there's a statement in the New Testament,

469
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,020
it's quite a strange statement and it's a,

470
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,860
it's a,

471
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:32,490
it's a suggestion in the
suggestion is that if you knock,

472
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,380
the door will open and if you ask,

473
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,540
you will receive a new thing.

474
00:20:36,570 --> 00:20:41,040
Well that seems highly unlikely and
well it does seem highly unlikely,

475
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:41,520
right?

476
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,680
Being sure that's the
way the world is set up.

477
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,011
It's like,

478
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:44,730
you know,

479
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,570
that is our school,

480
00:20:45,571 --> 00:20:46,890
the way the world is set up,

481
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:48,810
it's a very strange thing and it's,

482
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,760
it's not that surprising if you
started thinking it through.

483
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:52,930
And so that mean after all,

484
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:56,830
prophetically through adapting to the
moral evolution has been working three and

485
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:59,500
a half billion years to produce you.

486
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,400
And so,

487
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,160
you know,

488
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,650
they could've done a better job,

489
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,790
but that's not such a bad job.

490
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:09,600
And so maybe she could attain your aim.

491
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:12,910
One of the things I've certainly learned
as a clinical psychologist once that a

492
00:21:12,911 --> 00:21:17,911
lot of the people that I saw who were
unhappy with their lives say new forties

493
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:23,440
and sometimes you're be within that and
who had him detained what they wanted

494
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:28,120
haven't attained in often in large part
because the never specified and the

495
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:33,121
probability that you're going to hit a
tiny target precisely without aiming at

496
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,650
it is zero.

497
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,260
That's not gonna happen so well.

498
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,190
So what would happen
if you would aim at it?

499
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,960
That's a question and how
it should be fast aim.

500
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,100
That's another question.

501
00:21:45,101 --> 00:21:46,060
And that's part of what,

502
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,490
12 rules for lights and it's about,

503
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,960
the second rule for example,

504
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:54,250
is a treat yourself like you're
someone responsible for helping.

505
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,740
It's kind of a nice start.

506
00:21:55,741 --> 00:21:59,260
So I could imagine edge and that
again is you're aiming a rifle.

507
00:21:59,261 --> 00:22:02,230
You have to put yourself in a
certain physiological state,

508
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:02,860
right?

509
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,160
What I'm,

510
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,280
take some deep breaths and calm down
and you want to make sure your hands are

511
00:22:06,370 --> 00:22:08,050
shaking and jiggling and so forth.

512
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:08,860
You know,

513
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:11,110
put yourself in the right frame of mind.

514
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,940
And if you're going to
take eight with your life,

515
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:13,900
it's the same thing.

516
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,590
You have to put yourself in the right
frame of mind and what's the right frame

517
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:17,980
of mind.

518
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,030
And it might be something like,

519
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:23,830
while you can assume that you're actually
hypothetically a valuable creature,

520
00:22:23,831 --> 00:22:25,880
even though you might
not think that self is,

521
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:30,180
you're absolutely knowing what the bull
about your own flaws and insufficiencies

522
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,140
but independent of value,

523
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:32,681
you might think,

524
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:37,060
well you can lend your sofa hand and you
can do something good for yourself just

525
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,800
up with the goodness of your heart.

526
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:39,101
You know,

527
00:22:39,101 --> 00:22:42,580
like you might do for
someone that you cared about.

528
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,100
Now that that's actually
very difficult for people.

529
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,750
You know,

530
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:48,430
like most of us love someone
or a couple of people,

531
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,620
but just half heartedly
at least observe children.

532
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,090
Well,

533
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:52,420
you know,

534
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,580
it's hard to be fully
committed to something.

535
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:55,770
But in generally way,

536
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,260
generally we do a pretty
good job with our,

537
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:02,830
with our partners or husbands and wives
and a pretty good job with her children.

538
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:02,980
Oh,

539
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,370
it's a little more iffy there.

540
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,483
A decent job,

541
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:06,910
parents,

542
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,091
well,

543
00:23:07,091 --> 00:23:08,800
you know it's 70 30 or whatever,

544
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:10,260
but maybe you could make,

545
00:23:10,261 --> 00:23:12,700
you can elevate elevated more
than that with a lot of aspirin,

546
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,030
but I don't know how good we are
about doing that for ourselves.

547
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,890
I would say much less so.

548
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:21,970
And part of that is definitely the fact
that we're very aware of our own flaws

549
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:25,740
and insufficiencies personally you
know more about how Regine useless.

550
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:28,840
You are fundamentally
then about anyone else.

551
00:23:28,841 --> 00:23:33,841
And so that's rather disheartening given
that it's disheartening then it's not

552
00:23:33,881 --> 00:23:35,710
so easy to take care of yourself properly,

553
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,210
but it doesn't go up his to be that you
really have to have that right not to

554
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:41,230
take care of yourself.

555
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:46,160
I think you have a responsibility to
take care of yourself as if something

556
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,070
value which you are.

557
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,070
And so that's a responsibility.

558
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,610
And so when you fill out a
future authoring program here,

559
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,680
you're asked to adopt for
the sake of experimentation,

560
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,480
the frame of reference,

561
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:10,570
a frame of reference within which you
give yourself the benefit of the doubt and

562
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:14,360
assume that there's something about
you that might be usefully be brought

563
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,680
forward into the world.

564
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,390
And you know,

565
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:17,661
it's,

566
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:18,494
it's uh,

567
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:24,220
an axiom of our society that there is
something about you that would be usefully

568
00:24:24,361 --> 00:24:28,130
be brought forward into the world because
our whole society is predicated on the

569
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:32,840
notion of the sovereign individual
there even enough and the divided and we

570
00:24:32,841 --> 00:24:34,220
wouldn't have,

571
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:35,563
uh,

572
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,830
exceeded political power
each and every one of us if,

573
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:44,840
and that would work unless there was
actually something to the proposition that

574
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:50,080
each individual is in fact something
approximating and divide locus of value

575
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,790
despite our insufficiencies.

576
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,850
And so allowing yourself the benefit of
the doubt seems like and philosophically

577
00:24:58,341 --> 00:25:02,480
appropriate thing and it takes a certain
month love and it takes a certain

578
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,314
amount of courage.

579
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,630
And so we ask people to think,

580
00:25:05,631 --> 00:25:05,931
okay,

581
00:25:05,931 --> 00:25:06,711
well here,

582
00:25:06,711 --> 00:25:07,700
here's a game.

583
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
You can have it if you ain't mad

584
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,300
possibility.

585
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,910
If you aim it a proper,

586
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,060
and would that make sense?

587
00:25:17,061 --> 00:25:18,590
Because if you ain't been
something in property,

588
00:25:18,591 --> 00:25:19,371
you're not going to hit it.

589
00:25:19,371 --> 00:25:21,830
So you could have it and
you can hit when you a map.

590
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,760
If you a property.

591
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,860
The question would be how when you,

592
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:26,600
a proper answer might be,

593
00:25:26,601 --> 00:25:31,120
well imagine you just started to take
care of yourself like he was something.

594
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,240
We're thinking carer.

595
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,700
So then you could say,

596
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,534
well,

597
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,360
if you could have what you wanted
three to five years down the room,

598
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,550
what would it be?

599
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,450
One of the needed,

600
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,010
assuming you were taking care of yourself.

601
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:43,870
Like if you,

602
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
if you can think about it like you,

603
00:25:44,921 --> 00:25:46,400
I take care of the child.

604
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,110
If you're going to take care of a child,

605
00:25:48,111 --> 00:25:50,690
he wouldn't just grant him or her,

606
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,970
his or her every win.

607
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:54,410
That's not care.

608
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,870
So that isn't how you can treat yourself.

609
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,460
You have to be more sensible.

610
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,331
How we can say,

611
00:25:59,331 --> 00:25:59,750
well,

612
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,021
okay,

613
00:26:00,021 --> 00:26:03,110
you mean you get to have what you need
three to five years down the road?

614
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,390
What do you want from your family?

615
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,670
If you could put your family together
the way you wanted it to be together.

616
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,160
So you had,

617
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,360
what do you want it from your father and
your mother and your siblings and your

618
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,110
kids,

619
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,310
just hypothetically,

620
00:26:13,311 --> 00:26:14,300
what would that look like?

621
00:26:14,301 --> 00:26:17,090
It probably wouldn't look like the
situation where you're all around the

622
00:26:17,091 --> 00:26:19,430
Thanksgiving dinner with your
hands around each other's necks,

623
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,870
squeezing slowly,

624
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,940
which is the condition many families
are in that Thanksgiving dinner.

625
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,190
You probably wouldn't wish for that and
it would probably not be for the basket.

626
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,303
Then you might ask,

627
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,181
well,

628
00:26:32,181 --> 00:26:33,800
what would you want from your,

629
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,690
from your intimate partner,

630
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,550
if you could have what you needed,

631
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,430
what would you want from your career?

632
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:42,830
And how would you educate
yourself if you could do,

633
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:48,480
we did an auditable way or at least
better trends you're managing now.

634
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:50,730
How would you take care of your
mental and physical health?

635
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,720
What would you do outside of work that
would be meaningful and engaging in

636
00:26:54,721 --> 00:26:55,590
productive?

637
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:56,863
Um,

638
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:00,810
what do you want from your friends?

639
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:01,620
That's,

640
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,650
that's cool.

641
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,410
Three and 12 for like make friends with
the people who want the best for him.

642
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:08,961
I'd say help.

643
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,280
I think to do that'd be useful.

644
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:11,821
You know,

645
00:27:11,821 --> 00:27:16,020
cause it's not that easy to do what's
best even though it's batched to do what's

646
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:17,370
best by definition.

647
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:21,870
It could be useful perhaps to be
surrounded by people who are happy when

648
00:27:21,871 --> 00:27:23,130
something good happens to you,

649
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:28,490
genuinely plates because they know that
life is bigger than short and tragic and

650
00:27:28,801 --> 00:27:32,820
then the probability that good things
will happen to people is somewhat low.

651
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,370
And then as a consequence of when they do,

652
00:27:35,371 --> 00:27:39,600
it's something to celebrate and who
had also perhaps be not so happy if

653
00:27:39,601 --> 00:27:43,950
something bad happened around you and
wouldn't necessarily entice you into such

654
00:27:43,951 --> 00:27:44,910
situations.

655
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:48,390
So that would be a good thing to
consider with regards to your friends.

656
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:53,391
So there's seven things that you think
about how to put your life in the kind of

657
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,910
order that would make you actually want
to have your rights to not be bitter

658
00:27:56,911 --> 00:27:57,744
about different

659
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:02,000
and degenerate because of that bitterness.

660
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:07,430
And then we asked people to write for
15 minutes sale and you get to have one,

661
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,180
which is your life to look like.

662
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,380
And so that would be life.

663
00:28:11,381 --> 00:28:16,381
That fine maximally except let's say,

664
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:17,850
but realistically,

665
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,700
and so then you have some name out there.

666
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,200
We had to Ms. Hampton,

667
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:27,810
we've worked on the program for awhile
and we had people write for 15 minutes

668
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:28,740
count provision,

669
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,820
which was okay.

670
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,390
That's where you're headed
and you're aiming for,

671
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,840
you're aiming at him kind of fleshing out.

672
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:38,580
Here's another useful
thing you think about.

673
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,360
So you have that habits and you're
resentful book things and you don't try as

674
00:28:45,211 --> 00:28:49,650
hard as it might in some dimensions of
your weaknesses that might take you a

675
00:28:49,651 --> 00:28:50,430
partner.

676
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,070
Pretty much everybody knows
what those weaknesses are.

677
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:53,311
You know,

678
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:57,000
some people would smoke too much pot
and some people would drink too much and

679
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:59,450
some people would be unfaithful.

680
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,590
Half counterproductive isn't it?

681
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:06,650
Some people would end up on the
street because they would teach,

682
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,280
generate with regards to the discipline,

683
00:29:08,281 --> 00:29:12,630
everybody kind of knows how they fall
apart if they felt apart in their own

684
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,120
idiosyncratic and spectacular manner.

685
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,450
It was the sorts of things
that keep you awake at night.

686
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,170
If you,

687
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:20,670
if you contemplate them deeply,

688
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,133
um,

689
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,880
where would you be in three to five years?

690
00:29:23,881 --> 00:29:26,070
If you let everything go directly to hell,

691
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,290
that's useful.

692
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,890
That's useful because then see,

693
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,760
it's one thing to motivate yourself
because you see that what you're doing is

694
00:29:35,761 --> 00:29:37,560
moving you ahead to
something that you want,

695
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,160
but that's hope and hope is a powerful

696
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:44,340
terror.

697
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,083
That's

698
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,260
one of the things I have to deal with.

699
00:29:50,261 --> 00:29:52,020
One clinical sciences there.

700
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,680
Maybe they don't have a job.

701
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:54,610
They really like,

702
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:55,613
you know,

703
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:59,010
and it's grinding away at
your soul and it's not,

704
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,510
I can just leap out of
your job into another job.

705
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,310
That's actually really
complicated problem,

706
00:30:03,311 --> 00:30:03,461
right?

707
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:04,330
If you don't like your job,

708
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:06,460
it's not just a psychological problem.

709
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,020
You have to have a job,

710
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,330
otherwise you died.

711
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,233
And so it's

712
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,461
changing.

713
00:30:13,461 --> 00:30:15,770
Jobs is the bathroom and
just adjusting itself.

714
00:30:15,771 --> 00:30:16,760
Psychologically,

715
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:19,760
you might have to do a lot of
planning to change your job.

716
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:23,120
You have to update your CV if you have
to update your skills and maybe we've got

717
00:30:23,121 --> 00:30:27,080
to figure out how to be a little bit more
credible in an interview and you have

718
00:30:27,081 --> 00:30:28,670
to overcome your fear of rejection.

719
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:30,110
Like there may be all sorts of things.

720
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:30,591
African,

721
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:35,210
we actually save yourself
up to move laterally or up
to let's say to a different

722
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,570
position when it's more engaging and uh,

723
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,370
you know,

724
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,203
you might be,

725
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,250
you might be looking to do that.

726
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,243
MMM.

727
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,420
And so you're afraid of getting down

728
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:57,091
and you think,

729
00:30:57,091 --> 00:30:57,211
well,

730
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:58,000
if I'm afraid of it,

731
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,190
why should I do it?

732
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,270
People ask themselves the same question
when they have a difficult conversation

733
00:31:03,271 --> 00:31:06,420
to have with their wives or
their children or their parents.

734
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:06,901
You know,

735
00:31:06,901 --> 00:31:08,970
cause a lot of us are
very conflict diverse.

736
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,970
There are difficult
conversations to happen public.

737
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,590
And the reason is is
because they're awkward.

738
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:16,200
Did and make us afraid.

739
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,370
So you might think,

740
00:31:17,371 --> 00:31:17,521
well,

741
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,560
why the hell bothered
if it makes you afraid?

742
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:21,030
Why not just not do it?

743
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:26,210
Which is one of the ideas that keeps
people in jobs they hate and in

744
00:31:26,281 --> 00:31:30,600
relationships and stopped him from
repairing their relationships with you.

745
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:33,420
It's a very difficult thing
to do and that's what it is.

746
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,853
Well,

747
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,920
let's imagine that you could just keep
doing the thing that you don't like them.

748
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,360
You don't change it
because you're afraid to,

749
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,011
well,

750
00:31:44,011 --> 00:31:46,080
are you afraid of what happens
if you don't change it?

751
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,610
And if you lay out this little hell,

752
00:31:48,611 --> 00:31:53,611
but I described really in one way so you
know where you in degenerating if you

753
00:31:54,061 --> 00:31:57,200
were going to degenerate and then
you look at your life and can take,

754
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:01,730
well here's a bunch of things I'm not
doing because I'm afraid not s you know,

755
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,670
keeping me secure.

756
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:03,091
It's like,

757
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:03,271
no,

758
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:03,990
it's not.

759
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:06,570
It's just taking you to that
place that you lay down.

760
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,100
It's an absolute catastrophe.

761
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:13,610
And so sometimes the answer to why should
I do this thing that I'd been putting

762
00:32:13,861 --> 00:32:17,920
off is well otherwise they end
up in this particular hell.

763
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,830
I already know.

764
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,430
I already know the parameters of it.

765
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,300
And so hope can help you move out of that.

766
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,920
It would be better if I did this,

767
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:30,921
but fear of not doing it
and the consequences as
we've been and what's better

768
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:34,260
yet is to have both of
the working in tandem.

769
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:37,620
So psychologists figured this out when
they were looking at theory years ago

770
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:40,170
because I'm trying to figure
out how to motivate our members

771
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,190
to do things like run down a nice update,

772
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,053
a reward.

773
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,310
Turns out that a hungry,

774
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:46,970
hungry,

775
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:48,590
wrapping down a little maze,

776
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:51,800
right rapidly get a piece
of cheese by the answer.

777
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,023
That rat,

778
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:58,940
if you have the hungry rata and you walk
in some catheter as pets are terrified

779
00:32:59,841 --> 00:33:00,650
as counts.

780
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,160
It reads like to even just
say from different Medicap
had just a different smell

781
00:33:04,161 --> 00:33:04,970
than couch.

782
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,270
They know what cat smell
like and don't like it.

783
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,910
So if you take your hungry rather
throwing little caterpillars,

784
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,820
he'll sit down that runway like nat,

785
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,220
much faster than women's just hungry.

786
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:20,390
So running away from something
that you're terrified element,

787
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,350
avoiding something that your property
being terrified of and running towards

788
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:26,130
something you want is a
good way of being knocked.

789
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:26,964
Somebody motivated.

790
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,300
And so at the second part of that program,

791
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,670
we have people,

792
00:33:31,671 --> 00:33:35,930
they hold a very detailed
plan about their,

793
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:42,720
and if the eagles prior code schools
figuring out why would you like to be

794
00:33:43,161 --> 00:33:45,710
better because he would
take the first school,

795
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,780
how would your family's,

796
00:33:46,781 --> 00:33:48,770
which to be better also with baby,

797
00:33:48,771 --> 00:33:52,310
how would you be of more benefit to the
community if you would take that book?

798
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:56,300
Cause it'd be nice if you could sort
yourself out in ways that also sorted out

799
00:33:56,301 --> 00:34:00,120
your family and then also sorted out in
your community and since you're making

800
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:00,620
an implant,

801
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,690
but where the hell no name for all three,

802
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,340
it's more sustainable anyways.

803
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:05,120
Right?

804
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:10,120
So throw the famous psychologist
show Piaget called celebrated state.

805
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,770
He says that it's like a game
that everyone wants to play.

806
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:17,840
It's better if you're going to play a
game to play a game that everyone wants to

807
00:34:17,841 --> 00:34:20,140
play with it and that's a good,

808
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,010
that's a good indication
that it's a good game.

809
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:24,950
And so if you could figure out how to
fix yourself up in a way that we had

810
00:34:24,951 --> 00:34:27,380
similar opinions to fix up
your family and your community,

811
00:34:27,381 --> 00:34:28,214
it's like,

812
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,353
hey,

813
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:35,660
everybody wins and maybe it would be
good to play game the different liquids.

814
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,420
So we don't think of games that way.

815
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,051
Pretty awful,

816
00:34:39,051 --> 00:34:44,051
but it's certainly possible getting
joint that exist and so well courage and

817
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,050
that free speech.

818
00:34:48,051 --> 00:34:51,950
One of the things that I do recommend
that people who try these programs is that

819
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:56,951
they do the that because if that plan
has been that the no plan at all and

820
00:34:57,021 --> 00:34:59,820
you're going to come up with a better
plan because what they haven't,

821
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,693
you know,

822
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,990
and so it's either a bad glad knows lab
and no glamor is way worse instead of

823
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:07,904
that plan.

824
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,540
At least when you implemented that plan
and you serve walking towards what the

825
00:35:11,541 --> 00:35:12,374
plan is,

826
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:16,940
you'll see specifically where it is
that you're an error like specifically.

827
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:21,320
And you'll learn from that and then
you can use what you learn while you're

828
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:22,520
making the mistakes,

829
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,730
implementing your bad plan
to make a better plan.

830
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,560
And if you keep doing that eventually,

831
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,100
like there'll be a lot
of failure along the way.

832
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,430
That's the adventure of
your life by the way.

833
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:36,830
If you do that and you keep laying on
plan and learning painterly from your

834
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,060
failures and then directing the planet,

835
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:44,120
what'll happen is you get on target as
you move through life and even though

836
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:48,540
you're hitting a moving target
because life is complicated.

837
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,290
And so we have some,

838
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,950
cause we studied this site didn't make
weight because we weren't convinced our

839
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:58,110
theories were necessarily accurate.

840
00:35:58,170 --> 00:35:58,720
We found,

841
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,553
for example,

842
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:02,620
this was at Mohawk College Ontario.

843
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,153
Um,

844
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,390
people who get to the future authoring
program before they went to college work.

845
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,020
The young men in particular,

846
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:14,310
especially the English young man sort of
categorize the people who were pursuing

847
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:19,311
something that was career oriented or
something sort of vaguely can find the

848
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:22,550
young men who had vacant triangles goals.

849
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,720
If they did the future authoring program,

850
00:36:24,721 --> 00:36:28,410
they were 50% less likely to drop
out of college in the first semester.

851
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,410
So it was quite staggering.

852
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,303
So,

853
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,551
so it's useful,

854
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:32,911
David,

855
00:36:32,911 --> 00:36:35,070
something that's the moral of that story.

856
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,320
And so fact the courage,

857
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:38,310
um,

858
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,690
which is where I started.

859
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:44,780
So originally when psychologists
were studying theory,

860
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:48,150
they assume that fear was
something that you learn.

861
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,180
And you might think that because
there you are sitting down,

862
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:51,931
they're pretty calm,

863
00:36:51,931 --> 00:36:52,081
you know,

864
00:36:52,081 --> 00:36:52,891
I'm afraid of anything.

865
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:57,330
And so you might believe that the
normal state of the human being is calm.

866
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,430
And then we have to learn to be afraid.

867
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,300
You know,

868
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,610
psychologists could teach
animals how to be afraid.

869
00:37:02,611 --> 00:37:04,920
So one way you can teach
an animal to be afraid.

870
00:37:04,921 --> 00:37:05,820
This was done with rap,

871
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:10,821
just have your route and it's in his cage
and it's like it's comradery and then

872
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:16,310
you turn off the light and then you
like to Phi this floor a little bit,

873
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:17,563
right?

874
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,730
Cause you wouldn't have the
route around for a while.

875
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,380
And so just enough to
shock and that shock,

876
00:37:25,381 --> 00:37:26,430
that causes pain.

877
00:37:26,431 --> 00:37:29,630
That's a punishment like shocked to wrath.

878
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,280
You do that a few times,

879
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:34,710
like was on the rent
freezes as the bag as hard,

880
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,240
that the light signifies shock and what
the Rad is experiencing with the light

881
00:37:39,241 --> 00:37:42,020
goes on his feeling or any title.

882
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:47,190
And so psychologists get that with tracks
and they thought a hot has learned to

883
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:48,300
be afraid.

884
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,700
That's actually not true.

885
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,220
I'll talk about that while.

886
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,610
And so then they generalize
that to human beings.

887
00:37:56,611 --> 00:37:59,430
And so maybe you have a phobia
mouse or something like that,

888
00:37:59,431 --> 00:38:00,570
or maybe you're afraid of something.

889
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:05,220
The idea was while you learn to be
afraid and we can teach you how to not be

890
00:38:05,221 --> 00:38:06,054
afraid.

891
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,510
And so what the psychologist
at the behavioralists was,

892
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,373
uh,

893
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:11,881
let's say,

894
00:38:11,881 --> 00:38:13,680
let's say you were afraid of balloons.

895
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,540
Some people are afraid of balloons.

896
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,433
As it turns out,

897
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,880
it's kind of an absurd fear,

898
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:18,714
but that's okay.

899
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,270
You know,

900
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:24,990
they with metal and uplifting positive
post to the face and they learned to be

901
00:38:24,991 --> 00:38:25,800
afraid.

902
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,750
And so that was
conditioning them to learn.

903
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,990
And so what you do is you
sit the person down as,

904
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:33,923
uh,

905
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,340
you have the do and suicides.

906
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:38,290
And so they take deep breaths.

907
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,750
You pay attention to
different parts of their body,

908
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:42,040
their feet and ankles,

909
00:38:42,041 --> 00:38:42,800
their knees,

910
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,331
so forth,

911
00:38:43,331 --> 00:38:46,510
all the way up the body and relaxing
the muscles and put them in a state of

912
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,700
relaxation or breathing deeply.

913
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,240
And then you have to think about pillows
or maybe you show them some balloons or

914
00:38:52,241 --> 00:38:54,360
maybe you feel the whole
cab room with cold.

915
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,930
It's flooding by the way,

916
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,150
just to be effective.

917
00:38:58,151 --> 00:39:00,190
If you have to get someone
over their fear of balloons,

918
00:39:00,191 --> 00:39:02,410
like right now it's a little drastic.

919
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,191
But anyways,

920
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:07,100
the point is is that you introduce
to the thing a trade tradeoffs.

921
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:07,871
Well,

922
00:39:07,871 --> 00:39:10,100
they're relaxed and ideas.

923
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,140
That's counter conditioning.

924
00:39:11,141 --> 00:39:15,280
The idea is that when you can't be
relaxed and afraid at the same time,

925
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:19,250
and so if you can learn to relax in the
face of the thing that you're afraid

926
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,480
that you won't be afraid of people,

927
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:22,510
but then someone knows.

928
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,560
So that's a pretty good in theory,

929
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:24,400
but it's wrong.

930
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,293
It's a good theory.

931
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:31,560
Just like the theory of the learn to be
afraid actually theories exactly wrong

932
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,060
because you don't want it to be fragrance.

933
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:35,480
You bloody well know.

934
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,010
What you learn is how to keep the home.

935
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:41,300
And it turns out if that's even true for,

936
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:42,143
for wraps,

937
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,610
the psychologist's Jerry
Mesh with the experiences,

938
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,330
experiments,

939
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:49,480
movement question is when
you have that normal rap,

940
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,201
you guys think,

941
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:50,770
well here's the,

942
00:39:50,770 --> 00:39:51,780
and he's in the cage,

943
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,020
he's kind of a home there.

944
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,720
So he's calm and you can teach
them how to be afraid of the light.

945
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,660
So when you take the comradery,

946
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,280
it's the normal rap.

947
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,990
It's like then you teach
them how to be afraid,

948
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:06,640
but it's kind of arbitrary when you
decided that the rat is normal because if

949
00:40:06,641 --> 00:40:11,641
you take a ride by the tail
and say you drop in a new cage,

950
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,380
when he goes in that medication,

951
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:16,100
he is not a con man.

952
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,610
He's this sort of route.

953
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:18,911
You know,

954
00:40:18,911 --> 00:40:20,530
you guys have brought you guys to chat.

955
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:23,440
Some of you help such as the scouts,

956
00:40:23,441 --> 00:40:24,370
but anyways,

957
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,320
but some of you have probably move your
cap to a new house and cats go like

958
00:40:30,881 --> 00:40:31,510
that.

959
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:35,020
Like your Kevin Holmes and
calm cow by cat standards,

960
00:40:35,021 --> 00:40:37,060
which is [inaudible] is

961
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,330
one of the delightful things about the,

962
00:40:40,430 --> 00:40:43,450
and you can scare them to [inaudible].

963
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:50,080
You know when a captured his
hair stands on ams like that,

964
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,180
you know that's the same experience
you have when you feel awe,

965
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,780
you know that your hair stands on end.

966
00:40:55,781 --> 00:40:57,040
When you feel all,

967
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:59,590
it's the same response that
an animal has to the Predator.

968
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:00,580
You know,

969
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,770
imagine you're like a mountain.

970
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,770
You'd see a title on that.

971
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:07,440
See your mouse and or
65 scale up the coyotes,

972
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,420
that cow was like 70 feet high.

973
00:41:10,730 --> 00:41:12,540
You saw a 70 foot high titles.

974
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,240
You feel awe [inaudible] most of stuff
and it doesn't make that's retired.

975
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:30,770
That's why they stand sideways to a
dance backwards off doctors [inaudible]

976
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:46,970
it's frozen.

977
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:50,280
That's a normal graph
as far as I'm concerned.

978
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,170
That's frozen wrap.

979
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,010
The thing that's absolutely terrified
out of it's fine cause it doesn't know

980
00:41:55,011 --> 00:41:58,480
what the hell it's doing or where it's
going or what's going to eat it next.

981
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,140
That's normal.

982
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,870
That's the fear circuit on completely.

983
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:07,310
That's the standard condition of
existence as far as I'm concerned because

984
00:42:07,311 --> 00:42:12,200
existence is character on spike terror
and death and the idea that the normal

985
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:13,670
condition is calm.

986
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,200
That's insane.

987
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,880
That's not true at all.

988
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:21,620
And so he put a rat in a cage and it's
frozen that cause it thinks God only

989
00:42:21,621 --> 00:42:22,880
knows what's here.

990
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:28,750
And then what it does is it's frozen
and snips of it and if nothing kills it,

991
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,720
then it seems a little bit more specific
and see if there's anything in there

992
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,230
and Kinda cap that would really drive,

993
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,261
you know,

994
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:44,261
to drink [inaudible] and see if we can
turn that [inaudible] learned almost

995
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:08,700
everything we know about how the
brain works from doing such things.

996
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:11,120
One scaredy wrapped so

997
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:17,850
and nothing kills him.

998
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:18,703
He gets a little gray,

999
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:24,470
he starts to move around and then we
can just explore as the whole damn cage

1000
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,580
every nook and cranny.

1001
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,950
And then if there's nothing
there that were killer app,

1002
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,940
then upon now and then you think,

1003
00:43:31,941 --> 00:43:33,170
well that's the normal rap.

1004
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:33,471
It's like,

1005
00:43:33,471 --> 00:43:33,801
well no.

1006
00:43:33,801 --> 00:43:35,330
What is terrified about,

1007
00:43:35,331 --> 00:43:36,430
what's the normal loud?

1008
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:39,130
The Conrad is the Rathmines
that's explored everything.

1009
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,330
It's really useful thing to know.

1010
00:43:41,331 --> 00:43:43,040
It's unbelievably useful thing to know.

1011
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:43,941
Now.

1012
00:43:43,941 --> 00:43:46,150
Rats don't generally live
by themselves in cages.

1013
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,100
We live in a hierarchy of other
undergrads in a social world.

1014
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:51,260
And so there's sort of like people,

1015
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,633
and so

1016
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,320
the reason that you're not terrified
out of your skull right now,

1017
00:43:58,190 --> 00:44:03,190
even though you could weave is then you're
in a higher repeat with to people who

1018
00:44:03,321 --> 00:44:06,770
basically share your
culture is the sheriff.

1019
00:44:06,771 --> 00:44:09,170
Go for sure in your hands
and you can predict it.

1020
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,460
You don't know what these
primates litmus from within.

1021
00:44:11,750 --> 00:44:13,730
There's probably 2000 people in here.

1022
00:44:13,731 --> 00:44:14,564
There's lease,

1023
00:44:15,050 --> 00:44:20,050
30 of you are seriously
the range [inaudible] but
everybody's behaving properly

1024
00:44:26,910 --> 00:44:29,020
and everybody's pointed
in the same directions.

1025
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,610
One was turned around
completely understood.

1026
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:32,763
See

1027
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,310
what the hell is this Friday not to?

1028
00:44:42,830 --> 00:44:44,160
And we have an agreement here.

1029
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,340
The agreement is everybody sits in their
chair and everybody thinks this is the

1030
00:44:47,341 --> 00:44:49,590
front and no one makes too much noise.

1031
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:49,981
And you know,

1032
00:44:49,981 --> 00:44:51,050
wave your elbows around.

1033
00:44:51,051 --> 00:44:54,360
It's like there's a lots
of rules and everybody,

1034
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:56,730
and you were told that's a rule

1035
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,810
and you don't talk a lot to your partner,

1036
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,350
let's say.

1037
00:45:04,350 --> 00:45:08,880
Well the electrodes on and you don't talk
to yourself and you're certainly going

1038
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,500
to yourself and hinder your forehead,

1039
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:12,190
right?

1040
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:17,190
So there's lots of rules that are keeping
your anxiety circuitry under control

1041
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:23,900
in this circumstance and everybody around
you is being polite enough to act out

1042
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:28,880
the rules and so your fear stays off.

1043
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:30,480
And what are the races?

1044
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,460
This is something that was,

1045
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,900
see if it's really important to me when
I finally figured out that the comrade

1046
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:36,030
wasn't the normal map,

1047
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:39,840
the terrified grab what's been normal
lab and then the terrified rab had to

1048
00:45:39,841 --> 00:45:44,040
learn how to be calm and the way that
it learns how to be calm was two sports

1049
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,200
territory and buddy,

1050
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:49,350
but have been natural environment to
organize a hierarchy in that territory so

1051
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:50,131
that every graduate,

1052
00:45:50,131 --> 00:45:50,581
exactly,

1053
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:54,700
whatever it is every other rep is
doing at all times come to a nice wrap

1054
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:59,070
agreement that's the hierarchy and
explore the environment and then they keep

1055
00:45:59,071 --> 00:46:00,570
their terrorist circuits off.

1056
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:04,200
And the reason that people don't like
to have their belief systems disruptive,

1057
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:09,320
it's because it turns the terrorist
circuits back on and no one likes that.

1058
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:10,710
Not even a bit.

1059
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:12,990
It's absolutely before a flight.

1060
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:17,250
And so that's hardly why people are
so invested in their belief systems.

1061
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:22,980
So back to how you treat
someone if they're afraid.

1062
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,030
So you flooded with balloons,

1063
00:46:27,031 --> 00:46:30,750
whether they're relaxed and then
they're not afraid to moons anyone.

1064
00:46:30,810 --> 00:46:31,680
And that actually works.

1065
00:46:31,681 --> 00:46:33,120
If you do it five or six times,

1066
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:37,920
then there'll be able to tolerate
balloons or mice or needles at a crime.

1067
00:46:37,921 --> 00:46:39,000
If a needle phobia,

1068
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:44,720
he had a needle phobia that was so
severe and he would undergo the surgery.

1069
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:45,780
There's no anesthetic.

1070
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:47,371
Right,

1071
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:47,761
right.

1072
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:49,080
So that's something,

1073
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:49,381
right?

1074
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:49,831
I mean you've,

1075
00:46:49,831 --> 00:46:51,620
you've had a dentist drill in your tooth.

1076
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:52,820
It's like trevaway there,

1077
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,060
but no needles.

1078
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,570
I treated him behaviorally
for it's needful.

1079
00:46:59,610 --> 00:46:59,821
Yes.

1080
00:46:59,821 --> 00:47:00,960
So what I did was,

1081
00:47:00,961 --> 00:47:01,451
first of all,

1082
00:47:01,451 --> 00:47:04,980
he trusted me and I have
rules in my therapy session.

1083
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:09,740
Like I am not going to do anything
that we do not agree on period.

1084
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:10,703
Ever.

1085
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:10,981
Okay?

1086
00:47:10,981 --> 00:47:12,180
So that's the crucial issue.

1087
00:47:12,181 --> 00:47:13,320
If you're going to treat help,

1088
00:47:13,321 --> 00:47:14,460
something with the fear.

1089
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,031
So I said,

1090
00:47:15,031 --> 00:47:15,660
well,

1091
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,250
you probably need to
get over this beautiful,

1092
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:17,410
you know,

1093
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:20,850
because I thought the whole dental
surgery keeping it seems a little much,

1094
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:23,940
and he needed to get blood tests and
other things because you need to get a

1095
00:47:23,941 --> 00:47:24,800
needle down with him.

1096
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:25,501
And so I said,

1097
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:25,621
well,

1098
00:47:25,621 --> 00:47:27,660
let's see if we can get
rid of this needle phobia.

1099
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:28,291
He said,

1100
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:28,531
okay,

1101
00:47:28,531 --> 00:47:29,140
we'll give it a try.

1102
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:29,381
And I said,

1103
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:29,591
okay,

1104
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:32,560
well the first thing I'm going to do
next session is I'm going to bring in a

1105
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:33,580
hacker here with Neil.

1106
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:35,110
I'm just going to put it on the shelf.

1107
00:47:35,111 --> 00:47:38,800
And I showed him exactly where on
Michelle funds going to put it.

1108
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:39,031
I said,

1109
00:47:39,031 --> 00:47:41,080
just look at that place in the shelf.

1110
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,440
And I said that because if
you're afraid to something,

1111
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:43,980
you don't like,

1112
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:44,813
come it.

1113
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,330
So you avoided.

1114
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,960
So one way of not being afraid
of something is to not avoid it.

1115
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:51,480
I said,

1116
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:51,571
well,

1117
00:47:51,571 --> 00:47:54,100
just look on the shelf and
get to know you with that.

1118
00:47:54,370 --> 00:47:55,181
So he said,

1119
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:55,540
okay.

1120
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:55,871
I said,

1121
00:47:55,871 --> 00:47:56,081
well,

1122
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:56,740
okay,

1123
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,130
next,

1124
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,240
next time he came in I said,

1125
00:47:58,241 --> 00:47:59,074
well,

1126
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:00,520
I have a seat.

1127
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:01,480
Make yourself comfortable.

1128
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:03,280
And see that spot.

1129
00:48:03,281 --> 00:48:04,600
I don't know last time if you look there,

1130
00:48:04,601 --> 00:48:06,850
you'll see a needle
and Scott Sheath on it.

1131
00:48:06,851 --> 00:48:08,410
It's got a little orange capsule on it.

1132
00:48:08,740 --> 00:48:09,250
And so,

1133
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:10,083
um,

1134
00:48:10,210 --> 00:48:11,410
I want you to just look at the needle.

1135
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:12,450
Just look,

1136
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:13,283
it said,

1137
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:13,990
okay.

1138
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:14,321
I said,

1139
00:48:14,321 --> 00:48:14,680
well,

1140
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,550
how's that one said?

1141
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:16,301
I'm kind of nervous.

1142
00:48:16,301 --> 00:48:16,601
And I said,

1143
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:16,721
well,

1144
00:48:16,721 --> 00:48:18,220
just look at it til you're bored.

1145
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:20,590
Boredom is a form of learning.

1146
00:48:20,950 --> 00:48:22,570
If you're afraid of something,

1147
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:24,460
what you want to do is become bored by it.

1148
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:25,330
And so,

1149
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:26,980
and if you look at me long enough,

1150
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:30,730
you'll get bored by it because it
doesn't do anything and just sits there.

1151
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,580
And he bought,

1152
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:34,931
he said,

1153
00:48:34,931 --> 00:48:35,221
okay,

1154
00:48:35,221 --> 00:48:35,540
I'm,

1155
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:36,370
I'm hot.

1156
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:36,641
I said,

1157
00:48:36,641 --> 00:48:36,881
okay,

1158
00:48:36,881 --> 00:48:37,121
look,

1159
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:38,190
I'm going to pick up the needle.

1160
00:48:38,191 --> 00:48:39,550
I'm not gonna bring them towards you.

1161
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:41,050
I'm just going to pick it up.

1162
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:44,110
I know it was lifted four inches off
of the shelf cause I wanted him to know

1163
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:45,130
what the hell was going on.

1164
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:45,550
Sorry.

1165
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:46,200
Left ended up in.

1166
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,870
That made me kind of nervous.

1167
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:48,281
I said,

1168
00:48:48,281 --> 00:48:48,401
okay,

1169
00:48:48,401 --> 00:48:51,030
I understand all of this new
and renewed the same thing.

1170
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:55,210
We just watch it until you're okay.

1171
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:56,291
He said,

1172
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:56,531
okay.

1173
00:48:56,531 --> 00:48:57,130
And I said,

1174
00:48:57,130 --> 00:48:57,480
lemon.

1175
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,181
We did the next day.

1176
00:48:58,181 --> 00:48:58,421
I said,

1177
00:48:58,421 --> 00:48:58,511
well,

1178
00:48:58,511 --> 00:48:59,344
I've been a movement.

1179
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:00,191
And I said,

1180
00:49:00,191 --> 00:49:00,311
well,

1181
00:49:00,311 --> 00:49:04,630
I'm gonna move it closer to you and you
know any increments and you can stop me

1182
00:49:04,631 --> 00:49:05,231
whenever you want,

1183
00:49:05,231 --> 00:49:06,970
but I'll just move it an inch at a time.

1184
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,750
And how will that be?

1185
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:09,071
He said,

1186
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:09,161
well,

1187
00:49:09,161 --> 00:49:10,670
I think that anyways,

1188
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:11,620
by the end of the session,

1189
00:49:11,621 --> 00:49:13,600
I'd had the needle with the,

1190
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:16,630
she's touching his arm and he leave me,

1191
00:49:16,631 --> 00:49:16,901
man,

1192
00:49:16,901 --> 00:49:19,510
he would have none of the room
screaming if that would've happened,

1193
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,170
you know,

1194
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:21,120
the session before that,

1195
00:49:21,190 --> 00:49:21,910
and that was enough.

1196
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:23,080
I didn't want to push it too far,

1197
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:24,910
but here is with nothing.

1198
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,610
I didn't have rocks.

1199
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,970
Now it turned out when the behaviors,

1200
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:31,990
if your experiments,

1201
00:49:31,991 --> 00:49:35,410
they found out that you definitely have
to ask the person to relax in order for

1202
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:36,580
the balloons to,

1203
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:40,060
for voluntary exposure to the
balloons to have me a sec.

1204
00:49:40,510 --> 00:49:40,781
Oh yeah.

1205
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:44,100
News have been voluntarily expose
themselves to what they were afraid.

1206
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:45,700
It's like,

1207
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:46,630
man,

1208
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:49,300
that was a major discovery.

1209
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:53,890
And if turns out that pretty much every
school of clinical psychology has come

1210
00:49:53,891 --> 00:49:54,910
from agree on that.

1211
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:57,490
How do you help someone
with what you're afraid of?

1212
00:49:57,550 --> 00:50:00,070
And this is important
because we're afraid of life,

1213
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:01,750
right?

1214
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,960
So if you figure out how you help
someone over from their fear,

1215
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,440
but that's a big deal because you're
afraid of life and you should be because

1216
00:50:08,441 --> 00:50:09,610
life will kill you.

1217
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:12,580
And so it's no wonder you're afraid of it.

1218
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,470
And so what are you
going to do about that?

1219
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,570
It's not like people
have phobias and so far,

1220
00:50:16,571 --> 00:50:16,810
no,

1221
00:50:16,810 --> 00:50:18,680
aren't afraid to face with no harmful.

1222
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:20,740
They're often afraid of
things that are harmful.

1223
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:24,070
And the mystery is often why
other people aren't afraid,

1224
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,540
not why they are.

1225
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:26,913
So

1226
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:31,820
how do you help someone
become less afraid?

1227
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:33,260
You actually don't.

1228
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,450
You actually help them
become more courageous.

1229
00:50:36,080 --> 00:50:39,080
That's cause that's not the same thing.

1230
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:39,780
It's like,

1231
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:43,880
because like actually is dangerous and
if your ability to prevail in life is

1232
00:50:43,881 --> 00:50:45,650
dependent on you not being afraid of life,

1233
00:50:45,651 --> 00:50:49,700
it's like that's kind of a nonstarter
because there's lots of things that might

1234
00:50:49,701 --> 00:50:50,750
come to be afraid of.

1235
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:52,990
And so if you to be successful,

1236
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,650
it had to be not afraid of life.

1237
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:55,100
It's like,

1238
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:55,610
well,

1239
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:57,260
forget about that because you know,

1240
00:50:57,261 --> 00:51:01,730
if you're on someone's
deathbed and there's going
to be some emotion associated

1241
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:02,061
with that,

1242
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:04,750
we're actually afraid of cats and
we're afraid if it send the need,

1243
00:51:04,751 --> 00:51:06,010
we're afraid of the trailing,

1244
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:07,520
we're afraid of pain.

1245
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:08,900
No bloody wonder,

1246
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:10,400
that's for sure.

1247
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:13,550
And so it's not being afraid
of it's necessary one,

1248
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:14,301
then we're lost.

1249
00:51:14,301 --> 00:51:16,070
But that isn't what's necessary.

1250
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:18,290
What's necessary is to be courageous.

1251
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,181
And that's very,

1252
00:51:20,181 --> 00:51:25,181
very cool because it turns out that you
could be more courageous than you think.

1253
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:29,330
And also turns out that if you put
yourself in a situation where you face the

1254
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:30,470
things you're afraid of,

1255
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:33,590
you find out that there's way
more to you than you thought.

1256
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,770
And what's also cool about that is it
doesn't seem to be on the upper limit to

1257
00:51:36,771 --> 00:51:38,870
that because it isn't obvious to,

1258
00:51:38,871 --> 00:51:42,560
if there's anything that you can
face without learning how to face.

1259
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:43,850
And I mean anything.

1260
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:44,691
When do you think about it?

1261
00:51:44,691 --> 00:51:44,931
Right?

1262
00:51:44,931 --> 00:51:46,670
People work in emergency wards,

1263
00:51:47,090 --> 00:51:47,301
right?

1264
00:51:47,301 --> 00:51:48,100
So think about that.

1265
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:48,260
Well,

1266
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:51,710
what they do is have emergencies
all the time and you think,

1267
00:51:51,711 --> 00:51:56,030
well the emergency is something you can
tolerate almost by definition would be

1268
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,990
an emergency otherwise.

1269
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,850
But people specialize in half.

1270
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:00,740
So obviously they get used to it.

1271
00:52:00,770 --> 00:52:02,840
People work in Palliative care boards,

1272
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:03,920
that's rough.

1273
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:07,850
Everybody there is suffering and it's
going to die soon and then they do die.

1274
00:52:07,851 --> 00:52:11,630
So not only are you dealing with
that and dealing with loss estimates,

1275
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:13,730
bossing people work in funeral partners,

1276
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,920
so they're dealing with
death all the time.

1277
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:17,690
It's like people are bloody tough.

1278
00:52:18,710 --> 00:52:20,150
So my client,

1279
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:21,740
he was pretty happy about that.

1280
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,500
And so the next session,

1281
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:25,603
um,

1282
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,950
I told him I was going to take
the sheets off the needle,

1283
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:28,973
you know,

1284
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:30,590
he was all right with that.

1285
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,730
And then I waved to the,

1286
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,230
but not do maniacally.

1287
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:39,350
And then I did the same thing and I
drove to the point where I can hold the

1288
00:52:39,350 --> 00:52:43,460
needle half an inch away from his
arm without him being with him,

1289
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:44,000
watching,

1290
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,030
don't get flinching without
turning away with him watching.

1291
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:50,810
Cause that's the thing is he actually
have to face the thing you're afraid of.

1292
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,440
And so that was no for that session.

1293
00:52:52,470 --> 00:52:53,450
Then the next session,

1294
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:57,350
part of it was trusting because he'd had
a bad experience with dentists when he

1295
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:58,184
was a kid.

1296
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,920
And that was partly what
produced his soybean.

1297
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:04,100
So he didn't really trust people in
authority deeply like a scared animal.

1298
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:04,911
And that's what he said.

1299
00:53:04,911 --> 00:53:05,481
It felt like,

1300
00:53:05,481 --> 00:53:06,470
what's a scared animal?

1301
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:07,490
That's the three d book.

1302
00:53:07,491 --> 00:53:08,120
Right.

1303
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:12,020
And so the other thing I had in
practice was telling me to stop and,

1304
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:12,981
and leaving.

1305
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:13,281
I said,

1306
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:13,521
look,

1307
00:53:13,521 --> 00:53:14,354
we're going to,

1308
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:19,420
you tell me to stop what I'm doing and
then leave and I've won't stopped and

1309
00:53:19,541 --> 00:53:19,671
know.

1310
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:21,140
I can just tell him that.

1311
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,370
And he would have believed me.

1312
00:53:22,371 --> 00:53:26,050
But that's not the same thing as
actually practicing and it happen.

1313
00:53:26,430 --> 00:53:28,460
So He'd say the needle,

1314
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:28,860
you know,

1315
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,200
and,

1316
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,150
and around you can say stop doing that.

1317
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:31,830
Stop.

1318
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:32,251
And he'd say,

1319
00:53:32,251 --> 00:53:32,821
I'm leaving.

1320
00:53:32,821 --> 00:53:33,840
And then he'd get up and leave it.

1321
00:53:33,841 --> 00:53:36,480
I just let them leave until
we get that five or six times.

1322
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:39,360
Like he would do a per 10
playing thing with the kid,

1323
00:53:39,570 --> 00:53:40,200
you know?

1324
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,150
And so then that God,

1325
00:53:42,151 --> 00:53:44,850
the idea of deep in him that if he
could just get the hell out of here,

1326
00:53:44,851 --> 00:53:45,311
there are no,

1327
00:53:45,311 --> 00:53:47,010
it would bug him if he wanted to.

1328
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:52,460
Part of increasing the trust that he
had with me and so are the end of that

1329
00:53:52,621 --> 00:53:53,454
session,

1330
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:58,110
I was able to cover the needle with a
piece of paper so he couldn't see it and

1331
00:53:58,111 --> 00:54:00,250
touch his skin with a short bed.

1332
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:04,740
So that was pretty damn good because
that was both the needle like a needle.

1333
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,480
Then you can see it as
one thing and the naval.

1334
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:09,240
Then you can see it's held
by someone who'd been,

1335
00:54:09,241 --> 00:54:10,470
trust is another thing,

1336
00:54:10,770 --> 00:54:11,460
but a late,

1337
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,790
you can't see that's being moved
by someone that you sort of trust.

1338
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:16,050
That's a whole different thing.

1339
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,340
And he could manage that.

1340
00:54:17,430 --> 00:54:17,760
And anyway,

1341
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:17,880
no,

1342
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,300
if you have the doctor and his
needles and so arranged for him.

1343
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:26,360
And the moral of that story is you
don't have to relax number features,

1344
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:27,510
the things that you're afraid of.

1345
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:28,353
You just have enough money,

1346
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,203
want face.

1347
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:31,460
And that's so cool.

1348
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,061
Okay,

1349
00:54:32,061 --> 00:54:33,620
now let me tell you a different story.

1350
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:35,550
So that's part of group

1351
00:54:35,790 --> 00:54:40,790
[inaudible].

1352
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:50,160
One is you know of is set up straight
with your shoulders back and people have

1353
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:56,991
criticized that chapter misread or non
branded [inaudible] what I'm talking

1354
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,270
about,

1355
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,270
I'm talking about hierarchies is pile,

1356
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:02,840
you know,

1357
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,810
then to standing up straight with
your shoulders back and to somehow new

1358
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,320
dominant and powerful.

1359
00:55:07,410 --> 00:55:08,610
And that's complete rubbish.

1360
00:55:08,611 --> 00:55:10,710
That isn't what that
chapter is about at all.

1361
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:11,910
It's about something else.

1362
00:55:11,911 --> 00:55:13,560
It's about the idea of it all.

1363
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:16,010
If you're going to be
successful in your hierarchy,

1364
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,910
suppose things from
Harvard for free range,

1365
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:22,300
the best thing that you
can be as courageous and
because people admire George

1366
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,890
and they promoted the name and
the admired by late and they,

1367
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:26,370
and they,

1368
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:26,820
uh,

1369
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,370
they mimicking and,

1370
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:30,360
and if you're a courageous person,

1371
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,540
then people are happy with you.

1372
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:37,380
And then you can lead them and so forth.

1373
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,090
And,

1374
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:41,910
and to stand up straight with your
shoulders back this to maximally expose

1375
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:44,970
yourself to the world and
such an extensive courage.

1376
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,141
And so that's,

1377
00:55:46,141 --> 00:55:46,561
that's why,

1378
00:55:46,561 --> 00:55:47,394
that's,

1379
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,110
that's why that's a useful thing.

1380
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:54,630
And it turns out that our hierarchies
told so much reward power for example,

1381
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,720
as the reward offer id,

1382
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,051
things,

1383
00:55:58,051 --> 00:55:59,550
competence and so forth.

1384
00:55:59,551 --> 00:56:02,760
But you develop confidence as the
consequences of courage because you

1385
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:06,570
development prominence by facing things
that you don't have it yet mastered.

1386
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,780
Overcoming your fear and learning to
master them and then you become competent

1387
00:56:09,781 --> 00:56:10,501
and that moves you up.

1388
00:56:10,501 --> 00:56:14,580
The hierarchy in our
functional hierarchies are
predicated upon confidence and

1389
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:17,160
competence is predicated on courage.

1390
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:22,150
And so we should facilitate good way.

1391
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,330
It's pretty good way
of being in the world.

1392
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:26,980
What does it do for you?

1393
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,090
Why do you think there's no amount of you?

1394
00:56:31,091 --> 00:56:33,400
And there's a lot of the world and
the world's a pretty dangerous place.

1395
00:56:33,401 --> 00:56:34,840
And maybe what you should do is go high,

1396
00:56:35,470 --> 00:56:37,390
but that doesn't really help to hide,

1397
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:38,830
which is why it's going to parents.

1398
00:56:38,831 --> 00:56:40,690
And all they do is encourage you to hide.

1399
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,950
Then you have bad parents and they just
make you weak and then you're weak and

1400
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:46,240
maybe you're hiding,

1401
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,300
but it doesn't matter because
no matter where you hide me,

1402
00:56:49,301 --> 00:56:51,250
you're never going to be able to
hide from what you're afraid of.

1403
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,010
Because wherever you are,

1404
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:56,680
no matter how much do you hide
the thing that you're afraid of,

1405
00:56:56,681 --> 00:56:57,530
we'll find you.

1406
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:01,180
And even if it doesn't sign you in
the world and in the near future,

1407
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:02,590
we'll find you nightmares.

1408
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:03,521
It doesn't matter.

1409
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:06,250
There's no hiding from it at all.

1410
00:57:06,850 --> 00:57:09,970
And so as a parent who don't
try to protect your children,

1411
00:57:09,971 --> 00:57:11,440
who tried to get some strong,

1412
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,990
and you do that by
exposing them to the world,

1413
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:16,930
that's why you don't
bother Jim Escape one,

1414
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:19,660
not school rules or Memphis correctly.

1415
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:20,880
11 this rule,

1416
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:25,890
11 because skateboarding is dangerous
doing it involves mastery and you want to

1417
00:57:26,681 --> 00:57:27,150
do your job,

1418
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:31,240
the masculine World Cup to be protected
from the world because there's no

1419
00:57:31,450 --> 00:57:32,830
protection from the world.

1420
00:57:32,890 --> 00:57:35,950
And if you tried to protect
your child from the world,

1421
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:39,160
then you are the thing they
should be protected from.

1422
00:57:39,670 --> 00:57:43,600
So encouragement now,

1423
00:57:43,601 --> 00:57:44,900
watch what happens with you.

1424
00:57:44,950 --> 00:57:47,420
Load test yourself against it.

1425
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:50,020
Well the first thing is learned something.

1426
00:57:50,690 --> 00:57:54,490
And so the psychologist Pha
that I told you about before,

1427
00:57:54,491 --> 00:57:56,230
he watched how children
learned that he looked,

1428
00:57:56,290 --> 00:57:56,990
he noticed it,

1429
00:57:56,990 --> 00:57:57,530
you know,

1430
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:00,330
shop and try new things and
experiment with new things.

1431
00:58:00,331 --> 00:58:01,180
And you know,

1432
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,040
when my daughter was young for example,

1433
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:03,500
sorry,

1434
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,230
due to things that I felt quite cool,

1435
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:06,450
she had this little box,

1436
00:58:06,451 --> 00:58:08,830
a cardboard box and was full of books,

1437
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,753
cardboard books.

1438
00:58:09,810 --> 00:58:10,630
It was solid.

1439
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:14,380
We bought this fake Disney books and
about four that would fit into the little

1440
00:58:14,381 --> 00:58:15,040
bump box.

1441
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:19,420
And they sit very tightly and when she
would shake them out to the box and then

1442
00:58:19,421 --> 00:58:20,260
put them in,

1443
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,770
it was hard in what she was doing
was learning how to use your hands,

1444
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:24,970
which is actually quite useful.

1445
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:27,190
You may notice you use
your hands and went to bed.

1446
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,860
And so learning how foods
to have is a good thing.

1447
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:34,000
And so she would sit there and literally
for an hour [inaudible] the books and

1448
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:37,210
then putting them in and she could get
it for me out before I had no problem.

1449
00:58:37,211 --> 00:58:37,991
But that fourth one,

1450
00:58:37,991 --> 00:58:38,231
man,

1451
00:58:38,231 --> 00:58:42,820
that was a pain and she just worry at
40 worried [inaudible] would go in and

1452
00:58:42,821 --> 00:58:45,580
that the first thing she did was
shake it out of him achieving really

1453
00:58:45,581 --> 00:58:46,510
concentrating on that.

1454
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:47,740
So she was,

1455
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:52,480
she was mastering that technique
that was fuck hand eye coordination,

1456
00:58:52,481 --> 00:58:53,620
which is very useful.

1457
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:53,881
Let's see,

1458
00:58:53,881 --> 00:58:55,690
you want to stumble into
things and be awkward.

1459
00:58:55,690 --> 00:58:57,400
So that's what she was tipped trying.

1460
00:58:57,401 --> 00:59:00,520
And then I watched her on the
monkey bars in our backyard,

1461
00:59:00,730 --> 00:59:01,640
which she was very little.

1462
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:04,050
She was only maybe two months old.

1463
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,400
These monkey bars were
too high for her and,

1464
00:59:06,401 --> 00:59:09,520
but she wanted to try them anyways
and we would watch her with some

1465
00:59:09,521 --> 00:59:10,121
apprehension,

1466
00:59:10,121 --> 00:59:11,120
but we didn't run out.

1467
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,810
Then we had to wait until she was
three rounds out up and then and go,

1468
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:15,760
oh my God,

1469
00:59:15,761 --> 00:59:19,210
but your fault so that she would fall
and large endeavor to do that again.

1470
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:21,070
Just what you do is you're a bad parents.

1471
00:59:22,150 --> 00:59:22,983
Yeah.

1472
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:23,991
And then they say,

1473
00:59:23,991 --> 00:59:24,291
see,

1474
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,600
I told you right.

1475
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:26,391
That's fine.

1476
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:29,930
You can check into those things
you think you can do fall.

1477
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,060
Just like I said,

1478
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,270
as she's my scary,

1479
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,413
sorry,

1480
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:42,320
she'd be on the first
wrong and it should do this

1481
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:46,811
each.

1482
00:59:46,811 --> 00:59:48,340
Each time she left up her foot,

1483
00:59:48,341 --> 00:59:49,690
she left like an inch higher,

1484
00:59:49,691 --> 00:59:49,931
right?

1485
00:59:49,931 --> 00:59:52,990
She was just right on
that edge of disaster,

1486
00:59:53,410 --> 00:59:55,630
which is the best place to play.

1487
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,280
Everyone knows that play on the edge of
disaster cause that's where you learn.

1488
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:01,570
That's where it's exciting.

1489
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:04,510
And the reason it's exciting is because
that's when you're learning and your

1490
01:00:04,511 --> 01:00:07,480
brain is wired to make you
excited when you're learning.

1491
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,460
And so she was on the ragged edge being
calm about it because she'd get her foot

1492
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,090
up and get to the next rung and then,

1493
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:16,180
then she did the same
thing with the next one.

1494
01:00:16,580 --> 01:00:16,900
There.

1495
01:00:16,900 --> 01:00:18,020
You do it carefully.

1496
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,700
So African American and she managed to
go across the top of the monkey bars.

1497
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:26,170
That was a good paid for her and a good
day for us and hopefully that'd paper.

1498
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:28,290
Okay,

1499
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,240
well courageous and more
confident that she would be.

1500
01:00:30,241 --> 01:00:32,850
So she learned something from doing that.

1501
01:00:33,150 --> 01:00:33,871
You know when you can say,

1502
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:33,991
well,

1503
01:00:33,991 --> 01:00:37,730
she absorbed information from the world
and build from cell phone with them that

1504
01:00:37,731 --> 01:00:38,800
that's the way of thinking about it.

1505
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:39,270
You know,

1506
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,200
the more things you do,

1507
01:00:40,201 --> 01:00:44,100
the more you go around the world and you
do things and bang yourself up against

1508
01:00:44,101 --> 01:00:45,560
other people in other situations.

1509
01:00:45,990 --> 01:00:48,230
You learn what you shouldn't do
and you learn what you should.

1510
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:48,421
You know?

1511
01:00:48,421 --> 01:00:53,421
When you make yourself sharper and
more in swarm in the formation,

1512
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:55,730
that's what information means.

1513
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:59,400
You put yourself in the formation
with the world by incorporating the

1514
01:00:59,401 --> 01:01:03,210
information of the world and you do that
by exposing yourself to things that you

1515
01:01:03,211 --> 01:01:06,750
haven't yet mastered and you would
spend your mastery and that's deeply

1516
01:01:06,751 --> 01:01:07,500
meaningful.

1517
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:12,110
It's that instinct of meeting is exactly
that instinct that tells you when you

1518
01:01:12,111 --> 01:01:14,850
were optimizing the rate at which
your competence is developing.

1519
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,580
And that's a really lovely
thing to know because you don't,

1520
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:21,060
you'll find sometimes if you're
engaged in what you're doing,

1521
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,500
that's that that's a meaningful
thing that you're doing.

1522
01:01:23,501 --> 01:01:24,031
And you mind saying,

1523
01:01:24,031 --> 01:01:25,500
well there isn't any meaning in life.

1524
01:01:25,890 --> 01:01:26,670
Actually the rents,

1525
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:29,490
you just have to look around and
see when it manifests itself.

1526
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:34,050
And when it manifests itself is when
you're expanding that zone of competence

1527
01:01:34,410 --> 01:01:34,561
does,

1528
01:01:34,561 --> 01:01:36,140
that's what meaning is there a signifier?

1529
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,870
And so it's actually very reliable
instinct and it's really real.

1530
01:01:39,960 --> 01:01:42,900
It is telling you that you're in the
right place at the right time doing the

1531
01:01:42,901 --> 01:01:43,734
right thing.

1532
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:44,521
So that's,

1533
01:01:44,521 --> 01:01:45,810
that's a great thing to know.

1534
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:47,070
So,

1535
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,140
so you inform yourself.

1536
01:01:49,730 --> 01:01:50,610
And so here's how,

1537
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:51,780
here's a cool thing.

1538
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:56,980
So in the shark does Egil Cathedral
is a cross and a cross is a symbol,

1539
01:01:58,980 --> 01:01:59,581
a symbol,

1540
01:01:59,581 --> 01:02:00,151
an x,

1541
01:02:00,151 --> 01:02:03,880
and you're at the point of the episode
that's the x marks the spot and the

1542
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:04,920
support is you.

1543
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,330
And if it's a cross,

1544
01:02:06,331 --> 01:02:08,040
at least the Christian world,

1545
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:09,930
it's also a place of suffering.

1546
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:13,140
And that makes sense because
the x marks the spot.

1547
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:13,561
It's you.

1548
01:02:13,561 --> 01:02:15,000
It's characterized by suffering.

1549
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:16,810
So that's idea there.

1550
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,000
And then the question is,

1551
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:18,121
well,

1552
01:02:18,121 --> 01:02:19,600
what should you do about that suffering?

1553
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,453
Because

1554
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,000
well,

1555
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:21,940
it started with that.

1556
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,220
There's no avoiding it.

1557
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:24,900
It's worse than that.

1558
01:02:24,930 --> 01:02:27,840
It's normally that there's no
avoiding it and then it exists.

1559
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,660
It's then a few don't
know how to deal with it.

1560
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:32,430
And it just grinds you up,

1561
01:02:32,431 --> 01:02:34,890
which it certainly will if
you know how to deal with it,

1562
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:39,090
then that would make you bitter and
resentful and that will make you cruel.

1563
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:42,420
And once your banner and resentful
and cruel or they will start to become

1564
01:02:42,421 --> 01:02:44,890
destructive and then you'll
suffer even more and know,

1565
01:02:44,891 --> 01:02:46,020
spread that everywhere.

1566
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,580
So you actually need to
know how to deal with fits.

1567
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:50,840
And so in the sharp cathedral,

1568
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,990
there's this very cool thing,

1569
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:53,290
which is a big of room.

1570
01:02:53,291 --> 01:02:53,971
If it's a base,

1571
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:54,840
it's a circle.

1572
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:59,490
It's divided into four parts
and it's a simple pilgrimage.

1573
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:00,151
Okay,

1574
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:02,310
so what happens if you're a medieval type?

1575
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,330
When we go on a pilgrimage,

1576
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:05,340
it's sort of what you do
when you go to Europe,

1577
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:05,971
you know,

1578
01:03:05,971 --> 01:03:06,790
or whatever.

1579
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:09,420
Southeast Asia is real common
for kids to go to now to,

1580
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:10,051
it's sort of,

1581
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:14,160
they grow up and they leave their parents
and they go out on this pilgrimage and

1582
01:03:14,161 --> 01:03:18,390
they go where they haven't been and what
happens when they go where they haven't

1583
01:03:18,391 --> 01:03:19,590
been as hypothetically,

1584
01:03:19,591 --> 01:03:20,251
they grow up,

1585
01:03:20,251 --> 01:03:21,490
they have some adventures that you,

1586
01:03:21,491 --> 01:03:22,410
some stupid things,

1587
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:23,100
you know,

1588
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:27,120
but they have some adventures and they
take care of themselves and so when they

1589
01:03:27,121 --> 01:03:30,420
come back they're there more than they
are because they went somewhere and they

1590
01:03:30,421 --> 01:03:31,680
have to be.

1591
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,380
So there is a thing you want
to be more than you are,

1592
01:03:34,381 --> 01:03:36,570
then you should go
somewhere you haven't been.

1593
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:39,870
And that's the idea of going
on a pilgrimage to go to
the center of the world.

1594
01:03:39,930 --> 01:03:43,650
You have a big adventure on the way
there and then all the way back and then

1595
01:03:43,651 --> 01:03:45,960
you're not the same when you come
back here more than you were.

1596
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,870
Everyone should go on a
pilgrimage once in your life.

1597
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:50,140
Always had dealt with it,

1598
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:51,150
just structured properly.

1599
01:03:51,151 --> 01:03:55,320
Then you go to the center of things and
that's the idea of a holy pilgrimage.

1600
01:03:55,380 --> 01:03:57,720
Let's say that's something
that people would have felt,

1601
01:03:58,200 --> 01:04:00,250
but not everybody can afford
to go on a pilgrimage.

1602
01:04:00,251 --> 01:04:01,420
And maybe you can do it small.

1603
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,150
We said that the sharp cathedral,

1604
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:04,860
which is a cross,

1605
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:05,963
there's a base,

1606
01:04:05,970 --> 01:04:10,970
it's a big piece of 40 feet across and
it's a circle divided into four parts.

1607
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:12,480
So it's the world north,

1608
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:12,930
west,

1609
01:04:12,930 --> 01:04:13,970
east and sell.

1610
01:04:14,070 --> 01:04:18,390
And you can get to the
center of the labyrinth,

1611
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:21,600
but the way into the center
as you entered the labyrinth,

1612
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:27,260
and then you have to walk in
these pathways that demarcate
all of the quadrants.

1613
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,550
And to get to the symphony,

1614
01:04:29,551 --> 01:04:30,630
you have to go everywhere.

1615
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:33,390
That's an idea.

1616
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:34,920
To get to the center,

1617
01:04:35,880 --> 01:04:37,110
you have to go everywhere.

1618
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:39,540
And that's exactly right.

1619
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:40,710
And so,

1620
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,610
and why?

1621
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:41,851
Well,

1622
01:04:41,851 --> 01:04:43,140
if you go everywhere,

1623
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,190
and that takes courage,

1624
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,650
obviously to go everywhere because you'd
have to get in front of what you were

1625
01:04:46,651 --> 01:04:48,270
afraid to go everywhere.

1626
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,160
Then you get to the centuries things.

1627
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,680
But why?

1628
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:54,900
Well,

1629
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,510
here's one reason you,

1630
01:04:58,040 --> 01:04:59,430
you got a lot of information.

1631
01:04:59,431 --> 01:05:01,980
When you go places that's
pretty straight forward.

1632
01:05:02,150 --> 01:05:02,391
You know,

1633
01:05:02,391 --> 01:05:04,590
and I'm sure if you think about it,

1634
01:05:04,591 --> 01:05:05,520
maybe I'm wrong about this,

1635
01:05:05,521 --> 01:05:06,360
but I don't think so.

1636
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:12,140
What I've noticed in my life is that
every time I tried to do something that I

1637
01:05:12,211 --> 01:05:15,330
actually tried to do that works,

1638
01:05:15,630 --> 01:05:18,320
it doesn't necessarily get
me where was planning to go

1639
01:05:18,670 --> 01:05:19,640
with that plan.

1640
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:22,060
I've never read and picking up a skill,

1641
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:22,361
you know,

1642
01:05:22,361 --> 01:05:25,060
I pick up a stihl for a reason and
that means it doesn't work out.

1643
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:29,110
Then I've got the skill and then
inevitably that skill comes in useful for

1644
01:05:29,111 --> 01:05:30,340
something along the way.

1645
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:32,360
And so my sense is

1646
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:37,060
the things that I've
actually attempted to do,

1647
01:05:37,090 --> 01:05:37,390
you know,

1648
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:38,260
put some spirited,

1649
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:42,610
have paid off even though they didn't
necessarily pay off the way that I

1650
01:05:42,611 --> 01:05:43,460
expected anyway.

1651
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:45,263
That's okay.

1652
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:49,120
That doesn't matter so much whether
or not they paid off that matters.

1653
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:54,420
So the more things you bang
yourself up against voluntarily,

1654
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,250
the more courageous you become,

1655
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:58,870
the more skilled you become,

1656
01:05:59,410 --> 01:06:02,120
the more you're able to deal
with your own suffering.

1657
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:05,860
And that means the less drug you're going
to be because suffering than you can't

1658
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:10,861
manage mixing her up and suffering that
you can bear and even bear notably in

1659
01:06:11,171 --> 01:06:12,220
honor of leading well,

1660
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:13,180
then well,

1661
01:06:13,181 --> 01:06:15,620
that's the definition
of a well lived life.

1662
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:17,590
Here's something else that's cool.

1663
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:22,780
So there's this idea that if you,

1664
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:28,000
if you can confront the abyss and then
in the abyss there's a monster in the

1665
01:06:28,001 --> 01:06:32,020
belly of the monster is your father and
your father was laying there asleep or

1666
01:06:32,021 --> 01:06:32,854
dead.

1667
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:33,880
You see that in the story,

1668
01:06:33,881 --> 01:06:34,714
but they'll queue.

1669
01:06:35,620 --> 01:06:36,311
It's a very,

1670
01:06:36,311 --> 01:06:37,540
very old idea.

1671
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,291
It's a very,

1672
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:38,651
very,

1673
01:06:38,651 --> 01:06:39,270
very old idea.

1674
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:42,080
It's Elise 5,000 years old in,

1675
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,390
in recorded form,

1676
01:06:43,420 --> 01:06:45,340
which means it's way older than that,

1677
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,020
but it's really old idea.

1678
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,370
You look at a few,

1679
01:06:48,370 --> 01:06:48,691
we should be.

1680
01:06:48,691 --> 01:06:50,380
So that's what terrifies you in the abyss.

1681
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:54,370
There's a terrible monster than the most
advanced of your father that he's half

1682
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:56,740
again or to sleep and you see that.

1683
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:56,960
No,

1684
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:57,240
no,

1685
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:58,860
you don't use a puppet marionette,

1686
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:00,820
someone else's pulling his strings.

1687
01:07:00,830 --> 01:07:02,330
If you remember in the parochial movie,

1688
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:05,620
you may remember this with Velcro goes
to the rest of it is farther from the

1689
01:07:05,621 --> 01:07:06,250
depths.

1690
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,630
Not only is he a marionette puppet,

1691
01:07:07,631 --> 01:07:08,980
he's also a jackass.

1692
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,100
That's a bad combination.

1693
01:07:11,101 --> 01:07:13,450
And so not only as something
else pulling his strengths,

1694
01:07:13,451 --> 01:07:14,830
he still wouldn't headed puppet,

1695
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:17,620
but you braise nonsense because he's,

1696
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:18,400
he's,

1697
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,160
he's pathologized his capacity for,

1698
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,580
for for truthful speech.

1699
01:07:22,581 --> 01:07:23,710
So he's really in rough shape,

1700
01:07:23,711 --> 01:07:27,880
but he goes down to the depths right
to the bottom to see if the thing that

1701
01:07:27,881 --> 01:07:29,470
everything is most afraid of,

1702
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:30,970
that's the whale on sterling.

1703
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:31,950
We're may not foot.

1704
01:07:31,970 --> 01:07:33,410
He finds inside the way.

1705
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:33,880
I won't even know.

1706
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:38,080
There's no explanation in this story
at all about how Japan got there is his

1707
01:07:38,081 --> 01:07:41,950
father and then he rescues his father
from the belly of the whale and they go

1708
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,970
back up to the surface.

1709
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:44,740
Pinocchio becomes a real boy.

1710
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:49,060
So that's very interesting and it's
really interesting cause you go see that

1711
01:07:49,061 --> 01:07:49,361
movie,

1712
01:07:49,361 --> 01:07:50,170
right?

1713
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:51,970
All of you pretty much
have seen that movie.

1714
01:07:51,971 --> 01:07:53,590
It's like what the hell are you doing?

1715
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:54,820
Going to see that moving.

1716
01:07:54,880 --> 01:07:58,670
You're watching drawings of
a puppet led by a cricket,

1717
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,490
go to the ocean,

1718
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,860
find a whale to rescue his father,

1719
01:08:02,890 --> 01:08:05,400
and somehow that makes it
real and you're all capable.

1720
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:08,560
Makes perfect sense.

1721
01:08:08,561 --> 01:08:10,530
It's like we're making any sense at all

1722
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:14,490
unless you're were engaged by,

1723
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:15,980
is it because it's actually

1724
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:16,813
true?

1725
01:08:17,830 --> 01:08:19,010
Here's how it's true.

1726
01:08:19,790 --> 01:08:22,250
This is something geneticists
have discovered recently.

1727
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:23,721
So first of all,

1728
01:08:23,721 --> 01:08:26,690
here's the thing is that if you face
what you're afraid of your pants,

1729
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,060
you're going to find all
sorts of information,

1730
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:29,740
right?

1731
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,140
You're going to get it
all sorts of information.

1732
01:08:31,141 --> 01:08:35,010
You get back that information in Gq
and that's going to make you informed.

1733
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:36,760
So that's part of,

1734
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,350
as part of becoming you are

1735
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,640
now some of that information.

1736
01:08:43,641 --> 01:08:46,450
You're going to get it from other
people and those people cause you were

1737
01:08:46,451 --> 01:08:47,420
interacting with all of the time.

1738
01:08:47,421 --> 01:08:50,120
They're telling you all the time about
how to behave and how not to behave,

1739
01:08:50,390 --> 01:08:53,180
how to be an honorable person and
how not to be an awful person in.

1740
01:08:53,181 --> 01:08:54,440
The more you reflect that,

1741
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:58,610
the more you take on the characteristics
that are demanded of youth in some

1742
01:08:58,611 --> 01:08:59,444
sense,

1743
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:03,030
in the way that an ideal
is demanded itself.

1744
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:05,420
If you think about that
as a journal ideal,

1745
01:09:05,421 --> 01:09:06,380
at least in part,

1746
01:09:06,650 --> 01:09:08,030
you should be the great father.

1747
01:09:08,270 --> 01:09:09,310
That's who you should be.

1748
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,144
You should grow up.

1749
01:09:11,060 --> 01:09:13,610
That's what you should get when
everyone's telling you that at the top,

1750
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:14,683
including you.

1751
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:16,940
And so the more you hit
yourself against the world,

1752
01:09:16,941 --> 01:09:19,340
the more of that information you're
going to incorporate it into more of that

1753
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:20,240
and you want to do come.

1754
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:23,510
And that's something like rescue
your father from the abyss.

1755
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,370
But here's this thing that's even cooler,

1756
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:28,310
and it's associated with this
idea of the labyrinth as well.

1757
01:09:28,311 --> 01:09:29,450
So the labyrinth,

1758
01:09:29,451 --> 01:09:30,620
which is the pilgrimage,

1759
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:33,000
you have to go everywhere
to get to the middle.

1760
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:34,760
So here's what happens.

1761
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:37,940
If I take you out of your
comfortable environment,

1762
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:38,961
when to put new,

1763
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:39,860
something new,

1764
01:09:39,890 --> 01:09:41,650
put you somewhere new or even better,

1765
01:09:41,690 --> 01:09:43,430
you put yourself somewhere new.

1766
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:46,100
And that's the only thing
that really works by the way.

1767
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:50,330
So if I present you with a
challenge and it's involuntary,

1768
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:53,210
you'll produce a load of stress
hormones and it'll paralyze him.

1769
01:09:53,211 --> 01:09:55,370
But if you take on the
same challenge voluntarily,

1770
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:58,390
you have an entirely different
psychophysiological response to.

1771
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:00,590
It's a completely different things.

1772
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:02,390
You do it voluntary.

1773
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:05,130
And so you have to confront
the abyssal derelict.

1774
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,733
What happens?

1775
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:09,890
You put yourself in a
radically new situation,

1776
01:10:13,270 --> 01:10:16,460
your genes turn oh new proteins and
manufactured different structures in your

1777
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:17,294
brain.

1778
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:19,340
You turned your cell phone.

1779
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:21,740
But we don't know the limit to that.

1780
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,210
And so you haven't paid attention.

1781
01:10:25,440 --> 01:10:25,690
You know,

1782
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,700
we're going to potentially as part what
you could learn as a consequence of

1783
01:10:28,701 --> 01:10:29,690
being informed.

1784
01:10:29,870 --> 01:10:34,700
But there's also a potential genuinely
there's a potential inside of you at the

1785
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:38,840
molecular level and the way you turn
that potential audience by struck,

1786
01:10:38,841 --> 01:10:39,830
by stressing yourself,

1787
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,450
by challenging yourself,

1788
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:42,530
right?

1789
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:46,610
By adopting a sense of courage in the
world and by pushing yourself beyond where

1790
01:10:46,611 --> 01:10:48,440
you are into new domains.

1791
01:10:48,530 --> 01:10:50,270
And the consequence of the VAT is,

1792
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:55,360
is that the genes in your
neural structures cold for
Neupro proteins and they

1793
01:10:55,581 --> 01:10:57,820
may do a new thing out with you.

1794
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,220
And we have no idea what
the limit of that is.

1795
01:11:01,221 --> 01:11:01,821
It's so you think,

1796
01:11:01,821 --> 01:11:02,240
well,

1797
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:05,180
what's that new thing
that's being turned on?

1798
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:05,871
Well,

1799
01:11:05,871 --> 01:11:09,760
obviously you know it'd be around
for three and a half billion years.

1800
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:10,670
You're not stupid.

1801
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:12,830
Even though they asked
student from time to time,

1802
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:16,350
you have this limitless biological,

1803
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,320
in some sense it's ready
to manifest itself,

1804
01:11:19,321 --> 01:11:20,730
but it's not going to manifest itself.

1805
01:11:20,731 --> 01:11:21,564
That will key in.

1806
01:11:22,050 --> 01:11:26,560
It needs a reason to turn it on and so
you go somewhere new voluntarily and

1807
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:29,940
things that would help you
cope with that new thing.

1808
01:11:29,970 --> 01:11:31,800
Turn on and then you might think,

1809
01:11:31,801 --> 01:11:31,951
well,

1810
01:11:31,951 --> 01:11:32,400
what would happen?

1811
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:35,760
You can just go to the old it
on and that's who that might be.

1812
01:11:35,761 --> 01:11:36,561
Well then you would need to be,

1813
01:11:36,561 --> 01:11:41,280
you should be and that would be equivalent
to rescue your father from the belly,

1814
01:11:41,281 --> 01:11:42,114
from the base thing.

1815
01:11:42,270 --> 01:11:42,751
That would be that.

1816
01:11:42,751 --> 01:11:44,940
The same thing is take you on habit,

1817
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,310
that architectural,

1818
01:11:46,700 --> 01:11:47,533
what would you call it?

1819
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,690
That architecture than desirable structure
of authority and incorporating that

1820
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:53,070
in something like that.

1821
01:11:54,720 --> 01:11:54,940
Well,

1822
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:59,940
what you need in order to do that
is courage and faith to faith fit.

1823
01:12:00,870 --> 01:12:01,950
If you manifest courage,

1824
01:12:01,951 --> 01:12:04,770
that the consequences of
that will be positive.

1825
01:12:06,720 --> 01:12:08,830
And the only way you look for
find out is if you try it.

1826
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:10,260
And if no one else can tell you,

1827
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,130
pick an hint at it,

1828
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:12,030
but you can't do,

1829
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:13,780
this is something they can essentially.

1830
01:12:13,781 --> 01:12:15,400
So the 1953 is,

1831
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:16,350
it's on you.

1832
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:19,230
The only person that can find
out if this is actually true,

1833
01:12:19,231 --> 01:12:20,064
it's you.

1834
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:23,560
It's your the what she has to face the
things that you're particularly afraid of

1835
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:24,960
and you're the one,

1836
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,110
there's an old story,

1837
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:28,290
King Arthur and the
knights of the round table,

1838
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,750
they're often look for the holy grail,

1839
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,060
which is the container
of what everyone needs,

1840
01:12:33,090 --> 01:12:34,440
whatever that is.

1841
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:36,810
And of course they don't know where an
intelligible though for the holy grail,

1842
01:12:36,860 --> 01:12:37,411
who knows,

1843
01:12:37,411 --> 01:12:38,850
where do you go look for the holy grail?

1844
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:43,380
And so they move away from the round
table and they all enter the forest and

1845
01:12:43,381 --> 01:12:46,770
each of the master's before I step
a place that looks darkness to him.

1846
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,010
And that's when you started
the search for the holy grail.

1847
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:53,280
So that's very much worth knowing as well.

1848
01:12:54,210 --> 01:12:58,710
So courage for why do you need courage?

1849
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:04,370
Because like this terrible suffering and
it's malevolence and so you have every

1850
01:13:06,011 --> 01:13:07,190
reason to be terrified.

1851
01:13:07,820 --> 01:13:11,970
There was no real way out for them
because that's the ground of existence,

1852
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,051
but it turns out,

1853
01:13:13,051 --> 01:13:17,520
but that's okay because there's more
genes than we think and the way you find

1854
01:13:17,521 --> 01:13:21,990
out if it's more and what that more is
is by facing a thing that's terrifying

1855
01:13:22,050 --> 01:13:23,160
and maybe facing up thing.

1856
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:28,160
That's my level and as well because
that could be obligation to face the

1857
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:33,480
suffering of the world and strengthened
malevolence within it and it turns out

1858
01:13:33,481 --> 01:13:38,481
that even though that's an overwhelming
task by definition that you're probably

1859
01:13:38,521 --> 01:13:42,710
up to it and if you took on the
responsibility of doing that,

1860
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:43,553
pulling terribly,

1861
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:47,820
then what would happen is that you would
discover that you were up to and what

1862
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,230
the consequences of that would be,

1863
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:53,980
at least in part is not so much that
the suffering in life would disappear or

1864
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,220
God only knows how much
we can constrain it.

1865
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:58,350
If we all seriously tried,

1866
01:13:58,380 --> 01:14:01,320
but then in the attempt
to thinks any extreme,

1867
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:02,610
you'll find a meeting.

1868
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,510
It's so engaging and so overwhelming
that that in itself will serve as a

1869
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:10,920
medication against the suffering
of him and malevolence that exists.

1870
01:14:11,190 --> 01:14:12,340
And all of that

1871
01:14:12,430 --> 01:14:16,150
appears to be just simply true.

1872
01:14:18,920 --> 01:14:19,750
Thank you.

1873
01:14:19,750 --> 01:14:24,750
[inaudible]

1874
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,960
do a Q and a with the questions and
hopefully you guys do over the Internet.

1875
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:04,810
We've got a few things I
can go over it very quickly.

1876
01:15:04,811 --> 01:15:05,650
First of all,

1877
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:08,980
the shows us 48 or 49,

1878
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:11,150
I believe when this tour every night,

1879
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,510
a very different lecture.

1880
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:15,190
So we are in London tomorrow night,

1881
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,053
Ontario.

1882
01:15:16,590 --> 01:15:17,380
Uh,

1883
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:18,220
you want me to join us in?

1884
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:19,360
Both were in London,

1885
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:19,721
England,

1886
01:15:19,721 --> 01:15:21,690
and the October we're in Kitchener,

1887
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:22,670
then the following night,

1888
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:23,870
there are still tickets available.

1889
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:25,240
Let me come see us there.

1890
01:15:25,510 --> 01:15:25,880
Uh,

1891
01:15:25,880 --> 01:15:28,810
this door will continue to
the u s and some timber,

1892
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:29,470
uh,

1893
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:31,030
the UK in October and hopefully,

1894
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:31,520
uh,

1895
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:32,230
uh,

1896
01:15:32,230 --> 01:15:35,020
abroad in 2019.

1897
01:15:35,021 --> 01:15:38,950
And the thing is voting
for your translation with
multiple languages and it has

1898
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:39,970
really a phenomenon.

1899
01:15:39,971 --> 01:15:41,620
So you also mentioned,

1900
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:42,061
I believe this,

1901
01:15:42,061 --> 01:15:45,050
some offering a program offering dotcom.

1902
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:48,310
If you go there and the
code to the 12 rules,

1903
01:15:48,430 --> 01:15:50,800
you can get up to 50% off,

1904
01:15:50,801 --> 01:15:54,220
5% off on the self authoring program.

1905
01:15:54,250 --> 01:15:55,480
Highly recommend that.

1906
01:15:55,570 --> 01:15:56,403
Okay.

1907
01:15:56,590 --> 01:15:58,810
And now with no further ado,

1908
01:15:58,811 --> 01:16:01,030
please don't think that
will come back to the stage.

1909
01:16:01,330 --> 01:16:06,330
Dr. Jordan [inaudible].

1910
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:22,720
So someone named Zachary
Henderson said in Europe,

1911
01:16:23,590 --> 01:16:26,740
who is the handsomest man
in the front row tonight?

1912
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:31,800
[inaudible]

1913
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:38,650
anonymous sense.

1914
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:39,550
Um,

1915
01:16:39,550 --> 01:16:41,050
do you believe in aliens?

1916
01:16:43,090 --> 01:16:43,601
No,

1917
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:48,601
but they exist whether I believe
the number of [inaudible].

1918
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:02,560
So someone said,

1919
01:17:02,590 --> 01:17:07,590
how do you reconcile the very strong
interest in your work with what is

1920
01:17:09,261 --> 01:17:10,000
otherwise in general,

1921
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,890
generally have an aesthetic and
a disengaged approach to life.

1922
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:16,700
So someone that's an island stuff first,

1923
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:18,440
right?

1924
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:19,273
Because

1925
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:21,350
you know,

1926
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:26,350
there's kind of two broad categories of
existential catastrophe and one would be

1927
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,680
the escape into totalitarianism that
sort of crushes with its strictures.

1928
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,830
And the other is to let everything
fall apart and to become a nihilistic.

1929
01:17:39,831 --> 01:17:43,310
And the nihilistic attitude is generating,

1930
01:17:43,311 --> 01:17:48,311
predicated on the presumption now in
life is fundamentally meaningless.

1931
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:55,840
There's no superordinate meaning and
because life is short and painful and so

1932
01:17:58,830 --> 01:17:59,663
forth.

1933
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:05,120
And I think the answer to that is,

1934
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:06,500
well,

1935
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:11,420
the process of discovering because
you can discover the point.

1936
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:13,323
Um,

1937
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:16,340
but you have to first of all,

1938
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,040
assuming that you're too
ignorant to begin with,

1939
01:18:19,041 --> 01:18:24,041
to know what it is and also
to question your doubt itself.

1940
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:26,990
No,

1941
01:18:26,990 --> 01:18:30,380
because if you believe
that place is pointless,

1942
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,800
then you believe that what
you believe is correct.

1943
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:36,590
And that means you believe your beliefs.

1944
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:42,280
And it seems to me that you probably
not smart enough to unquestioning belief

1945
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:44,150
your beliefs.

1946
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,760
And you might start with a question,

1947
01:18:45,761 --> 01:18:46,730
can your doubt,

1948
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:48,470
why do we go with that?

1949
01:18:48,471 --> 01:18:50,090
Life has meaning.

1950
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:50,721
Well,

1951
01:18:50,721 --> 01:18:51,201
you might say,

1952
01:18:51,201 --> 01:18:51,620
well,

1953
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:54,500
it's just self evident given
its suffering infinity.

1954
01:18:54,890 --> 01:18:55,251
It's like,

1955
01:18:55,251 --> 01:18:55,761
well no,

1956
01:18:55,761 --> 01:18:57,200
that's not so self evident.

1957
01:18:57,230 --> 01:18:59,330
Maybe you're just
useless near responsible.

1958
01:18:59,331 --> 01:19:04,240
And you're justifying that by making
the cakes that life has made less

1959
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:04,500
something.

1960
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,460
You don't have to do anything and you
don't have to bear any responsibility.

1961
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:10,790
That's actually quite helpful if you
discover that because you think that

1962
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:13,910
everything is pointless and horrible
and it's just that you're useless and

1963
01:19:13,911 --> 01:19:18,040
that's way better because
if you're just used to us,

1964
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:19,670
you could forget and fix that.

1965
01:19:19,671 --> 01:19:21,260
But if life was pointless and horrible,

1966
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,580
then you basically do.

1967
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:26,270
So you can substitute
nihilism for humility.

1968
01:19:26,780 --> 01:19:29,000
You can substitute humility for nihilism.

1969
01:19:29,660 --> 01:19:31,190
That would be a good start.

1970
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:36,730
And then the first to ask this question
obviously has a genuinely empathetic and

1971
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:38,300
disadvantaged approach to life,

1972
01:19:38,630 --> 01:19:43,010
but finds that they're very
strongly interested in my work.

1973
01:19:43,011 --> 01:19:43,281
Okay?

1974
01:19:43,281 --> 01:19:48,230
So then the first thing can do
that is to notice that you're not

1975
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:51,790
completely empathetic in this occasion.

1976
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,150
You're apathetic condition,

1977
01:19:53,510 --> 01:19:58,010
but there's some spark in the
darkness and you don't know why.

1978
01:19:58,070 --> 01:20:02,420
I could stare at east and this is a
useful thing if you're feeling hopeless.

1979
01:20:02,570 --> 01:20:02,991
And I mean,

1980
01:20:02,991 --> 01:20:06,090
there's lots of reasons why someone might
be feeling hopeless and sometimes when

1981
01:20:06,091 --> 01:20:09,450
people are feeling hopeless because
they're physically ill in one matter.

1982
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:13,160
So I'm not thinking about
this as a universal panacea.

1983
01:20:13,180 --> 01:20:15,360
I know there's lots of
reasons for being depressed.

1984
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:16,540
Um,

1985
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:17,071
and that,

1986
01:20:17,071 --> 01:20:20,040
that's not that easy to
distinguish from being nihilistic.

1987
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:24,330
But if you notice that there
are some things that grip you,

1988
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:27,120
that's a useful place to start.

1989
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:28,080
It's like,

1990
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:28,471
Oh look,

1991
01:20:28,471 --> 01:20:29,580
I'm interested in something.

1992
01:20:30,220 --> 01:20:31,410
Well that's a mystery,

1993
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:32,240
right?

1994
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,530
Cause you can't make yourself
interested in something.

1995
01:20:35,640 --> 01:20:39,150
You can notice that they were interested
in something and then you can pursue

1996
01:20:39,151 --> 01:20:39,630
it.

1997
01:20:39,630 --> 01:20:40,860
Interest to sort of like,

1998
01:20:41,130 --> 01:20:41,970
it's like a beacon.

1999
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:43,380
The clippers in the darkness.

2000
01:20:43,381 --> 01:20:44,970
If you follow what you're interested in,

2001
01:20:45,180 --> 01:20:47,760
especially if you do an honest action.

2002
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:48,733
A crucial,

2003
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,090
which is why I wrote rule eight,

2004
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,250
tell the truth or at least a lie.

2005
01:20:53,280 --> 01:20:54,780
If you're going to follow
when you're interested in,

2006
01:20:54,781 --> 01:20:55,810
then you've been an [inaudible].

2007
01:20:55,860 --> 01:20:56,671
Because if you lie,

2008
01:20:56,671 --> 01:20:59,040
you have fun with John is
the mechanism of interest.

2009
01:20:59,041 --> 01:21:00,770
And then it lead you off of cliffs.

2010
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:02,880
So if you're gonna follow
what you're interested in,

2011
01:21:02,881 --> 01:21:05,880
that you've been in the audience because
otherwise you're following someone

2012
01:21:05,881 --> 01:21:06,840
dishonest.

2013
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,220
That's a very bad idea.

2014
01:21:08,850 --> 01:21:09,270
So,

2015
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:10,051
but in any case,

2016
01:21:10,051 --> 01:21:12,000
if you don't notice that
you're interested in something,

2017
01:21:12,450 --> 01:21:14,430
even if you're interested
in something like music,

2018
01:21:14,431 --> 01:21:15,420
I don't care what it is,

2019
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:16,680
if you're interested in something,

2020
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:19,230
then that thing that you're
interested in in guidance,

2021
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:23,090
you know what we need in the
Harry Potter movies there,

2022
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,020
they played that quidditch game.

2023
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:28,770
And you know that's a funny game
because there's the normal game,

2024
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:30,630
sort of like basketball.

2025
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:35,660
So if you played on brooms and then
there's a game that rises out of that,

2026
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:38,340
which is the gate of the secrets play,

2027
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:39,660
there's two secrets.

2028
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:42,170
And they chased this little
ball with wings on it.

2029
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:45,930
That's actually an ancient symbol
as the hell chemical chaos.

2030
01:21:45,931 --> 01:21:46,710
And it's uh,

2031
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:49,320
it's the container of
the unrevealed world.

2032
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:50,011
That's what the hell,

2033
01:21:50,011 --> 01:21:50,821
chemical chaos.

2034
01:21:50,821 --> 01:21:53,820
Cause that's what that
stitches interesting way.

2035
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:54,180
How Fun.

2036
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:56,920
I don't know how they helped JK
Rowling ever figured that out,

2037
01:21:56,921 --> 01:21:57,271
I think is,

2038
01:21:57,271 --> 01:21:59,010
it's unbelievably obscure knowns.

2039
01:21:59,011 --> 01:22:04,011
But she gets figured out and the secrets
chased that and that thing flipped

2040
01:22:04,381 --> 01:22:04,801
around,

2041
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:05,010
right?

2042
01:22:05,010 --> 01:22:05,601
And it goes ever.

2043
01:22:05,601 --> 01:22:06,540
It's like a mercury,

2044
01:22:06,541 --> 01:22:08,250
the winged messenger of the gods.

2045
01:22:08,251 --> 01:22:09,240
It's the same idea.

2046
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:12,690
And the secrets follow this
thing that fits around,

2047
01:22:12,691 --> 01:22:16,440
that's a Goldman glitters and
bleed and that's meaning itself.

2048
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:21,300
And the idea that's expressed in the
game of quidditch is that the person who

2049
01:22:21,301 --> 01:22:26,190
pursues meaning and fights and is when
something of such colossal magnitude that

2050
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:30,350
the entire game is that
everyone who was blame,

2051
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:37,250
something of such a colossal magnitude
that he is declared victorious right at

2052
01:22:37,621 --> 01:22:38,340
that moment.

2053
01:22:38,340 --> 01:22:41,940
That's really what that is symbolizing
in the structure of the movie,

2054
01:22:41,941 --> 01:22:42,721
which is so cool.

2055
01:22:42,721 --> 01:22:45,690
But you manage that and it's
such as such as stroke of genius,

2056
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:47,460
but you can do that in your life.

2057
01:22:47,490 --> 01:22:47,701
You know,

2058
01:22:47,701 --> 01:22:50,630
there'll be things that glimmer in
glitter for you in the darkness.

2059
01:22:50,631 --> 01:22:52,170
And you said,

2060
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:53,530
Andrew is a person.

2061
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:54,810
How's this question,

2062
01:22:55,290 --> 01:22:56,123
um,

2063
01:22:56,130 --> 01:22:59,790
that you hit and you have a
strong interest in my work?

2064
01:22:59,850 --> 01:23:01,740
Well then I would say be
a little more precise.

2065
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:03,840
Right?

2066
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:04,321
Exactly.

2067
01:23:04,321 --> 01:23:06,750
What is it that you're
interested in or decisive?

2068
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,160
What is it that's
gathering your attention?

2069
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,720
Because that's up marker to the,

2070
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:13,150
that's a door.

2071
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:16,270
That's the doorway through which
you must pass into your life.

2072
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:17,650
That's what that is.

2073
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,660
And that's what meaning marks out for me.

2074
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:20,740
No,

2075
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:22,180
it's likely we see,

2076
01:23:22,181 --> 01:23:24,610
we see in front of us a set of doors,

2077
01:23:24,640 --> 01:23:25,360
so that's the,

2078
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:29,430
that's the world in front of us is
an infinite set of doorways and,

2079
01:23:29,431 --> 01:23:33,250
and we can open the doorways and
all sorts of things will come out.

2080
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:37,870
We don't face some that
were not determined by the
material reality around us,

2081
01:23:38,170 --> 01:23:41,890
but we are to some degree that
isn't the world that confronts us.

2082
01:23:41,910 --> 01:23:46,150
The world that confronts us is a vast
expansive potential and possibility.

2083
01:23:46,151 --> 01:23:48,880
You all know that I can wake up
in the morning and you think,

2084
01:23:49,060 --> 01:23:52,810
well there are things to do or there
are ways that I can behave that will

2085
01:23:52,811 --> 01:23:54,220
produce certain consequences,

2086
01:23:54,221 --> 01:23:55,510
some negative.

2087
01:23:55,510 --> 01:23:56,420
It's a positive.

2088
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:00,350
It's this expansive potential and that
was certainly what you in front of them

2089
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:04,930
as a human being is you
confront the expensive potential
with your consciousness

2090
01:24:04,931 --> 01:24:08,470
and your consciousness is exactly that
which transformed that potential into

2091
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:13,590
actuality and your moral and your moral
and your morality determines whether you

2092
01:24:16,781 --> 01:24:21,540
transformed that potential into
a good world or a bad word.

2093
01:24:21,970 --> 01:24:23,040
And you all know that too,

2094
01:24:23,050 --> 01:24:25,840
because you know that you can make bad
decisions and make things worse and you

2095
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:28,060
could make their decisions
and make things better.

2096
01:24:28,300 --> 01:24:30,070
And so that's an actual too,

2097
01:24:30,071 --> 01:24:35,071
that's an echo of what happens in genesis
when God creates the world of chaos is

2098
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,050
it's a decision to,

2099
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:42,570
to speak the truth and to interact with
the Kaylyn jumps on to produce having

2100
01:24:42,670 --> 01:24:43,503
[inaudible].

2101
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,640
It's in that image that were made.

2102
01:24:45,670 --> 01:24:46,780
That's the story.

2103
01:24:46,880 --> 01:24:48,010
It's a great story.

2104
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:51,370
And we all believe it cause we treat each
other like that and predicated or into

2105
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:52,660
our political system.

2106
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:54,550
And the idea that that's what we are.

2107
01:24:54,970 --> 01:24:55,721
And then you might say,

2108
01:24:55,721 --> 01:24:59,500
well how will it was due doorways in front
of you and which one should you open?

2109
01:24:59,501 --> 01:25:00,191
That's her as well.

2110
01:25:00,191 --> 01:25:00,920
How about the people?

2111
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,570
But the one that clips and
it attracts your attention.

2112
01:25:04,810 --> 01:25:07,030
And that's a deep
manifestation of the instincts,

2113
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:07,421
the meeting.

2114
01:25:07,421 --> 01:25:12,100
And so something beckons t and then you
can open it and then something comes out

2115
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:12,550
of it.

2116
01:25:12,550 --> 01:25:13,900
And that changes everything.

2117
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,850
And then what beckons will change.

2118
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,830
And that's what happens when
you follow your instinct.

2119
01:25:17,831 --> 01:25:18,664
For meeting,

2120
01:25:19,020 --> 01:25:20,830
but you have to be humbled to do that.

2121
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:24,850
You have to be willing to see what it
is that glitters of the darkness and you

2122
01:25:24,851 --> 01:25:29,020
have to lower yourself so that you're
willing to pursue it because it won't be

2123
01:25:29,021 --> 01:25:31,870
something high and mighty to begin with
because why the hell should it be if you

2124
01:25:31,871 --> 01:25:35,170
don't know what you're doing and you don't
know who you are and you're enveloped

2125
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:37,360
in chaos and you're at your,

2126
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:38,350
what would you say?

2127
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:38,861
Hopeless.

2128
01:25:38,861 --> 01:25:40,210
And I'm disciplined than useless.

2129
01:25:40,211 --> 01:25:44,350
Why would something magnificent manifest
itself for you to begin when it's

2130
01:25:44,351 --> 01:25:47,820
supposed to be something small enough
so someone like you would have to get on

2131
01:25:47,821 --> 01:25:48,770
their hands and knees to,

2132
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:49,923
to approach.

2133
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:52,360
Maybe you have to clean up your room.

2134
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,170
Maybe you have to scrape the
dust bunnies underneath your bed.

2135
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,153
You know,

2136
01:25:57,160 --> 01:26:00,640
maybe you have to do those things that
you know you should do that you've been

2137
01:26:00,641 --> 01:26:02,380
putting off because they're beneath you.

2138
01:26:02,390 --> 01:26:02,801
It's no,

2139
01:26:02,801 --> 01:26:04,400
they're now,

2140
01:26:04,450 --> 01:26:09,430
I haven't no money or exactly what you
have for is go have no matter how small.

2141
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:14,330
And so you would talk to your
responsibility and you follow it.

2142
01:26:14,331 --> 01:26:17,570
Beckons is meaningful and you do that.

2143
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:21,110
And humility knowing that you're not in
a position to judge the world and you

2144
01:26:21,111 --> 01:26:21,944
say,

2145
01:26:23,270 --> 01:26:25,930
I haven't generally apathetic and
distribution approach to life,

2146
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:30,630
it's like well what makes you think
you're a reliable structure meeting?

2147
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:32,240
Why?

2148
01:26:32,240 --> 01:26:33,230
It's a good question.

2149
01:26:36,410 --> 01:26:40,820
So before you dismiss the
cost monks as insignificant,

2150
01:26:41,570 --> 01:26:45,230
you might want to make sure that you
put yourself together to the degree that

2151
01:26:45,231 --> 01:26:46,064
you can,

2152
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,720
cause you may be missing
something you never know.

2153
01:26:49,830 --> 01:26:54,830
So [inaudible]

2154
01:27:09,670 --> 01:27:10,503
does

2155
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:14,390
everything you believe makes you hopeless.

2156
01:27:15,620 --> 01:27:18,530
Then maybe you would question
the utility of what you believe.

2157
01:27:23,960 --> 01:27:28,820
And I ran in a cocktail hour,

2158
01:27:30,710 --> 01:27:31,660
cocktail hour,

2159
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,560
a woman talks to a psychiatrist,

2160
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:34,530
I believe that a party,

2161
01:27:34,960 --> 01:27:36,200
hence the cocktail hour.

2162
01:27:36,570 --> 01:27:40,250
And she's trying to ask him for
professional advice and she says,

2163
01:27:40,251 --> 01:27:40,431
look,

2164
01:27:40,431 --> 01:27:44,060
I'm having a pretty rough time in
my life is not what it should be.

2165
01:27:44,310 --> 01:27:46,020
If I'm suffering from Marilyn

2166
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:49,790
and I really hope there's
something wrong with me.

2167
01:27:50,190 --> 01:27:54,860
And the psychiatrist is sort of taken
aback but there's something wrong with

2168
01:27:54,861 --> 01:27:55,061
you.

2169
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:55,581
And she says,

2170
01:27:55,581 --> 01:27:56,414
well,

2171
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,060
as far as I can tell him,

2172
01:27:58,070 --> 01:27:59,660
it's only two possibilities.

2173
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:03,260
Either there's something wrong with
me and that's why I'm suffering

2174
01:28:04,460 --> 01:28:05,293
unsupportive.

2175
01:28:05,780 --> 01:28:08,840
Or there's something wrong with the
structure of existence and that's why I'm

2176
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:09,890
suffering.

2177
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:13,460
And if there's something wrong
with the structure and existence,

2178
01:28:13,461 --> 01:28:16,280
well then what am I going to do?

2179
01:28:17,140 --> 01:28:17,973
Nothing.

2180
01:28:19,130 --> 01:28:20,990
But if there's something wrong with me,

2181
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,330
then I can fix it.

2182
01:28:24,520 --> 01:28:26,300
And so that's chapter six,

2183
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:29,570
which is the dark chapter in 12 months.

2184
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:32,730
Your life is to meditation on the
motivation of people who do such things as

2185
01:28:32,731 --> 01:28:34,100
shoot up elementary schools.

2186
01:28:35,030 --> 01:28:39,800
And the rule is put your house in perfect
order before you criticize the world.

2187
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,760
And if everything is around you was
meaningless because of your beliefs.

2188
01:28:43,761 --> 01:28:45,140
The first thing you might think as well,

2189
01:28:45,141 --> 01:28:47,390
maybe it's your beliefs and not the world.

2190
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:49,820
And so that's,

2191
01:28:50,030 --> 01:28:51,020
that's not believable.

2192
01:28:51,021 --> 01:28:52,860
Helpful thing to realize.

2193
01:28:52,861 --> 01:28:54,080
You've been dealt with your own

2194
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:01,940
[inaudible]

2195
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:12,113
on

2196
01:29:14,310 --> 01:29:15,143
your website.

2197
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:23,760
I'm six foot piece of art,

2198
01:29:25,510 --> 01:29:27,960
so that's about six feet square.

2199
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:33,050
It's made for cases like the labyrinth
that I've described and it's later.

2200
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:39,720
It's fun and it's a bit of a quarter
inch layer of some full course,

2201
01:29:39,871 --> 01:29:44,871
full court to say it's a labor room
start foam with a layer of paper on each

2202
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:46,410
side and the software,

2203
01:29:46,420 --> 01:29:47,253
new institute

2204
01:29:48,930 --> 01:29:52,740
as backing for prints and so
forth or frame Darren works.

2205
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:56,060
But I decided about the 1980s with,

2206
01:29:56,080 --> 01:30:00,780
I'm just going to make foam
core sculptures that were
half sculpture and have

2207
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:01,663
pagans.

2208
01:30:01,800 --> 01:30:06,060
I made half a dozen of them before
I ended up doing other things.

2209
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:11,270
And one of the things that I made back
then was this sculpture that I called the

2210
01:30:11,371 --> 01:30:12,420
meaning of music.

2211
01:30:12,870 --> 01:30:15,870
And I was really interested
in music at that point,

2212
01:30:16,230 --> 01:30:20,930
partly because I was trying to sort
out the phenomenology of meaning.

2213
01:30:21,460 --> 01:30:24,270
What is meaning and is it something real?

2214
01:30:24,530 --> 01:30:25,440
If it's something real,

2215
01:30:25,441 --> 01:30:28,710
what does it represent
or what is all of that?

2216
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:32,160
And one of the things I had
noticed was that people fall,

2217
01:30:32,161 --> 01:30:34,560
we music intrinsically meaningful.

2218
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:39,240
And that was very interesting
to me because even nihilistic
people couldn't help

2219
01:30:39,241 --> 01:30:41,070
but find music meaningful.

2220
01:30:41,430 --> 01:30:44,850
And so it was 1983 or [inaudible] 84,

2221
01:30:45,250 --> 01:30:45,870
um,

2222
01:30:45,870 --> 01:30:48,450
punk rock movement was still pretty

2223
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:50,950
powerful.

2224
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:54,840
It's still a going concern that
function like the sex pistols.

2225
01:30:59,160 --> 01:30:59,993
And

2226
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:04,430
I noticed that even the nihilistic
punk rock I just found there.

2227
01:31:04,431 --> 01:31:05,264
And nihilistic,

2228
01:31:05,540 --> 01:31:06,930
extremely meaningful,

2229
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:12,150
which I thought was
[inaudible] celebrating,

2230
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:13,800
anarchic,

2231
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:14,431
nihilism.

2232
01:31:14,431 --> 01:31:16,040
They were brilliant to their music.

2233
01:31:16,250 --> 01:31:21,250
[inaudible] using these two because
it's an art form and it goes underneath

2234
01:31:22,171 --> 01:31:22,591
thinking.

2235
01:31:22,591 --> 01:31:24,450
It's also a good antidote to,

2236
01:31:25,120 --> 01:31:26,940
to rational skepticism,

2237
01:31:26,941 --> 01:31:30,330
which is why music has become such
a powerful force in our culture.

2238
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:31,710
People love music.

2239
01:31:31,711 --> 01:31:33,680
And I think without music,

2240
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:35,420
any people just died.

2241
01:31:36,350 --> 01:31:40,570
And it's because music
speaks of meaning directly.

2242
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:42,150
Like when you listen to music,

2243
01:31:42,151 --> 01:31:43,110
when you're into it,

2244
01:31:43,290 --> 01:31:44,360
when you're enjoying it,

2245
01:31:44,370 --> 01:31:45,570
you're not really enjoying it.

2246
01:31:45,571 --> 01:31:48,000
You're finding the experience meaningful.

2247
01:31:48,410 --> 01:31:49,243
And,

2248
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:53,260
and it's fun to watch people play music
because they can train themselves,

2249
01:31:53,810 --> 01:31:55,550
watch people improvise,

2250
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:55,771
you know,

2251
01:31:55,771 --> 01:32:00,250
because they're all trained together
and doing this normal thing.

2252
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:03,210
They're all got the average where they
shouldn't be there doing it beautiful

2253
01:32:03,211 --> 01:32:03,790
again.

2254
01:32:03,790 --> 01:32:06,370
So I talked a lot about
what music represented.

2255
01:32:08,180 --> 01:32:09,013
Um,

2256
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:10,890
and I spent about four months making,

2257
01:32:10,900 --> 01:32:15,190
this is painting and I thought what are
we trying to do is to make a piece of

2258
01:32:15,191 --> 01:32:20,191
art that represented visually what music
represented in the auditory relevance.

2259
01:32:21,161 --> 01:32:22,930
So if you look at that local,

2260
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:24,560
they'll see that it's like a neck Q,

2261
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:29,020
but nick was really just one of
those reversing cubes and I made the,

2262
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:34,230
I made the painting so that you couldn't
resolve at visually so that if you look

2263
01:32:34,331 --> 01:32:34,650
out,

2264
01:32:34,650 --> 01:32:38,270
if gaze at it without
focusing too much on,

2265
01:32:38,271 --> 01:32:39,370
just see that it moves,

2266
01:32:39,371 --> 01:32:39,821
it moves,

2267
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:40,241
moves,

2268
01:32:40,241 --> 01:32:42,970
moves as your brain tries
to resolve what it is.

2269
01:32:43,210 --> 01:32:48,210
What it actually is is a cube set on an
without with a tunnel about the mental,

2270
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:51,350
it broken into four fragments.

2271
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,170
Another thing that it is,

2272
01:32:53,171 --> 01:32:54,004
it's a,

2273
01:32:54,430 --> 01:32:58,840
it's a three dimensional representation
of a two dimensional representation of a

2274
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:00,220
foreign object.

2275
01:33:00,760 --> 01:33:03,360
That's actually because music
is a four dimensional object,

2276
01:33:03,361 --> 01:33:03,650
right?

2277
01:33:03,650 --> 01:33:04,840
Because it has three dimensions,

2278
01:33:04,841 --> 01:33:09,430
spatial spatial dimensions because
you don't use it as rained in space.

2279
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:12,310
That's what happens when
you listen to stereo if see,

2280
01:33:12,580 --> 01:33:14,920
feel or hear how it's a rating space.

2281
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:17,320
And then it just unfolds across time.

2282
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:18,970
So it's got four dimensions.

2283
01:33:19,540 --> 01:33:22,990
And the reason music is meaningful and
Mr [inaudible] an awful long time to

2284
01:33:22,991 --> 01:33:27,991
figure out is because the things that
you see in the world that you think are

2285
01:33:28,511 --> 01:33:29,950
objects aren't objects.

2286
01:33:29,951 --> 01:33:34,951
They're actually patents
and their patterns that you
interact with in a manner

2287
01:33:36,190 --> 01:33:37,750
that makes them into tools.

2288
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:40,410
And so often the tool,

2289
01:33:40,420 --> 01:33:45,420
so you're a pattern because you
maintain your structure across time.

2290
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:49,480
So that's about having something that
big canes instructor across time.

2291
01:33:50,170 --> 01:33:52,930
And so all the things that we perceive,

2292
01:33:52,931 --> 01:33:54,930
our patterns and patterns,

2293
01:33:55,240 --> 01:33:56,021
all the patterns,

2294
01:33:56,021 --> 01:33:57,060
there's a world and there were many,

2295
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,080
I mean you think about all the
patterns here and they don't have,

2296
01:33:59,081 --> 01:33:59,914
right?

2297
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:02,800
You go down to the subatomic level
and there's an array of pallets,

2298
01:34:02,801 --> 01:34:03,970
and then above that,

2299
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:04,860
at the atomic level,

2300
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:06,290
there's another array of accountants.

2301
01:34:06,310 --> 01:34:08,980
And then at the molecular level
there's another array of patterns.

2302
01:34:08,981 --> 01:34:10,870
And then your organs are patterns.

2303
01:34:10,871 --> 01:34:11,671
And then there's youth,

2304
01:34:11,671 --> 01:34:12,291
it's a powder.

2305
01:34:12,291 --> 01:34:16,030
And then there's you moving through
space with all these other people.

2306
01:34:16,031 --> 01:34:16,930
And that's a pattern.

2307
01:34:16,950 --> 01:34:19,240
And then there's the political system.

2308
01:34:19,300 --> 01:34:21,880
Or let's say that the town
that we're in and down,

2309
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:23,440
some pattern in the political system,

2310
01:34:23,441 --> 01:34:25,720
not some pattern and
the ecological system,

2311
01:34:25,721 --> 01:34:26,560
and that's a pattern.

2312
01:34:26,561 --> 01:34:30,640
And then there's the cosmos itself and
that was a pattern and that's the harmony

2313
01:34:30,641 --> 01:34:31,474
of the spheres.

2314
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:36,340
All those patterns are interacting in
a harmonious way and that's what music

2315
01:34:36,341 --> 01:34:37,270
represents.

2316
01:34:38,200 --> 01:34:41,590
It represents the harmonious interaction
of the patterns of the world.

2317
01:34:42,040 --> 01:34:45,340
And then when you go out to a bar and
your doubts and what you're doing is

2318
01:34:45,341 --> 01:34:48,370
you're a regular body
alone without pattern,

2319
01:34:48,410 --> 01:34:51,990
you find that deeply meaningful like you
should because you shouldn't read the

2320
01:34:51,991 --> 01:34:54,640
body in alignment with
the patterns of the world.

2321
01:34:54,910 --> 01:34:58,130
And then when you dance with someone
else and maybe that was someone that you

2322
01:34:58,131 --> 01:34:58,850
love,

2323
01:34:58,850 --> 01:35:03,850
then you mutually produce a pattern and
you're improvising with each other to

2324
01:35:04,011 --> 01:35:08,390
produce that pattern and your simultaneous
aligning the pattern that you're both

2325
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:10,060
producing with all the pack.

2326
01:35:10,090 --> 01:35:11,390
We all any of the music.

2327
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:13,400
And so you're acting out the action,

2328
01:35:13,640 --> 01:35:18,110
you're acting out the act
of engaging in a dialogue,

2329
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:19,570
dialogue,

2330
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:20,403
just dialed belt,

2331
01:35:20,590 --> 01:35:20,801
right?

2332
01:35:20,801 --> 01:35:25,801
So you're engaging in a dialogue that
produces a pad that adapts you to the

2333
01:35:26,361 --> 01:35:29,030
structure of the patterns of the world
and that's what you're doing and you're

2334
01:35:29,031 --> 01:35:29,864
dancing.

2335
01:35:30,590 --> 01:35:33,710
And so I figured all that out with regards
to music and turned to portray that

2336
01:35:33,711 --> 01:35:36,310
in that logo and that simple.

2337
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,160
And then since then I've
been experimenting with that
symbol joined to see how

2338
01:35:40,161 --> 01:35:44,690
many different forms I could get it to
tenants as I can get it to manifest in

2339
01:35:44,691 --> 01:35:45,530
the world.

2340
01:35:45,860 --> 01:35:47,770
And so it's propagating like mad.

2341
01:35:47,960 --> 01:35:51,350
And that was part of what I wanted
to do when I made 35 years ago.

2342
01:35:51,480 --> 01:35:52,240
I thought,

2343
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:55,310
I'll make this thing and see how many
different ways it will manifest itself in

2344
01:35:55,311 --> 01:35:56,144
the world.

2345
01:35:56,450 --> 01:36:01,450
So that's the story of
the local [inaudible].

2346
01:36:36,730 --> 01:36:37,610
Okay.

2347
01:36:39,250 --> 01:36:44,250
[inaudible]

2348
01:37:13,430 --> 01:37:14,263
by

2349
01:37:16,260 --> 01:37:17,020
you're not going to be,

2350
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:18,650
you're on someone's deathbed

2351
01:37:22,290 --> 01:37:23,123
even.

2352
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:35,960
So you have to be extraordinarily
careful with their terminology.

2353
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:39,860
When people say that they
want to be happening,

2354
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:40,401
first of all,

2355
01:37:40,401 --> 01:37:41,234
they don't mean that.

2356
01:37:41,300 --> 01:37:42,560
When you say you wouldn't be happy,

2357
01:37:42,561 --> 01:37:44,090
that's not actually what you mean.

2358
01:37:44,480 --> 01:37:46,740
There's plenty of
psychological evidence that,

2359
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:49,160
because if you take measures,

2360
01:37:50,240 --> 01:37:51,320
we all be,

2361
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,820
and you analyze the statistics,

2362
01:37:54,260 --> 01:37:58,590
what you find is that when people
really don't want is to be anxious and

2363
01:37:58,591 --> 01:37:59,424
impatient.

2364
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,890
So happiness is a positive
emotion over and above that.

2365
01:38:04,891 --> 01:38:08,490
But if you force people
to make a trade on scale,

2366
01:38:08,550 --> 01:38:11,130
don't pick absence of misery and anxiety.

2367
01:38:11,131 --> 01:38:11,520
But that's,

2368
01:38:11,520 --> 01:38:12,510
that's the fundamental,

2369
01:38:12,920 --> 01:38:14,370
that's the fundamental motivation.

2370
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:15,751
And so,

2371
01:38:15,751 --> 01:38:18,920
and then regards to happiness,

2372
01:38:20,840 --> 01:38:21,720
it's a,

2373
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:23,980
okay.

2374
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:28,490
Happiness is something that comes upon
you if you're fortunate and it comes with

2375
01:38:28,491 --> 01:38:31,090
some more likely to come upon you
with you're pursuing something that's

2376
01:38:31,091 --> 01:38:32,920
worthwhile and meaningful and awesome.

2377
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:34,023
Awesome.

2378
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:38,680
And the problem with assuming that the
emotional state is actually the goal is

2379
01:38:38,681 --> 01:38:42,160
that when you're in situations where that
emotional state can't possibly be the

2380
01:38:42,161 --> 01:38:42,994
goal,

2381
01:38:43,090 --> 01:38:46,360
and so that would be when you're dealing
with the tragic reality in some fights

2382
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,420
and your ethos is the
pursuit of happiness.

2383
01:38:49,421 --> 01:38:50,254
That erm,

2384
01:38:51,010 --> 01:38:51,430
you know,

2385
01:38:51,430 --> 01:38:53,280
let's set you up a sick
child for three years,

2386
01:38:53,290 --> 01:38:54,070
four here.

2387
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:59,070
More say good luck with your happiness
hypothesis because that's not going to

2388
01:39:00,491 --> 01:39:01,390
get you through it.

2389
01:39:03,770 --> 01:39:05,830
And I'm not saying that
you should be cyclical.

2390
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:06,880
Happiness was it.

2391
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:09,040
You should despise him
if it comes your way.

2392
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:10,660
But it's just not the problem.

2393
01:39:11,830 --> 01:39:13,270
It's not a noble pursuit.

2394
01:39:13,271 --> 01:39:14,320
And it will,

2395
01:39:14,810 --> 01:39:18,890
it will lead you burettes
situations of dire necessity.

2396
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:23,680
You need something much more
profound and yourself in the world.

2397
01:39:24,400 --> 01:39:28,870
And that's why I talked
more about suffering it
malevolence cause those things

2398
01:39:28,871 --> 01:39:33,390
are undeniable and the cause
and then do a bunch of trouble.

2399
01:39:33,950 --> 01:39:38,950
And at minimum you can orient yourself
in the world cause you take game against

2400
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:42,380
both of those and attempt
to get sprayed them.

2401
01:39:42,700 --> 01:39:45,730
That's something you can do even
in the most dire of circumstances.

2402
01:39:45,731 --> 01:39:47,940
And so if you're dealing with
someone who's in pain on it,

2403
01:39:48,310 --> 01:39:51,280
if you're dealing with someone who's
dying or you're dealing with the

2404
01:39:51,281 --> 01:39:52,780
catastrophes of your life,

2405
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:56,890
you still have a meaningful option of
trying to reduce the suffering to the,

2406
01:39:56,980 --> 01:39:58,300
to the maximum possible,

2407
01:39:58,310 --> 01:39:59,143
the great.

2408
01:39:59,780 --> 01:40:01,390
And that's a worthwhile endeavor.

2409
01:40:03,460 --> 01:40:08,460
And so it's a much more adult way
of orienting yourself in the world.

2410
01:40:08,890 --> 01:40:10,540
And if happiness happens to come your way,

2411
01:40:10,541 --> 01:40:12,790
well then good for you to win.

2412
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:13,740
It's not wonderful.

2413
01:40:13,840 --> 01:40:15,150
That's something to be thankful for,

2414
01:40:15,160 --> 01:40:17,410
but it's a side effect and not a person.

2415
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:21,460
Damian says doing what
you do must be stressful.

2416
01:40:22,870 --> 01:40:24,460
Shoghi one wine.

2417
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:30,030
Why shoe shopping?

2418
01:40:31,130 --> 01:40:33,060
Some people think I've already complete

2419
01:40:33,840 --> 01:40:38,840
[inaudible]

2420
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,553
okay,

2421
01:40:47,950 --> 01:40:48,670
well it's,

2422
01:40:48,670 --> 01:40:50,680
it's stressful I suppose in some ways.

2423
01:40:50,681 --> 01:40:51,320
I mean,

2424
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:52,060
um,

2425
01:40:52,060 --> 01:40:52,720
these,

2426
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:53,350
I don't,

2427
01:40:53,350 --> 01:40:53,950
these,

2428
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:57,550
these talks particularly stressful
because they're so positive.

2429
01:40:58,270 --> 01:40:58,990
You know,

2430
01:40:58,990 --> 01:41:03,990
I like to come up and talk about the
things that I've learned and to seal from

2431
01:41:04,970 --> 01:41:09,940
New People here and have a serious
discussion about things that would help

2432
01:41:09,941 --> 01:41:14,050
orient us in the world and to push
what I know farther it happened.

2433
01:41:14,230 --> 01:41:16,360
So that's,

2434
01:41:17,470 --> 01:41:20,830
it's so positive that I don't
really think about this.

2435
01:41:20,840 --> 01:41:25,080
Certainly this part of it as stressful
facing journalists to stressful,

2436
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:30,910
not always usually and often.

2437
01:41:31,390 --> 01:41:32,223
And so

2438
01:41:33,970 --> 01:41:35,530
I dunno how I'm the wine from that.

2439
01:41:35,531 --> 01:41:39,080
I usually go sleep afterwards I
guess is what I do that help me.

2440
01:41:39,081 --> 01:41:39,914
That was helpful.

2441
01:41:40,330 --> 01:41:41,163
Um,

2442
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:42,350
what I get for to

2443
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:49,210
increase my ability to tolerate
the activities that I'm engaged in.

2444
01:41:49,211 --> 01:41:49,660
This,

2445
01:41:49,660 --> 01:41:54,280
I travel with my wife and she's extremely
helpful cause she's very level headed.

2446
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,540
I have an extra brain along,

2447
01:41:55,541 --> 01:41:56,890
which is a useful thing.

2448
01:41:57,250 --> 01:41:58,210
And uh,

2449
01:41:58,390 --> 01:42:00,940
we swear sometimes with
work workout with them,

2450
01:42:01,240 --> 01:42:04,390
sometimes we go for a drive where we
can do that and we go for a walk and I

2451
01:42:04,391 --> 01:42:07,270
spend time with my family and um,

2452
01:42:07,570 --> 01:42:09,640
those are all good things.

2453
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:10,330
Um,

2454
01:42:10,330 --> 01:42:11,163
but I go,

2455
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,540
life is stressful.

2456
01:42:14,320 --> 01:42:14,741
So,

2457
01:42:14,741 --> 01:42:19,420
and at least I'm in a position
where whatever I'm doing,

2458
01:42:19,421 --> 01:42:23,890
it's stressful is counterbalanced by
exactly what that talks from all of you

2459
01:42:23,891 --> 01:42:26,860
tonight about it's deep what I'm doing,

2460
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,110
what I'm engaged in is deeply meaningful.

2461
01:42:30,730 --> 01:42:35,730
And so it's a pleasure to be able to
share that with other people and to see

2462
01:42:35,981 --> 01:42:38,020
that sense of meaningful engagement,

2463
01:42:38,260 --> 01:42:40,510
develop more people.

2464
01:42:41,470 --> 01:42:42,303
And

2465
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:45,910
I can't think of anything
better to do than that,

2466
01:42:45,940 --> 01:42:48,840
which is why I'm doing
what I'm doing tonight.

2467
01:42:48,860 --> 01:42:49,693
For example,

2468
01:42:49,900 --> 01:42:54,430
I can't think of anything better than
sitting here and talking to all of you

2469
01:42:54,431 --> 01:42:59,431
about these things that are necessary to
understand and to lay out in the world.

2470
01:43:00,280 --> 01:43:01,113
And so

2471
01:43:02,530 --> 01:43:04,810
what do I do to unwind?

2472
01:43:06,220 --> 01:43:10,030
I think I do what you shouldn't
do if you want to unwind.

2473
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:10,890
I,

2474
01:43:10,890 --> 01:43:13,120
I'm trying my best to make things better

2475
01:43:15,340 --> 01:43:18,310
because it seems to me that would
be better if they were better.

2476
01:43:19,210 --> 01:43:20,043
Simple.

2477
01:43:20,680 --> 01:43:25,420
And I have some sense of how bad things
can be because I've studied how bad

2478
01:43:25,421 --> 01:43:26,310
things can be.

2479
01:43:26,330 --> 01:43:29,140
And I experienced some of
it in my own personal life,

2480
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:33,850
some of them with my clients because
I've been in very dark places with my

2481
01:43:33,851 --> 01:43:38,851
clients and in my own life from time
to time and certainly in my studies.

2482
01:43:39,820 --> 01:43:42,070
And I would grab him that everything.

2483
01:43:42,071 --> 01:43:44,940
Did you go to hell in
a hand basket like it?

2484
01:43:45,500 --> 01:43:50,500
And I would like it if everyone got on
the board and we all decided to make

2485
01:43:51,351 --> 01:43:52,370
things better.

2486
01:43:52,430 --> 01:43:57,430
Each of us started with our own
lives and facilitating that is

2487
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:02,240
that afternoon to the catastrophe of life.

2488
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:06,800
And so that's a continual
unwinding in a sense.

2489
01:44:07,650 --> 01:44:08,140
So,

2490
01:44:08,140 --> 01:44:13,140
and it's a privilege to be able to
take part in m to also see this amazing

2491
01:44:14,001 --> 01:44:14,834
thing.

2492
01:44:15,350 --> 01:44:18,110
If I'd been developing
for a long time now,

2493
01:44:18,130 --> 01:44:18,920
you know,

2494
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,690
I started doing these lectures,

2495
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:24,740
public lectures were getting last
year I did a series on the Bible,

2496
01:44:25,100 --> 01:44:26,930
which I thought was
really quite comical that,

2497
01:44:26,931 --> 01:44:29,140
that word because um,

2498
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:33,080
well think about it is I decided
to do a series of lectures.

2499
01:44:33,081 --> 01:44:37,400
So I rented the theater and I decided
that I wanted to do lectures on,

2500
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:40,630
on gems inspections of
what responsibilities,

2501
01:44:40,631 --> 01:44:41,750
starting with genesis,

2502
01:44:42,290 --> 01:44:46,610
and then I would do that publicly and
then a whole bunch of people came.

2503
01:44:47,350 --> 01:44:47,690
No.

2504
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:48,760
So that was pretty weird.

2505
01:44:48,780 --> 01:44:51,930
A lot of them are young men for exactly
not the people who would ever tell them

2506
01:44:51,931 --> 01:44:52,764
to do that.

2507
01:44:53,310 --> 01:44:56,990
So they have lots of people
have about 2 million,

2508
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:59,540
two and a half a million people have
watched the first of those lectures.

2509
01:44:59,900 --> 01:45:02,150
It's on the first sentence of Genesis.

2510
01:45:02,420 --> 01:45:03,170
So to Mt.

2511
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:05,630
Two and a half million people have
watched the three hour lecture.

2512
01:45:05,750 --> 01:45:08,390
It's three hours long on one sentence

2513
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:12,200
from the first story in the Bible.

2514
01:45:12,201 --> 01:45:13,400
It's completely ridiculous.

2515
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:17,990
When my book launched,

2516
01:45:19,100 --> 01:45:21,270
the publicists in,

2517
01:45:21,410 --> 01:45:22,730
in London rented.

2518
01:45:22,731 --> 01:45:26,210
It's either so that I can talk
about it sold out right away.

2519
01:45:26,480 --> 01:45:30,110
So then they rented number one for the
next day and it's sold out right away.

2520
01:45:30,111 --> 01:45:32,660
And so they rented one the next
week and it's sold out too.

2521
01:45:32,990 --> 01:45:34,960
And then the same thing
happened in Amsterdam.

2522
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:36,860
And then I thought,

2523
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:38,390
well that's interesting.

2524
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:39,471
So dope,

2525
01:45:39,471 --> 01:45:40,600
15 theaters,

2526
01:45:40,910 --> 01:45:45,910
15 theatrical performances in
Toronto would then for Europe,

2527
01:45:46,461 --> 01:45:49,520
I can probably go whatever and in the
world and can here and we'll talk about

2528
01:45:49,521 --> 01:45:50,331
what I want to talk about,

2529
01:45:50,331 --> 01:45:51,470
how much people will come.

2530
01:45:51,980 --> 01:45:52,611
So I thought,

2531
01:45:52,611 --> 01:45:52,711
well,

2532
01:45:52,711 --> 01:45:57,711
I wash and dry that
that Caesar [inaudible],

2533
01:45:59,660 --> 01:46:02,690
my wife and I have been in,

2534
01:46:02,750 --> 01:46:07,040
I think this is the 58
city in four months and so,

2535
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:07,680
and the here,

2536
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:08,660
here you all are.

2537
01:46:08,661 --> 01:46:13,661
And we're having a very
serious conversation ourselves
properly in the world.

2538
01:46:14,310 --> 01:46:16,610
And so that's not stressful,

2539
01:46:16,611 --> 01:46:16,850
man.

2540
01:46:16,850 --> 01:46:18,170
That's great.

2541
01:46:19,100 --> 01:46:24,100
So it compared to there's so much worth
catastrophe in the world to be involved

2542
01:46:29,361 --> 01:46:34,220
in a continual conversation with
thousands of people about how each of our

2543
01:46:34,221 --> 01:46:38,960
individual lives might be better and
how that could spread into our families,

2544
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:41,060
into the broader community.

2545
01:46:41,150 --> 01:46:42,410
It's like that's not stressful.

2546
01:46:42,411 --> 01:46:44,030
That's the opposite of stressful.

2547
01:46:44,630 --> 01:46:45,710
It's great.

2548
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:46,521
It's wonderful.

2549
01:46:46,521 --> 01:46:47,450
It's so far as that.

2550
01:46:47,451 --> 01:46:48,830
I can't believe it you,

2551
01:46:49,710 --> 01:46:52,320
I was talking to my son the other day,

2552
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:53,281
this morning,

2553
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:58,281
I think it was this morning
[inaudible] paid with Tammy and I,

2554
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:09,020
we have a hell of a trip from big
order from Dublin to London Dublin.

2555
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:15,020
I talked to Sam Harris and govern the
summary and 8,500 people showed that port

2556
01:47:15,120 --> 01:47:16,350
and this big stadium.

2557
01:47:16,351 --> 01:47:18,540
It was like the biggest
philosophical discussion.

2558
01:47:18,840 --> 01:47:21,270
I think it was the biggest
public philosophical discussion.

2559
01:47:21,350 --> 01:47:22,570
Not Common.

2560
01:47:22,571 --> 01:47:27,571
It's not like [inaudible] was that will
be the biggest event and was like all

2561
01:47:31,081 --> 01:47:36,081
these people showed up cavernous Rena to
him to hear a very difficult discussion

2562
01:47:38,431 --> 01:47:41,910
about the relationship between facts
and values and religion and science.

2563
01:47:42,050 --> 01:47:43,690
They were like right into,

2564
01:47:43,870 --> 01:47:44,430
you know,

2565
01:47:44,430 --> 01:47:47,820
we were going to switch to Q and
a after an hour of discussion,

2566
01:47:47,880 --> 01:47:52,880
but the audience voted overwhelmingly
with my clapping too to continue the

2567
01:47:54,361 --> 01:47:55,051
conversation.

2568
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:56,550
So we talked for two and a half hours,

2569
01:47:56,551 --> 01:47:58,120
never cruise like right on the board.

2570
01:47:58,121 --> 01:48:01,890
And so it just turns out that people
are lot smarter than we thought.

2571
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:02,940
There's a huge,

2572
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:04,253
huge,

2573
01:48:04,470 --> 01:48:05,880
well I think TV,

2574
01:48:05,881 --> 01:48:09,960
the narrow bandwidth of TV maybe made
we were stupid and we're actually not.

2575
01:48:10,440 --> 01:48:13,940
And so there's this massive
public hungered for detail and,

2576
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:14,903
and,

2577
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:19,710
and reasonably deep
philosophical discussions like
well that's a helpful thing.

2578
01:48:20,190 --> 01:48:21,700
So that was just beyond belief.

2579
01:48:21,701 --> 01:48:26,701
[inaudible]

2580
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,100
we did that and I was crazy,

2581
01:48:32,101 --> 01:48:32,934
exciting,

2582
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:36,940
ridiculously adventurous and the talk
went really well and we'll take it

2583
01:48:37,080 --> 01:48:37,500
hopefully,

2584
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:37,981
like I said,

2585
01:48:37,981 --> 01:48:39,000
that we'll be able to in August.

2586
01:48:39,001 --> 01:48:43,080
And then people can see when there was a
discussion about the relative merits of

2587
01:48:43,320 --> 01:48:45,330
an atheist materialist viewpoint,

2588
01:48:46,090 --> 01:48:48,150
that's cultural or religious traditions,

2589
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:50,410
religious viewpoint.

2590
01:48:50,910 --> 01:48:55,200
And we had a good discussion
on both sides of that argument.

2591
01:48:55,201 --> 01:48:55,820
And then,

2592
01:48:55,820 --> 01:48:56,070
you know,

2593
01:48:56,070 --> 01:48:56,700
with any luck,

2594
01:48:56,700 --> 01:48:59,400
a couple of million people will watch
those videos and they can have a

2595
01:48:59,401 --> 01:49:01,950
discussion about it and maybe the
concern themselves up property.

2596
01:49:01,951 --> 01:49:05,580
And then we went to London
and did the same thing again.

2597
01:49:05,740 --> 01:49:07,940
And along with a variety of,

2598
01:49:08,340 --> 01:49:09,000
of,

2599
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,510
of other activities.

2600
01:49:11,010 --> 01:49:11,451
Like I said,

2601
01:49:11,451 --> 01:49:15,870
I was talking to my son about it this
morning and he's a pretty tough kid and

2602
01:49:15,900 --> 01:49:17,100
pretty level headed.

2603
01:49:17,310 --> 01:49:18,510
And when he was talking about it,

2604
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,460
it made him,

2605
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:21,270
he broke down at the of crime.

2606
01:49:21,450 --> 01:49:22,620
And you know,

2607
01:49:22,680 --> 01:49:26,010
and the reason for that is because it's
absolutely overwhelming to watch this

2608
01:49:26,011 --> 01:49:26,401
happen.

2609
01:49:26,401 --> 01:49:27,750
I can't believe.

2610
01:49:28,290 --> 01:49:29,400
So it's not stressful.

2611
01:49:29,401 --> 01:49:29,781
It's,

2612
01:49:29,781 --> 01:49:30,614
it's,

2613
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:33,470
it's a privilege to be doing next.

2614
01:49:33,471 --> 01:49:36,140
It's an ounce of bloody privileged
to be doing this and that.

2615
01:49:36,141 --> 01:49:41,141
So [inaudible]

2616
01:49:50,490 --> 01:49:55,490
how do you move forward advice after
having made every granted huge mistake.

2617
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:08,201
You know,

2618
01:50:08,201 --> 01:50:10,010
this is one of the reasons that I,

2619
01:50:10,170 --> 01:50:13,950
and I take the biblical elections I
did last year were so helpful to me.

2620
01:50:14,220 --> 01:50:15,380
And I think that the people,

2621
01:50:16,030 --> 01:50:18,910
one of the things that's quite
interesting about those stories,

2622
01:50:19,240 --> 01:50:22,810
Abrahamic stories in particular
is it was bloody people.

2623
01:50:23,250 --> 01:50:24,880
They just make mistakes all the time.

2624
01:50:26,790 --> 01:50:27,790
So Abraham,

2625
01:50:27,791 --> 01:50:28,780
for example,

2626
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:29,230
no,

2627
01:50:29,230 --> 01:50:30,380
he was chosen by God.

2628
01:50:31,530 --> 01:50:33,250
I pathetically like all the people

2629
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:35,590
were,

2630
01:50:35,590 --> 01:50:35,891
I mean,

2631
01:50:35,891 --> 01:50:39,360
he just takes one absolutely
catastrophic mistake after another.

2632
01:50:39,950 --> 01:50:44,950
And so that's life man making
in regretting huge mistakes.

2633
01:50:46,690 --> 01:50:49,480
Now that doesn't mean that you should
just go and propagating the mistakes,

2634
01:50:50,350 --> 01:50:52,790
so you have to take responsibility for it.

2635
01:50:52,810 --> 01:50:57,810
But the people that I've watched in my
life lived property that say they learned

2636
01:50:59,831 --> 01:51:00,581
from their mistakes,

2637
01:51:00,581 --> 01:51:04,180
but they didn't beat themselves
to death because of the,

2638
01:51:04,780 --> 01:51:04,991
you know,

2639
01:51:04,991 --> 01:51:05,471
when you think,

2640
01:51:05,471 --> 01:51:06,304
well,

2641
01:51:07,570 --> 01:51:08,281
so this is,

2642
01:51:08,281 --> 01:51:09,770
well this was a regretted it to Dell.

2643
01:51:09,771 --> 01:51:10,211
And it's like,

2644
01:51:10,211 --> 01:51:13,510
well we don't take adulthood is
out in the public square and stone.

2645
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:18,190
And so you probably shouldn't
do that to yourself.

2646
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:20,260
You know,

2647
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:21,200
if you regret it,

2648
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:21,761
well then what?

2649
01:51:21,761 --> 01:51:24,580
You have to do least you have
to repent and you have to atone.

2650
01:51:25,010 --> 01:51:25,843
Okay.

2651
01:51:26,010 --> 01:51:28,420
And so what is [inaudible]?

2652
01:51:28,470 --> 01:51:28,801
Well,

2653
01:51:28,801 --> 01:51:33,801
it means you have to go over what you
did and you have to figure out now that

2654
01:51:34,021 --> 01:51:35,020
you know it was a mistake,

2655
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:37,940
you have to figure out why you were
Sadam clueless since of damage,

2656
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:40,830
stupid and exactly what we did wrong.

2657
01:51:40,831 --> 01:51:42,450
Like with each decision point,

2658
01:51:42,510 --> 01:51:47,100
like you know when you first met the
person that you have the affair with,

2659
01:51:47,490 --> 01:51:51,590
you probably flirted with him
a little bit more than that.

2660
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:52,583
Then you,

2661
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:58,100
you probably flirted with him to a
degree that you regarded as Miskiw epic

2662
01:51:58,120 --> 01:51:58,953
access.

2663
01:51:59,850 --> 01:52:01,490
Did Eddie ones snow?

2664
01:52:01,491 --> 01:52:02,241
You have to figure out,

2665
01:52:02,241 --> 01:52:05,540
well why in the world did I
think that was a good idea?

2666
01:52:05,541 --> 01:52:07,340
Then you have to know he'd sack.

2667
01:52:07,370 --> 01:52:08,570
So if you're a,

2668
01:52:09,080 --> 01:52:14,080
if you're walking down a path and you'd
get lost in wonder us without that,

2669
01:52:14,151 --> 01:52:15,110
you get lost.

2670
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:18,530
You have to figure out how it is
that you wandered off the path.

2671
01:52:19,040 --> 01:52:22,960
Because the purpose of of
Rick head take let's say,

2672
01:52:23,010 --> 01:52:25,190
so that when you're back on the path,

2673
01:52:25,250 --> 01:52:25,701
first of all,

2674
01:52:25,701 --> 01:52:26,780
you can find your way back.

2675
01:52:26,781 --> 01:52:27,920
That would be the first purpose.

2676
01:52:27,950 --> 01:52:30,620
The second is so you
don't wonder off again.

2677
01:52:31,190 --> 01:52:33,250
And if you wondered
off once that your pro,

2678
01:52:33,270 --> 01:52:37,440
the wandering off in that matter in so
then you have to figure out why you who

2679
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:42,260
wandering off in that manner right down
into the most painful level of detail.

2680
01:52:42,410 --> 01:52:44,840
And then you have to figure
out how not to do it again.

2681
01:52:44,930 --> 01:52:48,320
And as soon as you figure
out how not to do it again,

2682
01:52:49,400 --> 01:52:51,800
then you should start beating yourself up.

2683
01:52:52,420 --> 01:52:52,820
You know,

2684
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:54,590
because you've learned your lesson.

2685
01:52:55,880 --> 01:52:57,340
That's sort of the principle.

2686
01:52:57,460 --> 01:53:02,180
I try it out once the
principles of discipline for
children in chapter five what

2687
01:53:02,181 --> 01:53:03,170
is the district's goals?

2688
01:53:03,171 --> 01:53:08,171
Is you still more forced than this
necessary minimum necessary for us,

2689
01:53:09,021 --> 01:53:09,854
it's a great,

2690
01:53:10,100 --> 01:53:10,933
it's a great,

2691
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,750
and you said on your cell
phone you make mistakes.

2692
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:15,561
You know what?

2693
01:53:15,561 --> 01:53:20,561
Maybe so you have to finger second
when you get wrong criteria.

2694
01:53:21,981 --> 01:53:22,870
When can you send him,

2695
01:53:22,871 --> 01:53:23,661
did something wrong.

2696
01:53:23,661 --> 01:53:26,310
You said you regretted it
okay and get something wrong.

2697
01:53:26,430 --> 01:53:30,330
Whereas you with regret or less pick your
just regretting the fact that part of

2698
01:53:30,500 --> 01:53:32,130
your life and you actually,

2699
01:53:32,131 --> 01:53:33,590
you know what nuts that's feeling,

2700
01:53:33,591 --> 01:53:34,610
sorry for yourself,

2701
01:53:34,640 --> 01:53:35,610
that's going to regret it.

2702
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:38,450
It's going to happen to sort those
things out because you don't get to feel

2703
01:53:38,451 --> 01:53:39,410
sorry for yourself.

2704
01:53:39,830 --> 01:53:41,380
You just to give to regret.

2705
01:53:41,810 --> 01:53:42,441
And if you read,

2706
01:53:42,441 --> 01:53:42,601
read,

2707
01:53:42,601 --> 01:53:46,280
read it into get something wrong and
then you got to figure out what you did

2708
01:53:46,281 --> 01:53:46,880
wrong.

2709
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:50,840
Exactly right down to the detailed
levels and what was wrong with your

2710
01:53:50,841 --> 01:53:53,360
perception and your beliefs
that led you in that direction.

2711
01:53:53,520 --> 01:53:57,750
Everyone would have to do to put
that right and then you have right.

2712
01:53:58,460 --> 01:53:59,820
And then maybe you have to call rob,

2713
01:53:59,850 --> 01:54:04,430
make it manage all the people that you
heard and then you have to be back.

2714
01:54:04,520 --> 01:54:07,000
And then perhaps you'll find
yourself back on the path.

2715
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:10,640
And then you have to stay on
the path as best as you can.

2716
01:54:11,830 --> 01:54:12,663
And,

2717
01:54:12,910 --> 01:54:17,910
and that's Kate in some sense because
if we all had to pay the ultimate price

2718
01:54:18,830 --> 01:54:19,570
for our sins,

2719
01:54:19,570 --> 01:54:21,740
if every single one of us would be

2720
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:30,840
just as part why the concept of original
sin still useful and everyone feels it

2721
01:54:30,921 --> 01:54:31,910
because everyone's guilty.

2722
01:54:32,540 --> 01:54:33,373
Never once ashamed.

2723
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:39,140
So we have this inbuilt sense
of something going wrong.

2724
01:54:39,230 --> 01:54:40,370
And if we can name it,

2725
01:54:40,470 --> 01:54:41,870
it just hot sense.

2726
01:54:41,960 --> 01:54:44,480
And that's why the idea of
original sin isn't so useful.

2727
01:54:44,481 --> 01:54:47,790
Even though it has perhaps some
conceptual problems associated with it.

2728
01:54:48,530 --> 01:54:49,400
Perhaps it's normal.

2729
01:54:50,710 --> 01:54:51,543
But

2730
01:54:52,790 --> 01:54:56,280
in this particular situation you don't,

2731
01:54:56,900 --> 01:54:59,330
you're a bad person.

2732
01:55:00,230 --> 01:55:01,670
But so is everyone else.

2733
01:55:02,220 --> 01:55:03,380
So it doesn't mark,

2734
01:55:03,381 --> 01:55:03,561
do you?

2735
01:55:03,561 --> 01:55:05,390
Well as particular horrible.

2736
01:55:06,310 --> 01:55:07,220
That doesn't mean the horrible.

2737
01:55:07,230 --> 01:55:08,120
This isn't real.

2738
01:55:08,830 --> 01:55:10,010
But it's not just you.

2739
01:55:11,570 --> 01:55:12,850
And then what you do about it.

2740
01:55:12,851 --> 01:55:13,040
This,

2741
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,120
you're trying to be better.

2742
01:55:14,660 --> 01:55:17,630
And that's what we do about what's
wrong with you to begin with.

2743
01:55:17,930 --> 01:55:18,670
Every,

2744
01:55:18,670 --> 01:55:19,700
every one of us,

2745
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:22,160
we've all got things to learn,

2746
01:55:22,161 --> 01:55:22,481
man.

2747
01:55:22,481 --> 01:55:23,300
And plenty of them.

2748
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:24,450
The world is what it couldn't be.

2749
01:55:24,710 --> 01:55:25,730
That's our fault.

2750
01:55:26,480 --> 01:55:27,800
And so we've got lots to learn it.

2751
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:28,281
So to you,

2752
01:55:28,281 --> 01:55:29,450
and you try and learn it.

2753
01:55:30,440 --> 01:55:35,440
You treat yourself with firm enough that
you learned and not harsh enough having

2754
01:55:36,680 --> 01:55:38,450
something you've died on your burn

2755
01:55:42,000 --> 01:55:47,000
[inaudible]

2756
01:55:52,860 --> 01:55:57,860
[inaudible].
