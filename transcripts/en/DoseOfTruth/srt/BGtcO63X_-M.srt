I read this interesting commentary a
little while ago on a statement by Christ

2
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:06,000
in the New Testament,

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:10,110
and the statement generally interpreted
is that the meek shall inherit the

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:10,411
earth,

5
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:13,890
but I was looking up the multiple
translations of the word Meek,

6
00:00:13,891 --> 00:00:17,340
and meek is actually
derived from a Greek word,

7
00:00:17,341 --> 00:00:18,174
of course,

8
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,800
because the Bible,

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:22,740
at least some of the original
forms of the Bible were in Greek.

10
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,113
Um,

11
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,420
and that word didn't exactly mean meek.

12
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,470
It meant something like

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,170
those who have weapons and
the ability to use them,

14
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:37,004
but cert,

15
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,430
but determined to keep the
machines will inherit the world.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And that means that people
who are capable of force,

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,113
let's say,

18
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,560
but decided not to use it,

19
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:51,230
are in the proper moral position.
