1
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:12,190
I began to understand that the goal of
psychic development by which he means

2
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:14,200
psychological development
or spiritual development

3
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:17,480
is the self.

4
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,860
There is no linear evolution.

5
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:22,740
There's only a circumambulation
of itself a getting closer.

6
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:23,220
It's like,

7
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,230
it's like you're spiraling into something,

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,060
something like that and the thing that
you're spiraling into recedes as you move

9
00:00:30,061 --> 00:00:31,800
towards it and it gets more and more

10
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,030
sophisticated and well developed as you
move towards it because you're not going

11
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:38,080
to run out of goals,

12
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:38,321
right?

13
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:40,420
No matter how much you
have your act together,

14
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:45,930
there's probably undoubtedly 30 dimensions
along which you could get your act

15
00:00:46,181 --> 00:00:48,030
together a lot more so.

16
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:52,480
And some of those aren't even conceivable
to you when you're in your initial on

17
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,830
carved state,

18
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,730
let's say uniform development
exists at most at the beginning.

19
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:58,360
Later,

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,980
everything points towards the center.

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,030
This insight gave me stability and
gradually my inner peace returned.

22
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,530
So this is fun.

23
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,151
On the left there,

24
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:12,530
that's the sharp cathedral.

25
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:15,380
That's the one that has the maze
in it that I told you about.

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,860
They actually light that up with lasers
now and so that's it lit up with lasers.

27
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,913
And so,

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:22,520
so it,

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:22,700
it,

30
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,770
they're turning it into
a cathedral of light,

31
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,810
which I think is really fascinating.

32
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:27,290
And it's a,

33
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:29,480
it's a continuation of the same idea,

34
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:29,721
right?

35
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:33,590
Because the stain glass windows where
obviously I wouldn't call them primitive

36
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:34,460
attempts to do that.

37
00:01:34,461 --> 00:01:34,701
I mean,

38
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,650
stained glass windows
are pretty impressive.

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,281
You know,

40
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:37,730
buddy,

41
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,800
it's an elaboration of the same thing.

42
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:41,420
So now you can go to that Cathedral.

43
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:42,950
They light up the whole town like that,

44
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,540
which is really something.

45
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,141
And so there,

46
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:46,820
and there is how the cathedral is built.

47
00:01:46,821 --> 00:01:47,654
It's across.

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,890
Um,

49
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:52,430
and do you remember the cross is an ax
that marks the center of the world and

50
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:54,710
the cross is the place
where each individual is.

51
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,680
And I think that's the fundamental
message of Christianity is the Crossmark's

52
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,640
the place where every
single individual is.

53
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:06,910
And it's a tragic place that consists of
suffering and exposure to malevolence.

54
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,030
And that the only way to come to
terms with it is to accept it.

55
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,160
And that seems to me,

56
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,280
I don't see anything metaphysical
about that statement whatsoever.

57
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,143
It's like,

58
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,600
well,

59
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,980
x marks the spot.

60
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:19,790
Fair enough.

61
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:20,930
You're in a spot.

62
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,700
You're right in the center of your world.

63
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:25,190
It's written the center of the
world as far as you're concerned.

64
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,480
And the same with the rest of us.

65
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,080
It's characterized by suffering
and exposure to malevolence.

66
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:31,310
There's no doubt about that.

67
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,870
What are you going to do about that?

68
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:33,943
Bitter,

69
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:34,820
resentful,

70
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,683
hateful.

71
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:37,250
All that does is make it worse.

72
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:39,270
So you have to accept it.

73
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,730
Now that's not an easy thing
because that's actually,

74
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:42,151
I would say,

75
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:46,170
a heroic task to voluntarily accept
the conditions of your own existence.

76
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,420
And that happens at the cross.

77
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,433
So that's fine.

78
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,270
And that's associated with light.

79
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,820
Well that's good that that's
associated with light.

80
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:56,010
You wouldn't want that to
be associated with darkness.

81
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:57,270
That would be a bad thing.

82
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,613
So,

83
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,300
and so there's the,

84
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,741
there's the,

85
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:06,574
uh,

86
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,940
the labyrinth that was built in 1,280.

87
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,080
And so the idea is you walk in here,

88
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:19,710
it's the same idea as that star sequence
of slides that I just showed you.

89
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,690
So here's the idea,

90
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:22,090
is that north,

91
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:22,924
south,

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,591
west,

93
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:24,424
and east.

94
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:27,580
So that's the whole world
laid out in two dimensions.

95
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,370
And so the question is how
do you get to the center?

96
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:31,690
Now we already know what the center is.

97
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,460
The center is the center of the cross.

98
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,620
That's the place of maximal suffering.

99
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:38,500
You could say maximal malevolence as well,

100
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,750
but it's also the place
where that's transcended.

101
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,280
So how do you get there?

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,660
While the answer is,

103
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:43,841
well,

104
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:47,650
you don't just stand on
the outside looking in,

105
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,270
that's not going to help.

106
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:50,051
So,

107
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:54,160
and you can't just run right to the
center even if you're in California.

108
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,653
And so

109
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,850
you have to walk in here and then you
see you go like this and you go to every

110
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:05,980
single place,

111
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,290
every single place on that,

112
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,510
on that little cosmos.

113
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,470
And then once you've gone to every
single place and expanded yourself as a

114
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:17,620
consequence of going north
and west and east and south,

115
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,110
then there's enough of
you so that you're at,

116
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:23,290
so that you can tolerate being first of
all that you could figure out where the

117
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:23,801
center is,

118
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:26,350
but also that you can
tolerate being at the center.

119
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,840
And so that's what that represents.

120
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,013
And that's pretty.

121
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:30,611
And look,

122
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,150
I mean,

123
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:32,620
let's make no mistake about it.

124
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:33,310
Hey,

125
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,680
people were pretty damn
serious about those ideas.

126
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,813
Like that's uh,

127
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,840
that's quite the piece of work for people
in the 12th century in all of those,

128
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,750
some of those damn cathedrals
took 300 years to build.

129
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:46,180
We don't build anything
that takes 300 years.

130
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:46,911
You know,

131
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,590
and people were putting a lot of effort
into whatever these things meant,

132
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:51,821
you know,

133
00:04:51,821 --> 00:04:54,340
and if you think they meant
bearded man in the sky,

134
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,174
then you know,

135
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,280
it's hard to,

136
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:02,320
it's hard to account for the kind of
motivation that would produce these

137
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,700
buildings with that kind of
paucity of conceptualization.

138
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,241
You know,

139
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:08,080
the towns,

140
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,410
and it was certainly the case in charters
that they groaned under the tax burden

141
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,700
that was required to produce these.

142
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:16,481
Now you might think,

143
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:20,020
well that's partly tyrannical
and no doubt that's the case,

144
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:20,710
but,

145
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,980
but that's not the whole story.

146
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:26,890
The whole story is that the people
who produce those buildings,

147
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:32,010
they thought about every bit of it is
nothing's accidental and they're trying to

148
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:35,950
portray something just like that
window is trying to portray something.

149
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:37,480
That's the same thing as this.

150
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,770
It's the center from which all
things manifest themselves.

151
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,550
You see it,

152
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,383
that's Christ.

153
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,880
They're being portrayed as,

154
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:48,190
as that center or the center within him,

155
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:48,851
something like that.

156
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:50,110
Very much like the shocker is,

157
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,010
and in,

158
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,853
in a,

159
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,890
in a yoga practice,

160
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,630
same basic idea.

161
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,480
It's the opening up of the
internal structure and,

162
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,310
and its proper realization.

163
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,073
So

164
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,250
there are people walking the

165
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,190
labyrinth.

166
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,970
So that's the coat of many colors,

167
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:14,211
right?

168
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:14,530
That's,

169
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:19,530
that's this differentiated motive being
that enables you to be competent at,

170
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:23,990
at home in the widest
possible number of places.

171
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,350
And that that's a real
differentiation of your personality.

172
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:30,830
It's breaking through the
boundaries of your personality,

173
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:34,550
including the ones that you
impose on yourself to become

174
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,510
someone who is useful
wherever they're put.
