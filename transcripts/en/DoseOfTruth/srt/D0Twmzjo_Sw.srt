1
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:10,120
And the sons of Noah that went forth of
the Ark were Shem and ham and Japheth.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,980
And Ham is the father of Canaan.

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:17,780
These are the three sons of Noah
and of them was the whole earth.

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,020
Overspread and Noah began
to be a HUD husbands men.

5
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,940
And he planted a vineyard and he
drank of the wine and was drunk.

6
00:00:25,941 --> 00:00:26,090
And,

7
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:29,240
and he was uncovered
within his tent and Ham.

8
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,890
The father of Canaan saw the nakedness
of his father and told his two brethren

9
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,023
without,

10
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:36,441
and Shem,

11
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:40,070
and Japheth took a garment and laid upon
both their shoulders and went backward

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,990
and covered the nakedness of their father.

13
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:43,220
And their faces were backward,

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:45,860
and they saw not their father's nakedness.

15
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,910
And Noah awoke from his wine and knew
what his younger son had done unto him.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:51,283
And he said,

17
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,670
curse had to be Canaan,

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,000
a servant of servants shall
he be unto his brethren.

19
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,451
And he said,

20
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:00,870
blessed shall be the Lord God of Shaman.

21
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,170
Canaan shall be his servant,

22
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,360
and God shall enlarge Japheth.

23
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,280
And he shall dwell in the tents of Shem.

24
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:07,720
And Canaan shall be his servant.

25
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:10,210
And Noah lived after the flood,

26
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:14,560
350 years and all the days of
Noah were 950 years and he died

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,950
and the whole earth was of one
language and of one speech.

28
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,431
Okay.

29
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:20,264
So

30
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,500
I remember thinking about this story,

31
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,800
it's gotta be 30 years ago

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,270
and I think the meaning of
the story stood out for me.

33
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:38,080
Sometimes when you read
complicated materials,

34
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:39,850
sometimes a piece of it will stand out.

35
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:42,550
It's for some reason
it's like it glitters.

36
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,530
I suppose that might be one
way of thinking about it.

37
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,690
It's it,

38
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,300
you're in sync with it and you
can understand what it means.

39
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:51,580
I've really experienced that
reading the Tao Te Ching,

40
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:56,080
which is document I would really like
to do a lecture on at some point because

41
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,490
some of the verses I don't understand,

42
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:59,650
but others stand right out
and I can understand them.

43
00:01:59,651 --> 00:02:02,440
And I think I understood what this
part of the story of Noah meant.

44
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:03,940
And I think it means,

45
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:04,290
you know,

46
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,230
we talked a little bit about
what nakedness meant in
the story of Adam and eve.

47
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,560
And the idea essentially was that to
know yourself naked is to become aware of

48
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:15,370
your vulnerability,

49
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,810
the physical,

50
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,800
your physical boundaries
in time and space and your,

51
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,813
your,

52
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,070
your physiological,

53
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,960
your fundamental physiological
insufficiencies as they
meet might be judged by

54
00:02:28,961 --> 00:02:29,320
others.

55
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,860
So there's biological insufficiency that
sort of built into you because you're a

56
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,880
fragile mortal,

57
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:36,160
vulnerable half insane creature.

58
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:36,771
And that's,

59
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:38,800
that's just an existential truth.

60
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:39,634
And then of course,

61
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,090
even merely as a human being,

62
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:44,230
even with all those faults,

63
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:48,520
there are faults that you have that are
particular to you that might be judged

64
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:50,200
harshly by the group while might be,

65
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:52,900
we'll definitely be judged
harshly by the group.

66
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,280
And so to become aware of your nakedness
is to become self conscious and to,

67
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:57,730
and to,

68
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:59,680
to know your limits and
to know vulnerability.

69
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:04,681
And that's what is revealed to him
when he comes across as farther naked.

70
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:11,230
It's so the question is what does
it mean to see your father naked?

71
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,030
And it seems to me,

72
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:15,280
and especially in an
inappropriate manner like this,

73
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,480
it,

74
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,110
it,

75
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:16,943
it,

76
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:17,470
it's,

77
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:17,950
it's,

78
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,290
it's as if ham,

79
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,780
he does the same thing that happens
in the Mesopotamian creation myth.

80
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:31,360
When when tie him out an absolute
give rise to the first God's there,

81
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:36,190
they're the father of the
eventual day of redemption.

82
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:41,490
Marduk they're very careless and noisy
and the kill appsu their father and

83
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:43,690
attempt to inhabit his corpse.

84
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,780
And that makes timeout enraged.

85
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,970
And so she bursts forth
from the darkness to,

86
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,111
to do the men.

87
00:03:50,111 --> 00:03:54,070
It's like a precursor to the flood
story or an analog to the flood story.

88
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:57,970
And I see the same thing happening
here with him is that he's,

89
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,970
he's insufficiently
respectful of his father.

90
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:04,360
And the question is exactly
what does the farther represent.

91
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:04,841
And you could say,

92
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,021
well,

93
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,590
there's,

94
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,423
there's,

95
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:09,670
there's the father that you
have and that's a human being.

96
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:09,931
That's,

97
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:11,140
that's a man like other men,

98
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,340
a man among men.

99
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,230
But then there's the farther as such.

100
00:04:14,231 --> 00:04:15,820
And that's the spirit of the father.

101
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:18,250
And insofar as you have a father,

102
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,840
you have both at the same time.

103
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,840
You have the personal father that's a
man among other men just like anyone else

104
00:04:25,521 --> 00:04:25,991
who's father.

105
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,900
But insofar as that man is your father,

106
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:31,600
that means that he's something
different than just another person.

107
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,910
And what he is is the incarnation
of the spirit of the father.

108
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,310
And to see that,

109
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,780
to take it to what,

110
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,360
to disrespect that carelessly,

111
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,680
maybe even he like,

112
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,041
no,

113
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,821
it makes a mistake,

114
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:46,070
right?

115
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:46,903
He

116
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,840
produces wine and gets himself drunk.

117
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:50,561
And you might say,

118
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:50,980
well,

119
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:51,251
you know,

120
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,830
if he's sprawled out
there for everyone to see,

121
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,990
it's hardly hams fault if
he stumbles across him.

122
00:04:55,991 --> 00:05:00,991
But the book is laying out a
danger and the danger is that,

123
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,430
well maybe you catch your father at his
most vulnerable moment and if you're

124
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,670
disrespectful then you transgress
against the spirit of the father.

125
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:15,520
And if you transgress against the spirit
of farther and Louis Spirit of the

126
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:18,100
father and lose respect for
the spirit of the father,

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,450
then that is likely to
transform you into a slave.

128
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:26,620
That's a very interesting idea and I
think it's particularly interesting.

129
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,480
Maybe not particularly interesting,

130
00:05:28,481 --> 00:05:29,500
but it's,

131
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,240
it's particularly Germane,

132
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:31,631
I think,

133
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:36,631
to our current cultural situation because
I think that we're pushed constantly

134
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,950
to see the nakedness of our father,

135
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:39,784
so to speak,

136
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,020
because of the intense criticism that's
directed towards our culture and the

137
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,640
patriarchal culture,

138
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:49,474
so to speak.

139
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,710
We're constantly exposing its weaknesses
and vulnerabilities and let's say

140
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,544
nakedness,

141
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,683
and

142
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,080
there's wrong with criticism,

143
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,070
but the thing about criticism is the
purpose of criticism is to separate the

144
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:03,090
wheat from the chaff.

145
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,430
It's not the burn
everything to the ground,

146
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,181
right?

147
00:06:06,181 --> 00:06:06,691
It's to say,

148
00:06:06,691 --> 00:06:07,524
well,

149
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
we're going to carefully look at this.

150
00:06:09,361 --> 00:06:10,740
We're going to carefully differentiate.

151
00:06:10,741 --> 00:06:13,560
We're going to keep what's good and
we're going to move away from what's bad,

152
00:06:13,561 --> 00:06:17,400
but the point of the criticism
isn't to identify everything is bad.

153
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:18,930
It's two separate.

154
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:23,100
What's good from what's bad so that you
can retain what's good and move towards

155
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:23,934
it,

156
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:29,260
and to be careless at that is is deadly
because you're inhabited by the spirit

157
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:30,240
of the father,

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:30,451
right?

159
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:32,790
In so far as you're a
cultural construction,

160
00:06:32,791 --> 00:06:34,170
which of course is something that the,

161
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,790
that the postmodern,

162
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,940
Neo Marxists are absolutely
enthusiastic about.

163
00:06:38,941 --> 00:06:42,450
You're a cultural construction in so
far as you're a cultural construction,

164
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,700
then your inhabited by
the spirit of the father.

165
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,700
And to be disrespectful towards that
means to undermine the very structure that

166
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,500
makes you not all of what you are.

167
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:54,630
Certainly certainly not
all of what you are,

168
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:56,820
but a good portion of what you are in,

169
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:59,670
in so far as you're a
socialized cultural entity.

170
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,740
And if you pull out the,

171
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,040
if you pull the foundation
out from underneath that,

172
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,090
what do you have left it,

173
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,760
you can hardly manage on your own.

174
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:09,840
You know,

175
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,100
it's just not possible.

176
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,380
You're a cultural creation.

177
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,280
And so Hamm makes this desperate error
and is careless about exposing himself to

178
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,840
the vulnerability of his
father or something like that.

179
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:26,610
He does it without sufficient respect.

180
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,690
And the judgment is that
not only will he be asleep,

181
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,340
but so all of his descendants and he's
contracted with the other two sons who

182
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,810
I suppose are willing to give their
father the benefit of the doubt,

183
00:07:39,811 --> 00:07:40,740
something like that.

184
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,620
And so when they see him
in a compromising position,

185
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,470
they handle it with respect and,

186
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,603
and,

187
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,800
and don't capitalize on it.

188
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:50,810
And,

189
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,500
and maybe that makes them strong.

190
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,210
That's what it seems to me.

191
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,910
And so I think that's
what that story means.

192
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,560
It has something to do with respect.

193
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,091
You know?

194
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:06,090
And the funny thing about
having respect for your culture,

195
00:08:06,091 --> 00:08:08,430
and I suppose that's partly why
I'm doing the biblical stories,

196
00:08:08,431 --> 00:08:10,150
is because they're part of,

197
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,610
they're part of my culture.

198
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,310
They're part of our culture perhaps.

199
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:19,110
But there they're certainly part of
my culture and it seems to me that

200
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,620
it's worthwhile to treat that with
respect to see what you can glean from it

201
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,353
and,

202
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,370
and not kick it when it's down,

203
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:29,204
let's say.

204
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,183
So.

205
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:40,010
And so that's how the story of no ends,

206
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,311
you know?

207
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:45,311
And the thing too is Noah is actually a
pretty decent incarnation of the spirit

208
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:47,511
of the father.

209
00:08:47,511 --> 00:08:47,930
That,

210
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:52,930
which I suppose is one of the things
that makes Hams misstep more egregious is

211
00:08:54,261 --> 00:08:54,920
that,

212
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,171
I mean,

213
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:57,690
Noah just built an ark and got
everybody through the flood.

214
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,081
Man,

215
00:08:58,081 --> 00:08:58,650
you know,

216
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,710
it's not so bad in.

217
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:04,440
So maybe the fact that he happened to
drink too much wine one day wasn't enough

218
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,480
to justify humiliating him.

219
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,483
And you know,

220
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:13,350
I don't think it's pushing the limits
of symbolic interpretation to note on a

221
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,900
daily basis that were
all contained in an arc.

222
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:16,951
Right?

223
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:20,340
And that's the arc that you could
think about that as the arc that's been

224
00:09:20,341 --> 00:09:22,320
bequeathed to us by our forefathers.

225
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:26,130
That's the tremendous
infrastructure that we inhabit,

226
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,500
that we take for granted because it works
so well that protects us from things

227
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:33,210
that we can't even imagine.

228
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:35,790
And we don't have to imagine
because we're so well protected.

229
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:39,270
And so one of the things
that's really struck me hard,

230
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:44,400
I would say about the disintegration and
corruption of the universities is the

231
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,690
absolute in gratitude
that goes along with that.

232
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,231
Criticism,

233
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:49,741
as I said,

234
00:09:49,741 --> 00:09:50,700
is for fine thing,

235
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,330
if it's done in the
spirit in a proper spirit,

236
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,060
and that's the spirit of separating
the wheat from the chaff.

237
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,400
But it needs to be
accompanied by gratitude.

238
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,960
And it does seem to me that
anyone who lives in the west,

239
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:06,840
in the western culture at this time,

240
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
in history and in this place and who
isn't simultaneously grateful for that is,

241
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:15,200
is,

242
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,830
is half blind at least because
it's never been better than this.

243
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,750
And it could be so much worse and it's
highly likely that it will be so much

244
00:10:24,751 --> 00:10:26,970
worse because for most of human history,

245
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,430
so much worse is the norm.
