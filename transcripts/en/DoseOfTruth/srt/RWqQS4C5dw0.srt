1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:07,343
Yes.

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:12,590
Society as a whole.

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,520
Then you're looking at it
from the wrong perspective.

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,450
Your,

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:16,830
your,

6
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,520
your level of analysis is wrong.

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:22,480
So you know it is society as a whole,

8
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,490
but what the hell good
is that going to do you,

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,470
you can't complain to society as a whole.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,710
You have to look for the
micro manifestations that
actually occur in your realm

11
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:34,800
and work on those.

12
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,650
Yeah and that's the only level of analysis
you have any control over anyways.

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,540
Fix the things that are within your
realm of power and what will happen as a

14
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:46,330
consequence of that is that
your realm of power will grow,

15
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,090
but you start local because
like what the hell do you know?

16
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,010
You're 19 or 20 or whatever it is.

17
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:51,840
Like you have,

18
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,470
you have a scrap with society.

19
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,570
It's like that's just an
architectural problem.

20
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,010
That's all it is.

21
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,830
Because you don't know enough
about society to have that opinion.

22
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:00,941
You know?

23
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:01,721
And I'm not being,

24
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:05,680
I'm not being a like I'm not
trying to be cynical about this.

25
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:07,690
I am telling you it's an
architectural problem,

26
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,261
you know?

27
00:01:08,261 --> 00:01:08,681
Of course,

28
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:10,720
everybody who is young has
a problem with society.

29
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:14,170
You're all at the bottom of the bloody
dominance hierarchy unless you count the

30
00:01:14,171 --> 00:01:15,730
entire rest of the world,

31
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,090
in which case you're
already in the top 1%.

32
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:20,141
Right?

33
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:20,681
So you know,

34
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,000
that's where thinking about too.

35
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:22,601
So,

36
00:01:22,601 --> 00:01:23,770
and you know,

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,251
if you,

38
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:27,310
if you are in involved in a battle,

39
00:01:27,311 --> 00:01:28,720
in some sense with society,

40
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:29,590
you,

41
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,990
you're dominated by the
figure of the great father,

42
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,910
the negative figure of the great father.

43
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,040
You also have to a lot of
what you should do about that.

44
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:38,680
It's increased your level of gratitude.

45
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,000
You know,

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,840
here you are,

47
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,973
it's warm,

48
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:43,240
the chair works.

49
00:01:43,241 --> 00:01:44,650
The floor isn't going to fall apart,

50
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,221
right?

51
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:46,840
You're at a prestigious institution,

52
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:51,100
you're well on your way to being
one of the top 1% in society.

53
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:53,320
You're just too damn young
right now for that to happen.

54
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,333
You're smart,

55
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,413
you're healthy,

56
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,500
you're good looking,

57
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,720
except for that weird thing
you're wearing around your head.

58
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,871
So like,

59
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,430
you know what the hell,

60
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,091
it's,

61
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:05,260
everything's good for you.

62
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:06,530
So I'm,

63
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:06,911
I mean,

64
00:02:06,911 --> 00:02:09,610
I know there's a tyrannical
element there is,

65
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:10,444
it's real.

66
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,153
But,

67
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,320
but if that's all you see,

68
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,011
you're,

69
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,930
you're blinded and that's not good.

70
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,710
It'll warp you.
