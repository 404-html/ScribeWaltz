1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Right,

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,230
so there was a new article,
I think it was published in nature,

3
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:13,140
I'll try to find the link for it.
It's about a year old that,

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,210
that was based on high resolution
imaging of new connections.

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,210
It's actually reviewed and Kurt Sal's
Kurzweil's book.

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,340
How to build a mind.
I think that's the name of it.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,070
Um,
and so it turns out that the Cortex is

8
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:30,900
made out of these columnar structures
that are pre-organized units of neurons

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,290
and they're replicated across the entire
cortex.

10
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,100
Basically the same structure.
And like the,

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,830
the,
the older,

12
00:00:37,831 --> 00:00:41,700
let's say connectionist idea was that
neurons that fire together wire

13
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:42,421
together,
right?

14
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:43,320
That,
that's happened.

15
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,330
Of course that's pretty standard
neurology,

16
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:48,060
but the,
the columns are already pre wired,

17
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,160
so it's actually columns that fire
together,

18
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,360
wire together,
but there's.

19
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,760
But there's even more with the high
resolution scanning.

20
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,420
So it turns out that underneath the
columnar structure,

21
00:00:57,421 --> 00:01:01,020
there are these prebuilt highways that
are connected,

22
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,110
connective tissue that are pre,
pre prepared.

23
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,620
So the columns have the option to
connect to the,

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,560
to the underlying highway,
and that highway can connect other

25
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:14,070
columns.
So it's as if implicit in the brain

26
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:16,050
organization,
and this is at the cortical level,

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,080
say nothing of subcortical organization,
there's already preexistent uh,

28
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,030
uh,
likelihoods that certain neurons will

29
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:25,890
fire wire together.
Yeah.

30
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:26,441
So,
and,

31
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:31,441
and what else is cool is that this is
actually architecturally quite a

32
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:33,950
regular.
So they found that the,

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,610
these superhighways arranged in lines
and,

34
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,563
and,
and,

35
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:40,380
and in,
at right angles to one another.

36
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:44,100
So it's almost like a three dimensional
structure of why your cubes that

37
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:47,550
underlies the neuronal structure.
So that's some neurological evidence for

38
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:48,570
the archetypal idea.
