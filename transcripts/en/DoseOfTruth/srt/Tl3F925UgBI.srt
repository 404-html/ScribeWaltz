1
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:09,560
And of course we're absolutely keenly
aware of that in the modern world because

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,600
we're possessed by this sense
that all of our frenetic activity,

3
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:19,430
all of our frenetic motivated activity
is producing alterations in the world

4
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:24,431
order such that nature itself is going
to be destroyed and eliminate us,

5
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:26,990
right?

6
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,970
That's classic Sumerian fear and
nothing's changed in the last 5,000 years.

7
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:36,620
The Sumerians presumed that once the
elder gods were constructed and started

8
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:38,150
moving around on the planet,

9
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:39,590
that their activity,

10
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:41,990
they're mindless activity.

11
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:42,651
Because remember,

12
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:44,990
these aren't well integrated
motivational forces.

13
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:48,380
They're more like primordial
beasts right there.

14
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:53,470
Unintegrated activity risks
plunging everything back and chaos.

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,780
Well tie match the
representative of chaos,

16
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:57,860
this generative chaos.

17
00:00:57,861 --> 00:00:59,360
But so what the Sumerian say?

18
00:00:59,361 --> 00:00:59,810
Well,

19
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,880
the elder gods because a lot of racket,

20
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:06,970
they move around the planet and they
upset time at and she decides that enough

21
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,390
is enough and she's
going to wipe them out.

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,480
So she's sitting at the
bottom of the ocean,

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:20,800
fuming away as the elder gods go about
their business and then they take one

24
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:25,670
step too many and they kill Appsu.

25
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,840
Who's her husband?

26
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,531
Now,

27
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:30,050
the Sumerian creation myth
doesn't say much about this,

28
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:34,760
but we know that Appsu is the male con
sort of chaos that makes it mortar.

29
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:39,350
So what happens is the elder
gods destroy order itself.

30
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:40,730
They destroy culture itself.

31
00:01:40,731 --> 00:01:42,050
And as soon as you destroy culture,

32
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:42,890
all hell breaks loose.

33
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:45,180
And that's exactly what happens
in this scenario creation myth.

34
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:46,610
So Tye,

35
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:46,941
Maddie,

36
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:47,774
Mergis,

37
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:52,100
she's going to wipe everything out
and the world will revert back to its

38
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:54,500
primordial non-existence state.

39
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,780
Now the older guards get wind of this,

40
00:01:56,781 --> 00:01:59,930
and of course they're just
terrified because they know
that this thing that gave

41
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:00,920
rise to them,

42
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,761
whatever it is,

43
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:05,240
the matrix of being can easily
wipe them out at a moment's notice.

44
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,950
And so despite the fact
that they're trans,

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,641
transpersonal,

46
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:08,210
and immortal,

47
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:12,440
and characterized by a certain amount
of power in the face of absolute chaos,

48
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,700
they're insufficient.
