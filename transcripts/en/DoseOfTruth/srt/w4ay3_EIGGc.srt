1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:02,233
Yeah,

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,390
we're looking for answers
and I can pick that

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:13,040
collection of dark web.

4
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:13,883
I think that,

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,690
I mean,

6
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,690
you get that when you listen to broken
[inaudible] broken a lot for me.

7
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,270
That's the first thing he said.

8
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,113
Touch God.

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,360
You can trust them.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:30,810
He's,

11
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,780
he's not self rammed down and head.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,370
He's not narcissistic of,

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:37,470
even though he spectacularly successful,

14
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:39,120
he keeps his feet on the ground.

15
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,860
He doesn't inflate himself,

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:43,350
he doesn't make claims
about his whole life.

17
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,413
Um,

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,970
the extent of his knowledge,

19
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:51,120
he's very aware of when it doesn't know
that there's a real confidence in that.

20
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:51,570
Right.

21
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,670
Joe knows there's a whole bunch
of things he doesn't know.

22
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,180
He keeps inviting people onto the show
and those things he doesn't know and he

23
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:00,670
doesn't care that he doesn't know that
he's happy to talk to people who know

24
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:02,130
some things he doesn't know.

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,060
And that's real ways to brightness,

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,080
to be confident and [inaudible].

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,650
So there's this,

28
00:01:13,651 --> 00:01:18,651
there's this quest and Samsung
request and he's also courageous.

29
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:19,741
You know,

30
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:22,350
like he takes on heart issues
and he doesn't back down.

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:26,100
And sometimes that's just
persistent stubbornness.

32
00:01:26,101 --> 00:01:27,260
Let's say one,

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,721
well,

34
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:27,991
you know,

35
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:31,660
Tony used to do two separate persistence
from stupidity sometimes mean,

36
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:33,920
and I remember surfing.

37
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:36,020
I'm seeing that here is
oversight of stupidity,

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,810
but,

39
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,560
but it's hard to,

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,000
it's hard to separate those things,

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,180
but he's very adamant in his pursuit of
truth and he's willing to go places that

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,110
are dangerous and then
hard on his reputation.

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,620
So more power to them
as far as I'm concerned.

44
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,970
[inaudible].
