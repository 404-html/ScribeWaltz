1
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,990
It's interesting to look at these
things from obviously from multiple

2
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:10,824
perspectives,

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,810
which is another thing you
had your logs don't do.

4
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,081
Right.

5
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:15,510
Because for them everything
is one cause there's one,

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,480
that's how you can tell when you're
dealing with someone who's ideologically

7
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:22,650
possessed is they make everything
attributable to a single cause like power.

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:23,131
So,

9
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:26,250
but so one of the things that's happened
with the nuclear family that's quite

10
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:30,450
interesting too is that
parents are older and they,

11
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:31,680
and they have fewer children.

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:36,510
So you could imagine that that hot
house environment in some senses being

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,790
exaggerated for a bunch of reasons.

14
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:39,624
One is,

15
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:44,190
well your child is a lot more valuable
to you if you're older and you only have

16
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,024
one or two,

17
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:45,390
right?

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,280
Because you're not going
to get another chance.

19
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:48,061
That's first of all,

20
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:50,430
you might've had some trouble
having the child to begin with.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,210
Um,

22
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,710
and you're not going
to get another chance.

23
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:54,990
So you've got all your
eggs are in one basket,

24
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:55,824
so to speak.

25
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,150
And then of course children don't have
the number of siblings they used to have.

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,840
And one of the things that's really
useful about having siblings is that they

27
00:01:03,841 --> 00:01:05,010
keep you in your place,

28
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:05,311
right?

29
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:05,760
They,

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,980
they're primary socialization agents.

31
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:09,300
And I mean that can be brutal.

32
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,240
And that's reflected say in
the story of Cain and Abel.

33
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:12,541
You know,

34
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:15,420
that that internal household
dynamic with siblings can be,

35
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,600
can really become murderous and
that has to be kept under control.

36
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,434
But I think the,

37
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:19,980
the,

38
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:23,130
the hothouse flower person who's,

39
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:27,810
who's incapable of tolerating
any jibes or any or any testing,

40
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,750
any dominance hierarchy testing of
the sort that you said that men do,

41
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,010
part of that's the consequence of being
raised by older parents who have excess

42
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:35,844
resources,

43
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,500
who have no siblings because the child
is then of course special and that

44
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:41,334
specialness,

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,161
well there,

46
00:01:42,161 --> 00:01:46,470
there seems to be an inverse relationship
between that specialness that's

47
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:49,560
protected and the person's
robustness and resilience.

48
00:01:49,561 --> 00:01:50,070
And so,

49
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,390
and then that's cotton to,

50
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:52,520
or not cotton too.

51
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,210
That's,

52
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,043
that's uh,

53
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:54,870
uh,

54
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,060
pandered to by the universities,

55
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:01,470
which insist upon setting up a situation
where no one has ever offended by

56
00:02:01,471 --> 00:02:02,304
anything,

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,680
any of the time.

58
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,780
That's something I also
can't understand at all.

59
00:02:05,781 --> 00:02:05,910
Right.

60
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,250
Cause it,

61
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,960
let me just say that's a
huge point you just made.

62
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,111
Okay.

63
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:11,980
Because it's the upper middle class of
the purpose of the Fred professional

64
00:02:11,981 --> 00:02:14,590
class who postpones having the children.

65
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:14,741
Okay.

66
00:02:14,741 --> 00:02:16,390
Because they go to law school,

67
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,770
they go to medical school.

68
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:18,000
Right.

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:18,361
And they,

70
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,690
and they have the children after their,

71
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:19,901
their,

72
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,531
their settled.

73
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:20,711
Okay.

74
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:20,870
In,

75
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,101
in,

76
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:21,850
in a drop.

77
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,001
Okay.

78
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,560
So they're the ones.

79
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:23,860
Okay.

80
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,840
W we have it injected this,

81
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,411
this,

82
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:28,180
this hypersensitive bourgeois.

83
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:28,541
I didn't,

84
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:28,751
you know,

85
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:30,430
code into the universities.

86
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:30,910
Now My,

87
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,020
my parents were 20 when they
married in 21 when they had me.

88
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:35,321
Okay.

89
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:35,621
It made,

90
00:02:35,621 --> 00:02:36,454
my father was,

91
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,230
um,

92
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:37,530
you know,

93
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:37,930
uh,

94
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,160
went to college on the Gi Bill,

95
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:39,590
getting out of,

96
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,600
out of World War II.

97
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,610
So w w when I was born,

98
00:02:42,611 --> 00:02:46,060
my father was still in college and
with the sweeping the floors and so on,

99
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,240
I am the product of young parents and
nature once actually Yucca parents.

100
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:52,410
Right.

101
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:52,930
Because,

102
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:53,890
because pregnancy is,

103
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:54,111
is,

104
00:02:54,111 --> 00:02:54,821
is quicker,

105
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:55,571
it's safer.

106
00:02:55,571 --> 00:02:55,841
Okay.

107
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:56,350
And so on.

108
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,670
And my parents had the energy.

109
00:02:57,671 --> 00:02:57,970
Okay.

110
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,803
Too.

111
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,680
That's useful energy that can do spirit
that came out of world war two and so

112
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:02,920
on.

113
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,330
I'm positive that then.

114
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:08,500
Then my only other sibling
was born 14 years later.

115
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:08,980
Okay.

116
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,581
My father,

117
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,290
this point was a college professor.

118
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:11,620
Right.

119
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,040
All right.

120
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:14,770
So she had completely different
parents then and then I did.

121
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:17,120
So she has very excellent
manners and so on.

122
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:17,980
She's completely different.

123
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:18,420
Okay.

124
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:18,820
All right.

125
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,140
And I have all this energy of,

126
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:21,491
I mean it might,

127
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:23,080
my parents were just a lot of other teams,

128
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,180
but now today we have this situation.

129
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:25,770
No,

130
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:28,060
it's considered heresy
to raise this issue.

131
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:28,720
Okay.

132
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,820
That you have have young women are told,

133
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:31,360
okay,

134
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,380
there's one future for you.

135
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,340
You are a future leader.

136
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:33,790
Okay.

137
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,241
You must,

138
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:37,340
you must move forward
four years of college and,

139
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:37,470
and,

140
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,920
and perhaps it was a professional class.

141
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:39,751
All right,

142
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:41,890
so it may be the women,

143
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,690
young women's bodies are signaling
that they want to be [inaudible].

144
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,260
Maybe,

145
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,260
maybe there are signals
coming from the body,

146
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,080
right?

147
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,630
Maybe now wanting this,

148
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,081
this,

149
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:53,321
this,

150
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,580
this system of education
that was devised for men.

151
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,050
Okay.

152
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:59,300
This is being funneled along
channel long and it's next.

153
00:03:59,310 --> 00:03:59,660
Awesome.

154
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,220
All right.

155
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,150
So young women,

156
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:01,540
you know,

157
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,351
a few unhappy,

158
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,520
they don't know why they feel,

159
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,990
they have no sense of identity.

160
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:05,641
If they,

161
00:04:05,641 --> 00:04:05,981
if they,

162
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:08,990
if they want to marry and
drop out of college and have,

163
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,913
have a baby,

164
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,130
they will be treated as
traitors to their class.

165
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,990
What you are future leader?

166
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:18,991
What have a baby only working class
women would do that I find working class

167
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:20,141
women.

168
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:20,351
Okay.

169
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,250
In general.

170
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:21,790
Okay.

171
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,980
Far more rounded as personalities.

172
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,470
They express themselves forcefully.

173
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:28,780
They have body language
that takes up space.

174
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:29,140
Okay.

175
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,010
A man says something to
them on the street there,

176
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,650
right back in their face and so on.

177
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,330
It does the bourgeois girls.

178
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:34,720
Okay.

179
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,800
Who are talking to them at their core.

180
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,521
They are a special,

181
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:37,060
okay,

182
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,070
we'll have to postpone actual life.

183
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,371
Okay.

184
00:04:39,371 --> 00:04:40,660
For him for all these years,

185
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,310
these cds,

186
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,640
these other girls who are,

187
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:42,891
who are,

188
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:45,340
who misjudged the
fraternity parties setting.

189
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,750
These are the girls who like rotten for
parental protection and handholding on,

190
00:04:49,751 --> 00:04:50,230
on the,

191
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:53,140
on the committee investigating what
went wrong on our date and so on and so

192
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:53,660
forth.

193
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,310
So yes,

194
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,200
I think that you have located,

195
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,610
that's very interesting.

196
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,660
The idea that the,

197
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:58,990
that these,

198
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,310
these young girls,

199
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:00,760
okay.

200
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,080
Who are so sensitive.

201
00:05:02,081 --> 00:05:02,291
Okay.

202
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:02,711
In College,

203
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,910
so I'm able to handle their sex life
are the product of older parents because

204
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,650
they went through the
professional career track.
