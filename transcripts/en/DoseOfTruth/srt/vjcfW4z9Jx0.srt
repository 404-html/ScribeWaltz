Dr. Peterson,

2
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:10,760
I have an interview for
medicine coming up very soon.

3
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:14,840
It's structured in the MMI format
and it's intensely competitive.

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:17,420
Any tips on how to
stand out from the rest?

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:20,653
Okay,

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,430
well the only thing I could say is that

7
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,011
two things.

8
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:29,370
One is really pay attention
to the interviewers,

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,671
right?

10
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:30,780
Super attention.

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,890
Like don't glare at them.

12
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:33,840
Like you're aggressively paranoid,

13
00:00:33,841 --> 00:00:36,900
but like make sure you're focused on them.

14
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,520
And then the other thing I would
say is say what you really think,

15
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,840
like tell the truth.

16
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,703
It'll make you,

17
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,211
first of all,

18
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:46,800
if you tell the truth and it doesn't work,

19
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:47,634
then you know,

20
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,640
maybe that's not the school for you.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,170
That's something to really think about.

22
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:53,610
Um,

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,500
and if it doesn't work anywhere
and you tell the truth,

24
00:00:55,501 --> 00:00:56,760
maybe medicine isn't for you.

25
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:58,530
And I know that might be a terrible shock,

26
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,950
but let's assume that you are genuinely
properly motivated to study medicine.

27
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,930
Then tell them what you think.

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,960
You know so many people when they go into
an interview try and they do this when

29
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,750
they write essays too is try to tell the
interviewers what you think they want

30
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:16,081
to hear it,

31
00:01:16,081 --> 00:01:19,260
but you can bloody well be
sure that virtually everybody
who's being interviewed

32
00:01:19,261 --> 00:01:24,261
is going to do that and I don't think
that's very advisable because if you don't

33
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,450
manifest yourself the way you are,

34
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:32,480
then there's no way that the path
that's proper for you can reveal itself.

35
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,110
I know that sounds sort of mystical,

36
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,670
but I don't know how to put it any better.

37
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,660
The best way to stand out in an interview
always assuming you're competent and

38
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:43,050
that you've done the preparation,

39
00:01:43,051 --> 00:01:48,051
you know and that you're not living a
lie is to actually say what you think and

40
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:53,250
hopefully what will happen
is that there'll be other
people on the panel that's,

41
00:01:53,251 --> 00:01:53,720
that's,

42
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:58,720
that are looking at you who are of the
same type and that would characterize a

43
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:00,210
good position for you.

44
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:01,021
A good place to be.

45
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:04,800
If there are people like that and they'll
know what you're doing and that will

46
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:05,640
that,

47
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,530
then they'll think you know that person,

48
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:09,210
you know they're there,

49
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,930
they'd be good.

50
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,910
They're straightforward,

51
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:11,611
they're honest,

52
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:12,210
they're,

53
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,043
they're tough.

54
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:13,800
They're,

55
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,120
they can say what they think.

56
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,580
And if there aren't people
like that on the panel,

57
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:18,151
then I would say,

58
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,860
you probably don't want
to go there anyways.

59
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,630
So that's what I would,

60
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:22,980
that's what I would do.

61
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,200
Be True to yourself,

62
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:25,590
you know?

63
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,670
But that also assumes that you've done
your homework and that you're prepared

64
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:33,300
and all of that because if you're a
useless jackass and you're yourself,

65
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:35,070
while obviously that is going to work.

66
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,780
So good luck.

67
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,790
Good luck with your interview.

68
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,740
But I always think that like you,

69
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,910
the other thing too is don't
treat the interviewers as enemies.

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,141
You know,

71
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,310
if that's hard,

72
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:51,150
because if you're kind of petrified
about the potential outcome and you feel

73
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:52,830
intense judgment,

74
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,300
then you're likely to go in.

75
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:56,250
They're kind of afraid and nervous and,

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,090
and,

77
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,860
and maybe even resentful.

78
00:02:58,861 --> 00:02:59,694
It's like

79
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,690
you've already done enough so that
you're going to get interviewed.

80
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,810
So in some sense the interviewers are
hoping that you'll be great already.

81
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:10,811
You know,

82
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:14,320
there might be the odd cynic in there
who's trying to figure out a reason to

83
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:16,600
give you an x and check you off the list.

84
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,270
But most of the people sitting there,

85
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:19,991
if they have a clue,

86
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,920
are going to be looking
for good candidates and
they're going to assume that

87
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,580
you're,

88
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,720
you've hit threshold.

89
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:28,300
And so it's not like
they're not on your side.

90
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,250
And so that's a good
thing to keep in mind too.

91
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,390
You're not going in there to,

92
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,670
to face a panel of enemies,

93
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:38,230
you're going in there to face a panel
of the sort of people that you're likely

94
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:39,460
to be in 10 years.

95
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:42,850
So that's another thing that's really
useful to keep in mind with interviews in

96
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:43,271
general.

97
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:43,870
I would say.
