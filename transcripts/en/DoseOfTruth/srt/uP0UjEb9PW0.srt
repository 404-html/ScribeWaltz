1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:07,990
Well,

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:08,601
so okay,

3
00:00:08,601 --> 00:00:13,601
so your self serving and you construct
a view of the world that serves those

4
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:17,600
self serving causes and some
of that has to do with power.

5
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,423
Fair enough.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,800
That doesn't mean it all
has to do with power.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,390
It means that some of
it has to do with power.

8
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,650
It's like racism.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,820
People are kind of racist or
maybe people prefer their ingroup.

10
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,320
It's not that easy or maybe people
prefer the familiar to the novel.

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,690
You know that I eat that.

12
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:41,780
The social psychologists have come up
with implicit association test that

13
00:00:41,781 --> 00:00:44,000
measures unconscious bias.

14
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,600
We don't know what the hell that measures
the people who invented that bloody

15
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:47,870
thing.

16
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:48,321
They know.

17
00:00:48,321 --> 00:00:49,460
We don't know what it measures.

18
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,560
They know it's not reliable.

19
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:55,820
They know it's not valid enough to
be used as an individual diagnostic

20
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:56,600
instrument.

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,220
That's technically the case.

22
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,260
They also know that you can't train
people out of their unconscious biases

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,850
because there was not much difference
between unconscious bias and instantaneous

24
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:08,684
perception,

25
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,210
but they don't really care.

26
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:14,290
I've written to Mazda and Bonci.

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,570
He's one of the inventors of
the IAT several times saying,

28
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,750
how about you come out in public
and say what you already know?

29
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,990
Which is that people are
misusing your damn test.

30
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,430
Silence.

31
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:26,571
Well,

32
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:28,050
that's partly because her discipline,

33
00:01:28,051 --> 00:01:31,580
social psychology is a corrupt discipline
as the social psychologists have

34
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:33,380
discovered over the last four years.

35
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,610
It'd be turning themselves inside out
trying to rectify which they haven't.

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,473
Anyways,

37
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,290
we're giving the devil his due.

38
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,680
There's an infinite number
of interpretations of
the world and it's highly

39
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:48,800
probable that you'll lay a
self serving one on top of it.

40
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:49,701
Yes,

41
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,830
and also that will serve
the interest of your group.

42
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:53,030
However you define that.

43
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:53,870
Yes,

44
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:56,720
but it only accounts for a
fraction of your behavior.

45
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,230
There's all sorts of other things at
work as well and you don't get to reduce

46
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:03,050
all human motivations
to one motivation power.

47
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,550
And then you might also ask a,

48
00:02:04,551 --> 00:02:07,280
why would you want to reduce
all human motivations to power?

49
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:09,650
It's so you can use power.

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:14,990
That's why you can justify
the use of power that's force.

51
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,330
You don't have to engage
in civilized debate.

52
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:18,980
You don't have to give
a damn about the facts,

53
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,160
especially if you're not a postmodernist
cause you don't believe in facts

54
00:02:22,161 --> 00:02:22,970
anyways.

55
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,631
And you might ask,

56
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:23,751
well,

57
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:24,350
why don't you,

58
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:24,531
Hey,

59
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:25,370
I'm not kidding.

60
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:26,510
I'm not kidding.

61
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,760
Postmodernists don't believe in facts.

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They believe that the idea of fact is
part of the power game that's place played

63
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:39,820
by the white dominated male patriarchy
to impose the tyrannosaur structure of

64
00:02:40,551 --> 00:02:42,770
the Patriarchy on the oppressors.

65
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:45,050
It's like I'm not making this stuff up.

66
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,681
It's embedded,

67
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:45,981
right?

68
00:02:45,981 --> 00:02:46,611
In theory,

69
00:02:46,611 --> 00:02:49,760
all you have to do is read
it and you find this out.

70
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,980
So they don't believe in facts.

71
00:02:51,981 --> 00:02:54,170
What facts would constrain
the use of power?

72
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,360
At least that's how it looks to me.

73
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,970
Yeah.

74
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,301
Okay.

75
00:02:59,301 --> 00:02:59,871
So fine.

76
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:00,020
We

77
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,100
gave the devil his due.

78
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:05,990
There's an infinite number
of interpretations and
you're likely to use bias,

79
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,070
compression algorithms on the world
and they're likely to be biased in your

80
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:10,904
favor.

81
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,493
True.

82
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,843
But

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,180
only partly true.

84
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,960
And the difference between an idiot log
and the thinker is that a thinker knows

85
00:03:24,961 --> 00:03:29,190
the difference between things that are
only partly true and things that are

86
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,024
completely true.

87
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,010
Things are complicated.

88
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:32,191
Like,

89
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:35,850
I like to think everything is as
complicated as a military helicopter.

90
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,470
You have to like,

91
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,680
I think it's eight hours of maintenance
to keep those things in the air for one

92
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,200
hour because they don't
fly like they're rocks.

93
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,130
They plummet.

94
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,330
It's really hard to keep them in the
air and they're full of parts and you,

95
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,830
and if you don't know all those parts,

96
00:03:49,831 --> 00:03:52,860
you don't go in there and monkey
about with them because just wreck it.

97
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,200
And that's just a helicopter.

98
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,800
Like everything is way more
complicated than the helicopter.

99
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:01,740
So you don't just go muck about in there
hoping you're going to make it better.

100
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,150
That isn't how it works.

101
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,860
You need to be competent.

102
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,221
All right,

103
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:07,054
so look,

104
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,590
here's where the postmodernists are wrong.

105
00:04:09,591 --> 00:04:12,800
I think there's three places
and there's serious errors.

106
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:17,120
The first is that there is an
infinite number of interpretations,

107
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:19,750
but there is not an infinite
number of viable interpretation.

108
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,910
So there's a very finite number
of viable interpretations.

109
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,770
And I don't think that this is theory.

110
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,060
I think that game theorists have already
demonstrated this to some degree and

111
00:04:29,061 --> 00:04:31,610
it's going to be built into
AI systems very rapidly.

112
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,031
Okay,

113
00:04:32,031 --> 00:04:33,350
so what are the constraints?

114
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:33,981
Okay,

115
00:04:33,981 --> 00:04:34,521
first of all,

116
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:38,540
you can't have an interpretation that
leads to immediately to your death or your

117
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:39,230
dad.

118
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:39,471
Now,

119
00:04:39,471 --> 00:04:40,670
if you want to be dead,

120
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,391
that's fine,

121
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:42,500
but if you don't want to be,

122
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:45,140
then you got a lot of limited options,

123
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:45,590
right?

124
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,090
You don't get to run naked across an
eight lane freeway at night blindfolded

125
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,100
because probably you'll be dead.

126
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,140
That's a bad interpretation.

127
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:54,891
Okay,

128
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:59,030
so you might say because you're
fragile and vulnerable and mortal,

129
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:03,200
that there's a limited number of ways
that you can look at the world that don't

130
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:04,034
result in,

131
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,700
let's say death or
serious damage or agony.

132
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,720
That's a bad thing.

133
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,830
Agony is a bad thing.

134
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:11,360
Most people agreed on that.

135
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:14,090
So you're constrained by pain and anxiety.

136
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,190
At least your interpretations
are constrained by pain
and anxiety and you know

137
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,120
you can make pain worse or better
by thinking about it to some degree,

138
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,080
but only to some degree
when push comes to shove,

139
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,150
pain is your master.

140
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:30,951
Okay?

141
00:05:30,951 --> 00:05:32,360
So that's a big constraint.

142
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:33,081
That's a big,

143
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:34,070
big constraint.

144
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,940
Well,

145
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:39,940
but the constraints are worse than that
because not only do you not get to have

146
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:44,270
an interpretation of the world that
produces anxiety and suffering right now,

147
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,550
but you don't get to have
an interpretation of the
world that if you iterated

148
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,720
across time produces pain and suffering.

149
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:52,250
And so that's,

150
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,320
that's a big problem
because there's lots of,

151
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,910
you could go out tonight and get yourself
drunk on cocaine and sleep with six

152
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,110
hawkers and you know,

153
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:00,770
maybe that,

154
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,120
maybe that'd be a good night.

155
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,720
You know,

156
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,790
you might not think about
it being so good tomorrow,

157
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:08,810
but then maybe you're dead of AIDS in a
year or maybe you're addicted to cocaine

158
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:11,180
or maybe you're a street
alcoholic or whatever.

159
00:06:11,181 --> 00:06:14,480
It's like as an iterable
game that's downhill.

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,180
And the thing is you play iterated games,

161
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:17,931
you don't play one,

162
00:06:17,931 --> 00:06:19,250
you play iterated games.

163
00:06:19,251 --> 00:06:23,390
And so your interpretation of the world
has to be one that will sustain multiple

164
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:28,391
iterations across time because you have
to worry about 40 year olds and 60 year

165
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,014
old you.

166
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,460
And that's a big problem.

167
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:32,570
That's a lot of used,

168
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:34,490
stretched over a long period of time.

169
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,190
And it's worse than that
because it's not just you.

170
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,200
It's like you and your family,

171
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:40,431
right?

172
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:40,971
And not only,

173
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:41,121
so,

174
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:44,660
not only do you have to take
care of yourself now in a
manner that allows you to

175
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:49,340
take care of yourself when you're 40 you
have to take care of yourself now in a

176
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:54,200
manner that takes care of you when you're
40 so that other people are happy to

177
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:58,970
have you around now and continually so
that they'll cooperate and compete with

178
00:06:58,971 --> 00:07:00,680
you in a positive way.

179
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:03,860
And so that's getting
ridiculously complicated.

180
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:04,521
It's not just you.

181
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:04,881
Now,

182
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,720
when you in the future,

183
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:09,860
it's you surrounded by other people doing
the same thing now and in the future.

184
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,660
And there's a lot of other people,

185
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,880
it can even just be you and your family.

186
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,361
You know,

187
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:14,900
like,

188
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:19,580
like the psychopathic burglar mob
that's just not going to go so well,

189
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:19,851
right?

190
00:07:19,851 --> 00:07:23,330
Other people are going to object
and the world's going to object.

191
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,381
And so fine,

192
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,390
there's an infinite
number of interpretations,

193
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:29,300
but it doesn't mean there's an infinite
number of viable interpretations.

194
00:07:29,301 --> 00:07:29,870
In fact,

195
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:30,920
there are hardly any,

196
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:33,230
there are hardly any playable games.
