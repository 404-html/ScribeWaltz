1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,530
There are a variety of very complex
things facing us,

2
00:00:09,531 --> 00:00:12,740
you know,
and one of them is while the Iq issue

3
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:16,700
that we talked about,
another is this polarization between

4
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:19,820
left and right that seems to be
characterizing everywhere in the West.

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:21,230
You know,
what's the same in Australia,

6
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,880
New Zealand,
all through Europe,

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,680
in Canada,
in the US.

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:28,430
I think you guys are actually a little
more protected against the most places.

9
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,730
But um,
and then the other one is,

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,440
well we need to dialogue between Islam
and Christianity and Judaism for that

11
00:00:36,441 --> 00:00:37,460
matter.
But I mean the big,

12
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,490
the big clash for the Western world is,
is Islam versus Christianity.

13
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,000
And you know,
people don't think about it in those

14
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:51,170
terms because many intellectuals in the
west think of themselves as secular,

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,920
but it's a massive,
it's a massive problem.

16
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:58,820
And I'm hoping to conduct a whole series
of conversations with,

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:01,040
with Muslims,
uh,

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,280
former and present pro and anti to try
to facilitate a dialogue because there's

19
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:08,450
lots to talk about.

20
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:12,200
I mean,
I've studied religious thinking a lot

21
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,280
and I'm pretty ignorant about Islam
because it's a complicated system and

22
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:20,690
it's difficult to get into.
But I can tell you that what I've read

23
00:01:20,691 --> 00:01:25,691
about Islam has not made me feel better
about the chances of reconciliation

24
00:01:27,831 --> 00:01:29,750
between the Christian and the Islamic
world.

25
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:32,360
So like I don't know what to make of the
fact,

26
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:33,710
for example,
I mean,

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:37,970
if you look at the figure of Christ,
and I don't care if you're religious or

28
00:01:37,971 --> 00:01:40,160
not,
I don't even care if Christ existed or

29
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,350
dog,
and I certainly don't care at the moment

30
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:46,430
about claims to divinity or the lock
there up.

31
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,080
It's just speaking as,
let's say I'm speaking as a secular

32
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:53,990
intellectual as a figure.
He's a figure of peace.

33
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:57,800
I don't think that that's disputable.
I mean,

34
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:00,080
he certainly,
he wasn't a warlord.

35
00:02:00,081 --> 00:02:02,240
That's,
that's one thing that's for certain,

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,730
he never led armies,
you know?

37
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,370
Whereas that's not the case with
[inaudible] at all.

38
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:12,400
Mohammad was clearly and indisputably a
warlord and so it isn't the obvious to

39
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:18,641
me what to make of that except that it's
bloody complicated in a child bride as

40
00:02:19,071 --> 00:02:20,080
well,
I believe.

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,720
Yeah.
Well that that one is somewhat less

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,750
problematic to me because I think that
you can write that off to the cultural

43
00:02:30,261 --> 00:02:32,280
morays of the time now.
Um,

44
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,860
I know that there's a weakness in that,
but I don't think we have to address

45
00:02:36,861 --> 00:02:38,450
that.
But the,

46
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:43,660
when the founder of your religion spread
that religion by the sword,

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,240
it makes it rather difficult.
And when your religion has been

48
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:51,740
embroiled in a vicious civil war from
the day of Mohammed's death,

49
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:53,710
which is exactly the case in,
in Islam,

50
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,580
between the Sunni's and the,
and the Shiites,

51
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,550
that war started literally the day that
Mohammed died.

52
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:03,190
It's very difficult for me to see how
that can be reconciled with the claims

53
00:03:03,191 --> 00:03:04,900
that Islam is a religion of peace.

54
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,410
Yeah.
We saw that one when Martin Luther

55
00:03:07,411 --> 00:03:09,750
hammered some stuff on a door a long
time ago,

56
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:12,450
and the Protestants and the Catholics
just went their separate ways.

57
00:03:12,451 --> 00:03:14,580
And I mean,
like there's been some rough feelings

58
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:15,810
over the years,
I suppose,

59
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:19,740
but no generational wars that I can
think of.

60
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,300
I mean,
right.

61
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,651
Yeah.
Well,

62
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,520
I mean,
there was plenty,

63
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:24,710
you know what,
as you said there was,

64
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:28,980
there's been plenty of Christian schism.
But the other thing too is that it's not

65
00:03:28,981 --> 00:03:31,770
that easy to lay those at the feet of
Christ.

66
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,510
No.
Because,

67
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:36,510
because just even merely as an
architectural figure,

68
00:03:36,511 --> 00:03:37,021
you know,
as,

69
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:37,591
as,
as,

70
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:41,760
as the western world's hypothesis of the
ideal man.

71
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,310
I mean,
as a moral character,

72
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,150
he was pretty much above reproach and I
don't,

73
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,680
well,
it's difficult for me to say the same

74
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:55,950
thing about Mohamad.
Now that might be because I'm an

75
00:03:55,951 --> 00:04:00,930
ignorant old western white guy,
but like I'm doing my best man.

76
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,930
I'm a big hit by,
or a dow is in for example,

77
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:07,920
and there's great wisdom in Daoism and
I've found value,

78
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:11,490
real value in and so much of the
religious reading that I did,

79
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:14,550
I've done,
but I'm really stumbling with Islam.

80
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:19,551
It's really hard for me to,
to see it as other than a primarily

81
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:23,010
political system

82
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,380
and did,
and that's how it's being a imply

83
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,170
enforced right now with WWE.
That's what Isis is all about.

84
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,630
You know there were state establish a
religious caliphate,

85
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:35,330
you know,
across the borders of two two countries.

86
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:35,990
It's,
yes,

87
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,840
it's less about when I think of
religion,

88
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:40,940
yeah.
When I think of like the Christian

89
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:42,710
religion,
how it's applied here in my home state

90
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:43,560
of Georgia,
you know,

91
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:47,070
it's w w when when we go to church and
we tied,

92
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,180
that has very little to do with politics
at all.

93
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:50,671
There's,
there's that,

94
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,850
there's this huge massive separation
between religion,

95
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:54,590
politics for the most part in the u s
and could be,

96
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,520
there are moments of ambiguity and,
and tempers flare over and I'm a

97
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,440
monument on this piece of property or
no,

98
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,320
but that's as stiff as it gets.
Like,

99
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:06,950
like the scariest bit of that that I can
remember some drunk fellow ran over a

100
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:09,770
monument for the 10 commandments a few
months ago and tipped it over.

101
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,410
Like,
like,

102
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,750
like that's what happens when,

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,540
and a critical point,
like,

104
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,350
like if you're not a Christian Kyle and
you're,

105
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,850
you know,
Christian kind of alcove there and

106
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,020
Georgia,
no one ever is going to come to you and

107
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:23,850
say you have to pay a different rate of
taxes.

108
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,550
You have to go to different stores,
you have to the religious who are,

109
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:27,780
will not be enforced

110
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,350
as a law.
You know,

111
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:30,670
I'm not going to lose any hands.
I,

112
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:31,310
if I,
if I,

113
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,410
I,
I can,

114
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,840
you know,
the Bible has many restrictions that it

115
00:05:34,841 --> 00:05:38,270
places on Christians and I ignore all of
them virtual,

116
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,310
you know,
like I don't,

117
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,730
I know there's no,
like there's no,

118
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:44,400
yeah,

119
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,690
religious police to come and kick my
door in and drag me away and torture me

120
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:50,880
and threatened my family and,
and well,

121
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,150
it's also,
there's other,

122
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:58,210
there's other cataclysms that that are
on that exist on the conception in the

123
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,160
conceptual realm as well.
So,

124
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,353
you know,
the,

125
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:06,680
the,
the states dominated by Islam are not

126
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:11,060
economically productive.
And that's quite an interesting mystery

127
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,613
and

128
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:16,140
they're not,
and many of the,

129
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:21,141
and many of the Islamic states that we
purport to regard as allies hold values

130
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:27,291
that are antithetical to our system.
And a Saudi Arabia is a classic example

131
00:06:27,601 --> 00:06:30,150
of that.
And I cannot for the life of me

132
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:35,151
understand,
except in a psychoanalytic manner why

133
00:06:35,191 --> 00:06:39,770
the radical feminists tolerate America's
Lli.

134
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,530
America's lie.
The fact that America is allied with the

135
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:45,000
Saudis,
it's just absent.

136
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,470
It's like,
it's like,

137
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,140
it's not much different as far as I'm
concerned,

138
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:52,320
that it would be if black people didn't
say anything.

139
00:06:52,321 --> 00:06:57,270
If America was allied with a slave or a
black slave owning state,

140
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,150
which of course also happens in Saudi
Arabia by the way.

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,350
So when did the feminist,
it's gotta be because Muslims right now

142
00:07:04,351 --> 00:07:06,700
are higher up on the victim hierarchy
than then.

143
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,310
So even if it's way over there,
they're not allowed to speak out against

144
00:07:10,311 --> 00:07:10,670
sir,

145
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:14,810
I think it's their unconscious wish for
brutal male domination.

146
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,143
I know.
I'm,

147
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,411
no,
I like that.

148
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:21,800
That's fun.
I think it's the left's ability to

149
00:07:21,801 --> 00:07:26,210
apologize for anything that's wrong.
I think that people on the left,

150
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,940
maybe I'm just as crazy as you guys are,
like the Muslims are oppressed women.

151
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:32,840
Oh,
that's cultural.

152
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,360
We need to understand that.
Oh guys think they're girls.

153
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,051
That's,
you know,

154
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:37,610
hey,
we need to understand where they're

155
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:38,840
coming from.
Everything.

156
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,650
They're so open minded to egg excuse
making,

157
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,900
even if it's horrific.
Yeah.

158
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,260
That's also the agreeableness say and we
were talking about earlier.

159
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:47,940
Yeah.
Because agreeable,

160
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,350
agreeable people agree.
You know,

161
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,620
that's,
that's why the term exists.

162
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,450
And yeah,
so there is a real uh,

163
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,450
Poland and if you ally that with high
openness,

164
00:07:57,451 --> 00:07:59,490
which is that open mindedness,
you know,

165
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:02,790
that it's associated creativity,
you get agreeable openness.

166
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,470
Yeah.
That's definitely,

167
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,750
and he goes
wrong.

168
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,860
And I'll forgive you beating your wife
often if you're low in

169
00:08:11,861 --> 00:08:15,460
conscientiousness,
everything you keeping really goes,

170
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,830
then bill more puts it nicely when he
says,

171
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,370
you know,
the left would not for one second be

172
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:23,710
okay with apartheid in South Africa.
Right.

173
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:26,260
They would just banging that drum hating
every second of the way.

174
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,030
But for some reason the oppression of
women in Saudi Arabia has gotten a

175
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:32,440
complete pass.
Yup.

176
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:36,070
And it's a real deal,
you know,

177
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,270
say it's real deal.
Yeah.

178
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,840
Heck,
just the driving thing alone.

179
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,680
Yeah.
Taylor,

180
00:08:44,681 --> 00:08:46,840
can you hold that?
They liked her.

181
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,880
Yeah.
I broke up.

182
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,470
You broke it.
We couldn't hear what you were saying.

183
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,420
You're still a little frozen.
So,

184
00:08:52,421 --> 00:08:53,254
um,
uh,

185
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,730
but yeah,
just taking away their ability to drive,

186
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:56,730
right.
Women don't have mobility without men.

187
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:00,660
That is hugely oppressive.
If you made that change in America and

188
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:05,580
none other than when you're walking
stuck at home than you actually don't

189
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:06,414
see

190
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,460
a more concrete embodiment of the idea
of individual autonomy than the

191
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:13,300
automobile.
You know,

192
00:09:13,301 --> 00:09:16,930
I think maybe it was the Soviet Union's
import and then,

193
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,000
and then,
uh,

194
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:19,360
uh,
manufacturer.

195
00:09:19,361 --> 00:09:21,640
If the automobile,
the doom communism,

196
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:25,870
because nothing screams autonomous
individual like a car,

197
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,630
right?
You drive it yourself.

198
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,120
You can go on any road.
No one tells you what to do.

199
00:09:31,121 --> 00:09:35,410
It's like it's freedom.
And the fact that women can't drive in

200
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:37,540
Saudi Arabia,
it tells the entire story.

201
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:42,750
And so the fact I cannot understand for
the life of me why we are so blind in

202
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:45,790
the west,
that we make the assumption that those

203
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:48,930
people are our allies.
It's like in what

204
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:49,923
Jay

205
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,790
and things have switched around the lot.
I mean,

206
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,460
America is now an oil exporting country
again,

207
00:09:56,210 --> 00:10:01,210
and you guys have been doing pretty good
on the fracking for natural gas front.

208
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,950
And you know,
the other thing that's quite a bit worth

209
00:10:03,951 --> 00:10:08,951
considering is that if the west wanted
to reduce its reliance on Middle Eastern

210
00:10:09,321 --> 00:10:11,600
oil,
it can turn to Alberta and the tar

211
00:10:11,601 --> 00:10:13,460
sands.
There's enough bloody oil there for,

212
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,030
for,
for the rest of humanity for the rest of

213
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:17,781
time.
You know,

214
00:10:17,781 --> 00:10:20,570
and it's a bit messy,
but it isn't obvious to me that it's

215
00:10:20,571 --> 00:10:23,240
better than,
it's worse than dumping $1 trillion

216
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:26,420
every five or six years into the coffers
of the Saudi princes.

217
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,420
Especially given there are obvious
responsibility for distributing the

218
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:35,930
most,
the most vicious Wahhabis propaganda all

219
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:37,720
over the world with the,
which is,

220
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,910
which is something that a fair chunk of
that petro money goes to.
