1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:10,090
What you've been writing and thinking
about and people's reaction to it

2
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:11,980
intersects with tonight's debate.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,520
Uh,

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,520
because you've been quite vocal on
the topic of political correctness.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,940
No fan of the radical left and it,

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:19,631
you know,

7
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:20,351
and people might say,

8
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:20,531
well,

9
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:21,940
does that mean you support the radical,

10
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:22,690
right?

11
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,523
It's like,

12
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,560
just because you're no fan of the
radical left doesn't mean you support the

13
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:26,891
radical,

14
00:00:26,891 --> 00:00:27,161
right?

15
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,010
That's an absolutely a
preposterous proposition.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,050
But the universities,

17
00:00:32,051 --> 00:00:34,060
especially the humanities
and social sciences,

18
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:37,780
are absolutely dominated
by left wing thinking.

19
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,720
That's well documented by
people like Jonathan Heit.

20
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:42,070
It's not my imagination.

21
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:47,520
And I find the doctrine that unites
them to be unconscionably pernicious.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,750
It's basically a collectivist doctrine.

23
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,480
And the thing that disturbs me about it,

24
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:57,890
but there's every reason
to have a left wing.

25
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:03,780
The reason you need a left wing is
partly because being left wing is in part

26
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:04,954
temperamental.

27
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,700
It's not going away.

28
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:12,070
And also because when our
society produces hierarchies,

29
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,840
which will inevitably do,

30
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,050
people tend to stack up at
the bottom of hierarchies.

31
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,600
It's in the nature of hierarchies
to produce that as an outcome.

32
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:24,601
And what that means is that the people
who are dispossessed in the hierarchical

33
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,750
arrangements need a voice and
that's the left obviously,

34
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,610
and and fair enough.

35
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,120
But it's also obvious that just
as the right can go too far,

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,320
the left can go too far,

37
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,540
but when the left goes too far is
something that's very ill defined.

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,760
And to me that's,

39
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:49,270
that's not acceptable given that we
know that the left can go too far and I

40
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:54,271
think they've certainly gone too far in
the universities and the postmodern neo

41
00:01:55,661 --> 00:02:00,661
Marxists pastiche that
makes up the radical left
philosophy that's at the bottom

42
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:05,590
of the social sciences and humanities
now is there's nothing about it that's

43
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:07,090
useful as far as I'm concerned,

44
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,070
that has nothing to do with compassion,

45
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,210
has nothing to do with lack of my lack of,

46
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:14,613
what would you say?

47
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,210
Empathy.

48
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:16,690
Yeah,

49
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,523
precisely.

50
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,660
They're completely separate issues.

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,900
And that's another thing that really
bothers me about political correctness.

52
00:02:22,901 --> 00:02:23,590
It's like,

53
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:23,741
well,

54
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,510
we have a hammer lock on empathy.

55
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,430
It's like a empathy is not enough.

56
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,990
It's not even close to enough.

57
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,600
And an excess of empathy
can do terrible things.

58
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,070
And B,

59
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,281
no,

60
00:02:33,281 --> 00:02:35,050
you don't have a hammerlock on empathy.

61
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:40,360
And to ally that with a philosophy that
essentially assigns people to their

62
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:43,090
identity via their group membership.

63
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,180
And then to read not only
the current state of affairs,

64
00:02:46,181 --> 00:02:50,980
but history itself as a battleground
between competing groups is,

65
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,140
I think it's dangerous.

66
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,830
I think it's obvious that it's dangerous
if you know anything about history,

67
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,250
but one you're sure to hear tonight

68
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,520
is this idea of privilege
that certain people by virtue,

69
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,120
uh,

70
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,660
Uni,

71
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,930
by virtue of our,

72
00:03:05,931 --> 00:03:06,940
our race,

73
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:07,930
our class,

74
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,980
our gender,

75
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,220
have enjoyed historically privilege in
society and it's time that that privilege

76
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:19,180
be shared more equitably across groups
who've been historically disadvantaged.

77
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:19,591
Well,

78
00:03:19,591 --> 00:03:24,120
that's a good example of the
conflation of empathy with ideology.

79
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,920
It's like first of all,

80
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,340
the majority in any society has privilege.

81
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:35,120
That's the whole point of the society is
to set up a system so that the bulk of

82
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:38,880
the people in the system
can do well while,

83
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,580
and then you have you built
in protection for minorities.

84
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,260
So to conflate that with
race is not acceptable.

85
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,573
It's a kind of,

86
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:52,020
it's a toxic sleight of hand and
it's extraordinarily dangerous.

87
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,540
So apart from that,

88
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,620
it's an empty claim.

89
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,440
Some people have advantages
that other people don't.

90
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,850
Well obviously,

91
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:05,250
and if you take apart anyone into the
multitude of categories that they can be

92
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:06,360
taken apart into,

93
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,480
what you'll find is that on
some of those dimensions,

94
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,460
they're doing better than other people
for rather arbitrary reasons sometimes.

95
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,770
And on other dimensions
they're doing worse.

96
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,820
So it purple.

97
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,800
And then the next part of that
is while historically speaking,

98
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:23,101
it's like,

99
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:23,670
okay,

100
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:26,040
over what span of time do you mean?

101
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:31,041
Precisely so you mean because my
ancestors 150 years ago were privileged

102
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,200
comparatively speaking,

103
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:35,940
that I should somehow pay for that now.

104
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,260
And Are you so sure.

105
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:40,200
My ancestors were so privileged
as far as I can tell.

106
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,810
My grandparents on my father's side,

107
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,930
my father grew up in a log
cabin until he was five.

108
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,430
He had like three rooms.

109
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,200
My grandmother was a cleaning woman,

110
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:51,660
fur fur farms in the,

111
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,100
in this,

112
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,830
in central Saskatchewan in the 1930s
she cooked for threshing cruise.

113
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,280
You know,

114
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,780
she chopped wood piles that were as big
as the damn cabin to get through the

115
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:00,810
winter.

116
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,410
It's like where?

117
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,370
Where's the privilege?

118
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,040
I see it accrues to me as
a consequence of my race.

119
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:05,461
Oh,

120
00:05:05,461 --> 00:05:05,791
I see.

121
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:08,130
So we're now we're going to have
a discussion about race are Wayne.

122
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,121
That's,

123
00:05:09,121 --> 00:05:13,350
and that's the thing about the toxic
left is that everything is about group

124
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:14,184
identity.

125
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,120
And so let's say,

126
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,130
let's even take the argument
further though and say,

127
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:17,401
okay,

128
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:19,260
well because of my skin color,

129
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,960
I'm differentially privileged.

130
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,381
Okay.

131
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:23,940
So from,

132
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:25,320
from a historical perspective,

133
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,280
so,

134
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,080
so what you're going to make everybody
be on the basis of their race now pay for

135
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:34,740
some historical inequity and
you're going to view the,

136
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:38,310
the history of the relationships between
men and women as one fundamentally of

137
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,144
oppression.

138
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,030
That's the way we're going to play this
is that it wasn't that men and women see

139
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:48,350
fundamentally cooperated throughout
history to bring themselves out of the

140
00:05:49,531 --> 00:05:52,530
fundamental catastrophe that
history has always been.

141
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,550
That isn't what it was.

142
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:58,551
Despite the fact that in 1895 the typical
person in the western world lived on

143
00:05:58,971 --> 00:06:00,050
less than a dollar a day.

144
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:01,070
By today's standards,

145
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:04,490
which is far below the UN's current
guidelines for abject poverty.

146
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,930
We're going to revisit that.

147
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:07,040
We're going to say no.

148
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:07,281
Really,

149
00:06:07,281 --> 00:06:10,640
the fundamental reality of the world
was that men are oppressed women.

150
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,013
It's like,

151
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,273
yeah.

152
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,790
So that brings me to a second argument
that you are no doubt going to hear

153
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:17,241
tonight,

154
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,080
which is that,

155
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,360
you know,

156
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,630
men need to check their privilege.

157
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,400
That there's an idea here that,

158
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,360
uh,

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,660
you know,

160
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,940
women in particular the me too movement.

161
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,590
There's been a,

162
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,760
an awareness and awakening the part of
the power of women in society and it's

163
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:32,211
time that,

164
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:33,140
that be acknowledged.

165
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,150
What will be your response to that?

166
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,290
Well,

167
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:36,831
first of all,

168
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:38,510
when the discussion is about power,

169
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,410
you know,

170
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,110
that sends a shutter up
my spine immediately,

171
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:45,140
partly because part of
the postmodern doctrine,

172
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,050
especially in its
alliance with neo Marxism,

173
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:48,940
which is squirrel,

174
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:50,480
strangest alliance by,

175
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,190
by my estimates,

176
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,690
everything's about power.

177
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,220
And I don't believe that.

178
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,450
I think that hierarchies are only about
power when they've already transformed

179
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:00,800
themselves into tyrannies.

180
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,400
And I don't think that the fundamental
hierarchies that characterize the west

181
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:07,190
art t radical comparatively speaking,

182
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,640
like compared to the heavenly
hierarchy in your utopian imagination,

183
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:15,470
no doubt there exemplars of pure hell,

184
00:07:15,471 --> 00:07:19,730
but compared to everywhere else in the
world right now and every other hierarchy

185
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,570
throughout history,

186
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,400
we're doing pretty damn well.

187
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:26,390
And the fact is is that once
we had reliable birth control,

188
00:07:26,391 --> 00:07:28,520
which really only happened in the 1960s,

189
00:07:28,850 --> 00:07:32,360
women were welcomed most fundamentally,

190
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:33,430
although also opposed,

191
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,150
but most fundamentally welcomed into
every position of authority and competence

192
00:07:38,151 --> 00:07:40,010
that could possibly be laid open to them,

193
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,900
to the point where now they
make up something like it's
damn near three quarters

194
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:46,760
of humanities and social
sciences students,

195
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,470
they dominate the healthcare fields.

196
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:53,060
So how fast do you expect the
transformation to take place?

197
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,170
While the argument is,

198
00:07:54,171 --> 00:07:54,351
well,

199
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:56,300
it would've never happened
without political pressure.

200
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,260
It's like,

201
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,093
yeah,

202
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,993
no,

203
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,833
sorry.

204
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,860
What triggered it was reliable birth
control and that made it possible.

205
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,671
It was reliable,

206
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:06,470
birth control and reliable,

207
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,683
um,

208
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:12,500
menstrual sanitation and all of those
things that no one ever takes into account

209
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:17,830
that made the playing field open
and it's transformed utterly.

210
00:08:18,681 --> 00:08:19,341
And in what,

211
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:20,390
50 years,

212
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,460
how fast do you think
these things can happen?

213
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,540
Good point.

214
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,340
So,

215
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:27,020
and I'm certainly not against
equality of opportunity.

216
00:08:27,021 --> 00:08:27,854
You have to be here.

217
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,670
You have,

218
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:33,670
I dunno what has to be wrong with you
to be against equality of opportunity.

219
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:34,610
You know,

220
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,230
even if you're selfish,

221
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,470
if you're not absolutely out for
destruction and you're only selfish,

222
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:45,980
let's say anybody with any sense would
go for equality of opportunity at least

223
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:49,280
because it gives you the possibility
of exploiting the maximum number of

224
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,260
qualified and talented people.

225
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,281
So,

226
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,510
and equality of outcome.

227
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:54,344
Well,

228
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,980
we'll save that for the debate tonight.

229
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,060
I'm sure it'll come up.

230
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:58,931
Final question.

231
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,490
I'm asking all of you pre debate.

232
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:02,470
Where do you think this debate
is going to go from here?

233
00:09:02,471 --> 00:09:03,790
Do you think we're,

234
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,690
we're in a kind of cultural spasm or
do you think there's something more

235
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,400
fundamental happening in our culture,

236
00:09:09,401 --> 00:09:10,720
a new tribalism,

237
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:14,560
a new set of antagonisms they're
going to take much longer to work at?

238
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,080
I think it'll depend on how well we each
behave in the next 10 years because I

239
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:26,700
think things could get way
better everywhere really fast,

240
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:31,740
or we could degenerate back
into our idiot 20th century.

241
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:33,660
Tribalisms and I would say,

242
00:09:33,661 --> 00:09:34,620
if I had to bet,

243
00:09:34,621 --> 00:09:35,454
well,

244
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:35,931
you know,

245
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:36,120
it's,

246
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,820
what are you seeing?

247
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,481
You're out there,

248
00:09:37,481 --> 00:09:40,000
you're in the public's.

249
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:40,834
Uh,

250
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,640
I,

251
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,150
I,

252
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,050
I really,

253
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,050
I would say that

254
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,700
there's plenty of pressure
in both directions.

255
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:55,351
You know,

256
00:09:55,351 --> 00:09:57,900
I'm heartened by the
fact that so many people

257
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:04,050
have been taking the
psychological material that
I've been providing online to

258
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:07,260
heart and doing what they can
to put themselves together.

259
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,080
I'm disheartened by the fact that

260
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,540
everything now is transformed into,

261
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,320
well,

262
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,880
virtually everything is transformed
into a polarized political argument.

263
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,210
And there seems to be no understanding
of the fact that not everything is

264
00:10:25,701 --> 00:10:26,660
actually political.

265
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,130
I actually don't think that,

266
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,830
I don't think the discussion
about political correctness,

267
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:31,693
political,

268
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,750
I think it's,

269
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,960
I think it's both theological
and philosophical,

270
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,190
but it's,

271
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,050
it's always presented are often
presented in politicize terms,

272
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:47,110
not least because if you're influenced
by the radical leftist collective

273
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,860
collectivist ideology,

274
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,410
that is the only playing field.

275
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,620
It's all hierarchies at each
other's throats playing power games.

276
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,320
It's it.

277
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,140
The free speech thing is
really interesting because
on the radical left end of

278
00:11:03,141 --> 00:11:03,411
things,

279
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:03,710
this,

280
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,510
there is no debate about free speech.

281
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:10,400
You can't have a debate about free speech
from that ideological position because

282
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:11,780
there isn't any such thing.

283
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,330
All there is is those who are maneuvering
for power within their respective

284
00:11:17,331 --> 00:11:19,500
groups making claims that benefit from,

285
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:19,940
yeah.

286
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:22,910
That's the basic axiom of
the interpretive system,

287
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,620
so free speech.

288
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,150
It isn't that it isn't.

289
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,910
The reason that free speech has
become politicized is because

290
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,330
if you adopt the collectivist viewpoint,

291
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,460
it's a shibboleth.

292
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,870
It's a fantasy.

293
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,820
You might think you're speaking freely,

294
00:11:37,821 --> 00:11:38,630
but you're not.

295
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,650
You're just expanding on that.

296
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,570
How prevalent gender absolutely.

297
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:42,404
Smile.

298
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,320
My Rez.

299
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,400
Anyway,

300
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:44,840
part,

301
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,840
one of the things that's funny about
the postmodern insistence on identity,

302
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,490
I think it's absolutely comical in a very,

303
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:53,324
very dark,

304
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:58,450
is the emergence of intersectionality
because the intersectional theorists

305
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,510
actually identified the Achilles
heel of the collectivist perspective.

306
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:04,990
You know,

307
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,820
because what they pointed out was,

308
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:06,971
well,

309
00:12:06,971 --> 00:12:09,370
let's say we cover the standard groups.

310
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,350
I don't know why these
are the standard groups,

311
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:13,180
but let's say sex,

312
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,330
ethnicity and race for
the sake of argument.

313
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:17,231
Well,

314
00:12:17,231 --> 00:12:18,760
what about how they interact?

315
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:19,991
It's like,

316
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:20,824
yeah,

317
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,270
what about that?

318
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,540
What about the fact that gender
is infinitely differentiable,

319
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,220
not least from the left wing perspective.

320
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,330
And what about the fact that
there's endless numbers of
ethnic variance and what

321
00:12:31,331 --> 00:12:31,751
are you going to do?

322
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,570
You're going to control for the
interaction between all of those.

323
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,650
And the answer is yes.

324
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:38,200
That's what we'll try to do
before we give up our radiology.

325
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,360
But the fact of the matter is,

326
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:44,410
is that the reason the
west decided on a radical,

327
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:49,390
individualistic perspective to begin
with is because we figured out 2000 years

328
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:50,224
ago,

329
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:53,340
at least at the origins of
this type of thinking that,

330
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:54,870
okay,

331
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:57,090
everyone is so unique that you can frack,

332
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,510
you can fraction hate their group
identity right down to the level of the

333
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:01,150
individual.

334
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,010
[inaudible] well,

335
00:13:02,011 --> 00:13:02,844
so,

336
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,593
yeah.

337
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:04,950
Yeah.

338
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,150
I don't know what's going to happen.

339
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,340
I think the universities for example,

340
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,770
I think they've done themselves yet.

341
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,570
I don't think they can escape from,

342
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:12,901
cause I,

343
00:13:12,901 --> 00:13:13,410
I,

344
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:18,000
I've watched large organizations crumble
and that can happen very often and

345
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,263
okay.

346
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:21,590
One serious error.

347
00:13:21,591 --> 00:13:22,424
We'll do it.

348
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,190
And I think I've tried to lay it out.

349
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,310
I think the universities have
made seven serious errors.

350
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,000
You don't want,

351
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,990
we're gonna have to say those for the
stage tonight and then universities will

352
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:34,090
absolutely be a topic of our discussion.

353
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,540
Okay.

354
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:39,140
But a real pleasure to get a taste for
your remarks and appreciate your passion

355
00:13:39,141 --> 00:13:39,700
and your,

356
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:39,920
uh,

357
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,960
a willingness to,

358
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:46,380
to step onto the stage and engage with
other people's ideas in a spirit of free

359
00:13:46,811 --> 00:13:47,800
and open exchange.

360
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:48,450
Yeah.

361
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,630
Hopefully it will go well and it'll be
an intelligent discussion and we'll get

362
00:13:51,631 --> 00:13:52,080
somewhere.
