1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,560
Well,

2
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,380
when you also have to look with
regards to the shadow ideas,

3
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:15,580
like you have to get in touch
with the depths of your anger.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,271
You know,

5
00:00:16,271 --> 00:00:19,060
lots of people are resentful
about all sorts of things.

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:23,680
They're resentful about Oh women and
they're resentful about men and they're

7
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,180
resentful about the patriarchy.

8
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:28,900
And there are resentful about the left
wing and resentful about the right wing

9
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:33,460
and the resentful about politicians
and they're resentful about like the

10
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:38,250
cataclysmic force of nature and its
ability to make people sick and,

11
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,461
and suffer.

12
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:44,320
And they're resentful about their own
inadequacies and about their bad parenting

13
00:00:44,321 --> 00:00:47,560
and God like the list
is just bloody endless.

14
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:49,660
And that can make you very,

15
00:00:49,661 --> 00:00:50,494
very angry.

16
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:55,210
That's part of that resentment and
cynical and bitter and dark and full of

17
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:59,560
fantasies about destruction and the
desire to bring things down and the wish

18
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:03,330
that everyone else suffered and the
desire to shake your fist at God.

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,740
And all of that's really dark.

20
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,380
You know,

21
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,181
Young said,

22
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:08,800
well the shadow of the human shout,

23
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,750
it extends all the way down to hell.

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,100
And you really meant that,

25
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,300
you know,

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:18,300
because all of the terrible things
that people are motivated to do are

27
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:20,950
associated with that shadow domain.

28
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:23,350
Like none of you are any,

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,440
none of you are saints in any likelihood.

30
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,720
You have a terrible capacity
for destructiveness.

31
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:32,500
And when you start to consult your
resentment and to see how angry you are,

32
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:35,260
it can terrify you to see
the depths of that anger.

33
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:38,470
Sometimes that'll manifest itself
in very destructive fantasies,

34
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:39,240
you know,

35
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,073
um,

36
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:45,300
which you might not want to
become conscious of because
there's so brutal let's

37
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,001
say,

38
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:49,750
and so aggressive that you can't even
believe that you generate them the nice

39
00:01:49,751 --> 00:01:50,950
person that's you.

40
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,880
It's like so it's quite frightening
to open the door and see all that.

41
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,880
And that also associates you with
the entire dark shadow of mankind,

42
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,590
right?

43
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:03,010
The sate tannic element
of the human character.

44
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,180
And,

45
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,690
but it opens the door down
understanding as well too,

46
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,120
to understanding how people can do
terrible things because you could see

47
00:02:10,121 --> 00:02:12,820
yourself as one of the people
who could do terrible things.

48
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,080
That's really useful.

49
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:14,914
You know,

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,873
cause then you,

51
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,050
well then maybe you start to be motivated
to be the sort of person who wouldn't

52
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:21,160
do terrible things.

53
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:21,641
You know,

54
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,090
if you can really come to terms with
the fact that that's part and parcel of

55
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:25,480
you.

56
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,210
It also is some perverse sense.

57
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,930
It's also a discovery of your own strength
though because you know if you have

58
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:33,820
that desire for aggression,

59
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:36,700
that desire for destruction and that that,

60
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,270
that ability to fantasize
in that aggressive manner,

61
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:44,320
it also means that you can incorporate
some of that into your speech and into

62
00:02:44,321 --> 00:02:47,590
your actions so that you're
a lot more immovable,

63
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,760
right?

64
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,450
And,

65
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,200
and a lot more of a force to contend with.

66
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,420
It can give you some respect for yourself.

67
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:59,050
When you realize that you're a force
of destruction as well as creation,

68
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,010
then you're also more likely to treat
yourself with a bit more intelligent

69
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,844
caution,

70
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,571
you know,

71
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:06,520
to know that you're a part of you.

72
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:10,030
Is it ticking bomb in some
sense that could go off.

73
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,223
And so you,

74
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:11,680
you,

75
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,180
you try it a bit more lightly around
yourself and maybe you encourage people to

76
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,100
tread a bit more lightly
around you as well,

77
00:03:18,101 --> 00:03:19,420
which isn't such a bad thing.

78
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,430
And all the people that I really admired
that I know have a clearly dangerous

79
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:27,220
side and you don't want to get,

80
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,830
you don't want to have that
activated any more than necessary.

81
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,710
But it's also what makes
them respectable and strong,

82
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,630
especially if they have
that under control.

83
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,973
So,

84
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:37,811
oh,

85
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:40,180
that's a bit of a dialogue
about shadow integration.

86
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,230
It's a very,

87
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,850
yeah.

88
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:45,290
Challenging undertaking,

89
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:45,711
you know,

90
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:49,580
to pull in that dark
side of your character.

91
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:55,040
And that would be all the things that
you've repressed or failed to develop as a

92
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,650
consequence of trying to be a harmless.

93
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,513
And

94
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,663
uh,

95
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,730
well let's say a harmless and

96
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,860
harmless citizen who looks
virtuous on the surface.

97
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,600
That's the union persona.

98
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,370
And you need that because everybody
needs a mask that they wear in public,

99
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:14,204
like a suit,

100
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,840
you know,

101
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,920
so that we can tolerate seeing
each other on the street.

102
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,340
We don't have to look right into
our depths every time we interact.

103
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,720
We need that persona,

104
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:27,120
but that has to be transcendent.

105
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,200
And the way to transcend that
is to integrate the darker
parts of the character.

106
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,330
They're very useful.

107
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,223
That aggression,

108
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,670
that's sexual demand,

109
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:36,504
for example.

110
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:40,260
All of that's very difficult to
socialize that competitiveness,

111
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,160
but unbelievably useful in
terms of force of character.

112
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,420
If you could manage it.
