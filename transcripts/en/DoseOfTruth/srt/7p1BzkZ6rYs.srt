1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,210
How about
so we should first decide what we're

2
00:00:07,771 --> 00:00:11,550
talking about.
We're not talking about my views of

3
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:15,690
political correctness despite what you
might have inferred from the last

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:19,770
speaker's comments.
This is how it looks to me.

5
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,250
We essentially need something
approximating a low resolution grant

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,290
narrative to unitus and we did narrative
to united because otherwise we don't

7
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:35,040
have peace.
What's playing out in the universities

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,970
and in broader society right now is a
debate between two fundamental low

9
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:41,820
resolution narratives.
Neither of which can be completely

10
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:44,130
accurate because they can't encompass
all the details.

11
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,560
Obviously human beings have an
individual element and a collective

12
00:00:47,561 --> 00:00:49,050
element.
A group element.

13
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:52,740
Let's say the question is what story
should be paramount,

14
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,310
and this is how it looks to me in the
West.

15
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,050
We have reasonably functional,
reasonably free,

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,350
remarkably productive,
stable hierarchies that are open to

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,600
consideration of the dispossessed that
hierarchies generally create.

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,690
Our societies are freer and functioning
more effectively than any societies or

19
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,230
anywhere else in the world and that and
then any societies ever have and as far

20
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:24,480
as I'm concerned,
and I think there's good reason to

21
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,740
assume this,
it's because the fundamental low

22
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:30,570
resolution,
a grant narrative that we've oriented

23
00:01:30,571 --> 00:01:33,690
ourselves around in the West is one of
the sovereignty of the individual and

24
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:38,430
it's predicated on the idea that all
things considered the best way for me to

25
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:42,390
interact with someone else's individual
to individual and to react to that

26
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:47,391
person as if they're both part of the
process because that's the right way of

27
00:01:47,851 --> 00:01:50,580
thinking about it.
The psychological process by which

28
00:01:50,581 --> 00:01:53,520
things we don't understand can yet be
explored and buy.

29
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:57,420
Things that aren't properly organized in
our society can be yet set right.

30
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,940
The reason we're valuable as
individuals,

31
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,520
both with regards to our rights and
responsibilities,

32
00:02:02,521 --> 00:02:04,560
is because that's our essential purpose.

33
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,260
Announce our nobility and that's our
function.

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,880
What's happening as far as I'm concerned
in the universities in particular and

35
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,040
spreading very rapidly out into the
broader world,

36
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:16,050
including the corporate world,
much to.

37
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:21,051
It's a much to what should be its
chagrin is a collectivist narrative and

38
00:02:22,171 --> 00:02:26,030
of course there's some utility in a
collectivist narrative because we're all

39
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,120
part of groups in different ways,
but the collectivist narrative that I

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:34,770
regard as politically correct as a
pastiche of a strange pastiche of

41
00:02:34,771 --> 00:02:38,880
postmodernism and neo Marxism in its
fundamental claim is that no,

42
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:44,010
you're not essentially an individual.
You're essentially a member of a group

43
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,180
and that group might be your ethnicity
and it might be your sex and it might be

44
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:52,140
a race and it might be any of the
endless numbers of other potential

45
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:56,130
groups that you belong to because you
belong to many of them and that you

46
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,560
should be essentially categorized along
with those who are like on that

47
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,790
dimension in that group.

48
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,090
That's proposition number one.
Proposition number two is that the

49
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:09,091
proper way to view the world is as a
battleground between groups of different

50
00:03:09,131 --> 00:03:11,410
power.
So you define the groups first and then

51
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,080
you assume that you,
you,

52
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,090
you viewed the individual from the group
context.

53
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:19,690
You viewed the battle between groups
from the group context and you view

54
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:24,100
history itself as a consequence of
nothing but the power maneuvers between

55
00:03:24,101 --> 00:03:28,360
different groups that eliminates any
consideration of the individual and at a

56
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,230
very fundamental level and also any
idea,

57
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:34,900
for example,
of free speech because if you're

58
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,920
collectivist at heart in this manner,
there is no such thing as free speech.

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,930
It isn't that it's debated by those on
the radical left and let's say the rest

60
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,810
of us so to speak.
It's that in that formulation there's no

61
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:50,380
such thing as free speech because for an
individualist free speech is how you

62
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:53,350
make sense of the world and reorganize
society in a proper manner,

63
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,670
but for the radical left type
collectivist that's associated with this

64
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,040
viewpoint of political correctness,
when you speak,

65
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,350
all you're doing is playing a power game
on behalf of your group and there's

66
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,960
nothing else that you can do because
that's all there is and not only is that

67
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:11,710
all there is in terms of who you are as
an individual now and how society should

68
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,310
be viewed.

69
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,560
It's also the fundamental narrative of
history.

70
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:19,060
For example,
it's widely assumed in our universities

71
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:23,710
now that the best way to conceptualize
Western civilization is as an oppressive

72
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,610
male dominated patriarchy and that the
best way to construe relationships

73
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:31,480
between men and women across the
centuries is one of oppression of women

74
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:33,760
by men as like,
well,

75
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:38,800
look,
no hierarchy is without it's tyranny.

76
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,290
That's a.
that's an axiomatic truth.

77
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:45,250
People have recognized that literally
for thousands of years and hierarchies

78
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,960
do tend towards tyranny and they tend
towards the use of patient by people

79
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:52,240
with power,
but that only happens when they become

80
00:04:52,241 --> 00:04:57,130
corrupt and we have mechanisms in our
society to stop hierarchies from

81
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:58,300
becoming intolerable,
be corrupt,

82
00:04:58,301 --> 00:05:01,600
and they actually work pretty well and
so and so.

83
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,370
I would also.
I would also.

84
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,560
I would also point this out,
you know,

85
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:09,850
don't be thinking that this is a debate
about whether empathy is useful or not

86
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,330
or that the people on the con side of
the argument are not empathetic.

87
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,240
I know perfectly well as sure Mr Frye
does that.

88
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:21,280
Hierarchies tend to produce situations
where people stack up at the bottom and

89
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:23,680
that the dispossessed and hierarchies
need a political voice,

90
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,540
which is the proper voice of the left by
the way,

91
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:29,830
and the necessary voice of the left,
but that is not the same as proclaiming

92
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:34,270
that the right level of analysis for our
grand unifying narrative is that all of

93
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:39,160
us are fundamentally to be identified by
the groups that we belong to and to

94
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:43,690
construe the entire world as the
battleground between different forms of

95
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:48,100
tyranny in consequence of that group
affiliation and to the degree that we

96
00:05:48,101 --> 00:05:51,310
play out that narrative that won't be
progress.

97
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:53,470
Believe me,
and we certainly haven't seen that

98
00:05:53,471 --> 00:05:57,350
progress in the universities.
We've seen situations like what at

99
00:05:57,351 --> 00:06:00,590
Wilfrid laurier university.
Instead we won't see progress.

100
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:04,790
What will return to is exactly the same
kind of tribalism to characterize the

101
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:05,624
lamp.

102
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,630
Thank you.
