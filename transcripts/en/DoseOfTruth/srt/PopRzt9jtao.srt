1
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:09,420
What about the disciplines on campus?

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,980
It seemed to be primarily devoted
to the activist cause like,

3
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:15,780
because my view is,

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:18,720
or my fear is that we've subsidized,

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,260
um,

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,610
the activist disciplines,

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,410
let's say women's studies
as a good example,

8
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:26,250
but we could say social work and then
the faculties of education now as well.

9
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:27,210
I think they're in the same,

10
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,220
in the same bin.

11
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:29,611
Let's,

12
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:29,910
let's,

13
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:30,840
let's put it that way.

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,990
The women's studies programs
in particular there,

15
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:39,020
their express goal expressed on their
websites is to produce social justice,

16
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:42,240
radical left leaning activists.

17
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,430
And so like for awhile,

18
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:49,170
one of the things I proposed in Canada
was that the conservatives in particular

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:53,640
cut the university funding by 25% so
that the universities would have to sort

20
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,474
themselves out.

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:55,650
But then that was,

22
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,750
it was a provocative claim obviously.

23
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,770
But then I thought,

24
00:00:58,771 --> 00:00:58,861
well,

25
00:00:58,861 --> 00:01:02,820
that's not a good idea because it opens
up the door to political interference in

26
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,450
the academy.

27
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,290
And that's bad.

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,010
That's exactly,

29
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:05,650
that's right.

30
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,270
That's right.

31
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:06,780
That's right.

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,590
But the academy's done a very bad job
of policing itself methodologically.

33
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,300
And we have these disciplines.

34
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,250
Women's studies I think
is a prime example.

35
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:18,030
And that's been very much criticized in
Canada by Janice Fia Manco who used to

36
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:18,181
be,

37
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:18,900
yeah,

38
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,111
yeah,

39
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,730
she is.

40
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,520
And she's,

41
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,410
she that she's not under natural mill.

42
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:23,940
You when she's doing such things,

43
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:24,181
you know,

44
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:24,511
she's,

45
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:28,950
she's a brave and tough person and she's
gone after the women's studies types on

46
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:30,780
methodological grounds particularly.

47
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,913
But,

48
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
but there are people who are working
full time at doing nothing but producing

49
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:38,370
the kind of polar.

50
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,180
So what do you have any lots about?

51
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:40,471
Yes,

52
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:40,860
I do.

53
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,220
I think so.

54
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:42,790
Um,

55
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,161
here I,

56
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:46,150
I teach in the business school here and
I teach a course called professional

57
00:01:46,151 --> 00:01:50,290
responsibility and I teach my
students about their fiduciary duties,

58
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,150
their duties to their employers,

59
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:53,680
the duties that we have to each other.

60
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:55,020
Um,

61
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,680
and fiduciary duty refers to a very,

62
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:58,000
a very high standard of care.

63
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,530
If you're managing someone's money,

64
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,251
you know,

65
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:00,571
you,

66
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:03,190
you really have to be committed
to doing what's in their interest,

67
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:04,150
not in your interest.

68
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,920
And I think we need that concept.

69
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:07,600
In the academy we have,

70
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,170
I'm not sure if she would call fiduciary
duties or just professional duties,

71
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,920
but I think we have two primary
professional duties that we must never,

72
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:16,840
never be tray one.

73
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,620
The most important one in our role
as scholars is our duty to the truth.

74
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:26,100
We must never say things that we think
are false or allow people to stay,

75
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:29,530
things that we think are false because
we're afraid if we challenge them,

76
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:30,364
we'll get in trouble.

77
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,850
So we have a fiduciary duty
to the truth and political,

78
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:36,730
ideological commitments clearly warp us,

79
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,900
they make us do things,

80
00:02:37,901 --> 00:02:38,261
they make us,

81
00:02:38,261 --> 00:02:39,094
they push us.

82
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,740
So we've got a hole.

83
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:45,190
We've got to recognize that if we
let our systems get out of whack,

84
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,300
we are betraying the truth.

85
00:02:46,301 --> 00:02:48,370
Where systemically do you want to?

86
00:02:48,371 --> 00:02:49,450
If we ever went systemic,

87
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,290
truth isn't problem.

88
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,080
We are systemically betraying the
truth in many of our disciplines.

89
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:56,110
So I think we need an awareness of that
and we need to hold ourself to a higher

90
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:56,944
standard.

91
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,300
They ended our role as teachers.

92
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:58,901
We have,

93
00:02:58,901 --> 00:03:01,330
and we really can call
it a fiduciary duty.

94
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,440
These are people's children
who are sent to us to educate,

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,310
um,

96
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,660
to enlarge their minds,

97
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,950
to teach them skills.

98
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,580
If we were to use them
for our sexual pleasure,

99
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:14,890
it's obviously a horrific crime.

100
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,250
But what is it if we use them
for ideological purposes,

101
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:20,860
if we say you've given me
your children to educate,

102
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm waging a political battle.

103
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,310
I'm going to try to get your statements,

104
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:24,820
tools,

105
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,470
it's tools that is horrific,

106
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
that is unacceptable.

107
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,530
We are violating our duties.

108
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,920
So I think we need it.

109
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:31,930
Right.

110
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,680
But the,

111
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,180
the response to that,

112
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:37,930
especially from the postmodernist
types is that that's all the ribs.

113
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,160
There's only ideologic.

114
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:39,994
Yeah.

115
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:40,720
Perfect.

116
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,280
So back to original question.

117
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:42,740
Um,

118
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,810
are there problem departments?

119
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,673
Absolutely.

120
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:49,540
So I wanted to put forth these two
commitments to truth and to educating,

121
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,420
not indoctrinating.

122
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:50,950
Yeah.

123
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,420
And universities that embrace these
highest goals like the University of

124
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:55,421
Chicago,

125
00:03:55,421 --> 00:04:00,421
I think is the best candidate
will probably find that
they need to do something

126
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:04,720
about department that don't
live up to those goals.

127
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,150
Other universities.

128
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,490
And I think Brown is leading
the way on this one so far.

129
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:14,050
I mean earlier in 2015 the president had
all kinds of statements about brown is

130
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:15,370
committed to social justice,

131
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,440
a fundamental bedrock
commitment to social justice.

132
00:04:17,441 --> 00:04:18,274
She said.

133
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:22,420
So if some universities choose to
devote themselves to social justice,

134
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,740
that's fine.

135
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,030
Just be upfront about it.

136
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,900
Say So.

137
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,720
So students will know if you
want social justice training,

138
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,554
you go to Brown.

139
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,860
But if you want to actually be trained
to find the truth to do research,

140
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,870
you go to Chicago and I think we're going
to see people flooding to Chicago and

141
00:04:38,231 --> 00:04:38,981
schools like it.

142
00:04:38,981 --> 00:04:40,390
So what I'm hoping,

143
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,760
what I'm hoping that's
the mechanism there.

144
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:43,091
If they,

145
00:04:43,091 --> 00:04:43,760
if they make the,

146
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,370
if they make their statements public that
the choice of the students will be to

147
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,970
go to the universities that
hold the principles that
you just described over the

148
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:52,350
other ones.

149
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,590
It will be a marketplace choice.

150
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,190
Exactly.

151
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:54,521
That's right.

152
00:04:54,521 --> 00:04:56,470
So that's why I said when I talked
about the emperor's new clothes,

153
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,730
we have a situation,

154
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,620
we have a gigantic market failure in
which our top universities are offering a

155
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:05,410
product that most consumers don't want.

156
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,870
And so my prediction is that Chicago
is going to see a huge surge of

157
00:05:10,871 --> 00:05:12,040
applications this year.

158
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,270
And if that's true,

159
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:13,961
um,

160
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:15,700
I think other universities are going to,

161
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:17,443
they're going to take notice.

162
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,580
So I'm hoping that we'll see a schism
in the American academy between those

163
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:23,500
universities that stand up and say,

164
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,490
this is madness.

165
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,650
We are committed to providing a platform.

166
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:28,990
We don't discriminate based
on viewpoint and politics.

167
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,400
That's the Chicago way.

168
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,361
And those that say,

169
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:31,511
no,

170
00:05:31,511 --> 00:05:32,650
we're about social justice.

171
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,860
Come here and we will train you to
fight for social justice and against the

172
00:05:35,861 --> 00:05:36,694
right.

173
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,720
So if,

174
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,640
if people have clear choices,

175
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,790
then I think we're going
to see a big change.

176
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,900
And that's why I'm optimistic,

177
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:44,770
because I think we're going to see that.
