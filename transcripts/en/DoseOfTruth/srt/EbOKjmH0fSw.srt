1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,440
Good question.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,670
Ask yourself what would motivate you?

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:09,960
You know,

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,793
first of all,

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,330
don't be studying eight hours a day
cause that isn't going to work and you're

6
00:00:14,331 --> 00:00:15,540
not going to do it anyways.

7
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,590
You know,

8
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:18,810
when you start studying
five minutes a day,

9
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:19,650
seriously,

10
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:20,100
would you,

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,870
could you bring it up to 10 minutes a day?

12
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:26,430
What would you have to do for yourself
to get yourself to sit down for half an

13
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,480
hour a day and,

14
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,190
and study intently?

15
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,510
Like maybe you'd have to,

16
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,920
I don't know what you'd have to do,

17
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,500
like have a beer at six
o'clock at night or something.

18
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,260
Or maybe you'd have to go for a walk
in the park or go out for coffee.

19
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:37,890
It's like,

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,890
imagine that you're sitting down with
a stupid undisciplined child who,

21
00:00:42,901 --> 00:00:45,630
and you're trying to get that child
to do something useful and you say,

22
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:45,871
okay,

23
00:00:45,871 --> 00:00:46,704
look,

24
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:48,120
I want you to do x.

25
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,110
It's necessary,

26
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:52,620
but you can pick how much of it you're
going to do and I'll give you what you

27
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:54,440
want if you do it well,

28
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,310
ask yourself that and see what happens.

29
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,890
So don't try to tyrannized yourself,

30
00:00:58,891 --> 00:00:59,161
you know,

31
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:03,270
try to negotiate with yourself and use
some reward and see how that works and

32
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:03,991
start slow.

33
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,261
You know,

34
00:01:04,261 --> 00:01:04,890
maybe,

35
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,010
maybe you're not very disciplined and
the best you can do is half an hour of

36
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:09,120
studying a day.

37
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,430
Well start with half an hour.

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,500
Increase that five minutes a week.

39
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,190
You know,

40
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,821
if you do that,

41
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:15,451
that's a lot.

42
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:15,900
If you,

43
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,250
if you do that for a year,

44
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,010
then you'll,

45
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:18,930
by the end of the year,

46
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,640
you'll be studying four hours a day.

47
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,020
So you can eat.

48
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,500
That's,

49
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,580
that's just with five,

50
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,140
that's just with five minutes a week,

51
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:25,301
right?

52
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:27,360
Because that's 250 minutes in a year.

53
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,960
So start ridiculously pathetically study
for five minutes a day for a week and

54
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:41,901
then move it to 10 you may have
to do that and don't cheat.

55
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:42,301
You know,

56
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,210
because one of the things people do is
they make a deal with themselves like

57
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:45,420
that.

58
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:45,841
I'm all,

59
00:01:45,841 --> 00:01:48,570
I'm going to study for 10
minutes a day each day.

60
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,460
And then they,

61
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,570
they get into it,

62
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:50,911
they think,

63
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:51,121
wow,

64
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,110
this is going really good.

65
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,650
So they study for two hours and then
they broken the contract with themselves

66
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:57,090
and they don't trust themselves anymore.

67
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,910
And then they don't study
for a whole year or,

68
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,390
well,

69
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,800
maybe not for a month.

70
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:02,730
So,

71
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,290
but set your contract,

72
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,700
ask yourself,

73
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:06,150
you know,

74
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,150
what could I do to move myself
forward to my goal that I would do?

75
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,060
And then how can I improve
that incrementally?

76
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,250
So that's the right way
of going about that.

77
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:18,503
So,

78
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,020
okay.
