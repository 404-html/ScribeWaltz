Jordan B.

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,363
Peterson

3
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,440
in your lectures,

4
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:15,200
you used the term postmodernism
interchangeably with cultural Marxism,

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,390
nihilism and moral relativism.

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,660
I wonder if you've considered or
heard alternative beliefs at the term

7
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:22,320
postmodernism is not necessary,

8
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:26,570
is necessarily always congruent on a one
to one scale with these other terms and

9
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:29,600
in some limited circumstances is positive.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,370
Specifically the idea that wouldn't,

11
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:35,570
you'd use the term postmodernism to
vilify is by some others referred to as

12
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:39,740
pseudo modernism where as some would call
what you endorsed to not be modernism

13
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:44,741
but in fact Metta modernism post
millennialism or post postmodernism,

14
00:00:45,261 --> 00:00:46,730
which unfortunately has a terrible name.

15
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,680
And then I have very brief just
definitions of those words.

16
00:00:51,681 --> 00:00:54,410
If you need me to know,

17
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,360
as I said tonight,

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,610
you have to give the devil his due

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,860
and so we'll do that.

20
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:01,910
So yes,

21
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:04,430
there was a very large number of
ways of interpreting the world.

22
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,530
There's no doubt about that.

23
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,993
Um,

24
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:08,930
yes.

25
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,930
People use biased interpretive lenses
to as means of interpreting the world to

26
00:01:15,591 --> 00:01:16,430
put their own

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,913
okay.

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,670
Priorities forward without necessarily
knowing that they're doing so and that

29
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,710
that can corrupt them.

30
00:01:25,711 --> 00:01:26,640
And Society.

31
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,720
Psychoanalysts figured that out
way before the postmodernist.

32
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:32,070
So they don't get any credit for that.

33
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,870
Like really none.

34
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,043
MMM.

35
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:39,050
So it's useful to keep
those things in mind.

36
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,390
It's when they're put,

37
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,950
but it's when they're put forward
is absolute truth that disturbs me.

38
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:46,311
It's like,

39
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:46,850
yes,

40
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,320
people are probably racist.

41
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:49,940
They might even be implicitly racist,

42
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:52,820
although we don't know what that means
and we don't know how it's related to

43
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,080
their explicit behavior.

44
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,230
And we can't separate it from in group
preference or necessarily from reaction

45
00:01:59,301 --> 00:01:59,960
to novelty.

46
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,190
So it's a tricky business.

47
00:02:01,191 --> 00:02:02,024
You know,

48
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,030
and we don't know how to separate
stereotypical racial perceptions from

49
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,790
perceptual heuristics.

50
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,780
We don't know how to do that.

51
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,570
Cause you're always oversimplifying the
world because you're not smart enough to

52
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:15,710
live in the world as it is.

53
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:16,910
You have to oversimplify it.

54
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,800
So yes,

55
00:02:18,801 --> 00:02:21,290
there are times when
postmodernism is useful,

56
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,890
are used it quite usefully tonight
to deconstruct postmodernism.

57
00:02:24,891 --> 00:02:25,724
In fact.

58
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,840
So,

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,673
but,

60
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,521
but wait,

61
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,380
it's when it's turned into an absolute,

62
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:32,060
especially a moral absolute that it,

63
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,550
and when it aligns itself with Marxism,

64
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:34,881
it's like,

65
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:35,571
sorry guys.

66
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:36,050
No,

67
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,220
you don't like grand narratives.

68
00:02:37,221 --> 00:02:39,380
You don't get to go there
while that's where you,

69
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,570
that isn't where you went,

70
00:02:41,571 --> 00:02:42,830
that's where you came from.

71
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:43,310
You never,

72
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,820
you never left there.
