1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,210
I'm quite shy and when asked questions
in public,

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,520
I find it hard to articulate a good
answer,

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,180
but we'll come up with a strong response
hours or days later.

4
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,530
Any advice?
Yeah,

5
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:21,020
I have some advice.
One is that,

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,270
um,
well you're probably introverted day so

7
00:00:23,271 --> 00:00:26,840
you're not as verbally fluent as an
extrovert would be a not quite as fast

8
00:00:26,841 --> 00:00:28,670
on the draw verbally,
but you know,

9
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,210
that means you need some more time to
contemplate and maybe you're high in

10
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:34,240
negative emotion too.
Um,

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,850
because shyness can be a combination of
introversion and high negative emotion.

12
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,070
It can be one or the other,
but,

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,910
but technically shy is introverted.
Um,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,480
anyways,
what I would certainly recommend for you

15
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:51,470
is that if you're faced with a
complicated question,

16
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,340
especially one that has to do with an
important decision in your life that you

17
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:59,810
say,
I need to sleep on it or I need a couple

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,690
of days and not to answer,
um,

19
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:04,723
on the draw.

20
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,520
I mean,
I think that's true even for extroverts.

21
00:01:07,521 --> 00:01:11,930
I think if you're at called upon to
offer your opinion about something

22
00:01:11,931 --> 00:01:14,390
complex,
then it's perfectly reasonable to say,

23
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:16,400
look,
that's a really hard question.

24
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,320
I'm not going to give you a casual
answer.

25
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:20,360
I need to think about it for a couple of
days.

26
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:25,010
So the advice would be because you find
it hard to articulate a good answer,

27
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:28,880
don't allow yourself to be rushed.
And the second is to understand that

28
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:31,640
this is part of your temperament there.
There isn't anything wrong with it.

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,430
It's just,
it's,

30
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,090
it's,
it's how you're wired.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:40,040
So
what causes a person to hoard is due to

32
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:43,340
low conscientiousness.
What is generally the best course of

33
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,440
treatment?
Um,

34
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,730
it's usually a consequence of relatively
high in neuroticism.

35
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,330
Um,
and it's tangled in with disgust,

36
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:56,000
sensitivity as well.
Um,

37
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,270
people who hoard have a hard time.
They feel guilty if they throw things

38
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:05,450
away because the thing's still have some
residual utility.

39
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,700
The best course of treatment is well,
behavioral therapies probably the best

40
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:15,701
course of treatment.
And to plan what needs to be thrown away

41
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,820
and to work with a person that can help
you make the hard decisions that,

42
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,900
that need to be made if you're hoarding.
Um,

43
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,990
all that,
all that hoarded material is an,

44
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,220
it's decisions that have been put off.
So a lot of that is high neuroticism.

45
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,800
I,
some of that can be a consequence of low

46
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:49,300
conscientiousness as well.
So the best course of treatment is to

47
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:53,210
find someone to help you plan how to
approach the,

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,480
the horde.
Very complicated.

49
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,390
So,
all right.

50
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,730
Which Hogwarts house would you be in?

51
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,123
Yeah,

52
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:20,630
well I think I'd have the same issue as
Harry Potter when the hat was first put

53
00:03:20,631 --> 00:03:22,460
on.
It would think that I might make a

54
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:25,910
perfectly good Dennis and of slitherin.
So,

55
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,310
um,
although that probably wouldn't be where

56
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,290
I would end up.
So

57
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,010
what is your take on an astrological
basis for significant dates in religious

58
00:03:43,011 --> 00:03:44,420
stories?
Example,

59
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:47,330
Christian religion is a parody on the
worship of the sun.

60
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,130
Well,
it's certainly not a parody.

61
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,920
Um,
religion,

62
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,950
religious systems as the expand tend to
incorporate everything that's quasi

63
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:00,830
religious in the culture.
And there's certainly no shortage of

64
00:04:00,831 --> 00:04:03,890
solar symbolism in Christianity.
I mean,

65
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:08,891
it's not fluke that that Christ is the
son and there are 12 disciples just like

66
00:04:09,861 --> 00:04:13,010
there are 12 astrological houses and
it's not fluke that,

67
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,293
um,

68
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:18,890
the birth of Christ takes place
essentially at the same time as,

69
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,380
as,
as the shortest day of the year.

70
00:04:21,381 --> 00:04:24,860
And the rebirth of the sun.
All of these things line up.

71
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,320
Now,
whether that synchronicity or whether

72
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:32,321
it's the attempt by the collective
imagination of human beings to align

73
00:04:33,891 --> 00:04:37,850
everything under a single truth,
that's a very difficult thing to say.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,530
Or maybe there's a single truth at work.
But the idea that Christian religion is

75
00:04:42,531 --> 00:04:44,690
a parody on the worship of the sun is
not,

76
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,660
is definitely not the case.
It's more like it's incorporated

77
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:52,160
elements of the worship of the sun over
thousands and thousands of years.

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,060
And that's a very complicated issue.
If you're interested in that,

79
00:04:56,061 --> 00:05:00,020
you could read I on a I o.
N it's booked by Carl Young,

80
00:05:00,021 --> 00:05:02,270
which is like the most terrifying book
I've ever read.

81
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:06,140
And so you could,
there's a deeper analysis of the

82
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:08,510
relationship between astrological
speculation.

83
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,010
Um,
and,

84
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,010
and the emergence of complex religious
stories.

85
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,293
So

86
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,470
my brother 29 is sick at home with
burnout.

87
00:05:27,471 --> 00:05:29,230
He's a perfectionist,
has anxiety,

88
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,510
has trouble dealing with stress.
How can I help them become stronger?

89
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,430
Well,
you could encourage him to go talk to a

90
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:36,840
therapist.
You could tell him to go find broadly,

91
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,060
make an appointment with three of them.
Go talk to each one for an hour.

92
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:43,550
And if he likes one of them and he finds
when who listens,

93
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,340
then he can go back a couple more times.
But it isn't going to hurt him to go

94
00:05:46,341 --> 00:05:48,140
once,
at least to go talk.

95
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,260
Um,
it's also possible that he needs someone

96
00:05:51,261 --> 00:05:53,660
to talk to them about medication.
You know,

97
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:56,120
antidepressants,
if he's in real trouble.

98
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,490
Antidepressants often very helpful to
people,

99
00:05:58,491 --> 00:05:59,600
not always,
but often.

100
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:04,520
And so that is a lot better.
Taking an antidepressant beats the hell

101
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,870
out of being sick at home with burnout
and it's attended dangers,

102
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:11,810
cognitive dangers,
dangers of stress induced illness,

103
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,600
dangers of suicidal ideation and all
that sort of thing.

104
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:18,740
Um,
I would also recommend that he tried the

105
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:21,560
self authoring program.
If he's at home,

106
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,650
he could write about his past,
he could write about his present,

107
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:26,810
he could write about his future,
he can do a bad job,

108
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,850
he can do it over days.
I think that,

109
00:06:29,030 --> 00:06:32,300
I mean we have evidence that the program
is extremely helpful to people and

110
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:35,630
there's evidence from other researchers
that such programs really help.

111
00:06:35,631 --> 00:06:38,780
So that would,
that would be something that he could

112
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:39,111
do.
Well,

113
00:06:39,111 --> 00:06:41,630
he's sitting at home and it's not going
to hurt him.

114
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:46,370
I'm going over some of the more complex
material might make them feel slightly

115
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:48,890
worse in the short term,
but the long term payoff is very,

116
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,390
very high.
So,

117
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:55,100
um,
that's what I would recommend.

118
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,460
Encourage him to go talk to somebody he
knew and he needs to make,

119
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:00,830
the planning needs to come to terms with
what's happened to him.

120
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,730
And He needs to make a plan and he might
need to talk to somebody for a long time

121
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,160
to figure out what the hell's going on.
You know?

122
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:09,560
And we also don't want to rule out,
and neither does he,

123
00:07:09,561 --> 00:07:11,810
the possibility that there's something
physical wrong,

124
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,420
you know,
because there's increasing evidence that

125
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,930
the depressive disorders and that would
include anxiety,

126
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,690
are consequence of,
of such conditions as,

127
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,080
as generalized inflammation.
And that's really worth looking into.

128
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,610
So I think a lot of the things that we
think are psychological have a more

129
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,100
pronounced physical basis.
So.
