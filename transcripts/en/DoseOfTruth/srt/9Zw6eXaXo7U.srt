1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:09,430
So plus like crickets are
telling you this and so

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,240
they're a very reliable source.

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:13,871
Okay.

4
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:17,620
So you see the star is star
recurs as a Motif in Pinocchio.

5
00:00:17,621 --> 00:00:22,300
And one of the more interesting elements
of it here is that when Jupiter wants

6
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:25,180
to transform his puppet Marionette,

7
00:00:25,181 --> 00:00:29,140
whose being played by forces
that operate behind the scenes,

8
00:00:29,141 --> 00:00:33,190
which is really good definition of
the persona from a union perspective,

9
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:33,670
right?

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,810
And also something indicative of something
like an ideological or conceptual

11
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:38,644
possession.

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,060
Japan know who's a good guy,

13
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:44,960
he's positive father figure re lifts his,

14
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,610
even though he's a patriarchal figure,

15
00:00:46,611 --> 00:00:47,210
right?

16
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,230
And a very competent one.

17
00:00:48,231 --> 00:00:52,190
He's still even lifts his eyes up to
something that transcends his motive,

18
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:57,191
be positive as it is and wishes that
his creation would undertake the kind of

19
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:03,890
transformation that would make it
autonomous and fully functional as a moral

20
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:04,340
agent.

21
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:05,091
No strings.

22
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:05,660
Right.

23
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,950
So that's very interesting.

24
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:11,951
I think soldier Pittson said the
salvation of mankind lies only in making

25
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:13,910
everything that concern of all.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,950
That's a pretty decent star light goal,

27
00:01:17,951 --> 00:01:18,784
I would say.

28
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,090
And so what happens in the
Pinocchio story is that because,

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,050
and I think this is a
symbolic representative of
what I just described to you,

30
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:30,500
that happens at a genetic level if
you put yourself in new situations.

31
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,220
So Jupiter is roughly culture
in the Pinocchio Story,

32
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:35,461
right?

33
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:35,791
He's,

34
00:01:35,791 --> 00:01:36,750
he's a craftsman.

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:37,620
He's,

36
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,453
he's uh,

37
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,380
and he makes Pinocchio.

38
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,420
So He's,

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,860
he's who's his son,

40
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,230
he's the socializing agent and

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,350
he aims for something
above mere socialization,

42
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,290
which is I think part of the
mysterious element of human beings.

43
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:55,471
You know,

44
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:59,490
in our scientific models we'd basically
have socialization and biology,

45
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:01,200
but there's always a third element,

46
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,370
mythological stories,

47
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:07,371
which is whatever you might construe as
the spontaneous action of consciousness

48
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,700
that's associated with free will.

49
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,601
And you know,

50
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:13,210
that's just basically being
conceptualized in religious terms.

51
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:14,770
There's something akin to the soul.

52
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,101
Now,

53
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:19,360
we don't have a category for that
scientifically because what we try to do

54
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:23,590
scientifically is to reduce everything
either to socialization or to biology.

55
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,980
But it isn't clear to me that that's,

56
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:31,510
it's perfectly reasonable
from the perspective of
practicality at a scientific

57
00:02:31,511 --> 00:02:32,230
level.

58
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,470
You don't want to multiply explanatory
principles beyond necessity.

59
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,110
But there's many things that
that doesn't come to terms with,

60
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:41,890
such as the fact that we all treat each
other as autonomous beings with free

61
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:43,840
will and that that seems to work.

62
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:45,070
And that if we stopped doing that,

63
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:46,150
then things go to hell very,

64
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:46,984
very rapidly.

65
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:48,183
So,

66
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,330
and the mere fact that we have been able
to conceptualize what that conscious

67
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:53,830
freewill might be,

68
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,420
metaphysically or physically,

69
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:56,800
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

70
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,570
It just means that we don't understand it.

71
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,130
I mean what,

72
00:03:00,131 --> 00:03:04,300
it was only in the last 15 years that we
discovered that 95% of the universe was

73
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,880
made out of some kind of
matter that we can't even,

74
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:12,280
whose properties we can't even imagine
except that it seems to have mass.

75
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,680
So anyways,

76
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,810
what happens is when Japan will reach,

77
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,790
lifts his eyes up to the star.

78
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,390
So it's society aligning itself with the
proper goal with regards to individual

79
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:25,931
development,

80
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:26,141
right?

81
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:26,974
So,

82
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,670
so there instead of society being
at odds with the individual,

83
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,850
they line up and then what
happens is nature comes on board.

84
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,760
And that's the Blue Fairy
and Pinocchio Story.

85
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:40,120
And that's seems to me to be a
symbolic representation of what happens

86
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,890
biologically when,

87
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,470
when you set the goal properly,

88
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,840
get your culture behind you
and move into the world,

89
00:03:46,841 --> 00:03:51,460
is that there's a biological
transformation that
occurs as a consequence of

90
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:51,641
that,

91
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:55,960
which means that a bunch of you
that hasn't been turned on turns on.

92
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,580
And I guess one question would be is
what would you be like if you turned on

93
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:02,890
everything inside of you
that could be turned on?

94
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:03,791
Well,

95
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:04,810
that's a good goal.

96
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,370
That's a good thing to find out.

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,480
So.
