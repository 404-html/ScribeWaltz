1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:10,010
So I went through some of
the symbolism of the unknown.

2
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:14,060
I want to go through some of the
symbolism that's associated with the known

3
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:14,481
today.

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,590
So give you some sense.

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,620
Flags are definitely patriarchal symbols.

6
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:20,030
There's their cultural symbols,

7
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,200
and here's some.

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,240
I'll just lay out every variety of terms.

9
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:27,470
And so that'll give you some indication
of the network of associations that's

10
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:31,130
associated with the symbol
of the dominance hierarchy.

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,113
Fundamentally,

12
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,193
culture,

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,180
Apple Linnaean control.

14
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:36,420
That's after Apollo,

15
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:38,540
the god Super Ego,

16
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,261
the conscious,

17
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:39,750
the king,

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:40,461
the patriarch,

19
00:00:40,461 --> 00:00:41,294
the plow.

20
00:00:41,450 --> 00:00:43,100
Cause the plow opens up the earth,

21
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:47,420
the Fallis Order and authority and
the crushing weight of tradition,

22
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:50,510
the wise old man and the tyrant dogma,

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,530
the day sky,

24
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:52,311
the country man,

25
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:52,851
the island,

26
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:53,331
the heights,

27
00:00:53,331 --> 00:00:54,710
the ancestral spirits,

28
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:56,570
and the activity of the dead.

29
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,960
Now these symbolic realms
or are kind of there,

30
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:00,930
there's there

31
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,570
situationally transformable.

32
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:09,290
So if you look across cultures
very frequently in stories,

33
00:01:09,291 --> 00:01:12,440
you see characters that exemplify
each of these categories,

34
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:15,350
but the characters can
shift to some degree.

35
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,041
For example,

36
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:21,041
so often if the story involves the ocean
and an island than the ocean will be

37
00:01:21,231 --> 00:01:22,430
feminine in the island.

38
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:23,211
Will be masculine.

39
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:27,470
But if the story utilizes
an island and the air,

40
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:29,450
then the island will
be feminine in the air,

41
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:30,261
will be masculine.

42
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:35,261
So it isn't as if there's a one to one
correspondence between the entities in

43
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:40,640
the story and these
architectural categories
because their definition depends

44
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:41,240
on,

45
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,280
they can't be defined in isolation.

46
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,390
So it's,

47
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,110
it's,

48
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:47,720
it's sort of like does
this really stupid example,

49
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,370
but it's the best one I can
come up with at the moment.

50
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,560
If you're trying to interpret statistics,

51
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:55,400
you can't understand what
a given statistic means
unless you know the number of

52
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:56,480
people in the experiment,

53
00:01:56,660 --> 00:02:01,660
the effect size and the probability that
that effect size is that at emerged at

54
00:02:01,971 --> 00:02:03,380
a better than chance level.

55
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,700
Any of those pieces of information
without the other two are actually

56
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:08,534
meaningless.

57
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,520
And it's the same situation here.

58
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,430
You have to have the representation
of culture and you have to have the

59
00:02:13,431 --> 00:02:16,970
representation of nature and you have
to have the representation of the

60
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:20,180
individual and then you
can figure out what's,

61
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,910
what entities are being used
in those different categories.

62
00:02:22,911 --> 00:02:25,490
Even though there's some
similarity across stories,

63
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:28,010
which is partly why you could
actually understand stories,

64
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:28,521
right?

65
00:02:28,521 --> 00:02:30,350
Because if there was no
similarity across them,

66
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,180
then you wouldn't be
able to understand them.

67
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,913
So,

68
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,893
um,

69
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,170
there some representations
of the great father.
