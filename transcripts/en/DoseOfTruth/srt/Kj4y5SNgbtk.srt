1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:06,880
Okay,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,880
so I'm talking today with Dr. Michael
Shermer and darker Schermer is among other

3
00:00:11,921 --> 00:00:12,221
things,

4
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:13,960
the publisher of skeptic magazine,

5
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,450
but more importantly
for our purposes today,

6
00:00:16,451 --> 00:00:21,451
he is also the author of this book
New Book and were heaven on Earth.

7
00:00:22,241 --> 00:00:24,850
And we're going to talk about
this today in some detail.

8
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:27,790
And so I'm going to turn this over first
too dark to Schermer who's going to

9
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,640
tell you some things about himself and
then we're going to have a discussion.

10
00:00:30,641 --> 00:00:32,110
He's going to outline this book to them.

11
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,430
We're going to have a discussion about,

12
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:34,220
well,

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,570
why he wrote it and what it contains
and what the implications are and all of

14
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:37,871
that.

15
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,580
So over to you Michael.

16
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:41,180
Sure,

17
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,590
sure.

18
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,050
Thank you for having me on the show.

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,610
Well,

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,041
the,

21
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,890
the book is kind of an
extension of my previous work.

22
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:48,760
Most of my books,

23
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,811
when I write them,

24
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:51,790
they kind of push off
from the previous book.

25
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:53,860
So going all the way
back to my first book,

26
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:55,180
white people believe weird things,

27
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:57,870
which was about the supernatural
into paranormal and,

28
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,471
and all that.

29
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:01,420
Then then that led to how we believe,

30
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:03,010
which was white people believe in God.

31
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,210
And then if you don't believe in the
supernatural and you don't believe in a

32
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:07,631
deity,

33
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:08,560
what about morality?

34
00:01:08,561 --> 00:01:12,220
So I wrote two books on math and science
of good and evil and the moral arc last

35
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:13,054
book.

36
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,931
So then,

37
00:01:13,931 --> 00:01:14,081
you know,

38
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:16,390
kind of covering all the big subjects.

39
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,253
Uh,

40
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,050
from a skeptical scientific perspective,

41
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,060
the afterlife is obviously a huge one.

42
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,660
And I had really dealt with that too
much and my previous books and you know,

43
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,100
now that I'm in my sixties,

44
00:01:27,101 --> 00:01:28,840
I guess you could say I'm
cramming for the final

45
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,200
thinking about these big issues.

46
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,940
It's not something I obsess about it.

47
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:35,580
I'm not terrorized by death like,

48
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,100
like some people that edge they are.

49
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,210
But I think it's a super interesting
subject because it's obviously a part of

50
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,870
the human condition.

51
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,610
It's something people do think about.

52
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,060
And apparently we're the only
species that can do this.

53
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:53,680
Although I have a chapter and have
designers on animals that grieve clearly.

54
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:57,640
Quite a few mammals do grieve
and they have some sense of loss,

55
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:02,770
death and grief for fellow group
members or family members that die.

56
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:05,500
There's not clear that they
understand that their mortal.

57
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,760
Um,

58
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,271
and then like,

59
00:02:07,271 --> 00:02:07,451
you know,

60
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:12,310
I covered the possibility
that neanderthals were self
aware of their mortality

61
00:02:12,311 --> 00:02:14,440
because of grave goods
that have been found.

62
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,333
Although that's,

63
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,120
it's hard to,

64
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,420
fossil fossil fossilization of
thoughts is difficult to interpret,

65
00:02:19,421 --> 00:02:22,120
but it seems reasonable that
they had some sense of that.

66
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,080
But in any case,

67
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,973
um,

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:24,611
uh,

69
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:24,901
so I,

70
00:02:24,901 --> 00:02:26,830
I deal with the,

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,550
you know,

72
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:27,810
the,

73
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:31,150
the monotheisms versions of the afterlife,

74
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,260
Heaven and mortality,

75
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,521
a Judaism,

76
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,270
Christianity,

77
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,670
Islam mainly cause you sort of have to,

78
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,530
although mine's a science book and
those are sort of low hanging fruit that

79
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,520
atheists have already kind of picked out.

80
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,500
So I don't spend a lot of time on that.

81
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:44,581
I,

82
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:48,160
I focused more on scientific
attempts to achieve and mortality.

83
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:49,210
And it's a book of science.

84
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:52,320
So I actually start with what
doesn't seem like a scientific get,

85
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,650
but Deepak Chopra's worldview of
sort of western Buddhism that,

86
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,880
um,

87
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,670
that there is the idea birth death.

88
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,760
Um,

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,650
afterlives life before life is all
kind of meaningless because it's all

90
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:09,460
consciousness in a detox
worldview as he puts it.

91
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,120
Uh,

92
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,331
you know,

93
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,290
consciousness is the
ontological primitive free.

94
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,130
You can't get underneath it.

95
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:15,730
Uh,

96
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:15,971
you know,

97
00:03:15,971 --> 00:03:16,181
the,

98
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:20,170
the scientific attempt to explain it by
material means will always fail because

99
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:22,690
that's not where
consciousness wise anyway.

100
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,524
So I,

101
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,010
um,

102
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,880
thanks to my wife,

103
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,730
uh,

104
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:25,930
you know,

105
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,790
actually delved into his world view,

106
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,120
Deepak and I have class for 20 years
and I've called his worldview Wu and

107
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:34,520
pseudoscience and,

108
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:34,860
and,

109
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,051
and,

110
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:35,231
you know,

111
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,850
we've been kind of at odds at each other.

112
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,250
So as it changes,

113
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:38,970
I mean,

114
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,420
he sort of the main you,

115
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,000
I'd say intellectual force.

116
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:45,360
I don't think it's unreasonable to say
the main intellectual force behind the

117
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:48,120
new age movement or associated
with the new age movement.

118
00:03:48,121 --> 00:03:48,954
Is that,

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,290
yeah,

120
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,730
certainly one of the most prominent ones.

121
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,200
He's got a huge following.

122
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,820
He goes on Oprah and talks about
these things and doctor Oz or whoever,

123
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,440
and he has a lot of following.

124
00:03:59,441 --> 00:03:59,990
So,

125
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:00,823
um,

126
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,510
my wife and I actually went down to
his center that 10% are in Carlsbad,

127
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,021
California.

128
00:04:05,021 --> 00:04:05,950
And spent some time there.

129
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,240
I delved into meditation and Yoga and
the tea and the chanting and all that

130
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:11,950
stuff just to kind of
see what it's all about.

131
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,873
And uh,

132
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,240
you know,

133
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,300
I think there's something there in terms
of behavioral change that is how it

134
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:18,850
affects your body and your
mind and your thinking.

135
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,800
And I could definitely
see something to that.

136
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,163
Um,

137
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,380
but also the difficult part that deep
buck and I have had is the same problem

138
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:30,580
that most scientists have
with new age beliefs,

139
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:31,150
but not just that,

140
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,350
but,

141
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:36,350
but non western traditions that Deepak
calls the eastern wisdom traditions that

142
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,620
it's the language,

143
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,730
the difficulty of language.

144
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,290
We have to use words to communicate.

145
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,250
Um,

146
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:45,850
and the words you use
matter at some level.

147
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:49,450
You have to be able to be talking
on the same level with words.

148
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:51,340
So when Deepak says,

149
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:52,430
um,

150
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:52,600
you know,

151
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,350
the ontological primitive or
consciousness is the womb of creation.

152
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:56,501
You know,

153
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:57,040
these,

154
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,520
it sounds sort of metaphorical and he
means something very specific by that.

155
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,930
If you can't get at that,

156
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:03,940
then you're wasting your time talking.

157
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,660
So,

158
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,160
um,

159
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,050
tee buck and I had kind
of become friends and we,

160
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:07,270
you know,

161
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,020
we're constantly communicating just to
try to see if we can find some ground

162
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:13,870
where we're talking on the same plane.

163
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,020
And so I think I've,

164
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:15,670
uh,

165
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,760
learned a lot from him in that,

166
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,501
in that sense.

167
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:22,060
And so my chapters devoted to him on
that and the general eastern wisdom

168
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:22,691
traditions,

169
00:05:22,691 --> 00:05:23,860
you know that when you die,

170
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,200
cause I always ask them what,

171
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:25,780
where do you go?

172
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,170
And he said,

173
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:27,460
at least it's this the wrong question.

174
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:29,320
I mean you just returned
to where you were before.

175
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:30,111
You know,

176
00:05:30,111 --> 00:05:31,120
cause when people ask me,

177
00:05:31,121 --> 00:05:32,800
well what do you think
happens after you die?

178
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,740
My standard kind of
quip is the same thing.

179
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,870
You go to the same place you
worked before you were born.

180
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,340
I'll say,

181
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,151
what are you talking about?

182
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:41,830
I wasn't anywhere before I was born.

183
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,370
Right?

184
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,780
And you'll be nowhere after you die.

185
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,170
But for depo time and consciousness kinda
overrides the concept of time at the

186
00:05:49,781 --> 00:05:54,781
beginning and an end by your consciousness
just returns to where it was and that

187
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:57,010
the physical body and brain,

188
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:01,430
just a temporary instantiation of
consciousness into physical being.

189
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:03,800
But it just goes back to some other place.

190
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,600
And then there's like a figure.

191
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:08,420
We don't have the words to even
conceive of what that means.

192
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,091
Uh,

193
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:13,580
that is the western language and the
way scientists talk that can't really

194
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,400
capture what he's talking
about it in that sense.

195
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:19,260
And so that's why I
think we kind of hit a,

196
00:06:19,261 --> 00:06:24,261
an epistemological wall there where you
have to actually get into introspection,

197
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,370
meditation,

198
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:30,320
and the deeper parts of that tradition
that I've never been able to really get

199
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,160
into personally.

200
00:06:31,161 --> 00:06:33,020
So I can't say I understand it,

201
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,950
although I kind of see where
he's coming from in that regard.
