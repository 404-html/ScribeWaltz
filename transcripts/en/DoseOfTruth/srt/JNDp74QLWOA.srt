1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,360
Freaking says fans,

2
00:00:09,361 --> 00:00:11,700
our chancellor for the
authentic individual.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,553
Well

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,471
that's a tough one.

5
00:00:16,471 --> 00:00:16,831
You know,

6
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:17,664
I mean,

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,200
cancer know that.

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:20,093
That's too,

9
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:22,440
that's too dramatic.

10
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,730
I guess that what you're pointing
out is the danger of saying,

11
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:28,680
and I can certainly appreciate that.

12
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:30,990
I can't say that I'm
particularly comfortable with it,

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,260
which might seem to be rather
hypocritical as it isn't.

14
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:39,030
Like I've shied away from
exposing my views in public.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,033
Um,

16
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,190
but I felt that I was driven to that
by necessity and also by my desire to

17
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,120
educate people.

18
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:45,954
Um,

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,621
however,

20
00:00:46,621 --> 00:00:49,830
I would say despite the fact that
I'm somewhat uncomfortable with it,

21
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,980
I think that's mostly because
of the responsibility.

22
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:53,610
You know what,

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,400
I've been terrified for a whole
year that I'd say something,

24
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:56,890
you know,

25
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,380
unforgivably stupid and,

26
00:00:58,770 --> 00:00:59,603
you know,

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,400
demolish myself in public and,

28
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:02,880
and,

29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,150
you know,

30
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,640
feel guilty and horrible about
that for the rest of my life.

31
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,790
And so far it'd be fortunate
there's been some close calls,

32
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,780
but I've been fortunate.

33
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,040
But you know,

34
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,810
now when I go places,

35
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,310
people often recognize me.

36
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,560
Even at this little town
we went up to this weekend,

37
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:19,470
there were two people that came up to me
in the parking lot and we're excited to

38
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:19,831
meet me.

39
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,760
And you know,

40
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,770
the vast majority of encounters,

41
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:26,550
all of the encounters I have with
people in public and have been really

42
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,181
wonderful.

43
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:31,110
I have to say that the people have
been extremely friendly and you know,

44
00:01:31,111 --> 00:01:32,730
sometimes they're a bit star struck,

45
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,350
which I find strange.

46
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,820
I can see the projection,

47
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:36,061
you know,

48
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:36,894
so it's,

49
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,310
it's unsettling for me,

50
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,850
although I'm not judging anybody for it.

51
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,510
Um,

52
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:44,460
it's just a strange thing to observe.

53
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:45,893
Um,

54
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,380
but you know,

55
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,580
I can't complain about
the fact that people are,

56
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,181
are,

57
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:52,014
uh,

58
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,913
are,

59
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,710
are positively predisposed
to what I'm doing.

60
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,160
I mean,

61
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,210
it's such a privilege.

62
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:00,330
I can't imagine what it would
be like to be hated publicly.

63
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,770
I think that would just kill me.

64
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,760
I really think that.

65
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,570
But,

66
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,403
um,

67
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,780
so I mean it's,

68
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:07,320
it's,

69
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,740
I suppose there's the possibility of
having that sort of thing go to your head

70
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:12,040
and it's it,

71
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,680
and I mean that happens to people,

72
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,930
but I think I've said this before,

73
00:02:15,931 --> 00:02:16,950
maybe on the Q and A's.

74
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:19,800
I have a pretty sensible
family and I have a pretty,

75
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,173
um,

76
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:22,763
what would you say?

77
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,470
Yeah,

78
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,250
I have a pretty good
sense of my limitations.

79
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:27,960
So I would say,

80
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,580
um,

81
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:28,911
let's,

82
00:02:28,911 --> 00:02:33,911
we could even call it an acute sense
and so I'm not particularly worried that

83
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,270
this is going to go to my head
in some way that that would

84
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:41,343
no

85
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,700
inflate my ego or something like that.

86
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:44,534
Huh.

87
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:44,960
I mean,

88
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:48,620
I think one of the things I have noticed
is that I might be little less patient

89
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,060
with people when I'm speaking,

90
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,283
um,

91
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,100
because I'm more used to that,

92
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,460
more use to that might be good for me
to be listened to and so I have to watch

93
00:02:58,461 --> 00:02:58,731
that.

94
00:02:58,731 --> 00:02:59,380
But I'm pretty,

95
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,800
I've always been pretty noisy and
talkative and so that's probably something

96
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:07,300
that's plagued me or being
a characteristic of me ever
since I was a little tiny

97
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:07,720
kid.

98
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,553
I mean,

99
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,200
I used to talk all the
time when I was a little,

100
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,400
little,

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,210
little guy.

102
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:13,541
I mean,

103
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,200
I think my cousin Eric Pony,

104
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,900
he probably listens to this.

105
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,240
He used to call the motor
mouth and that was the boat.

106
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:19,961
Exactly right.

107
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:21,700
I was like a miniature Camille Paglia.

108
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:22,863
So,

109
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,793
um,

110
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,491
anyways,

111
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:26,110
I can't complain about having,

112
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:26,711
let's say,

113
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,544
fans I,

114
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,500
people have been unbelievably good to be,

115
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,690
and I'm really grateful for that.

116
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:32,524
So,

117
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,030
um.
