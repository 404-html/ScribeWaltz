1
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,580
So let's talk about Rogers for a minute.

2
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,300
He was a devout fundamentalist Protestant.

3
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,700
And I think that's important to know
because a lot of his thinking has a very

4
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:25,360
strong Protestant flavor.

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,900
I mean,

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,890
the reason I concentrate on such things
and the philosophical background,

7
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:31,700
if these thinkers,

8
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,510
because you have to understand the axioms,

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,030
the safer that you're dealing with dirt,

10
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,980
you actually don't understand them at all.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,250
And when you're assessing the
axiomatic presuppositions of the paper,

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:44,690
you're usually outside the
thinkers thought in some sense,

13
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:44,961
right?

14
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:46,400
Because you're looking at axioms,

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:48,920
but you don't get it unless you,

16
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,280
unless you know the accident.

17
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,340
And so Carl Rogers thought was
deeply grounded in his Protestantism,

18
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:56,174
but it's,

19
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,410
his father in particular was a scientific
farmer and applied the scientific

20
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:02,120
method on the farm that he grew up in.

21
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:07,510
And so Rogers had a devout fundamentalist
background of the sort that was more

22
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:15,200
typical in the thirties and the
forties but he also had us powerful,

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,713
uh,

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,250
understanding of the scientific method
and practical observations of its

25
00:01:22,251 --> 00:01:23,084
utility.

26
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,433
So

27
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:27,581
he,

28
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:31,660
his first academic training was at the
Union theological seminary seminary.

29
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:32,494
In the mission of,

30
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,700
of that seminary was to evangelize
the world in their generation.

31
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,380
If I remember correctly,

32
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:43,960
was when he was on a boat to China to
serve as a missionary that he first

33
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:46,990
started to question the
absolute reality of his,

34
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,930
of his Protestant beliefs.

35
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,340
It isn't that he abandoned particularly,

36
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:59,460
it's that he incorporated them into a
approach to psychotherapy that fulfilled

37
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:05,110
all the preconditions for this.

38
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:07,670
There's a,

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:11,560
there's this striving towards a kind of
interpersonal perfection that goes along

40
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,580
with Protestantism.

41
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,380
There's an idea that the most important
realization of the most fundamental

42
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:25,531
reality is to be had in direct and
honest communication between two people

43
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:30,363
and

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,550
two or more people.

45
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,550
That's a place where you might say,

46
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:38,110
if you're thinking about it symbolically,

47
00:02:38,111 --> 00:02:43,111
that the living word emerges
and Roger's thinking is deeply,

48
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:45,850
deeply rooted in that kind of conception.

49
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,110
And it's,

50
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:51,340
it's partly that he believed that if
you could integrate yourself properly,

51
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:56,260
if you could put yourself together in
some sense at every level of analysis,

52
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:58,900
then you'd be able to exist,

53
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,730
communicate in a way that was,

54
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,890
there's a Ph Eddie,

55
00:03:01,891 --> 00:03:04,840
and for to this that was
optimally beneficial to you,

56
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,290
but also optimally beneficial to
other people at the same time.

57
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:13,320
And a lot of that would emerge in
your interactions with each other in

58
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,230
communication.
