00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,180
I constantly cannot verbalize my
thoughts,

2
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:12,600
written and focal regardless of topic
and my level of knowledge.

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:17,010
Tips for verbalizing,
thoughts to get them into writing and

4
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:18,180
therefore speech.
Well,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,380
what I would say Lauren is do this like
read something,

6
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,790
put a decide,
try to summarize it in writing and talk

7
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:31,650
while you're doing it.
And then write down what you say and

8
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,890
don't edit while you're doing that.
See what are the problems that people

9
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:38,700
have when they're trying to write is
they try to write a good sentence.

10
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:42,750
They not only tried to write a sentence,
but they try to write a good sentence

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,510
and you can't do that.
You have to write a sentence that's hard

12
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:50,511
enough and then you have to edit it.
So allow yourself to write badly.

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,790
I'm dead serious about this.
Like write a bad,

14
00:00:53,791 --> 00:00:57,630
bad,
bad first draft and then edit it if you

15
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:59,130
get rid of 70% of it.

16
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:01,350
So what?
That's exactly what should happen.

17
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,540
So like if you want to write a thousand
word essay,

18
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,700
you should start by writing a really bad
2000 word essay and then you should get

19
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:11,460
rid of the worst 50% you can do that
iteratively.

20
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:14,050
I have a document online.
It's,

21
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:16,020
it's,
if you go to my website,

22
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:20,550
under courses,
there's psychology for 30 is the course.

23
00:01:20,551 --> 00:01:24,240
I should make this more public.
But under cycle psychology for 30,

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:28,560
there's a template for writing.
And if you went and looked at that

25
00:01:28,561 --> 00:01:31,320
template,
it tells you it answers your question.

26
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:34,590
I,
I produced this little guide book for,

27
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,310
for writing that will help.
And if you write enough,

28
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,660
you'll learn to speak.
The other thing I would say too is that

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,490
it might be anxiety that's doing,
you might think about joining a club

30
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,420
like toastmasters or maybe if you're a
university student to public speaking,

31
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:54,060
uh,
something where you'd get in front of

32
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:56,100
people.
And then when you're in front of people,

33
00:01:56,101 --> 00:01:58,620
don't talk to the group,
talked to the individuals within the

34
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:02,970
group and let yourself be bad at it.
You'll get better as you practice.
