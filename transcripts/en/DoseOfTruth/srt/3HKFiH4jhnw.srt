1
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,050
Dr. Peterson,
I'm really hoping you can share your

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,310
thoughts on the day.
Just shooting.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,960
Yeah.
Well,

4
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:20,110
what I would do is recommend the
biblical lecture I did on Cain and Abel,

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,370
I would say,
because I think that that's a good

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,290
summary of the state of mind that
somebody has to be in in order to do

7
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:32,070
what was done at Los Vegas.
So you have to be very,

8
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,970
very embittered by life in order to do
that sort of thing.

9
00:00:35,971 --> 00:00:38,820
And you have to be searching for
revenge,

10
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,470
I would say.
And it's not,

11
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,430
you know,
you might think,

12
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:43,710
well,
it's only revenge on other people

13
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,780
because you've developed hatred for
people,

14
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,960
but it's deeper than that.
It's not just hatred for people.

15
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,570
I would say it's hatred for being itself
and,

16
00:00:52,571 --> 00:00:57,270
and the desire to take revenge on being
for the outrage of the tragedy and

17
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:00,140
suffering that's associated with being,
um,

18
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,960
and maybe the tragedy and suffering
that's being part and parcel of your own

19
00:01:03,961 --> 00:01:04,670
life.

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,980
And that makes you embittered.
And then past embittered becomes

21
00:01:07,981 --> 00:01:12,300
outraged and past outrage becomes well
homicidal or even genocidal.

22
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,480
And that's a terrible state of mind to
begin.

23
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,670
It's a hellish state.
Um,

24
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,100
I believe that the best way to
conceptualize the state of mind that

25
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:26,310
someone has to be at in order to do
something like the Columbine shootings

26
00:01:26,311 --> 00:01:28,830
for example,
or what happened in Las Vegas is that

27
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,020
you're really an,
now you have to speak about it and

28
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:33,540
religious languages.
You're really out for revenge against

29
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:35,460
God,
for the outrage of creation.

30
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:39,960
That's what it looks like to me.
And that's a state of mind that's truly

31
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:42,720
hellish and you could get there by
broody long enough.

32
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,200
Now it's also possible,
I mean this guy didn't have any previous

33
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:48,510
history,
criminal history or anything like that

34
00:01:48,511 --> 00:01:50,160
and he's pretty old.
So you know,

35
00:01:50,161 --> 00:01:55,020
there's also also also the possibility
of some kind of neurological pathology

36
00:01:55,021 --> 00:01:57,600
that that might be characteristic of
him.

37
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,180
You know,
some degenerative neurological disease.

38
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:04,290
There was a kid years ago at the
University of Texas at Austin who

39
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,070
climbed up on the tower there and shot a
number of people with a high powered

40
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:13,071
rifle and he had a fast growing tumor on
his hypothalamus and had reported like

41
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:16,950
these being overcome with extreme
feelings of rage.

42
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:21,951
And so that's another possibility.
But I would say the,

43
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,830
uh,
embitterment hypothesis is the strongest

44
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,600
one.
I would also say too,

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,510
I noticed the Steven Pinker tweeted this
today,

46
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:34,020
is that one of the ways of controlling
this sort of thing would be for the

47
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:37,650
press to agree,
not for there to be a blanket agreement,

48
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,680
not to publicize the name or any other
identity markers of the people who do

49
00:02:42,781 --> 00:02:46,290
the shooting.
Because there's also this really,

50
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,630
what would you call it?
Arrogance.

51
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,990
It's a kind of arrogance and pride last
ditch,

52
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:56,910
arrogance and pride that that is
associated with the fantasies that drive

53
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:57,930
this sort of behavior.

54
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:00,430
And the fantasy is like,
well,

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,340
after I do this,
everyone will sure know the who,

56
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:04,960
who the hell I was.
You know,

57
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:08,710
even though maybe I was ignored or
unhappy when I was alive after I'm dead,

58
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:12,010
everybody's going to know who I was and
what idea did you know?

59
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,130
So there's this underground desire for
fame,

60
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,030
I guess it's notoriety,
but notoriety might be preferable to

61
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,890
being ignored.
And so,

62
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,230
you know,
there's a lot of talk about gun control

63
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,990
and that's understandable,
especially with regards to automatic

64
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:27,390
rifles.
Um,

65
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,920
although I also understand why the
people who are gun owners are afraid of,

66
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,090
of,
of,

67
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,850
um,
allowing what they regard as one of

68
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:39,010
their fundamental rights to be infringed
upon.

69
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:44,650
But it would certainly be useful if we
stop giving people who do this sort of

70
00:03:44,651 --> 00:03:47,440
thing,
not $100 million worth of free publicity

71
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,170
and all the notoriety they can manage.
So,

72
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,910
you know,
that's another way of thinking about

73
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:53,530
controlling it.
So

74
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,950
yeah,

75
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,430
one of the things you'll see if,
if,

76
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:58,890
if you're interested in this sort of
thing,

77
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,750
if you ever go read the writings of,
of the Columbine killers that the teens,

78
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,900
they're very interesting.
They're very much worth reading,

79
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:10,020
especially I think it's Dylan Klebold
who was the more literate of the,

80
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:12,850
of the two.
But he tells you exactly where he went

81
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:16,410
after brooding and brooding and brooding
on his,

82
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,680
his isolation and segregation from
mankind.

83
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,790
So he's out there beyond,
he's out there in a chaotic domain and

84
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:27,090
because he's tortured by that,
his thoughts taken unbelievably dark

85
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:29,550
turn,
like it's unimaginably dark.

86
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,740
Um,
if you're interested in that sort of

87
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:32,580
thing,
you could read that.

88
00:04:32,581 --> 00:04:34,860
There's another book you could read
called Pans,

89
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:35,730
Ram,
p,

90
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:36,271
a,
N,

91
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:37,200
zed,
r,

92
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:37,950
a,
m.

93
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:41,280
And it's a fascinating book.
It's about this guy who I think he raped

94
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,190
1200 men.
So that sort of tells you what sort of

95
00:04:44,191 --> 00:04:48,840
guy he was extraordinarily physically
powerful and brutal and malevolent.

96
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,800
And he was kind of a juvenile delinquent
type and they put them in a reform

97
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:55,860
school and he was not well treated it.
Now in reform school,

98
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,920
it's sorta like the worst of the
Canadian residential schools.

99
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,160
And when he came out,
he was not a happy boy.

100
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,720
And so he spent the rest of his life
trying to be as destructive as he could

101
00:05:06,721 --> 00:05:11,310
possibly imagine and purely consciously
with malevolent intent.

102
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,120
And then,
and,

103
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,120
and believe me,
he was pretty destructive.

104
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:17,880
He kept track of the dollar value of all
the buildings he burned down.

105
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,550
He tried to start a war between Britain
and the United States.

106
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:23,300
Like he was an all out for all out may
ham,

107
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,860
his dying words,
they are going to hang him.

108
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,620
Um,
he told the guy who was going to hang

109
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,610
them too.
He said,

110
00:05:29,611 --> 00:05:33,060
hurry up you who's your bastard?
I could kill 12 man in the time it takes

111
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:33,894
you to hang me.

112
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,330
And that's exactly the sort of person he
was.

113
00:05:36,331 --> 00:05:39,420
And he made friends with this physician
in the,

114
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:43,290
in the prison who he thought was like
the first person who ever did something

115
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:45,630
nice for them,
gave them a dollar for cigarettes if I

116
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:48,090
remember correctly.
And the physician encouraged him to

117
00:05:48,091 --> 00:05:50,310
write his autobiography.
And so we did.

118
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:53,910
And it's available.
And so if you want a view,

119
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,370
because you know you,
you always think of people,

120
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,760
you think well people have good
intentions,

121
00:05:58,761 --> 00:06:01,970
you know that you specially things out
if you're naive and agreeable.

122
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,210
So all of you who are sitting there out
there thinking people have good

123
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:07,490
intentions,
you're probably high in agreeableness,

124
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,910
but that's not always the case.
People can have very dark motivations

125
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,210
that are fully conscious and very well
elaborated and pans around was no,

126
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:22,280
he was smart and his book is very well
written and he tells you exactly why he

127
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,420
thought the way he thought.

128
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,590
And so it's a good glimpse of exactly
this sort of thing where you can get to

129
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,650
if you want to buy brooding on your
specific misfortune.

130
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:31,843
You know,
in his,

131
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:35,300
his basic credo was that human beings
were so reprehensible that they should

132
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:38,540
just be eliminated and believe me,
that's what he was trying to do.

133
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,380
And these people who do terrible things
like the Columbine shooters,

134
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,990
that's exactly what,
for lack of a better word,

135
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:47,570
they're possessed by it's sheer
malevolence.

136
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,160
And the Columbine kids had a much more
spectacular catastrophe plan than the

137
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:55,130
one that actually occur.
And they knew it was going to be a full

138
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:58,350
blown media circus.
And lots of these people who engage in

139
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:02,180
these sorts of mass murders,
they know about the other mass murderers

140
00:07:02,181 --> 00:07:05,450
and they're engaged in a competition.
And the competition is who can do the

141
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,820
most brutal thing the fastest,
something like that.

142
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:10,780
So you can't just be thinking about
people who've,

143
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,340
you know,
who have good intentions,

144
00:07:13,341 --> 00:07:16,760
but if somehow gone wrong,
if you ever meet someone who isn't like

145
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:20,960
that and you think that you're just a
tree with ripe fruit to be plucked.
