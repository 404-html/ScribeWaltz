1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,550
And I think that's part of the reason
why human beings can be so infinitely

2
00:00:03,551 --> 00:00:04,151
creative,

3
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:04,391
right?

4
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:04,751
For us,

5
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:05,830
the world isn't fixed.

6
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:07,870
We never know what it's
going to bring forth.

7
00:00:07,871 --> 00:00:09,400
So 100 years ago,

8
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,630
if someone would have said,

9
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:11,464
well,

10
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:14,680
you could build a machine on a wafer,

11
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,380
a centimeter square out of sand,

12
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:20,740
and if you have enough of those machines,

13
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:22,510
than everyone in the
world can be connected.

14
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,050
And everyone in the world can have an
infinite library of verbal material,

15
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:26,680
right?

16
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,491
That's impossible.

17
00:00:27,491 --> 00:00:28,720
But it's not impossible.

18
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:33,721
It turns out that Silica has those
properties and we can build unbelievably

19
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:37,240
powerful machines out of nothing.

20
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,630
And so then that kind of makes
you think about just what this.

21
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:43,120
Nothing that we're building
things out of his right,

22
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:48,121
because it seems to be able to reveal
a constant array of properties.

23
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,140
Properties that are essentially unlimited
and its capacity to reveal those

24
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:57,070
properties seems to depend as much
on our ability to interact with it.

25
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:58,090
Whatever that is,

26
00:00:58,330 --> 00:01:02,080
as it does on whatever the stuff is.

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:09,030
And we know even from a strict object
perception of the world that the stuff

28
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:12,690
that things are made of is a lot more
complicated than we had originally

29
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:13,111
presumed,

30
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:17,610
even as materialists because
materialists realists,

31
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,000
there are philosophy only holds down to
about the subatomic level of analysis.

32
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,720
Deterministic worldview below
the subatomic level of analysis.

33
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,560
There's nothing deterministic at all and
the stuff that things are made of is so

34
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:32,760
mysterious that we can't even.

35
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:33,571
We can't grasp,

36
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,770
but we can't comprehend it.

37
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,220
So it turns out that rather than the
story world be being dependent on the

38
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:42,241
object world,

39
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,410
it might be the other way around.

40
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:47,190
The object world is dependent on the
story world and that implies at least to

41
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,620
some degree that the story
world is actually more real.

42
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,180
Whatever that means.

43
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,070
And then I told you that,

44
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,150
well,

45
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,980
the real problem of life isn't so much
what do you do when you're around things

46
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:00,780
that you understand?

47
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:04,470
The real problem of life is what do
you do when you encounter something you

48
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:06,480
can't conceptualize?

49
00:02:06,481 --> 00:02:10,290
And I think a good recent example of
that was the bombing of the world trade

50
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:10,681
towers,

51
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:14,940
which people were compelled to watch
over and over and over and over.

52
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,650
And if you ask someone,

53
00:02:16,651 --> 00:02:18,150
well what is it that you're watching?

54
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:18,901
They would say,

55
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:19,081
well,

56
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,840
I'm watching the world
trade towers fall down,

57
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,190
but then you might say,

58
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:24,600
well why are you watching
it over and over?

59
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,620
And they would say something like,

60
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:25,980
well,

61
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,150
I can't believe it.

62
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,340
I can't believe it's happening.

63
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,390
And what does that mean?

64
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,440
It means something like whatever
it is that's happening here,

65
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:38,340
whatever's being blown apart
exceeds my ability to model.

66
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:41,880
And as a consequence I have to expose
myself to it again and again and again and

67
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:44,460
again to try to understand what's falling,

68
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,080
what's falling exactly.

69
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:46,914
Is it just the.

70
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,230
Is it just the Towers is at 20,000 people?

71
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,750
Is that the financial system of the u?

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,990
S is the stability of the Western world
is at the beginning of world war three

73
00:02:54,991 --> 00:02:58,980
or as the former CIA director
just mentioned in the u,

74
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,890
the beginning of World War for what
is it exactly that you're looking at?

75
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,840
When something happens
that you don't understand

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,481
and then you'll say,

77
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:10,601
well,

78
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,800
how do you react to that?

79
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,430
And it turns out that you
react mostly with your body,

80
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,540
not with your mind,

81
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,070
not with your perceptual systems,

82
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:18,940
not with your thoughts,

83
00:03:18,941 --> 00:03:20,860
but with your emotions and your body,

84
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:25,630
and that means you sweat and you panic
and you feel depressed and you feel hurt

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,610
and you feel ashamed and you're prepared
for a catastrophe which is stress and

86
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:32,430
all that basically noncognitive.

87
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,730
And what that means is that when you
encounter something you don't understand,

88
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:41,731
the first manner in which you
conceive of it is embodied emotional,

89
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,540
physical way.

90
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:47,170
Before you develop up an
object representation or
cognitive representation,

91
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:51,490
you may not ever get it like an event
like that or a worse event can throw

92
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:55,960
someone into a tailspin that's so
extreme that they never get out of it.

93
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:56,501
So you see,

94
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,101
for example,

95
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:57,701
sometimes,

96
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:59,740
and this is more true
among elderly people,

97
00:03:59,741 --> 00:04:01,060
if their spouse dies,

98
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:03,540
the probability that they'll
die in the next year,

99
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,380
say from a heart attack
or something like that,

100
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,910
increases substantially.

101
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,290
Why is that?

102
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:13,410
It's because they're conceptual frame was
so dependent on the existence of their

103
00:04:15,251 --> 00:04:15,731
spouse.

104
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:20,731
Say someone they've lived with for 25
years that the anxiety and uncertainty

105
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,980
caused by their anomalous disappearance
there death is so extreme that it sends

106
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:30,400
their body into a physiological state
that's basically unbearable and that does

107
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,060
the men,

108
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,060
and when you start to understand what
having your preconceptions rattled really

109
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:36,521
means,

110
00:04:36,521 --> 00:04:41,521
then you also start to understand why
people are so motivated to protect their

111
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,780
ideological territory,

112
00:04:43,781 --> 00:04:44,030
right?

113
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,220
Because ideological territory,

114
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:46,570
that's how you see the world.

115
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:51,600
That's your story and you can't have
your fundaments rattled all the time

116
00:04:51,851 --> 00:04:55,660
because it throws everything into chaos
and that puts you in this terrible,

117
00:04:55,661 --> 00:05:00,661
panicky cortisol written stressful state
that's really hard on you physically.

118
00:05:01,241 --> 00:05:01,751
So we know,

119
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,351
for example,

120
00:05:02,351 --> 00:05:05,950
that if you're in a state where you're
chronically exposed to threat or

121
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:06,491
punishment,

122
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:07,930
which is the case in depression,

123
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,090
say you produce a lot of cortisol,

124
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,940
which is a stress hormone
and cortisol is toxic,

125
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,270
so the more of it you produce,

126
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:17,980
the more you kill off your hippocampal
cells and you really need them because

127
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:19,060
they are key to memory.

128
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,210
You do in your immunological system.

129
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,000
There's all sorts of negative side
effects of cortisol poisoning,

130
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:27,460
increased incidents of
cardiovascular disease,

131
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:28,690
heightened grade IV cancer,

132
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:30,400
plus it's just no fun,

133
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:30,671
right?

134
00:05:30,671 --> 00:05:33,550
It's the worst thing that can
possibly happen to you essentially.

135
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,180
If something I know it happens to
you in blows your frame of reference,

136
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:37,361
right,

137
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:38,440
knocks you for a loop,

138
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,730
sends you to the underworld,

139
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,410
however you want to construe it,

140
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,630
that's really going to upset
your bandwagon and throw
you into a state that you

141
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:48,220
do virtually anything to avoid.

142
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,870
But by the same token,

143
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:53,290
there is a possibility that
inside that chaotic mess,

144
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,090
there's something you really need.

145
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,800
And what's the logic there?

146
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:57,741
Well,

147
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:59,180
the logic is something like this.

148
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,350
When you look at the world,

149
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,070
you only see a fragment of it and that's
good because it's pretty overwhelming

150
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,080
and a fragments generally
more than enough,

151
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:11,240
but all the information that you've ever
gathered in your entire life to build

152
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:15,470
yourself out of and to make your life
stable has come as a consequence of your

153
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:18,350
ability to explore what
you don't understand,

154
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,050
and that's an unlimited capacity,

155
00:06:21,051 --> 00:06:21,260
right?

156
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,030
No matter how much you explored,

157
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:24,710
how much information you gather,

158
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,490
there's always the possibility that
there's way more information out there and

159
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,880
that means if you have a problem
and you see that it's a problem,

160
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,230
even though that's frightening,

161
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:38,500
it's also a gateway into a domain of
possibility and the possibility is this

162
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:42,920
richly informative background that
could in principle provide you with any

163
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:46,640
answer you need and then
you can take one more thing.

164
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,500
And the old Gods,

165
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,830
Mars say the God of war,

166
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,371
Venus,

167
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,204
the god of love,

168
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,700
they're all internalized for us,

169
00:06:55,701 --> 00:06:56,534
right?

170
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,620
We know that anger is the psychological
state and that love is the psychological

171
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:01,454
state,

172
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,100
but if we look at our
great religious traditions,

173
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,040
Christianity say or Buddhism,

174
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,930
just to take two as an example,

175
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:14,000
we still have this notion that what
these figures represent is something

176
00:07:14,001 --> 00:07:14,860
external.

177
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,041
Well,

178
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,690
you might say how primitive,

179
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,423
right?

180
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,420
Just as primitive as the idea that
the god of war is something external,

181
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,830
is the idea that this sort of figure,

182
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:26,570
it's supposed to be something external.

183
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,510
It's supposed to be something embodied,

184
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,350
right?

185
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,700
It's a story about the nature of
individual moral responsibility.

186
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,910
So the idea is something like this,

187
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,744
well,

188
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,880
reality itself,

189
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:45,940
the existence of things seems to depend
on the existence of a finite observer so

190
00:07:46,761 --> 00:07:48,620
that we can see things from a perspective.

191
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,330
If you don't see things
from a perspective,

192
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,530
everything is the same.

193
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:53,180
There's nothing delineated,

194
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,360
but if there's going to
be delineated things,

195
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:57,620
small things,

196
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,520
insufficient things,

197
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:02,420
and they're going to be aware they're
going to be vulnerable as a part of their

198
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:03,920
limitation.

199
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,701
And so you say,

200
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,534
well,

201
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,130
limitation is a precondition for being
and that means suffering is part and

202
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,090
parcel of being.

203
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:16,751
Dostoevsky.

204
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:17,584
Said clearly,

205
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,423
look,

206
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,110
I give you all the cake you want,

207
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,490
you got a big house,

208
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,600
you got nothing to do,

209
00:08:22,601 --> 00:08:23,770
but watch TV,

210
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,191
right?

211
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:25,870
And propagate the species.

212
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:26,920
Are you happy?

213
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,330
And Dostoevsky says,

214
00:08:28,331 --> 00:08:28,481
well,

215
00:08:28,481 --> 00:08:28,781
no.

216
00:08:28,781 --> 00:08:29,440
Why?

217
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:29,651
Well,

218
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:32,260
because human beings are
really fundamentally,

219
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,570
you're ungrateful and insane.

220
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:38,590
So if you give them some
little comfortable niche to
occupy themselves with so

221
00:08:38,591 --> 00:08:39,730
they don't have anything to worry about.

222
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,020
The first thing they're gonna do,

223
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:44,140
just like Adam and eve basically
are just like Gautama Buddha.

224
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,410
They're going to run around
looking for the apple,

225
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,580
looking for the snake,

226
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,580
looking for the trouble to
smash the frame into bits,

227
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:52,900
no matter how comfortable it is,

228
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:56,700
just so they can get access
to little and have some fun.

229
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:57,751
And so then you think,

230
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:01,740
well maybe it's more like the purpose
of life isn't to avoid chaos because we

231
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,400
like chaos.

232
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,151
It's entertaining,

233
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:03,361
right?

234
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:07,170
It keeps us alert and awake and it gives
us something to do that really has no

235
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:07,830
end.

236
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,990
And so maybe the answer
is something more like,

237
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:10,711
well,

238
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:12,210
forget the frame of reference,

239
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,500
forget the chaos,

240
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:16,200
but hit the balance right between the two.

241
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:16,561
Right?

242
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:20,160
So that you've got one foot where it's
reasonably comfortable and you got one

243
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:23,550
foot out there where it's kind of
exciting and dangerous and that's perfect,

244
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:28,260
and then you think the state you want to
attain that makes you resistant to even

245
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,550
the greatest anomalies.

246
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,780
Anomalies of death,

247
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:30,991
say,

248
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,510
or vulnerability or mortality is exactly.

249
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,520
That's that position,

250
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:39,900
right balance straight between the forces
of chaos and the forces of order or

251
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,080
between Yin and Yang and how do you
know you're there because that's what it

252
00:09:45,211 --> 00:09:46,110
really boils down to.

253
00:09:46,111 --> 00:09:48,360
How do you know that you're
there and then you think,

254
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:48,661
okay,

255
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:49,500
it's pretty simple.

256
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,650
You Watch with your eyes open,

257
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,460
just like Solzhenitsyn Watch.

258
00:09:55,461 --> 00:09:57,250
Do you think I don't know everything,

259
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,750
so let's see what I do.

260
00:09:58,751 --> 00:09:59,410
No,

261
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,510
no preconceptions.

262
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:05,170
I'm not going to shield myself from the
truth with some second rate frame of

263
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:05,621
reference.

264
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:08,590
We don't believe in those anyways
because they're always fragmental.

265
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,760
I'm just going to watch.

266
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,100
So when am I not miserable?

267
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:12,941
And then you think,

268
00:10:12,941 --> 00:10:13,181
wow,

269
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:15,060
I'm not miserable when
I'm interested in things.

270
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,390
Something I get interested in,

271
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:19,700
something I don't exactly know
why I get interested in it.

272
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:20,980
It catches me.

273
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:25,873
What are the,

274
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,040
what's the phenomenology of being caught,

275
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,600
are not self conscious.

276
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:31,220
When I'm engaged in something,

277
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,270
I'm more like a child,

278
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:36,050
which is why children have
intimations of immortality.

279
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:38,330
I mean engaged in this process.

280
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,980
I don't think about myself,

281
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:41,600
so I'm not self conscious.

282
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,440
I lose my sense of temporality because
it seems like I can do whatever it is

283
00:10:45,441 --> 00:10:50,270
that I'm doing thing that I enjoy for
hours and the time flies by and I'm not

284
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:54,200
even really aware of the surrounding
world and none of my existential concerns

285
00:10:54,201 --> 00:10:56,330
are paramount at that time.

286
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:00,350
Every need is suppressed by
my engagement in the activity.

287
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,730
And then you say to yourself,

288
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:01,971
well,

289
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:02,241
yeah,

290
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,020
I find that only happens like you know,

291
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,670
10 minutes every three days or something
when I'm being particularly miserable.

292
00:11:07,671 --> 00:11:08,630
But you might say,

293
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:08,841
well,

294
00:11:08,841 --> 00:11:11,690
the fact that it happens at all is
probably worth paying attention to.

295
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,600
I mean if you believe that
your experience is real,

296
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,710
like real,

297
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,170
the fact that you can get
into a state like that at all,

298
00:11:18,171 --> 00:11:19,310
it's worth paying attention to.

299
00:11:19,311 --> 00:11:20,150
And so then you might say,

300
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:20,760
well that's,

301
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,220
that's where your sense of ethics
really starts to arise is what makes you

302
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:25,821
interested.

303
00:11:25,821 --> 00:11:26,031
Well,

304
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:27,550
it might be just as cracked and,

305
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,090
and,

306
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:30,770
and peculiar as something
you could possibly imagine,

307
00:11:30,771 --> 00:11:31,160
right?

308
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,390
Your parents are against it,

309
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:33,440
your friends or against it.

310
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,990
Even you're against it when
you're thinking clearly,

311
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:40,991
but there's still this reality that
something compels you and then you think,

312
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:41,391
well,

313
00:11:41,391 --> 00:11:42,440
can you trust it?

314
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:43,791
And I think,

315
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,660
well that's a tough question because
I read a long time for a long time,

316
00:11:47,661 --> 00:11:52,250
I read accounts of serial killers
because I was really interested in what

317
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:53,084
motivated.

318
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,351
Right?

319
00:11:53,351 --> 00:11:56,050
And they're an interesting
breed in many ways,

320
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:58,540
which is why there's such a
popular fascination with them.

321
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:00,940
And so then you think about a
story like that and you think,

322
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,020
Geez,

323
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,910
maybe you can't trust your interest,

324
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:04,690
right?

325
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,680
Maybe it'll take you somewhere.

326
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,520
You don't want to go,

327
00:12:06,521 --> 00:12:08,350
like seriously where you don't want to go.

328
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:12,490
How do you know that if you really
let yourself be who you could be,

329
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,260
that you'd end up somewhere good.

330
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,870
And so then you come to the
second part of the story,

331
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,070
which is something like this.

332
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,560
Let's say that you're a very,

333
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:20,951
very,

334
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:24,190
very finely tuned biological machine,

335
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,323
right?

336
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,630
Lack into a computer and then you say,

337
00:12:28,631 --> 00:12:29,410
okay,

338
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:32,620
you take a computer and you
feed it false information.

339
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,910
What do you get out?

340
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:36,100
False information,

341
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,293
right?

342
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:37,691
Well,

343
00:12:37,691 --> 00:12:39,430
you've stuck with this computer.

344
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,900
It's very complicated.

345
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:44,710
You kind of reside in it in some
manner you don't understand.

346
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,040
And yet you're prone pawn occasions
either to deny it information altogether

347
00:12:50,831 --> 00:12:54,240
when you walk away from something you
know you shouldn't walk away from or to

348
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:54,550
it,

349
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:55,660
bad information.

350
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:56,763
And so then what if,

351
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,850
what if this was the case?

352
00:12:57,851 --> 00:13:02,170
What if it was the case that the systems
that Orient you with regards to your

353
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:06,940
interest can become pathologized by
any relationship you have with yourself

354
00:13:06,941 --> 00:13:08,770
that's predicated on bad faith.

355
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,271
And so then you think,

356
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,104
well,

357
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,250
that's why there's an ethical
aspect to this redemptive process.

358
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:18,000
Like a real strenuous and
strict ethical aspect.

359
00:13:18,001 --> 00:13:19,090
It goes something like this.

360
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:21,100
There are things that you can do.

361
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,870
Find yourself engaged with the world
at such a level that your existential

362
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:29,800
concerns could disappear and we can even
understand that biochemically to some

363
00:13:29,801 --> 00:13:32,200
degree because if you're
really interested in something,

364
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,960
you get a dopamine release,

365
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,680
an exploratory dopamine release,

366
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,880
that's great.

367
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,910
I mean that's associated with
positive effect with confidence,

368
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,950
with increased immunological functioning,

369
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,670
with better memory functioning
with learning everything you want.

370
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:50,350
It's also potently antianxiety,

371
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,040
lytic and analgesic,

372
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:55,400
which means that if you're really pursuing
something that's compelling to you,

373
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:58,400
you're much more resistant
biochemically to punishment,

374
00:13:58,401 --> 00:13:59,091
disappointment,

375
00:13:59,091 --> 00:13:59,840
depression,

376
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,530
pain,

377
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:01,010
threat,

378
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:01,640
et Cetera,

379
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,050
and it's not because you're blind,

380
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,301
you're blind.

381
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:08,690
It's because your nervous system is
optimally tuned to make you maximally

382
00:14:08,691 --> 00:14:09,231
resistant,

383
00:14:09,231 --> 00:14:12,470
and so then you might think
if you were optimally tuned,

384
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,270
how resistant would you be?

385
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,963
You don't know,

386
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:16,760
right?

387
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,420
Because it's a spiral that
never stops moving uphill.

388
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:26,830
We don't know what the upper mds and we
have exemplars that might indicate what

389
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:28,370
that upper end could be,

390
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,110
but we don't actually know.

391
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:31,551
So then you think,

392
00:14:31,551 --> 00:14:31,881
okay,

393
00:14:31,881 --> 00:14:32,720
well here's the.

394
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,690
Here's the rule.

395
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,100
Say something like this.

396
00:14:37,101 --> 00:14:38,810
If you look at the world
from this perspective,

397
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,520
which is something you
have to decide if you're,

398
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,930
you know,

399
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:43,850
you find compelling and reasonable.

400
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:45,230
The rule is this,

401
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,870
you're always gonna run into it normally,

402
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:52,713
right?

403
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,180
And,

404
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,311
uh,

405
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,640
normally is always going to
look to look to you like,

406
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,073
like this,

407
00:14:58,550 --> 00:14:59,600
and it's no bloody wonder.

408
00:14:59,601 --> 00:15:00,770
You want to run away from that.

409
00:15:00,771 --> 00:15:04,640
I mean in some ways is your whole body's
telling you watch out and for good

410
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:05,900
reason because it's no joke,

411
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,860
but then it was more to the story
because the anomalous thing,

412
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:11,450
that's everything you don't know.

413
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,221
And you might say,

414
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:13,700
well,

415
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,890
you're going out with someone and you
want to have a longterm relationship.

416
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:16,753
They'd be true.

417
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,380
How could there be any good in that?

418
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:23,180
Because that's certainly what you're
going to ask when you first encounter the

419
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,470
unexpected information,

420
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,390
but then you might think could be that
I'm a little too naive for my own good,

421
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:30,320
right?

422
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,640
People pull me in a little more than they
should or I'm not sufficiently careful

423
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:37,880
when I enter into intimate relationships
with people or I don't treat people

424
00:15:37,881 --> 00:15:42,320
right or I don't have a
good conceptualization of
myself or I'm chasing after

425
00:15:42,321 --> 00:15:43,154
the wrong person.

426
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:44,361
Well,

427
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:46,250
that's all going to be
very annoying to learn,

428
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,121
but if you don't learn it,

429
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:48,290
you're going to be in big trouble.

430
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:51,980
So maybe the best thing to do and enormity
of that sort hits you is to think,

431
00:15:51,981 --> 00:15:52,640
okay,

432
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,270
yeah,

433
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,140
it's a dragon.

434
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,850
No doubt it will eat me,

435
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,500
but if I don't let it eat me,

436
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:00,410
then they'll just be another one waiting
around the corner and it'll probably be

437
00:16:00,411 --> 00:16:02,480
a little bit bigger and if I
get eaten by enough of them,

438
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,960
I'm not really gonna want to be around
much and maybe I'm not going to be

439
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:07,970
willing to help other people
be around much either.

440
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,730
It doesn't seem like a very
good alternative to me.

441
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,570
Back in 1957,

442
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:21,160
some new gnostic writings were
discovered in a and a cave.

443
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:28,150
They were discovered by these two Arab
guys who went out to kill the man who

444
00:16:28,151 --> 00:16:28,931
killed her father.

445
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:30,160
They took them out into this cave.

446
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:32,140
Then they killed them and
when they were burying them,

447
00:16:32,141 --> 00:16:36,970
they found exam for a full of papers
and papyrus and they took them home and

448
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:38,410
their mother used a bunch of them too,

449
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:42,280
like cooking fires with and one day one
of their friends who was an antiquities

450
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,470
dealer showed up and he said,

451
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:44,741
you know,

452
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:45,990
you shouldn't be burning those.

453
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Those are about 1500 years old and they
look like very early gnostic gospels and

454
00:16:51,701 --> 00:16:54,850
the Gnostics were this branch of
Christianity that was pretty violently

455
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:59,050
suppressed by the emergence of Orthodox
Christianity and the gnostics believed

456
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,330
that faith was a good thing,

457
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:02,950
but knowledge was all right too.

458
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:08,460
And they wrote Gospel accounts say
of Christ's life that were knowledge

459
00:17:09,881 --> 00:17:12,280
predicated as much as
revelation predicated.

460
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:12,491
Say,

461
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:14,800
and this is one of the quotes
from one of those Gospels,

462
00:17:14,801 --> 00:17:15,820
the Gospel of Thomas,

463
00:17:15,821 --> 00:17:18,580
which is actually one that
the only one that got out,

464
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,680
Carl young got ahold of them.

465
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,910
Interestingly enough,

466
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:25,120
and this is one of the quotes
and I really liked this,

467
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,470
this is a non canonical saying
of Christ and the saying is,

468
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,260
if you bring forth what is within you,

469
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,260
why don't you bring forth will save you.

470
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,500
If you do not bring
forth what is within you,

471
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,130
what you do not bring
forth will destroy you,

472
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,430
and I think that's a pretty good
line to close off the class.
