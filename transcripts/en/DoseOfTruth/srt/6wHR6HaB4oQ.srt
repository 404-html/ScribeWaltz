1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,280
And the persona is the mask that you
wear.

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:06,120
And that's what persona means is the
mask that you wear to convince yourself

3
00:00:06,121 --> 00:00:08,010
and the world that you're not a terrible
monster.

4
00:00:08,011 --> 00:00:09,600
So that when you look at yourself in the
mirror,

5
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:11,940
you don't have to run away screaming.
You know,

6
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,100
when you might think,
well that's a bit of an overstatement,

7
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:19,101
but you'll was very interested in
phenomena such as,

8
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,630
um,
say psychological,

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:25,710
the psychological phenomena that would
characterize the actions of someone who

10
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:28,620
might be an Auschwitz camp guard for
example.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:30,900
And uh,
you know,

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,970
that's pretty monstrous form of
behavior.

13
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:36,990
And the thing about Auschwitz camp
guards is that there's no reason to

14
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:41,160
assume really that they were much
different than normal people.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,750
Now,
there would have been exceptions

16
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,160
obviously,
but,

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,050
and what that means is that perhaps you
two could be an Auschwitz camp guard and

18
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:51,150
perhaps he would even derive some
enjoyment out of it.

19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:54,390
And you might think not,
but you shouldn't think not so quickly.

20
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:58,920
And what that also implies is that if
you could see what that meant when you

21
00:00:58,921 --> 00:01:00,540
looked in the mirror and looked at
yourself,

22
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:04,500
you might run away screaming because
you'd have a revelation of just exactly

23
00:01:04,501 --> 00:01:08,190
what the human being is capable of.
And that's a very unpleasant revelation.

24
00:01:08,191 --> 00:01:12,090
And also one of the things that stops
people from being enlightened because

25
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,560
that revelation of the evil of the self
is part of the journey to enlightenment

26
00:01:16,561 --> 00:01:17,370
and an early part.
