1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,650
Present only nature.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,860
He came to that conclusion.

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,990
It was many people have
come to that conclusion,

4
00:00:10,991 --> 00:00:14,920
but I think the two who've
outlined it most spectacularly,

5
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,220
we're Nietzsche and Dostoevsky had
niche is an unbelievably influential

6
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:20,981
philosopher.

7
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:21,281
You know,

8
00:00:21,281 --> 00:00:23,650
I don't think there was anyone
that was more influential

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,570
during the entire course of the
20th century accepting a very,

10
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:33,990
very tiny handful of other
people accepting the scientists.

11
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,160
We won't bother with their,

12
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,001
where their discussion,

13
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:37,530
you could put marks in that category,

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,990
you could put Freud in
that category partly,

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,590
but after that the list
starts to get a lot thinner,

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,160
you know?

17
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,810
So maybe there's 10 people up and
out level and Dostoyevsky of course,

18
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:49,320
I think,

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,760
I mean,

20
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,240
if,

21
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,150
if you ever,

22
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,460
if anybody ever prepares a list of the
top 10 greatest literary figures in the

23
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:56,821
world,

24
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:58,590
he would be in the top 10 list.

25
00:00:58,591 --> 00:00:58,830
You know,

26
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,210
I think he's perhaps second to Shakespeare
and may be above Shakespeare in my

27
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,044
estimation.

28
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,130
So these aren't trivial
people were talking about
and they weren't dealing with

29
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:09,120
trivial issues.

30
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:12,541
Well.

31
00:01:12,541 --> 00:01:13,890
So then the question might be,

32
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:18,450
what's at the bottom of the
idea of a transcendent value?

33
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,360
And I want to want it to approach that

34
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,600
staying out of the metaphysical domain
as much as possible because you can claim

35
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,990
anything you want from a metaphysical
perspective and that's a big problem.

36
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:33,340
And so people will say,

37
00:01:33,341 --> 00:01:33,521
well,

38
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,710
why come up with a hypothesis of God?

39
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:36,544
For example,

40
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,660
God could be anything.

41
00:01:37,661 --> 00:01:38,680
There's a satire,

42
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,360
uh,

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,930
the flying Spaghetti Monster,

44
00:01:40,931 --> 00:01:41,180
right,

45
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:46,180
is classic satirical representation of
a day at that the atheist types used to

46
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:48,340
buttress their arguments and fair enough,

47
00:01:48,341 --> 00:01:48,880
you know,

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,020
as a satirical idea,

49
00:01:50,021 --> 00:01:51,130
it's pretty damn funny,

50
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,580
but there's things about this that
aren't the least bit of music.

51
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:56,860
And the thing that's not amusing as well.

52
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,460
What,

53
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,600
if anything,

54
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:00,430
is our culture predicated on,

55
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:01,391
okay,

56
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:02,224
so what happened?

57
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:02,860
Well,

58
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,870
Nietzsche and Dostoevsky put this forth,

59
00:02:04,871 --> 00:02:09,871
this set of propositions and out of
Dostoyevsky's line of thinking to some

60
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,260
degree grew soldier,

61
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:11,900
netsuite,

62
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,780
and so as units and documented
the absolute horrors of
equity predicated Soviet

63
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:17,441
society,

64
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:17,741
you know,

65
00:02:17,741 --> 00:02:19,000
and we don't teach,

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,410
we don't learn about that,

67
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,490
right?

68
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:21,761
This,

69
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:26,761
I don't understand is that what happened
in the 20th century on the radical left

70
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,900
end of the spectrum is
not well documented.

71
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,190
Students don't learn about it.

72
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,270
Why the hell is that?

73
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,980
We learned about World War II,

74
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:35,350
we learned about what happened
in the Holocaust and fair enough,

75
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,490
we absolutely should,

76
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:38,530
but nobody knows.

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,070
It's a mystery to everyone when,

78
00:02:40,071 --> 00:02:43,270
when I talk about what happened in
the Soviet Union and that's absolutely

79
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:46,360
appalling and that's to say nothing
about what happened in China,

80
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,890
which was equally horrible.

81
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,113
Yeah,

82
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:54,270
the system didn't work.

83
00:02:54,271 --> 00:02:56,190
It was predicated on the wrong values.

84
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,010
Unless you think that that
sort of thing means work,

85
00:02:59,530 --> 00:02:59,771
you know,

86
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,160
cause you,

87
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,750
you have to define that as well.

88
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,560
But it collapsed under its own weight
after it killed tens of millions of

89
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:05,921
people.

90
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:07,190
That doesn't really instill Ritz.

91
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:08,710
Not like Russia has recovered.

92
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,190
It doesn't seem to me like that's
a very good definition of worked.

93
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:16,600
Now whatever we're doing in the West
seems to work for all of its flaws.

94
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,861
And the question is,

95
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:19,300
are we just deceiving ourselves?

96
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,740
Is it just arbitrary power,

97
00:03:20,741 --> 00:03:21,940
politics and opinion,

98
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,710
or is there something at the bottom of it?

99
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,623
Yeah,

100
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:31,960
so when Soulja knits and
wrote the Gulag archipelago,

101
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:35,100
he believed that the Russians would have
to return to Orthodox Christianity to

102
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:36,340
find their pathway forward.

103
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,850
And that's of course has made him into
a reactionary in the eyes of many of his

104
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:40,360
critics.

105
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,850
But that is perhaps what
is happening in Russia.

106
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:46,600
Although it's very difficult to tell
because Putin also seems to be using his

107
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,980
affiliation with the Orthodox Christian
Church as as it means to consolidate

108
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:51,700
power.

109
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:54,220
So the situation in Russia is unclear,

110
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,750
but a religious revival,

111
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:57,040
if that's happening in Russia,

112
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:58,030
and perhaps it isn't,

113
00:03:58,031 --> 00:03:59,020
but if it is happening,

114
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,570
is something that unfolds over
decades and even centuries.

115
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:05,050
So it's not an easy thing to evaluate
when it first starts to happen.

116
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,500
Okay.

117
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,350
But soldier knits and drew the same
conclusions that Dostoyevsky did.

118
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,101
Fundamentally.

119
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:11,820
I'm not,

120
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,170
not in exactly the same way,

121
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:13,591
but very,

122
00:04:13,591 --> 00:04:14,251
very close.

123
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:14,430
He,

124
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,020
he believed as far as I could tell that
unless people were willing to adhere to

125
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:20,670
some sort of transcendent value,

126
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:25,230
that they had no protection against
pathological ideologies and no protection

127
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:27,450
against the murderous impulses
that came along with them.

128
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:31,560
And I found his work in unbelievably,

129
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,481
I found his right.

130
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:33,270
Incredible,

131
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:33,841
powerful,

132
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:34,674
incredible.

133
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:38,310
I don't know how you can read that book
and not draw that kind of conclusion.

134
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,030
I think people who criticize soldier
nets and have never read the damn book

135
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,200
because that book is like,

136
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,890
it's like going into the
ring with Mohammed Ali and
being pummeled to death for

137
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:47,724
half an hour.

138
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:48,151
You know,

139
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:49,830
you don't recover from it that easily.

140
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,113
So

141
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,860
then young branched off of nature.

142
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,160
Okay.

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,661
And so niche,

144
00:04:58,661 --> 00:05:01,230
his idea was that people would
have to create their own values,

145
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,220
roughly speaking.

146
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,990
And I think that's where niches is.

147
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:04,261
We,

148
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:04,500
uh,

149
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,500
is his weakest because it isn't obvious
to me that people can create their own

150
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:10,171
values.

151
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,820
And I think he fell into,

152
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:16,020
I don't want to be a casual critic of
nature because that's always dangerous

153
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:18,480
given that he probably had an Iq of 260,

154
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,201
you know,

155
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:19,441
I mean,

156
00:05:19,441 --> 00:05:21,420
he was way the hell out
there in the stratosphere.

157
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,760
And just when you think you've
understood what he was talking about,

158
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,500
you can be bloody well
sure that you didn't.

159
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:27,090
But it does seem to me,

160
00:05:27,091 --> 00:05:28,170
and he was running out of time,

161
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:28,981
he died young,

162
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:29,201
you know,

163
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:31,140
when he was trying to solve
this problem in a rush,

164
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:31,974
I would say.

165
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,370
And he hypothesized that people would
have to become superman over men,

166
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:40,410
roughly speaking in order to
deal with the death of God.

167
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:44,640
And that idea sort of branched off into
Nazi propaganda because that's in some

168
00:05:44,641 --> 00:05:47,700
sense with the Nazis were trying
to do with their promotion of the,

169
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,200
of the perfect area.

170
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:49,501
You know,

171
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:50,334
now it's a mist.

172
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:53,400
It's a misappropriation of
nature in my estimation.

173
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,210
And it was partly because his
sister who was a perverse creature,

174
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,693
um,

175
00:05:58,950 --> 00:05:59,900
uh,

176
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,921
what would you say?

177
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:05,900
Doctored his work in such a way so that
it was more easily appropriated by the

178
00:06:05,901 --> 00:06:06,680
Nazis.

179
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,690
But there is some danger
in what he said too.

180
00:06:08,691 --> 00:06:09,650
Because you know the,

181
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,431
the question is,

182
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,581
well,

183
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:12,800
if you're going to
transform yourself into the,

184
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,660
into the giver of values,

185
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,310
what stops you from inflating yourself
into something like a demigod and just

186
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:21,860
pronouncing what the
values are going to be.

187
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,750
So that's a problem.

188
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,040
You know,

189
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:30,800
you're going to replace
tradition with yourself.

190
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,953
Well,

191
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,490
there's dangers in that because
there's nothing to keep you humble.

192
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:37,910
That's,

193
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,650
that's the most appropriate objection.

194
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:40,940
There's nothing to keep you humble.

195
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,880
And those things can spiral
out of control very rapidly.

196
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:45,920
And they did say in the case of Hitler,

197
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:48,620
I mean it's easy to blame what
happened in Germany on Hitler,

198
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:49,100
but that's a,

199
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,880
that's a big mistake because it was a
dialogue between Hitler and the German

200
00:06:52,881 --> 00:06:53,690
people,

201
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:53,901
right?

202
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:55,370
Hitler didn't create himself.

203
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,720
It was cocreation.

204
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:00,620
He said things people listened
and told him back what to say.

205
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,100
And then he said them and they listened
and they told him back what to say.

206
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,840
And it looped until he was the
mouthpiece of their darkest desires.

207
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,860
Now that's a good,

208
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,600
that's a game he was willing to play.

209
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,550
But you can't think about that as it
isn't like Hitler created Nazi Germany,

210
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:20,840
Hitler and the Germans
cocreated Nazi Germany now.

211
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:25,841
And a leader gives our articulation
to the imagination of the population.

212
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,410
That's what a leader does.

213
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,180
And you know,

214
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:29,931
you could say that,

215
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:30,111
well,

216
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:33,770
Hitler may be Hitler filtered what
the Germans were telling him through a

217
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:37,580
particular lens because he had no shortage
of resentment and desire for revenge

218
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,720
in his own heart.

219
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,580
You know,

220
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:40,413
um,

221
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,350
it's not like his life was his
spectacular success be before he became a

222
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:46,310
political activist.

223
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:48,650
And he was brutalized very
badly in world war one.

224
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,230
And he didn't get to
pursue his primary dream,

225
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,050
which was to be an art student in Vienna.

226
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:57,140
And he had applied three times
and got rejected all three times.

227
00:07:57,141 --> 00:07:58,640
And so he was bitter about that.

228
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,700
He was basically living on the
streets after World War One.

229
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
It wasn't the world's happiest person,

230
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:07,520
and I'm sure he carried a fair bit of
resentment in his heart when he was in the

231
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,950
trenches in world war war one at,

232
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,810
at in one experience that he had,

233
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:15,740
all of his friends were killed by a
mortar when he had wandered off to go do

234
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:16,574
something else.

235
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,713
So,

236
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,260
you know,

237
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,780
it's hard to even imagine what
something like that would do to you,

238
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:24,230
but I can tell you when you're the
only survivor out of 20 people,

239
00:08:24,231 --> 00:08:28,190
that's also going to give you an
enhanced sense of your own specialists.

240
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,580
Because the alternative is just to
think about how God damn arbitrary the

241
00:08:31,581 --> 00:08:32,750
universe really is.
