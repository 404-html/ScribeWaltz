00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,780
I have her friend lives in Montreal,
his name is James.

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:07,080
Simon is a great painter and he's taught
me a lot of things,

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:08,880
helped.
He's helped me design my house and

4
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:13,881
beautify it and I bought some paintings
from him a couple of years ago and he

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:18,720
did this series of paintings where he
went around North America and stood in

6
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,721
different places and then he painted the
view from here down and so it's his feet

7
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:28,320
planted in different places on roads in
the desert on the ocean.

8
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:30,540
I have one actually hanging over my
toilet,

9
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:34,100
which is him standing at a urinal.
Yeah.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,680
Well,
you know,

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,190
he was trying to make a point and the
point was that wherever you are,

12
00:00:38,191 --> 00:00:40,680
it's worth paying attention and that's
because you know,

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:45,210
so all these places that he visited,
he looked exactly where he was standing

14
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,570
by the side of the road and the desert
sort of mundane in some sense,

15
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:51,390
but then maybe he put 40 hours into that
painting.

16
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,350
You know,
when it's very,

17
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:54,450
very realistic painting with really good
light.

18
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:58,950
And what he's telling you as a painter
is everything is worth paying attention

19
00:00:58,951 --> 00:01:00,570
to.
An infinite amount,

20
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:03,600
but you don't have enough time and so
the artists does that for you,

21
00:01:03,601 --> 00:01:05,550
right?
The artist looks and looks and looks and

22
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:09,000
locks and locks and then gives you that
vision and so then you can look at the

23
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:13,530
painting and it reminds you that,
right where you are is there's every.

24
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,950
Everything that there is is right where
you are and that's a hard thing to

25
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,450
realize,
but it's actually true.
