1
00:00:01,060 --> 00:00:04,150
What is the story behind the
logo that you use in your intros?

2
00:00:04,151 --> 00:00:05,260
Where did it come from?

3
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:06,761
That's,

4
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:11,761
that logo is called the meaning of music
and it's actually a sculpture that I

5
00:00:12,011 --> 00:00:16,050
made in 1985 that's about
five and a half feet by half,

6
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:18,940
five and a half feet and
about eight inches thick.

7
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:20,470
And it's made out of foam core,

8
00:00:20,471 --> 00:00:21,790
which is this bed.

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,660
It's a sub.

10
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:27,370
It's a material that's often used as a
backing for paintings or for when you get

11
00:00:27,371 --> 00:00:27,971
them framed,

12
00:00:27,971 --> 00:00:32,110
it's it's styrofoam sheet about a quarter
of an inch thick with paper on both

13
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:34,960
sides and you can cut it very
accurately with an exacto knife.

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,660
And so what I did was
make a stack of those uh,

15
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:39,730
uh,

16
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,050
those foam core sheets about eight inches
high and it made the thing in quarters

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,890
and so that it would fit together on the
wall because it would have been too big

18
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:48,850
to maneuver easily.

19
00:00:48,851 --> 00:00:49,370
And,

20
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,110
um,

21
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:51,550
it's a very complicated,

22
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,210
um,

23
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:52,870
image.

24
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,850
It's actually a three
dimensional representation of a,

25
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:05,980
it's a three dimensional representation
of a two dimensional representation of a

26
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:07,360
four dimensional object.

27
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,950
And that four dimensional
object you could think of as

28
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,290
it's a representation of time and space.

29
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:15,490
And I can tell you,

30
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,670
I kind of have to hint at
what the painting means.

31
00:01:18,671 --> 00:01:20,020
It or the sculpture,

32
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,890
it means the same thing that music
means to know how music unfolds and then

33
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:26,050
something else unfolds within it.

34
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:27,550
And then it unfolds again within it,

35
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:29,110
like a rose opening into the,

36
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:34,530
into the day or like a lotus flower that
sort of comes up from the darkest steps

37
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,750
up through the dark water
and then blooms on the,

38
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:40,030
on the surface of the water and the sun.

39
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:41,140
And that's where the Buddha,

40
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:41,890
you know,

41
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,430
um,

42
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,061
what would you say?

43
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,560
Symbol symbolically rest.

44
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:47,530
So can imagine that thing opening and
then imagine that that's what that

45
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,880
painting is an image of.

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,230
And that's the same thing as music.

47
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:52,180
So it's a Mandela image.

48
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,231
And for young,

49
00:01:53,231 --> 00:01:57,310
the Mandela was a symbol of the self
and the self was something that unfolds

50
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,091
like music,

51
00:01:58,091 --> 00:02:01,060
which is actually why we
like music and it's like the,

52
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,290
the rose,

53
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,210
the rose that you see that the geometric
rose that you see in stained glass,

54
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:08,044
it's the same thing.

55
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,740
Um,

56
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,670
that's the Stain Glass Window
that Pinocchio was reprehensible.

57
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:13,540
Compatriot.

58
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:13,900
Um,

59
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,501
what's his name?

60
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:14,831
Lamp.

61
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:18,520
Wick breaks when he's in pleasure island
that he throws a rock to destroy the

62
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:22,790
model home to demolish the
substructure of Western civilization.

63
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,120
So I had a very intense religious
experience at one point when I was

64
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,410
contemplating that.

65
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,390
So when I drew the image to begin with,

66
00:02:31,391 --> 00:02:32,740
I drew it in about 10 minutes,

67
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:33,400
kind of rough.

68
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,890
And then I use a straight
edge to straighten it all
open and a protractor to or

69
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,520
a compass to make the curves.

70
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,800
But I drew it very quickly
and I'd been thinking about,

71
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,930
I've been reading young
a lot at that point,

72
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:45,160
like fruit for months,

73
00:02:45,161 --> 00:02:46,390
months of intense reading.

74
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:49,630
And that image you sort
of popped out of me very,

75
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,200
um,

76
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
very suddenly.

77
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,590
But it took about three months
to make the actual image.

78
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,030
And then I had only a quarter of it
hanging on my wall because it was so big.

79
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,880
And I had finished it after
about three months of work.

80
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:04,600
So this was back in 1985 and it was a
graduate student and I was listening to

81
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,620
the Jupiter symphony,

82
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:07,500
which is the piece of music that I use,

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,530
um,

84
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,150
that was used for the intro to my,

85
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,050
to my videos.

86
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,730
And it's a Mozart symphony.

87
00:03:12,731 --> 00:03:13,840
And this happened,

88
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,410
man.

89
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,250
So this happened.

90
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:19,590
So I was really watching that Mandela,

91
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,141
that quarter,

92
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:20,681
Mandela,

93
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,890
that I have made intensely and
quite listening to the music,

94
00:03:23,891 --> 00:03:26,950
trying to understand what the
music music was signifying,

95
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,251
you know,

96
00:03:27,251 --> 00:03:29,650
because music has intrinsic meaning,

97
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,880
which is a very strange thing.

98
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,650
Now,

99
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,280
the part of the reason for that is that
language has meaning and our language

100
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,720
has a musical quality,

101
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:38,080
right?

102
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,380
And that's process most of by the right
hemisphere so that when people speak,

103
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,010
there's a,

104
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:44,140
there's a melody in their language.

105
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,600
And that carries a lot
of the emotional import.

106
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,870
And then what musicians have done
is figured out how to use that,

107
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,320
that,

108
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,153
that,

109
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,930
that musical faculty,

110
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:57,931
let's call it that no one's semantic w
musical faculty to sort of purely denote

111
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:58,900
meaning.

112
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,310
That's part of what music means.

113
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,270
And so,

114
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,060
but I was still trying to
understand what the meaning was.

115
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:04,894
You know what,

116
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,580
because it's nonverbal,

117
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,930
the meaning of music.

118
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:09,700
And I was trying to figure
out how to articulate that.

119
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:11,370
And that's partly why I made the,

120
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:15,250
the sculpture was to get a grip on
it and to understand it in anyways,

121
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,130
I was,

122
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,963
uh,

123
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:17,711
really,

124
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,060
really concentrating hard on that.

125
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,893
Mandela and,

126
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,310
and that sculpture.

127
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,160
And I had been working on it
intensely for about three months.

128
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:27,040
And also that's a lot of
meditation on a single idea.

129
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,500
And I was standing in my living room and
then had this very strange experience.

130
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:32,334
I,

131
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,190
and I can't explain this properly because
there's no way of really describing

132
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:36,281
it,

133
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,420
but I'll do my best.

134
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:38,290
So you know,

135
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,480
when those renaissance
painting sometimes you see,

136
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:43,060
well first of all you see great cloud,

137
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,350
great,

138
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,480
great sunny skies with,

139
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:47,920
with massive,

140
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:48,440
uh,

141
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:53,350
what stupendous impressive bills of
clouds and then light shining through the

142
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:55,030
sunlight shining through in streams.

143
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,990
Sometimes that's captured very
beautifully but especially English later,

144
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,960
later artists usually that or
later than the renaissance.

145
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:03,640
But you see it in
renaissance paintings too.

146
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,751
And you all,

147
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:06,280
you also see in,

148
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:06,940
in,

149
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,110
in renaissance paintings,

150
00:05:08,111 --> 00:05:10,300
especially in the earlier
phase of the renaissance,

151
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,600
the sky opening up in God sort of
peering fourth through the clouds.

152
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,020
And that's exactly what seemed to
happen to me is that I had this sense,

153
00:05:17,021 --> 00:05:18,070
it was like a vision,

154
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:20,170
although I was still in
my living room in Newark,

155
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,700
but inside the theater of,

156
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:22,720
in my imagination,

157
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,190
I could feel the,

158
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,190
the sky opening up now
and it wasn't the sky,

159
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:27,970
it was,

160
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,980
I would say the only way I
can let you think about it,

161
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,980
that was something like another dimension.

162
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,970
And then I could feel this
force descend upon me,

163
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,560
which I think was something that,

164
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:39,670
you know,

165
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:43,810
would have been considered classically
something like the holy ghost,

166
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,644
I suppose.

167
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:47,740
And it filled me with
this intense sense of,

168
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,190
of,

169
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:48,730
of,

170
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,300
of,

171
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,590
of Paradise,

172
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,260
a paradise.

173
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,740
I don't know how to say it,

174
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,593
uh,

175
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,050
while it was like being
in heaven for some,

176
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:03,943
some,

177
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,430
some brief period of time and I
could feel myself transformed,

178
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,900
transmuted as a consequence
of this experience.

179
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,150
And it was as if I was in the
presence of something that was living,

180
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,190
you know,

181
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,830
and I suppose that was an experience
of God if you want to put it that way.

182
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,123
Um,

183
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,440
that's certainly what it seemed like.

184
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:21,600
And,

185
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,360
and I felt that I could live that way.

186
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:27,200
I could live transfigured like
that permanently if I desired it.

187
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:27,950
And I thought,

188
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:28,401
my God,

189
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:31,910
I wouldn't be able to walk down the
street in this sort of elevated state,

190
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:32,744
let's say.

191
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,550
I don't know how I would act.

192
00:06:34,551 --> 00:06:35,960
I don't know how he would
interact with people.

193
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,670
I don't know how people
would interact with me.

194
00:06:37,671 --> 00:06:39,410
I just don't think that I could do it.

195
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,500
And then I felt that
whatever had descended,

196
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:45,000
it seemed that as if it was sorrowful and,

197
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,440
and it,

198
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,690
and it departed from me slowly and,

199
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:48,680
um,

200
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,513
with no,

201
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,860
like with no punitive intent.

202
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,530
And I wouldn't say with
any dissatisfaction,

203
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,420
it was as if the gift
had been offered did,

204
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:58,280
I wasn't in no position to receive.

205
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,301
And,

206
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,134
uh,

207
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:00,770
I went,

208
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,330
I talked to my wife soon afterwards.

209
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,600
I shook for about physically for
about half an hour after that,

210
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,300
uh,

211
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,041
experience.

212
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:07,340
Like,

213
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,600
like I was shaking,

214
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:08,901
you know,

215
00:07:08,901 --> 00:07:09,170
like,

216
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:09,530
like,

217
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,770
like he shake after a car accident if
you've ever been in a car accident.

218
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,000
And my pupils were completely dilated
and I had a couple of experiences like

219
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:17,480
that,

220
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,760
like echoes of it a couple
of times after that.

221
00:07:19,761 --> 00:07:20,390
And so,

222
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:20,781
anyways,

223
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:21,321
that was a very,

224
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:22,520
very powerful experience.

225
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:23,960
I've certainly never forgotten that.

226
00:07:23,961 --> 00:07:24,650
And,

227
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:25,460
um,

228
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,270
well,

229
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:26,720
you know,

230
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,370
I dunno.

231
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,670
I don't know what to think about that.

232
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,533
I mean,

233
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,150
God only knows what the
world is really like,

234
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:32,841
that's for sure.

235
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:36,020
And I've had a variety of very strange
experiences that have convinced me that

236
00:07:36,021 --> 00:07:37,520
we know very little about anything.

237
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:37,820
So.
