1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,840
Would you have voted for Donald Trump?

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,220
That's a hard question.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,930
You know when it's funny,

4
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:17,090
because I've been Canada,

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:18,440
I actually went to,

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,920
I was invited out to a private club
the night of the American election by a

7
00:00:21,921 --> 00:00:26,450
couple of Americans and there was a bunch
of Americans at this club and they did

8
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:29,930
a straw vote and you know,

9
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,030
I thought that what I probably would
have done when it came right down to it

10
00:00:35,031 --> 00:00:37,200
because I had to vote hey in the struggle.

11
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,260
So that was a pretty
reasonable simulation.

12
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,160
I think what I would've done was walk
into the voting booth with the intention

13
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:47,420
of voting for Clinton and then at
the last minute gone to hell with it.

14
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:49,160
I'm not doing it and voted for trump.

15
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,530
I think that's what I would've done.

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,810
And I thought about it a lot afterwards.

17
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:54,380
I mean,

18
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,090
for the entire election virtually,

19
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,140
I thought,

20
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:02,140
well Clinton has the experience necessary
to at least keep the status quo in

21
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:04,790
motion,

22
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,623
you know?

23
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,520
So in some sense she was a conservative
choice because she'd been in politics

24
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:11,354
for so long.

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:12,860
So.

26
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:17,860
But then as the campaign continued
and she continued to beat the identity

27
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:21,080
politics drum louder and louder,

28
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:26,420
I became more and more concerned about
her political direction or ideological

29
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,254
direction.

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,680
And then I thought when I was thinking
about what happened to the United States,

31
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:30,981
I thought,

32
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:31,131
well,

33
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:33,170
here's what the Americans decided.

34
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,900
They decided that they
liked the unscripted,

35
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:36,561
impulsive,

36
00:01:36,561 --> 00:01:39,380
live better than the scripted,

37
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,214
conniving,

38
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,383
unscripted,

39
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:45,110
impulsive lies of trump better than the
conniving scripted lines of Clinton.

40
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,800
It wasn't like the two
choices were so brilliant.

41
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,450
So I think I would have impulsively
voted for trump at the last moment.

42
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,411
I think so,

43
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:54,651
but I,

44
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:54,891
you know,

45
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:55,820
I can't be sure,

46
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,130
but it wouldn't have been
with the sense of delight.

47
00:01:58,131 --> 00:01:59,060
I can tell you that.

48
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:04,340
So it would have been based on
like your sort of logically,

49
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:09,490
rationally you might have argued
Hillary Clinton is the conservative pick

50
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:11,810
because she's not going
to up in the system.

51
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,040
It's not going to be great,

52
00:02:13,041 --> 00:02:15,020
but we know what we're
going to get with her.

53
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,090
But deep down viscerally,

54
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,860
maybe you feel like,

55
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,113
um,

56
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:23,340
what would that visceral sort
of sense of Ben for trauma?

57
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,200
Well,

58
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,330
it's a repugnance I,

59
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:30,340
I really do find identity
politics repugnant and I
don't use that term lightly.

60
00:02:31,131 --> 00:02:36,020
I think that we're making a very
big mistake to retry belies our,

61
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,310
our social,

62
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,100
our social conceptual structure.

63
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:40,851
You know,

64
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:40,980
the,

65
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,980
the big advantage to being in the west
was that we live in a society where the

66
00:02:46,011 --> 00:02:50,330
individual is sovereign and
some miraculous achievement
that we've managed that

67
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:51,830
both conceptually and practically.

68
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,300
And then to see the,

69
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,880
the left is pushing this I think.

70
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,550
I think the left is responsible for
this in large part the radical to read,

71
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:02,140
divide us among ethnic,

72
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:07,030
sexual or racial lines and
then other lines without.

73
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,470
And I think if a catastrophic
error and I just,

74
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,320
the Democrats just did far too much of
that and I wasn't happy at all that they

75
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:15,700
abandoned the working class.

76
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:16,751
You know,

77
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:19,180
like I have a fair bit of sympathy,

78
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,310
let's say for the working class.

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,160
Coming from a working class background,

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,610
having had a dozen or
more working class jobs.

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,993
Um,

82
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,030
and also some real appreciation
for working class people.

83
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:33,340
Like I liked working with my hands.

84
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:33,970
I've worked,

85
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:35,620
I've done a lot of renovation projects,

86
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:39,100
I've worked with a lot of contractors
and plumbers and carpenters and those

87
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:44,020
sorts of people and I felt that they
had been abandoned by the Democrats and

88
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:44,800
that,

89
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,400
that was,

90
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,710
that was a real betrayal,

91
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,070
a fundamental betrayal.

92
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,300
So,

93
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:49,550
and uh,

94
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:49,840
you know,

95
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,060
I know I'm not alone in those thoughts.

96
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,350
That's for sure.

97
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:53,531
I mean,

98
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,910
the same thing is happening in Canada.

99
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,020
The classic left wing,

100
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:01,450
the left wing in Canada has moved away
from its proper concentration on the

101
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,380
concerns of the,

102
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,270
of the working class poor.

103
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:08,080
Let's say I started planning this
intellectual identity politics game,

104
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,590
which I think is why do I
really find a detestable?

105
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:11,971
Yeah,

106
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:12,804
me too.

107
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,450
Me Too.

108
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:13,960
Look,

109
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,210
I think there's absolutely no doubt that
the left started this and that they're

110
00:04:18,211 --> 00:04:19,260
to blame for it,

111
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,660
but I feel like Donald Trump,

112
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:27,420
so what conservatism and American
conservatism until recently said,

113
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,873
um,

114
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,780
identity politics is bad,

115
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,150
therefore we're not
going to play the game.

116
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,740
We're not going to do it.

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,550
And I believe that Donald
trump was a vote for,

118
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,031
hey,

119
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:40,890
we have to fight fire with fire.

120
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,410
If they're going to play it,

121
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,820
that's the big danger.

122
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:45,821
Well,

123
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:47,060
and that's one of the things that I've,

124
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:47,850
I mean,

125
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,220
I've saved most of my online vitriol,

126
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:53,040
let's say for the radical left because,

127
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,570
and I think the primary reason for that
is because of my academic background,

128
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,180
it's the route the radical left has,

129
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,160
has undue influence in academia and then
from academia into the broader world,

130
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:05,910
you know,

131
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,950
so it makes sense for me,

132
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:13,010
especially given the compelled speech
law in Canada to be primarily concerned

133
00:05:13,531 --> 00:05:15,840
with the overreach of the radical left,

134
00:05:15,841 --> 00:05:18,840
but it's not like I'm thrilled
with the identity Iranian,

135
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,703
right?

136
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:20,910
Because they're doing the same thing.

137
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:21,360
They're,

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,260
they're mode or their,

139
00:05:22,261 --> 00:05:23,460
their strategy is different,

140
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:23,641
right?

141
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:28,641
Because the radical left
strategy is identify the
majority group and defeat them

142
00:05:28,711 --> 00:05:29,790
with something like guilt.

143
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,460
But the radical right strategy is
well except the majority a virtue,

144
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,290
let's say and when,

145
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,273
when the fight,

146
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,720
but none of them,

147
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,430
neither of those
approaches are gonna work.

148
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,811
You know,

149
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:43,560
like even the,

150
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,360
even the white supremacist approach,

151
00:05:45,361 --> 00:05:45,840
let's say.

152
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,430
I mean,

153
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,070
it's fatally flawed in a variety
of ways apart from its pure,

154
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:51,070
reprehensible realty.

155
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:51,391
It's like,

156
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:51,900
well,

157
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,531
who's white?

158
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:53,364
Exactly

159
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,620
like we're,

160
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:58,160
how do you draw these
distinctions is the problem.

161
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:58,521
Of course,

162
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,410
the intersection left has run into.

163
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,180
They run into the impossibility of making
group identifications with any degree

164
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:05,811
of accuracy,

165
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,750
but the same problem technically speaking,

166
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:10,520
be devil's attempts on the right.

167
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,390
It's like,

168
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,223
well,

169
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:14,270
what are the people who
inhabit northern India?

170
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,104
Are they white?

171
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,920
Like what?

172
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:17,661
Where exactly?

173
00:06:17,661 --> 00:06:18,920
You're drawing the boundaries here.

174
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:19,430
Yeah.

175
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:19,770
Well,

176
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:24,090
it really matters all polling
way of looking at things.

177
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:30,060
I have the sense that that the problem
is that what the left wants to do today

178
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,580
is not to achieve parody.

179
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,560
They don't want women or minorities
to achieve parody and be equal.

180
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,630
They want them to be superior,

181
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,531
so in other words,

182
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:42,390
they believe in a zero sum game.

183
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:47,190
They don't believe we can grow the
pie and everybody be more prosperous.

184
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,430
They believed that there was zero,

185
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
zero ba winners,

186
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,220
the winners and losers,

187
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:55,020
and therefore they have to tear down.

188
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's say men for example,

189
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,550
in the me too moment in
order to elevate women.

190
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,001
Yeah.

191
00:07:01,001 --> 00:07:01,310
Well,

192
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,930
the zero sum problems,

193
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,230
a real one that bedeviled
the left forever.

194
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,100
You know,

195
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,790
and there there are constant claim
is well we live in a resource,

196
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,183
a resource

197
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,950
scarce environment and yeah,

198
00:07:14,951 --> 00:07:18,940
there has to be winners and losers and
I don't think there's any evidence for

199
00:07:18,941 --> 00:07:19,774
that at all.

200
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,763
Um,

201
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,690
and,

202
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:22,430
but the,

203
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,720
even if they're not out to
attain like an inversion,

204
00:07:25,721 --> 00:07:26,554
so that the,

205
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,200
the,

206
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,600
the last become first,

207
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:33,601
let's say there are certainly not
paying any attention to the fact that

208
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,050
equality of outcome is impossible.

209
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,730
Impossible goal.

210
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,560
There's a measurement problems.

211
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,460
So the measurement problem
is well across what outcomes.

212
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:48,610
Exactly and I mean exactly because
these are very important issues.

213
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,280
You want people to be equal
across all possible outcomes.

214
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:52,870
Like where do you draw the borders?

215
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,210
Well that's a big problem like and,

216
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:58,660
and then the next problem is
who decides when they're equal,

217
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:03,210
how do you set up a system that isn't
the market system to decide when equality

218
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,173
has been attained?

219
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,850
So that's second insoluble problem.

220
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:10,840
And then third insoluble problem
is well across what groups?

221
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:14,980
Because I don't know how many
ethnic categories are used,

222
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:16,350
say in the US labor boards,

223
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:17,950
statistics and by the US government,

224
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:18,581
but it's something.

225
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:19,414
It's in the dozens,

226
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,890
like so you're going to
equate across all ethnicities.

227
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,800
Are you going to equate across all social,

228
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,480
like socioeconomic categories?

229
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,050
You're going to include the
infinite number of genders in that,

230
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,060
like their problem.

231
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:39,061
Technically the problem that they're
trying to solve can be solved technically

232
00:08:39,131 --> 00:08:42,970
impossible to solve it apart from the
fact that it's also when it's put into

233
00:08:42,971 --> 00:08:43,451
practice,

234
00:08:43,451 --> 00:08:46,030
it's actually murderous equity doctrine,

235
00:08:46,031 --> 00:08:47,410
I think is a murderous doctrine,

236
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,970
so,

237
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,920
but it's not so easy to
put your finger on why.
