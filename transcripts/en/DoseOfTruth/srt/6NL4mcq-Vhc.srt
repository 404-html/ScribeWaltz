1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Hmm,

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,840
I would like to move onto discussing
myths.

3
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,500
This is so interesting.
So I would just say one more thing

4
00:00:13,501 --> 00:00:15,350
because I,
if you,

5
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,820
uh,
if you talk to these people about how we

6
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:20,150
can reconstruct homosexuals,
I mean,

7
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,780
can you send,
can you send them to a straight camp?

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,890
I mean all of them would say that's
horrible,

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,170
but if you ask about how can you
deconstruct and then reconstruct boys

10
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:33,130
and their masculinity,
all of them are aboard.

11
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,380
So.
Yeah.

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,390
So,
so it's,

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,830
it's a very inconsistent.
Well,

14
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:44,320
I mean,
one of the things I complained about

15
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,460
last year with regards to this build cc
see legislation in Canada,

16
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:50,650
as I said,
look,

17
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,970
you're instantiating a social
constructionist view of gender,

18
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:57,140
gender,
expression,

19
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,110
sexual proclivity,
all of these things into the law.

20
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,300
Okay?
So it's socially constructed.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,140
Okay.
So wake up.

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,890
The Conservatives who have been,
uh,

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:12,950
opposing homosexuality for the last
hundred years have used nothing but

24
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:14,820
social constructionist arguments.

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,650
They basically say,
well,

26
00:01:16,651 --> 00:01:19,830
if it's socially constructed or an
individual choice,

27
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:20,611
which is,
by the way,

28
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:25,170
now it's stantiating into Canadian law,
then why the hell can't you just be

29
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:28,610
reeducated out of it?
Or just drop it if it's just an

30
00:01:28,611 --> 00:01:30,570
individual choice.
Well,

31
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,750
I tried to say you're,
yeah,

32
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,340
you're playing with fire the fire that
will consume you.

33
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,890
Okay.
But you know,

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,080
okay,
nobody,

35
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,730
nobody.
No,

36
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,340
I shouldn't say nobody.
These arguments are,

37
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:50,480
these arguments are subtle and,
and they're not easy to follow.

38
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,560
And so,
and the problem is,

39
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:57,620
is that the consequences of producing
legislation like that unfold over

40
00:01:57,621 --> 00:01:59,150
decades,
not minutes.

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
Yeah.
So I don't know.

42
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,550
Did you see what happened at Wilfrid
laurier university in Canada last week,

43
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:08,170
two weeks ago?
Lindsay Shepherd.

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,390
Does that ring a bell?
I listened to the conversation.

45
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:13,960
She recorded.
Yeah.

46
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:16,840
So in Canada now,
three things are happening.

47
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,740
The first is,
despite the fact that I predicted this

48
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:25,480
and that the only reason my reputation
was ever let's say tarnished,

49
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,120
was because I predicted that this was
going to happen.

50
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:31,150
I'm still being vilified by people who,
even,

51
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,530
who,
who are admitting nonetheless,

52
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:37,230
that what happened at Wilford Laurey was
reprehensible.

53
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,610
Okay?
So that's one thing.

54
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,630
The second thing is the people that
Laurie,

55
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,940
who used,
who accused Lynsay of breaking the

56
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:50,740
Canadian federal and provincial laws are
being accused of misinterpreting those

57
00:02:50,741 --> 00:02:52,820
laws,
which they aren't as far as I'm

58
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:55,640
concerned,
but that enables people to save face.

59
00:02:56,710 --> 00:03:01,710
And third and most a fair number of
faculty members and public commentators

60
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:07,630
are claiming that Ramboo,
Kana and pim lot and Joel,

61
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,310
who were the interlocutors in the
inquisition are the true victims,

62
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:15,070
but really?
Oh absolutely.

63
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:17,590
Because now,
now that people have been.

64
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,311
Well,
first of all,

65
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:22,000
they were only standing up for trans
rights and second,

66
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,050
well because they've been the target of
substantial criticism,

67
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:30,280
let's say like overwhelming,
punishing,

68
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:35,490
brutal criticism on ending for weeks
while they're that they're now victims

69
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,800
because that's just not fair.

70
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:43,890
And so when the president could Wilfrid
laurier university apologized to lynsay

71
00:03:44,831 --> 00:03:46,690
shepherd,
she also said,

72
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:48,760
but you know,
I also feel,

73
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:53,080
I also feel that what has happened to
the faculty members in the aftermath of

74
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,990
this faculty members and administrators
was also raw.

75
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,270
So like,
it's that typical thing.

76
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:01,300
You know,
you see this when kids get bullied in

77
00:04:01,301 --> 00:04:03,850
schools.
Now is that the idiot

78
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,610
interveners and they're and they're
blind.

79
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:13,030
Humanitarian impulse is bringing the
bully and the victim into the

80
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:16,420
principal's office to discuss it,
assuming equal,

81
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,080
equal causal,
what would you call it?

82
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,990
Responsibility on the part of the victim
and the perpetrator,

83
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,070
and they think that,
well,

84
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:26,830
if they just had a nice talk about it,
then

85
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:32,350
we could be settled.
Not understanding at all that the bully

86
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,270
who's,
let's say one of these,

87
00:04:34,271 --> 00:04:37,750
one in 100 Predator types,
it's just going to stand on the outside

88
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,830
of the school ground and wait for the
victim to come by and just pound the

89
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:44,440
hell out of him because that's how
bullies work.

90
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:44,981
It's like,
well,

91
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:46,870
we could settle it like reasonable
people.

92
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:48,070
And he's like,
yeah,

93
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,430
right.
You're so God damn naive that you know,

94
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,130
if evil ever popped out and made a face
at you,

95
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:56,760
which would likely will.
You'd be scared into posttraumatic

96
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,080
stress disorders so fast.
You wouldn't know what hit you.

97
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:02,170
And I've seen that plenty of times in my
clinical practice.
