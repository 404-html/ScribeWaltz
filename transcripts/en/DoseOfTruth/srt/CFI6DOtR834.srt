1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,200
Maelstrom,

2
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:04,110
who is apparently chaos
given the name asked me,

3
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:05,970
am I chaos or am I order?

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,261
Well,

5
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:08,160
that's a good question.

6
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,620
I would say a lot of the time I'm chaos,

7
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,170
but I do everything I can
to put things in order.

8
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:14,370
Um,

9
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:17,190
but I'm going to answer
that in a deeper way.

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,061
I would say,

11
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:19,830
because first of all,

12
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,430
everything and everyone is chaos
and order at the same time.

13
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,890
And I don't mean that in a trait sense.

14
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,390
I mean in a technical sense,

15
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:28,710
which is order.

16
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,600
Technically speaking in my way of viewing
the world is order is that domain you

17
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:37,590
inhabit when what you're doing produces
the results that you want to have

18
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:38,190
happen.

19
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,600
That's a pragmatic perspective from,

20
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,120
from a philosophical perspective,

21
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:45,930
it's derived at least in part or is it
analogous to the pragmatism of people

22
00:00:45,931 --> 00:00:46,640
like,

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,473
um,

24
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,693
um,

25
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,600
cs purse and William James,

26
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:52,770
the American PR,

27
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,660
the early American pragmatists.

28
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:55,883
Um,

29
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,370
and there's a great book on
all that if you're interested,

30
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:00,570
called the metaphysical club.

31
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,220
Um,

32
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:06,990
so order is where you are when what
you're doing is producing the results that

33
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:09,150
you intended and that
validates what you're doing.

34
00:01:09,151 --> 00:01:09,571
By the way,

35
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:11,280
that that's a pragmatic form of truth.

36
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:16,190
Your theory is accurate when if you
enact it then the results that you intend

37
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:16,920
emerge.

38
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,480
That's the definition of truth.

39
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:19,720
From a pragmatic perspective,

40
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:23,640
it's a very powerful definition and it's
very much associated with the Darwinian

41
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:24,480
notion of truth.

42
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,130
So that's worth,

43
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,780
that's worth looking into.

44
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,320
Now obviously there are times when
you implement a plan and and at world

45
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,300
conception that goes along with that
plan and what you wanted didn't happen.

46
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:42,690
And so then the domain of chaos comes up,

47
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:45,960
the domain of the unpredictable
and unexpected and you
have to contend with it.

48
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:48,990
And sometimes when you are acting,

49
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:54,110
you do perverse things and things that
surprise you and then things don't work

50
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:56,490
out well for you.

51
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:00,510
Or maybe you get a surprise and maybe
sometimes that might even be positive and

52
00:02:00,511 --> 00:02:04,110
that's because the chaos within new
as manifested itself and you've done

53
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:08,430
something that exceeds the bounds of
your understanding and you know that can

54
00:02:08,431 --> 00:02:11,470
happen to people so badly that they
developed post traumatic stress,

55
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,290
posttraumatic stress disorder.

56
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,850
Sometimes soldiers,

57
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,740
especially naive young soldiers,

58
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:19,860
will go on a battlefield and watched
themselves do something they can't imagine

59
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:23,070
they're capable of doing and then they
have permanent post traumatic stress

60
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,760
disorder.

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,940
So there's a chaos within
that can manifest itself,

62
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,550
that can disrupt whatever order you are.

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,120
Um,

64
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,240
and you know that minor ways because
everybody's always running around doing

65
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,950
things that aren't good for them,

66
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,470
that they know they shouldn't
do and that they can't control.

67
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,520
And so there's a chaotic and an
orderly aspect to everything,

68
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,780
to the individual,

69
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,041
to the family,

70
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:44,970
to the social world,

71
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:45,930
to the natural world.

72
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,710
It's chaos and order at every
level of analysis simultaneously,

73
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,830
which is why the Dallas think of the
world is made out of Yin and Yang,

74
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:53,790
which is essentially,

75
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:54,853
um,

76
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,360
analogous to the idea of order and chaos.

77
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,643
And now,

78
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,910
but then there's another element too.

79
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:04,960
So your order and your chaos
and the place that you live,

80
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:07,150
the environment is
order and chaos as well.

81
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,170
But you're also the process
that mediates between the two.

82
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,340
And what that means is you're the forest
that confronts chaos and casts it into

83
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:15,731
order.

84
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,740
We talked about that in
the freewill discussion.

85
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,110
That's the basis for the dragon math,

86
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:20,980
or at least part of it,

87
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:21,814
the hero myth.

88
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,810
You are the forest that confronts chaos
and transforms it into habitable order.

89
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,260
And there's an idea that if you
do that using truthful speech,

90
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,330
it's probably the deepest
idea in the Bible.

91
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,890
If you confront chaos and the
unknown using truthful speech,

92
00:03:35,891 --> 00:03:38,320
then the order that you produce is good.

93
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,130
So that also means that your chaos and
order and the process that intermediates

94
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,064
between them,

95
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:47,020
and that's really the
basis of the hero myth.

96
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:50,440
So part of that is the hero
story and the Dragon Myth.

97
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,071
Go Out,

98
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,570
confront the drag and get the gold,

99
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:53,291
bring it back,

100
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,490
share it with the community.

101
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,890
And the dragon is a representation of
that which dwells beyond the confines of

102
00:03:59,891 --> 00:04:02,020
the safe and habitable space.

103
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:02,231
Right?

104
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:03,730
It's an image of a predator.

105
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,870
That's part of what it is.

106
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:06,610
Although it's way more
complicated than that.

107
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,320
And you're also the forest that confronts
order when it becomes too tyrannical

108
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,590
and restructures it back to chaos and
then restructures the chaos back into more

109
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:17,890
beneficial order,

110
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,911
which is what you do.

111
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:19,541
For example,

112
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,300
if you have an argument with
someone that you settle,

113
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,901
right?

114
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,420
Cause the argument takes the orderly,

115
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,530
um,

116
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:30,460
relation that you have with that person
and then produces a chaotic interlude,

117
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:32,890
which is all the pain that's
associated with the argument.

118
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,310
And that's a dissolution into what Mircea
Eliade called pre cosmic gone chaos.

119
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,461
And out of that,

120
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:40,780
a new order can emerge.

121
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,970
And so the best way to construe
yourself is not as chaos or as order,

122
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:48,630
but as the process that
mediates between the,

123
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,010
and that's the basis for the ethos of
the West is that the human being is best

124
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,410
represented as the individual and
the individual is that attentive and

125
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:04,411
communicative entity that is continually
capable of mediating properly between

126
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:05,860
chaos and order.

127
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,050
Now this is a deep idea.

128
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,200
You could read maps of
meaning if you would like.

129
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:14,020
The audio version of that
is coming out June 12th,

130
00:05:14,021 --> 00:05:14,740
by the way.

131
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:18,190
And I will make a video detailing the
relationship between maps of meaning and

132
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,270
12 rules of life.

133
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,220
But you can construe yourself,

134
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,660
you should construe yourself as the
process that mediates between chaos and

135
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:26,380
order.

136
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:30,880
And you should aim to be the process
that does that properly using truthful

137
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,410
communication because that's how you
keep the elements of existence properly

138
00:05:35,411 --> 00:05:36,190
balanced.

139
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,821
And you might say,

140
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,061
yeah,

141
00:05:37,061 --> 00:05:38,320
but is that real?

142
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,573
Well,

143
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,170
if you read maps of meaning,

144
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,460
there's a section on
neuropsychology that's also
buttressed by a book written by

145
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:49,510
Ian Mcgilchrist called the master
and his emissary that lays out the

146
00:05:49,511 --> 00:05:52,240
relationship between the right
and left hand Miss Hemisphere.

147
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:52,751
Now,

148
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,660
it's quite strange that we have
a right and left hemisphere.

149
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,000
It's almost as if we have two
consciousnesses dwelling in our,

150
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,140
in our,

151
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,740
in our,

152
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,573
in our being,

153
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,470
and they're quite separable.

154
00:06:03,471 --> 00:06:05,810
If you cut the Corpus
callosum that unites the two,

155
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,780
then the two hemispheres will
act independently to some degree.

156
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:11,180
You can communicate with each
of them somewhat independently,

157
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,370
so they actually view the
world quite differently.

158
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,210
And that that hemisphere distinction
is not only they're human beings,

159
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,880
but also an animal's along way
down the phylogenetic chain.

160
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:20,570
Now,

161
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,570
I made the claim partly because I was
reading a man named m e l Conan Goldberg,

162
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:27,740
who was a student of Alexander Luria,

163
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,470
the most brilliant neuro
psychologist of the 20th century.

164
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,380
And Andy Goldberg made the case that,

165
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,520
um,

166
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,370
the left hemisphere is specialized for,

167
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:38,743
um,

168
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,860
for what's known.

169
00:06:39,861 --> 00:06:44,000
And the right hemisphere is specialized
for a normally and VSRM a Shondra and

170
00:06:44,001 --> 00:06:45,350
who's a famous neurologist.

171
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:47,170
I'm an MD in,

172
00:06:47,171 --> 00:06:50,930
in California has also made a very similar
claim based on his analysis of brain

173
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:52,430
damaged individuals.

174
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,600
But Goldberg's case was
the left hemisphere is
specialized for what you know,

175
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:57,434
how to do.

176
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,490
And the right hemisphere is specialized
for response to what's unknown and that

177
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:04,400
maps on to this order chaos dimension,

178
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:05,720
right,

179
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,860
and the right hemisphere.

180
00:07:06,861 --> 00:07:07,570
Now,

181
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,390
um,

182
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,650
McGilchrist in his book,

183
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:12,680
the master and his emissary has
pointed out quite clearly that the left

184
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:14,690
hemisphere has a tyrannical tendency,

185
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,310
which Rameshchandra Shondra
and also viewed in his brain
damaged patients by the

186
00:07:19,311 --> 00:07:19,760
way.

187
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,640
And that the left hemisphere
is always trying to impose.

188
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,940
It's logical and restricted
order on the world.

189
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,860
And to make the world fit into that.

190
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,970
Now it has to do that.

191
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:29,990
There's reasons for that.

192
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,670
Part of the reason is,

193
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:35,480
is that if your theory you've worked on
for 10 years makes one prediction error,

194
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:37,070
you shouldn't throw the
whole damn thing out.

195
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,290
You should doubt the prediction error,

196
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:39,731
right?

197
00:07:39,731 --> 00:07:44,000
Cause you never know when your data is
actually data or is just another kind of

198
00:07:44,001 --> 00:07:44,810
theory.

199
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,490
We can't get into that at the moment.

200
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,713
Now,

201
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,673
um,

202
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:53,630
McGilchrist makes it very strong case
and I think a more elaborated case than I

203
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:54,620
made in maps of meaning.

204
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:59,621
But it's the same argument fundamentally
that the right hemisphere is concerned

205
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:01,540
with reaction to anomaly.

206
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,060
And so,

207
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:05,390
so what happens in some senses
something unexpected happens.

208
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:06,830
That's the domain of chaos.

209
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,900
And that stops you in your tracks,

210
00:08:08,901 --> 00:08:09,621
it freezes you.

211
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,030
And that's a Predator response.

212
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:11,900
A prey response.

213
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,500
Actually,

214
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,333
you're frozen,

215
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:15,260
the unknown has manifested itself.

216
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,090
You're not in order anymore.

217
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,310
You don't know where you are
and you don't know what to do.

218
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:19,821
And so,

219
00:08:19,821 --> 00:08:21,860
and you can't just shut
down like a computer does.

220
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,150
You freeze instead.

221
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:27,350
And then what happens is that the
ancient mechanisms that have helped our

222
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:29,540
ancestors for tens of millions of years,

223
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:31,010
or perhaps longer than that,

224
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,310
react to that which looks beyond the
confines of the unknown kick in and you

225
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:36,951
start,

226
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:37,491
first of all,

227
00:08:37,491 --> 00:08:38,301
that's motoric.

228
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:42,590
So you freeze and then you cautiously
start to explore and then it's imagistic.

229
00:08:42,591 --> 00:08:45,080
You start making imaginal representations,

230
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,000
metaphoric representations,

231
00:08:47,001 --> 00:08:50,330
dramatic representations of what
might constitute the unknown.

232
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,950
And then those representations are
practiced and implemented in the world.

233
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,840
They become more and more
fine grained and automatized.

234
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,160
And as that happens,

235
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:03,270
the locale that they're represented in
the brain shifts from right to left.

236
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:04,703
So,

237
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,761
so,

238
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:09,120
so the reason I'm telling you
all this is because you know,

239
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,820
this is where the metaphysical
and the physical unite,

240
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,850
and this is the sort of argument that
I was trying to make to Sam Harris.

241
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,760
And hopefully we'll be able to continue
doing that because I'm going to meet him

242
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,230
three times in the next few months.

243
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,750
Is that the,

244
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:22,950
the Yin Yang idea,

245
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,070
the chaos order ideas,

246
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,960
metaphorical in some sense to say that
the world is made up of order and chaos

247
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,820
doesn't sound like an empirical statement,

248
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:31,590
but strangely enough,

249
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:37,010
the world to which our brains are adapted
is actually the world of chaos and

250
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:37,531
order.

251
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:39,090
You can think about it as unexplored,

252
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:40,320
unexplored territory too.

253
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:41,100
That's another,

254
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,790
that's another,

255
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,623
you know,

256
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,583
take on it.

257
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,740
And so then you think from
a Darwinian perspective,

258
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:47,730
think about it this way.

259
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,980
From a Darwinian perspective,

260
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:50,820
there's an,

261
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,400
there's an an axiomatic presupposition,

262
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,730
and that is reality is that which selects,

263
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:57,510
okay,

264
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:00,630
reality is the force that
selects over evolutionary time.

265
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:05,160
And so the force that selects over
evolutionary time has selected for

266
00:10:05,161 --> 00:10:06,750
hemispheric specialization,

267
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,910
bilateral hemispheric specialization,

268
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,960
which indicates the two different modes
of looking at the world are necessary

269
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,340
for survival,

270
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:14,611
right?

271
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:15,660
So that's real.

272
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:19,830
And so the idea that the world is made
out of chaos in order is perhaps the most

273
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:20,700
real idea.

274
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,360
Now,

275
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,910
here's something else cool
that's associated with that.

276
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,400
And this is an antidote to nihilism.

277
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,070
I also think it's an antidote to two.

278
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,390
What would you call 'em?

279
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,680
Ideological,

280
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,360
ideological possession.

281
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,230
So when you encounter something unknown,

282
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:40,110
you orient towards it and
that's an involuntary response.

283
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:42,360
You could even think about it
as a deterministic response.

284
00:10:42,361 --> 00:10:45,990
It's part of what orients you
very rapidly towards predators.

285
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:48,630
So they don't kill you before
you have a chance to respond.

286
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:49,351
Okay,

287
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:52,470
so you react because the
anomalous thing is meaningful.

288
00:10:52,471 --> 00:10:53,820
It's intrinsically meaningful.

289
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:59,060
And the reaction is first terror with
perhaps an overlay of disgust and second

290
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:00,180
curiosity.

291
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:04,020
And it's terrorist so that you
freeze and remain paralyzed.

292
00:11:04,021 --> 00:11:05,040
You turn to stone.

293
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,650
When you look at the Bass Lisk
or the snake or the Gorgon,

294
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,521
you turned to stone.

295
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:10,080
You're paralyzed like a prey animal.

296
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,830
And that's so the prey Predator
can't see you at least in part.

297
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,920
And there's other elements
of the orienting reflects
that are associated with

298
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:17,880
Predator avoidance.

299
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:20,100
And then if nothing
additionally terrible happens,

300
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:23,220
you start to thaw out
and you start to explore.

301
00:11:23,221 --> 00:11:25,020
And you do that with image first and,

302
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,080
and then PR and then practice the
appropriate behaviors and then,

303
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,160
and then automate those.

304
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:30,000
Now look,

305
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:30,871
here's the thing.

306
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:31,704
That's cool.

307
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,280
So that orienting reflects to the
unknown is it's an admixture of threat,

308
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,850
fear and curiosity,

309
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,880
incentive reward.

310
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:47,250
So negative emotion and positive
emotion now and it's dose dependent.

311
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,020
The larger the anomaly,

312
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,720
which means the larger the map,

313
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,520
it blows out when it manifests itself.

314
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,500
Think of the difference between being
irritated at your marital partner because

315
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:00,040
they,

316
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,401
you know,

317
00:12:00,401 --> 00:12:01,001
um Oh,

318
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:01,834
who knows?

319
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,230
Because they were late to pick you up
for work compared to how we rotated you

320
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:07,390
would be if you found out
they were having an affair.

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,710
Difference in size of a,

322
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:12,910
normally the first one disrupts
a tiny little part of your space,

323
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:16,750
time orientation and the second
one demolishes your past,

324
00:12:16,751 --> 00:12:17,710
present and future.

325
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,630
And the larger the disruption,

326
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,180
the more negative emotion obviously.

327
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:23,590
And so,

328
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,520
so there's this weird interplay between
negative and positive emotion in the

329
00:12:27,521 --> 00:12:29,480
response to a normally and,

330
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,030
but it's deeply meaningful,

331
00:12:31,031 --> 00:12:33,010
even if it's even if it paralyzes you,

332
00:12:33,011 --> 00:12:34,000
even if it's terrifying,

333
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:34,834
it's meaningful.

334
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,110
And then that transforms perhaps into
intense curiosity and you start to

335
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:38,890
explore.

336
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,890
Now the phenomena of meaning
is a manifestation of the
complex orienting reflex.

337
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,980
And so you're wired so that you're not
just order and you're not just chaos,

338
00:12:50,981 --> 00:12:55,660
your order continually confronting
chaos so that the order remains updated.

339
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,250
And you might say,

340
00:12:57,251 --> 00:12:57,431
well,

341
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:01,240
how do you know how much chaos you should
confront in order to keep the order

342
00:13:01,241 --> 00:13:02,650
continually updated?

343
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:08,170
And the answer is maybe see
something is meaningful.

344
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,110
The reason that something is meaningful
is because you're getting a deep

345
00:13:11,111 --> 00:13:16,111
instinctual signal that
you're encountering a normally
at a rate that doesn't

346
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:17,530
exceed your capability.

347
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,430
That's also the rate at which you
can keep yourself updated optimally.

348
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,730
And so meaning isn't
epit phenomenal and it,

349
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,623
and it isn't.

350
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,070
It isn't some kind of delusion
that rationality can and
should overcome to say,

351
00:13:30,071 --> 00:13:30,251
well,

352
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:31,300
everything's meaningless.

353
00:13:31,301 --> 00:13:31,631
It's like,

354
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:31,811
no,

355
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:32,410
it's not.

356
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,110
Meaning is the most fundamental
instinct for adaptation.

357
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,780
And so that's partly why
in 12 rules for life.

358
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:39,190
I said one of the rules,

359
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,150
I think it's rule seven
is do what is meaningful,

360
00:13:43,151 --> 00:13:47,160
not what is expedient because meaning
is a really good guide to longterm

361
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,063
adaptation.

362
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,140
And so then,

363
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,620
and the other thing about meaning,

364
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,980
which is what happens when you get
the balance between chaos and order,

365
00:13:53,981 --> 00:13:54,191
right?

366
00:13:54,191 --> 00:13:57,250
Is that meaning is the
antidote to despair.

367
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,320
And so if you,

368
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:01,960
and there's all sorts of
reasons in life to be desperate.

369
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:04,540
And so if you immerse yourself in meaning,

370
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:05,650
you can learn to do that.

371
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:06,700
You can learn to do that.

372
00:14:06,701 --> 00:14:08,740
You can make that goal your highest goal.

373
00:14:08,741 --> 00:14:13,330
And so then the highest goal would be
to be the sort of mythological hero,

374
00:14:13,331 --> 00:14:13,811
let's say,

375
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:18,640
to embody and incarnate and
imitate the mythological hero,

376
00:14:18,641 --> 00:14:19,900
like the imitation of Christ,

377
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,550
which is what you're called to do.

378
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:22,930
If you happen to be Christian,

379
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:25,420
that means that you live in meaning.

380
00:14:25,421 --> 00:14:28,660
And that meaning is the antidote to the
suffering of life that would otherwise

381
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:32,110
make you brutal and vengeful
and unhappy and miserable.

382
00:14:32,111 --> 00:14:32,980
And like that,

383
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,270
that young guy who just mowed
down 12 people in Toronto,

384
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,890
these are real things.

385
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,390
You lose your sense of meaning.

386
00:14:40,391 --> 00:14:42,420
You end up in hell and inhale,

387
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,410
you do all sorts of terrible things.

388
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,191
These are,

389
00:14:45,191 --> 00:14:49,840
these are dreadful realities and it
isn't as if they're not grounded in the

390
00:14:49,841 --> 00:14:51,010
appropriate science.
