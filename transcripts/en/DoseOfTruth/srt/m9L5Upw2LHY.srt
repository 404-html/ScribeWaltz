1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:11,430
No young was a student of niches you see.

2
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:13,260
And he was also,

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,780
I would say at the very
astute critic of nature,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,050
he was educated by Freud and Freud.

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:20,760
Freud,

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,340
I suppose in some sense
started to collate,

7
00:00:23,341 --> 00:00:27,750
collate the information that we had
pertaining to the notion that people lived

8
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:28,680
inside a dream.

9
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:28,891
You know,

10
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:32,870
it was Freud who really popularized
the idea of the unconscious mind.

11
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,740
And we take this for granted to such a
degree today that we don't understand how

12
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:39,180
revolutionary the idea was.

13
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:42,930
Like with what's happened with Freud is
that we've taken all the marrow out of

14
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:44,310
his bones so to speak,

15
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:45,990
less the husk behind.

16
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:46,910
And you know,

17
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,270
now when we think about Freud,

18
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:51,750
we just think about the husk because
that's everything that's been discarded.

19
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:55,050
But so much of what he discovered as
part of our popular conception now

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,280
including the idea that your perceptions
and your actions and your thoughts are

21
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:00,114
all,

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:00,990
um,

23
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:01,620
what would you say?

24
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:06,620
Informed and shaped by unconscious
motivations that are not part of your

25
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:07,950
voluntary control.

26
00:01:07,951 --> 00:01:08,880
And that's a very,

27
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:09,990
very strange thing.

28
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:14,340
It's one of the most unsettling things
about the psychoanalytic theories.

29
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:18,810
Cause the psychoanalytic
theories or something like
you're a loose collection of

30
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:23,760
living sub personalities each with its
own set of motivations and perceptions

31
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,260
and emotions and rationales,

32
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:26,220
all of that,

33
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,590
and you have limited control over that.

34
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:30,270
So you're like a plurality of,

35
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:30,960
of,

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,320
of,

37
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,130
of internal personalities that's
loosely late into a unity.

38
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:39,180
You know that because you can't
control yourself very well,

39
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:43,080
which is one of Hume's objections to
Nietzsche's idea that we could create our

40
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:43,890
own values.

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:45,330
So young didn't believe that,

42
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,380
especially not after interacting with
Freud because he saw that human beings

43
00:01:49,381 --> 00:01:51,840
were affected by things that were deeply,

44
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:54,990
deeply effected by things that were
beyond their conscious control.

45
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,780
And no one really knows how
to conceptualize those things.

46
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,291
You know,

47
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,900
the cognitive psychologists
think about them in some senses,

48
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,990
computational machines
and the ancient people,

49
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,490
I think thought of them as God's,

50
00:02:05,491 --> 00:02:07,050
although it's more complex than that,

51
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:08,610
like rage would be a god.

52
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:09,444
Mars,

53
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:10,800
the god of rage.

54
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:13,080
That's the thing that possesses
you when you're angry,

55
00:02:13,081 --> 00:02:13,291
you know,

56
00:02:13,291 --> 00:02:14,540
it has a viewpoint and it,

57
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,110
it it,

58
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,190
it says what it wants to say.

59
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:20,070
And that might have very little to do
with what you want to say when you're

60
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:22,530
being sensible and it
doesn't just inhabit.

61
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:26,910
You had inhabits everyone and it lives
forever and it even inhabits animals.

62
00:02:26,911 --> 00:02:31,911
And so it's this transcendent
psychological entity
that inhabits the body

63
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:34,990
politic light,

64
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,450
like a thought in habits,

65
00:02:36,451 --> 00:02:37,051
the brain.

66
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:38,520
That's one way of thinking about it.

67
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,260
It's very strange way of thinking,

68
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,130
but it certainly,

69
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:44,280
it certainly has its merits and so,

70
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,031
and those things,

71
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:45,990
well in some sense,

72
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:46,710
those are daddies.
