1
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,650
Dr. Peterson,

2
00:00:08,651 --> 00:00:10,690
I'm really hoping you can
share your thoughts on the day.

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:11,524
Just shooting.

4
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,653
Yeah.

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:15,911
Well,

6
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:20,030
what I would do is recommend the
biblical lecture I did on Cain enabled,

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,681
I would say,

8
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:25,681
because I think that that's a good
summary of the state of mind that somebody

9
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:29,740
has to be in in order to do
what was done at Los Vegas.

10
00:00:29,741 --> 00:00:32,020
So you have to be very,

11
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:35,950
very embittered by life in
order to do that sort of thing.

12
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:38,770
And you have to be searching for revenge,

13
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:39,341
I would say.

14
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:40,420
And it's not,

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:40,751
you know,

16
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:41,381
you might think,

17
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:41,561
well,

18
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:45,730
it's only revenge on other people because
you've developed a hatred for people.

19
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:46,900
But it's deeper than that.

20
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:48,910
It's not just hatred for people.

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,700
I would say it's hatred
for being itself and,

22
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:57,220
and the desire to take revenge on being
for the outrage of the tragedy and

23
00:00:57,221 --> 00:00:59,200
suffering that's associated with being,

24
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,370
um,

25
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,910
and maybe the tragedy and suffering
that's been part and parcel of your own

26
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:04,670
life.

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,860
And that makes you embittered.

28
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:10,390
And then past embittered becomes
outraged and past outrage becomes well

29
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:12,250
homicidal or even genocidal.

30
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,430
And that's a terrible
state of mind to begin.

31
00:01:15,431 --> 00:01:16,540
It's a hellish state.

32
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,093
Um,

33
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:23,580
I believe that the best way
to conceptualize the state
of mind that someone has

34
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:26,920
to be at in order to do something like
the Columbine shootings for example,

35
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:29,910
or what happened in Las Vegas
is that you're really an hour.

36
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
You have to speak about it
and religious languages.

37
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:33,820
You're really out for revenge against God,

38
00:01:33,821 --> 00:01:35,410
for the outrage of creation.

39
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:37,150
That's what it looks like to me.

40
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,650
And that's a state of mind that's truly
hellish and you could get there by

41
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:42,670
broody long enough.

42
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,960
Now it's also possible,

43
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:46,750
I mean this guy didn't
have any previous history,

44
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,300
criminal history or anything
like that and he's pretty old.

45
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,140
So you know,

46
00:01:50,141 --> 00:01:54,970
there's also all also the possibility
of some kind of neurological pathology

47
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:57,580
that that might be characteristic of him.

48
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:57,881
You know,

49
00:01:57,881 --> 00:02:00,130
some degenerative neurological disease.

50
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:04,960
There was a kid years ago
at the University of Texas
in Austin who climbed up on

51
00:02:04,961 --> 00:02:08,830
the tower there and shot a
number of people with a high
powered rifle and he had

52
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:13,831
a fast growing tumor on his hypothalamus
and had reported like these being

53
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,930
overcome with extreme feelings of rage.

54
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,420
And so that's another possibility.

55
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,970
But I would say the,

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,690
uh,

57
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,050
embitterment hypothesis
is the strongest one.

58
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,550
I would also say too,

59
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,460
I noticed the Steven
Pinker tweeted this today,

60
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:34,360
is that one of the ways of controlling
this sort of thing would be for the press

61
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:35,194
to agree,

62
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,600
not for there to be a blanket agreement,

63
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:42,630
not to publicize the name or any other
identity markers of the people who do the

64
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:43,271
shooting.

65
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:46,240
Because there's also this really,

66
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:47,560
what would you call it?

67
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,693
Arrogance.

68
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,940
It's a kind of arrogance
and pride last ditch,

69
00:02:51,941 --> 00:02:56,941
arrogance and pride that
that is associated with the
fantasies that drive this

70
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:57,880
sort of behavior.

71
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,590
And the fantasy is like,

72
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,580
well,

73
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,780
after I do this,

74
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,210
everyone will sure know the who,

75
00:03:03,211 --> 00:03:04,630
who the hell I was.

76
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:04,931
You know,

77
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,650
even though maybe I was ignored or
unhappy when I was alive after I'm get,

78
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:11,120
everybody's going to know
who I was and what idea,

79
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:11,981
you know,

80
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:15,070
so there's this underground
desire for fame,

81
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:17,020
I guess it's notoriety,

82
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:19,810
but notoriety might be
preferable to being ignored.

83
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,123
And so,

84
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,341
you know,

85
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,170
there's a lot of talk about gun control,

86
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,370
and that's understandable,

87
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,530
especially with regards
to automatic rifles.

88
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:27,783
Um,

89
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,820
although I also understand why the
people who are gun owners are afraid of,

90
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,490
of,

91
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,240
of,

92
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:38,050
of allowing what they regarded as
one of their fundamental rights to be

93
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:38,950
infringed upon.

94
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,620
But it would certainly be useful if we
stopped giving people who do this sort of

95
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:44,871
thing,

96
00:03:44,871 --> 00:03:49,300
not $100 million worth of free publicity
and all the notoriety they can manage.

97
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:50,170
So,

98
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,411
you know,

99
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:52,540
that's another way of
thinking about controlling it.

100
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,500
So.
