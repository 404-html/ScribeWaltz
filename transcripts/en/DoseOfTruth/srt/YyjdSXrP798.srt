1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,400
So now we've also spent a lot
of time selecting entrepreneurs.

2
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:15,401
I work with this company in California
that has started schools for

3
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:19,670
entrepreneurs in a 100 and now I think
160 different countries all over the

4
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:20,130
world.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,590
This the guy who started this,

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,210
whose name is a Dale ressies,

7
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:23,810
it real,

8
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,920
it's an absolute monster.

9
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:29,900
The guy started while all he started
all those six schools in five years,

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,310
165 schools,

11
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:33,350
you know in all all across the world,

12
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,010
eight different languages and we've been
screening people for entrepreneurial

13
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:39,140
ability and if you're going
to be an entrepreneur,

14
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,180
you almost have the opposite profile.

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,073
As a soldier,

16
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,340
you're very high in openness and you're
lower in conscientiousness or at least

17
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:47,930
conscientiousness is irrelevant.

18
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:51,800
And the reason for that seems to be that
like if you're an orderly person and

19
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,900
you'd like to follow up
procedures and rules,

20
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,530
it's kind of hard for you to start a
company because when you first start a

21
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:59,810
company or engage in any
other creative process,

22
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,330
because entrepreneurs turned
out to be the same as artists,

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,190
you kind of have to,

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,190
you're not operating within
a rural governance structure.

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,671
In fact,

26
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:12,410
there may be many times where you
have to break a small rule to,

27
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:15,300
to move properly at a
higher level of analysis.

28
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:15,560
There's,

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,530
there's no algorithmic way
of generating a new company,

30
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:18,980
right?

31
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,813
Obviously.

32
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,520
And so it's people who
are very high in openness,

33
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,350
who happened to be good entrepreneurs.

34
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:25,440
And so they just,

35
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,810
something I thought was
extraordinarily cool because we'd,

36
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,510
we'd also already known what predicts
managerial administrative and academic

37
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:36,660
ability and Iq is crucial
for any complex jobs.

38
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,910
So we'll just leave that behind.

39
00:01:37,911 --> 00:01:39,800
But what predicts academic ability,

40
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:43,940
for example at the University of
Toronto is an intelligence obviously,

41
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,410
but also conscientiousness.

42
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,790
The correlation between creativity
and grades at the UFT is zero.

43
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,043
Zero.

44
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,100
Right?

45
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,671
But it's not,

46
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,810
it's not surprising
that the thing is that,

47
00:01:54,811 --> 00:01:54,981
you know,

48
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,420
it's easy to be cynical about that.

49
00:01:56,421 --> 00:02:00,000
But one of the things you
have to understand about
creative people is that they

50
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,490
continually step outside of the
domain of evaluation structures.

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,061
Right?

52
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:09,650
Cause if you're going to say you're going
to evaluate a hundred performance of a

53
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,450
hundred professors on
their lecturing ability,

54
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,800
well you kind of have to measure what's
common across all the professors in

55
00:02:15,801 --> 00:02:18,320
order to come up with the
standards for evaluation.

56
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,430
Well that means you're not going to be
able to use that structure to evaluate a

57
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:26,810
particularly creative professor because
he or she is going to do something in a

58
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:30,260
way that's so different that it won't
show up on the evaluation measure.

59
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,600
And of course that's what
happens in universities.

60
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:33,434
You know,

61
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,010
um,

62
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:36,350
somebody sent me a couple of days ago,

63
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,130
somebody sent me an essay that they had
written for their master's thesis that

64
00:02:40,131 --> 00:02:44,960
was wildly creative and
they were basically told to
leave the program and that

65
00:02:44,961 --> 00:02:45,794
they couldn't continue.

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,640
Not in a mean way.

67
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:47,000
They,

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,181
well,

69
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:49,370
what happened was that what
they were thinking was,

70
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:53,870
so outside of the conventions
in the discipline is that
no one had any idea what

71
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:54,860
to do with the essay.

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:55,851
So,

73
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,980
and then that's really the
law of creative people,

74
00:02:57,981 --> 00:02:58,161
right?

75
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:02,830
They're always stepping of evaluation
structures and so it's not that surprising

76
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:07,180
that the relationship between creativity
and grades at the u of t is zero.

77
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,320
We found out as well by
looking at graduate student
performance across multiple

78
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,154
institutions,

79
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,000
that there was a negative correlation
between creativity and graduate school

80
00:03:16,001 --> 00:03:16,834
performance.

81
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,160
It wasn't even zero.

82
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:19,420
It was worse than negative.

83
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,750
Being creative was negative and you think,

84
00:03:22,751 --> 00:03:24,400
well that could make you cynical as well,

85
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:24,770
but,

86
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,770
but you can't be cynical in that way
because one of the things that happens in

87
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:35,101
science is that science tends to progress
incrementally rather than in great

88
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:39,510
leaps now and then someone comes along
who blows the structure out of a science

89
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,160
advances it ridiculously like Einstein.

90
00:03:42,161 --> 00:03:43,570
But like most people are,

91
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:45,460
nine Stein had may be thank God for that.

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:48,520
Most of the time you're in a discipline,

93
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:48,760
you,

94
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,500
you understand the discipline,

95
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,440
and then once you've developed
understanding of the discipline,

96
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,580
you know what the next micro
question is that should be answered.

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,480
And part of the reason that science is
so powerful is because it allows people

98
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:06,220
who aren't genius level creatives to
make real advances in the generation of

99
00:04:06,221 --> 00:04:06,970
knowledge.

100
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,160
One tiny micro step at a time.

101
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,900
It doesn't matter if there's 100,000
people doing it and each of them is making

102
00:04:13,901 --> 00:04:14,621
a micro step.

103
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:14,861
Man,

104
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:17,740
we're zipping along as fast as
we possibly want to zip along.

105
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,990
And so it turns out to
be conscientiousness.

106
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:22,450
That's the excellent predictor
of graduate student performance.

107
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,400
That's the best predictor for law.

108
00:04:24,401 --> 00:04:26,740
It's the best predictor
for managerial positions.

109
00:04:26,741 --> 00:04:29,140
It's the best predictor for
administrative positions.

110
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,860
Anything that has a structure of
rules that needs to be applied,

111
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,290
conscientiousness is a great predictor.

112
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:35,861
So,

113
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:39,430
but it's not good for predicting artistic
ability or entrepreneurial ability.

114
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:42,010
And that's also really important
because one of the things,

115
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,440
this is partly why bureaucracies stultify,

116
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,581
right?

117
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:46,810
Because what happens is they,

118
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,591
as they develop,

119
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:51,250
they get chock full of conscientious
people with a few psychopaths thrown in

120
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,590
there just for good measure
that get chocked full of,

121
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:58,740
of conscientious people busily zooming
efficiently down to single track.

122
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,560
And then all of a sudden the landscape
shifts and they're going very,

123
00:05:02,561 --> 00:05:05,350
very efficiently in exactly
the wrong direction.

124
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,150
And then the whole
bloody thing falls apart.

125
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,300
So you need to have some creative wing
nuts in your organization to come up with

126
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:16,660
completely absurd ideas that might
just on the off chance be true.

127
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:21,340
And so creativity is strange in that
manner too because it's a high risk,

128
00:05:21,341 --> 00:05:22,360
high return game.

129
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,510
You're a lot safer in your life to find
a functioning entity and to operate as a

130
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:30,670
cog within it as long as the
entity keeps functioning.

131
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,080
Because if you're creative and you
go off on tangents all the time,

132
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,190
there's some probability that one of
those tangents is going to be exactly what

133
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:42,130
is needed at the time and you're
going to become hyper successful as a

134
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:42,964
consequence.

135
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,120
But there's much more probability
that even though your,

136
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,400
some of your ideas might
be highly valuable,

137
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:52,270
the probability that this is the
right time and place for them is

138
00:05:52,271 --> 00:05:53,710
extraordinarily low.

139
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:56,350
So to produce a successful
creative product,

140
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,891
for example,

141
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:57,800
in the marketplace,

142
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,810
you need a ridiculous combination of
creativity so that you keep generating

143
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:07,811
ideas and then a network around you of
people who have skills that you don't,

144
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,280
and then the production of a,

145
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,780
of a product,

146
00:06:11,781 --> 00:06:13,130
let's say whatever that happens to be,

147
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,340
that's actually in demand
by the marketplace at
exactly that moment and that

148
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,450
someone else hasn't already done better.

149
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:25,840
So the sensible thing to tell anybody
who wants to be creative is that stupid.

150
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,471
You shouldn't do it.

151
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:27,661
It's,

152
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:32,661
it's your probability of success is so
low that it's better just to do something

153
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:33,710
sensible.

154
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,310
But the problem with that is that creative
people can't do that because they're

155
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,130
creative and if they shut
down their creativity,

156
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,290
it's like an extrovert
who's gone to live in a,

157
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,860
you know,

158
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,210
in an isolated cell,

159
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,520
a creative person who
isn't being creative,

160
00:06:46,521 --> 00:06:47,354
they just,

161
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,890
they just wither and die.

162
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,300
So they're stuck with it.

163
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:50,840
So,

164
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,280
but it is a high risk,

165
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:53,600
high return strategy.

166
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:57,470
So probably better if you want
to be creative or if you are,

167
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:00,680
and you should take this advice to heart
because I'd been watching people for a

168
00:07:00,681 --> 00:07:01,514
long time.

169
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,800
If you want to engage
in a creative pursuit,

170
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,430
you should find something stable to do
that will generate you an income and you

171
00:07:09,771 --> 00:07:12,530
should pursue the thing that
you're creative about on the side.

172
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:17,420
Because monetizing creative production
is so bloody difficult that especially

173
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:20,060
now like especially in
like artistic domains,

174
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,890
generation of music
and that sort of thing.

175
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:26,891
It's like you just have no idea how many
million songs there are on the Internet

176
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,650
and the vast majority of the commercially
available get downloaded zero times,

177
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:34,011
like 80 PR,

178
00:07:34,011 --> 00:07:37,940
I think there's 80 million
songs or something like that
on the net and I believe

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,590
it's something in the neighborhood of
70 million get downloaded zero times and

180
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,000
then there's 100 that can get
downloaded like 350 million times.

181
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,870
And so those people are wildly
successful and everyone else collapses in

182
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:51,440
failure.

183
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,273
Yep.

184
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:55,483
No,

185
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,930
we'll talk about that more.

186
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:57,441
Okay.

187
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:59,090
So that's not a bad overview for,

188
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,270
for initial foray into psychometrics.
