1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:03,600
You can find any piece of art
that ever existed on Google.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:05,100
And so that's great.

3
00:00:05,101 --> 00:00:05,311
So,

4
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:05,551
you know,

5
00:00:05,551 --> 00:00:07,080
when I'm trying to illustrate these,

6
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,251
these lectures,

7
00:00:08,251 --> 00:00:13,251
I type in Abraham Renaissance and then
like I get 200 renaissance paintings.

8
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:14,791
It's so great.

9
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:15,630
And then I can look at them.

10
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:18,750
And one of the other things that's
so remarkable is that all of these,

11
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,800
the major themes of these stories
have been illustrated by people of

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,510
spectacular,

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,160
my mind,

14
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,170
mind expanding talent.

15
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,830
You know,

16
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:32,100
there's just this endless array of,

17
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:32,641
well,

18
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:33,270
look at that.

19
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,103
I mean,

20
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,460
that's an amazing painting.

21
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:37,441
And so,

22
00:00:37,441 --> 00:00:38,100
and there's,

23
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,371
and,

24
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,180
and have this,

25
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:39,271
uh,

26
00:00:39,271 --> 00:00:39,571
there's,

27
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:43,770
there's dozens of paintings on this
theme and it's just another indication of

28
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:45,270
how obsessed people,

29
00:00:45,271 --> 00:00:45,451
you know,

30
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:49,350
this was the only book that existed
for years and people were absolutely

31
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,980
obsessed by it and produced all
these amazing things from it.

32
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,170
And we're in danger of losing that.

33
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:57,870
And that's a big mistake
because it's magnificent.

34
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,440
A little humility would go a
long way towards restoring it.
