1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,150
I also spent a lot of time reading Carl
Young and it was through [inaudible] and

2
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:09,390
also John Piaget who was a developmental
psychologist that I started to

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:14,391
understand that are articulated systems
of thought are embedded in something

4
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:16,050
like a dream.

5
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:20,820
And that dream is informed in a
complex way by the way we act.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,230
So you know,

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,070
we act out things we don't
understand all the time.

8
00:00:26,071 --> 00:00:27,240
And if that wasn't the case,

9
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:30,840
then we wouldn't need a psychology or
a sociology and anthropology or any of

10
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:33,480
that because we would be completely
transparent to ourselves.

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,830
And we're clearly not.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,340
So we're much more complicated
than we understand,

13
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:42,570
which means that the way that we behave
contains way more information than we

14
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:43,404
know.

15
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:48,650
And part of the dream that surrounds our
articulated know of his being extracted

16
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:53,190
as a consequence of us watching each
other and behave and telling stories about

17
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,680
it for thousands and thousands
and thousands of years.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,800
Extracting out patterns of behavior
that characterize humanity and trying to

19
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:02,460
represent them,

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,481
pardon me,

21
00:01:03,481 --> 00:01:04,291
through imitation,

22
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,310
but also through drama and mythology and
literature and art and all of that to

23
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:09,420
represent what we're like.

24
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:11,070
So that we can understand what we're like.

25
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:15,720
And that process of understanding
is what I see unfolding,

26
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,620
at least in part,

27
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,700
the biblical stories.

28
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,210
And it's,

29
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:22,020
it's halting and partial and
awkward and contradictory and,

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,093
and all of that,

31
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,500
which is one of the things
that makes the book so complex.

32
00:01:25,501 --> 00:01:29,820
But I see in it the struggle
of humanity to arise,

33
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,120
to rise above its animal forebear say,

34
00:01:33,121 --> 00:01:35,670
and to become conscious of
what it means to be human.

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,210
And that's a very difficult thing
because we don't know who we are,

36
00:01:39,211 --> 00:01:39,811
what we are,

37
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,670
where we came from or any of those things.

38
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:42,750
And you know,

39
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:46,770
the light life is an unbroken chain going
back three and a half billion years.

40
00:01:46,771 --> 00:01:48,540
It's an absolutely unbelievable thing.

41
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,950
Every single one of your
ancestors reproduce successfully
for three and a half

42
00:01:52,951 --> 00:01:53,880
billion years.

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,950
It's absolutely unbelievable.

44
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,290
We rose out of the dirt and the Muck,

45
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,390
and here we are conscious,

46
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,650
but not knowing.
