1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:10,590
Would you consider a more official
consultancy role with Andrew Scheer's

2
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:12,650
Conservative Party?
Uh,

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,330
it's very difficult to say what I would
consider.

4
00:00:15,331 --> 00:00:20,310
It isn't obvious to me that Andrew
Scheer would particularly like to have

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,180
me as no official consultant time kind
of a,

6
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,820
what might you describe a controversial?
Yes,

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,130
that's the word right now.
And so,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,500
you know,
it's funny though because I was making

9
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:34,620
this new video today,
which I alluded to earlier,

10
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:38,850
using good old,
what's this character here?

11
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,120
A Hitler,
the Hitler,

12
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:44,140
the spokes frog.
And uh,

13
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,700
I,
I went back and looked at my comments on

14
00:00:47,701 --> 00:00:49,860
bill [inaudible] last year,
which,

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,000
which were the comments that originally
got me in hot water and had me accused

16
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:56,460
of all the things I've been accused of
Transphobia,

17
00:00:56,461 --> 00:00:57,960
bigotry,
racism.

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,080
Um,
what else?

19
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,750
Oh,
you fascism being on the far right.

20
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,880
And then finally,
and to top it all off,

21
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:06,810
Hitler himself.

22
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,780
And one of the things that I realized
was that,

23
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,540
that I was really calm during that
video.

24
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,350
You couldn't have really.
I couldn't have offered a more mild

25
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:18,670
mannered criticism,
a bill [inaudible].

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,360
And it's pretty funny because,
you know,

27
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm this scandal that engulfed Wilford
Laurey a this week is the worst scandal

28
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:30,230
that I remember involving a university
in,

29
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,410
in,
in my memory,

30
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,440
going back to the 19 seventies.
And what happened at Laurie was exactly

31
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:41,580
what I predicted would happen except it
was actually worse because they did

32
00:01:41,581 --> 00:01:46,581
accuse Lynsay of breaking the law spill,
see 16 specifically.

33
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:49,620
And if contravening the Ontario Human
Rights Code,

34
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:50,630
which I,
you know,

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,760
for all I know she might've done.
So we're,

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,060
we're at this situation where a Ta
showing a video of someone discussing

37
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:05,031
pronouns and candidate can now be termed
a hate crime and illegal provincially

38
00:02:06,811 --> 00:02:09,750
and federally.
And like all the usual suspects have

39
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:10,584
come out of there.

40
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,680
Their caves,
let's say.

41
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,280
I'm like Brenda Cossman,
the lawyer I debated last year and said,

42
00:02:17,281 --> 00:02:19,260
well,
it's a real stretch to assume that what

43
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:21,890
Lindsay Shepherd did was,
was,

44
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:26,040
you know,
sufficiently reprehensible to actually

45
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:30,720
constitute a violation of the Ontario
Human Rights Commission guidelines,

46
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,050
policies,
uh,

47
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,710
hits a stretch.
So I guess we're supposed to feel good

48
00:02:34,711 --> 00:02:36,000
about that.
But,

49
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:40,020
um,
I'm probably a little bit too hot right

50
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:43,580
now to serve in any official consultant
role.

51
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,790
Uh,
that doesn't mean that I wouldn't be

52
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,610
happy to speak to,
you know,

53
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,230
political figures who might be
interested in speaking with me because,

54
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,900
you know,
I generally speak to people who asked me

55
00:02:57,901 --> 00:02:59,100
to speak to them.
So,

56
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,760
um,
as reprehensible as that might be.
