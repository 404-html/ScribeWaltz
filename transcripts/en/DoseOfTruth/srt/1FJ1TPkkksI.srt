1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:10,560
One of the things that I've been
realizing

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:14,670
as a consequence of going through these
stories is that

3
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:21,730
the degree to which there are about
individuals is quite remarkable and I

4
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:24,130
think that's really telling,
you know,

5
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,900
one of the reasons I prefer Dostoyevsky
Tolstoy because Tolstoy is more of a

6
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:32,560
sociologist.
He's more interested in the relationship

7
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:35,680
between groups of people.
This is an oversimplification because

8
00:00:35,681 --> 00:00:37,300
obviously Tolstoy,
he's a great author,

9
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:40,060
but yeah,
I like Dostoyevsky better because he

10
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:43,930
really delves into the souls of
individuals and I think it's remarkable

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,260
the degree to which all of the stories
that we've covered so far in genesis are

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:54,460
about individuals and they're quite
realistic,

13
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,030
which is quite remarkable too.
They're not really romanticize to any

14
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:01,540
great degree because all of the people
that are regardless,

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,850
regardless,
let's say as patriarchal or matriarchal

16
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:07,990
figures in genesis have no shortage of
ethical,

17
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:11,260
different,
no shortage of ethical flaws and also no

18
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:14,470
shortage of difficulties in their life
and the difficulties are realistic

19
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,300
there.

20
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,290
They're major league problems,
you know,

21
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:22,291
like familial catastrophes and famine
and war and revenge and hatred and all

22
00:01:22,811 --> 00:01:23,680
those things.
It's not a,

23
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,240
it's not a pretty,
it's not a pretty book and that's one of

24
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:31,120
the things that makes it great.
I mean that's one of the things that

25
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:32,710
characterize this great literature
right,

26
00:01:32,711 --> 00:01:34,540
is that it,
it doesn't present you with a

27
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:36,790
whitewashed view of,
of,

28
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,410
of humanity or of existence.
And that's really a relief I think,

29
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:44,290
because as you all know,
because you're alive,

30
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,530
there's no such thing as a whitewash
existence like your to be alive is to be

31
00:01:50,201 --> 00:01:53,890
in trouble ethically and existentially.

32
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,450
I've been reading this book recently,
I'll talk about it a little bit later.

33
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:05,451
It's called better never to have been.
And it was written by a philosopher in

34
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,940
South Africa in Cape Town named Ben
Atar,

35
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:12,600
that's his last name.
And he basically argues,

36
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,210
I think it's a specious argument and I
think it's artificially constructed,

37
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:23,010
but he basically argues that because
life is so full of suffering,

38
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,850
even good lives are very much full of
suffering.

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,520
That it's wrong to bring children into
the world because the suffering

40
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:36,270
outweighs the good even in good lives.
And it's actually wrong.

41
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,230
It would also be better not to exist for
exactly the same reason.

42
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,850
And my sense in reading the book is that
he came to that conclusion and then

43
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:48,750
wrote the book to justify it,
which is actually the reverse of the way

44
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,150
that you should write a book.
What you should do when you're writing a

45
00:02:51,151 --> 00:02:53,700
book is you should have a question and
you should,

46
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,320
it should be a real question,
right?

47
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,120
It should be one you don't know the
answer to.

48
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,120
And then you should be studying and
writing like mad and reading everything

49
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:04,840
you can get your hands on to see if you
can actually grapple with the problem

50
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,800
and come to some solution and you should
walk the reader as well through your

51
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:11,740
process of thinking so that they can
come to the,

52
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,050
well,
not necessary to the same conclusion,

53
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,620
but it at least track what you're doing.
And I don't think that's what he did.

54
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:21,130
I think he wrote it backwards,
but then an a and so I was thinking

55
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:26,131
about it a lot because that's actually a
question that I've contended with in my

56
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,680
writing.
There are Memphis to Ophelia and are

57
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,320
satanic figures,
for example,

58
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:35,860
in girth is Faust and also Ivan in the,
in the,

59
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:39,490
in the brothers Karamazov who basically
make the same case,

60
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:42,730
you know,
that existence is so rife with trouble

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,690
and suffering that it would be better if
it didn't exist at all.

62
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,770
And the problem I've had with that,
there's a variety of them,

63
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,010
but one of the problems I've had with
that is what happens if you start to

64
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:56,950
think that way?
Because what I've observed is that

65
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,310
people who begin to think that way,
that isn't where they stop.

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,650
Like it,
they get angry at existence,

67
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:05,380
which is what happened to Cain as we saw
in the Cain and Abel Story.

68
00:04:05,381 --> 00:04:09,370
And then the next step is to start
taking revenge against existence.

69
00:04:09,371 --> 00:04:12,190
And that cascades until it's revenge
against.

70
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:15,730
While I think the best way of thinking
about it as revenge against God for the

71
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:18,460
crime of being,
which is I think the deepest sort of

72
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,840
hatred that you can entertain.
And,

73
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:23,110
and,
and when you're in the grip of a really

74
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:25,840
deep emotion,
like a really profound emotion,

75
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:29,170
right at the bottom of emotions,
you're in something that's like a quasi

76
00:04:29,171 --> 00:04:30,070
religious state.

77
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,350
And that's more or less independent of
your belief,

78
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,420
say in a transcendent deity.
I mean,

79
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,560
you can be in a profoundly emotional
state that's as deep as it can be and it

80
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:41,890
can have religious significance without
that necessarily signifying anything

81
00:04:41,891 --> 00:04:43,750
about a transcendent be it,
you know,

82
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,420
but,
but then I was thinking,

83
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,430
you see,
the problem with that argument is you

84
00:04:48,431 --> 00:04:50,830
can gerrymander it endlessly.
You know,

85
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:53,500
because first of all,
how do you measure suffering and how do

86
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:55,990
you measure happiness?
It's like how do you assign weights to

87
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:57,160
them?
And God,

88
00:04:57,190 --> 00:05:00,610
there's just no way of doing that.
You have to do it arbitrarily.

89
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,780
And so you can make an argument that the
suffering outweighs the happiness.

90
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:07,330
You just wait the suffering more heavily
than you wait the happiness.

91
00:05:07,331 --> 00:05:08,560
And that's the end of that,
you know?

92
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,330
And so that's,
that's a problem.

93
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,510
But I think there's a deeper problem.
