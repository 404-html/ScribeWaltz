1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:07,700
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,660
So back to where you were saying before
about the striving upwards towards

3
00:00:11,661 --> 00:00:13,940
something that happened up there,

4
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:14,930
whatever that is.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,770
Um,

6
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:19,310
of course we don't want to go for utopia
because there's no such place to get to

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,460
and that causes catastrophes in history.

8
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,120
So,

9
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,090
but the idea of like,

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:27,770
of like making the world
a more rational place,

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,880
this is a good goal.

12
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:31,490
And this is the kind of thing
that we do at skeptic magazine.

13
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:32,810
I what did we do?

14
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:35,210
We promote science and
reason and critical thinking.

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,950
You write about critical thinking,

16
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,970
this is what you do.

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,060
So we're all working on that
and that and and that's good.

18
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:42,000
Um,

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,180
yeah.

20
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,200
Well I'm always looking at,

21
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:44,961
sorry,

22
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:45,794
go ahead.

23
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:49,160
We'll be talking about
literature for example.

24
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:53,800
It's returned to the books of the Bible
or dusty SD or if we want to make our

25
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,280
listeners' heads explode,

26
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,050
iron rand and atlas shrug.

27
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,900
Why have people by the tens of
millions purchased her books?

28
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:03,621
You know,

29
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:05,000
literary critics say they're awful,

30
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:05,541
they're terrible.

31
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,840
Novels are not well written and her
figures are black and white and her

32
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:09,830
philosophy is wrong.

33
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:10,430
Okay,

34
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:10,851
let me,

35
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:11,601
you have to ask yourself,

36
00:01:11,601 --> 00:01:14,090
why do tens of millions of
people love those books?

37
00:01:14,091 --> 00:01:14,750
And,

38
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:17,380
and it's because she's
doing something else.

39
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:20,210
He's not trying to describe the
world the way it actually is,

40
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,410
but that the way it could be.

41
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,810
And these are the things we've done wrong.

42
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,441
Communism,

43
00:01:24,441 --> 00:01:25,011
socialism,

44
00:01:25,011 --> 00:01:27,350
because she came out of
that Russian background.

45
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,260
And so her figures like John Golf,

46
00:01:30,261 --> 00:01:32,910
these are kind of ideal
things to strive for.

47
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,461
Yes,

48
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:34,294
exactly.

49
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,990
Her fingers are archetypal
heroes of a certain form.

50
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,380
If we could bring it back
to some real world example,

51
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,370
I just recently,

52
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,190
recently started following
a Jocko Willink feel,

53
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:47,870
okay,

54
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm never going to be Jocko Willink,

55
00:01:49,361 --> 00:01:50,081
but you know,

56
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:53,410
I got this book and I read
one page a day and it,

57
00:01:53,411 --> 00:01:53,621
you know,

58
00:01:53,621 --> 00:01:54,170
it's kind of,

59
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:54,780
it's sort of like,

60
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,613
oh yeah,

61
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,170
you can get up at six in the morning
and get out there on your bike ride with

62
00:01:59,171 --> 00:01:59,830
the guys.

63
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,641
I don't want to do it.

64
00:02:00,641 --> 00:02:04,210
But then I see his page
and he's just get at it.

65
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:05,240
Okay.

66
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,100
So in a way,

67
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:08,530
it's not describing the
world in a scientific way.

68
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,120
It's,

69
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,500
it's,

70
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:11,260
it's sending a different message,

71
00:02:11,261 --> 00:02:13,870
like you should strive to be this,

72
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,860
even if you don't make it,

73
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:15,993
just do it.

74
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,871
Do something.

75
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:17,704
Anything.

76
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,530
And that's a different
sense of different goal.

77
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,081
Yes.

78
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:21,370
Well I,

79
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,590
I think to that.

80
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:23,701
Okay.

81
00:02:23,701 --> 00:02:24,421
So first of all,

82
00:02:24,421 --> 00:02:25,670
with regards to any round,

83
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,010
I think the criticism leveled at her that
her characters are too black and white

84
00:02:29,011 --> 00:02:29,730
is correct.

85
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,810
Because I think that one of the things
that distinguishes great literature from

86
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:36,690
propaganda is that in great literature,

87
00:02:36,691 --> 00:02:39,450
most of the conflict is
within rather than between.

88
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,831
Right?

89
00:02:40,831 --> 00:02:41,251
And so,

90
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:44,910
and the problem with the round is all
her good characters are the same good

91
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:48,240
character and all her bad characters
are the same bad character.

92
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:48,810
And,

93
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,310
and there's no overlap between them.

94
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:51,420
So there's a curiosity,

95
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,130
there's an architectural purity,

96
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,460
but that compromises its
utility as literature.

97
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,294
I would say

98
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,520
Soltra Neeson makes his point
in archipelago where he says,

99
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,140
if only the world,

100
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:04,870
we're simply black and white and
we can take the bad people and,

101
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,031
and,

102
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:06,430
and isolate them somewhere.

103
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,481
But the problem is,

104
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:07,810
is,

105
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:08,080
you know,

106
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,640
we all have a darkness
and evil in our hearts

107
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,500
between good and evil runs
down every hard doubts,

108
00:03:14,501 --> 00:03:15,570
his famous sprays.

109
00:03:15,571 --> 00:03:18,090
And it was something he experienced
very deeply and is also,

110
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:18,670
you know,

111
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,260
it's also pride,

112
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,960
primordial Lee true.

113
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:22,890
Whenever.

114
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,723
Awesome.

115
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,960
Just analyze literature in this sense.

116
00:03:25,961 --> 00:03:26,101
Well,

117
00:03:26,101 --> 00:03:27,210
there's a body of literature,

118
00:03:27,211 --> 00:03:27,980
evolutionary,

119
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,680
you know,

120
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,720
literary analysis in which,

121
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,920
um,

122
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,190
you know,

123
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,270
peep pinker writes about this at the
end of the blank slate in which he talks

124
00:03:36,271 --> 00:03:37,070
about,

125
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:37,903
you know,

126
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,300
these novels,

127
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,650
these sophisticated novels,

128
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,300
which the characters are rich and deep,

129
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:42,811
you know,

130
00:03:42,811 --> 00:03:45,680
they have all these good
characters and bad characters,

131
00:03:45,681 --> 00:03:46,830
characteristics and so on.

132
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,390
And uh,

133
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:49,200
and we can,

134
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,500
we can glean from that in a sense
that the novelists we're ahead of the

135
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:52,921
cognitive.

136
00:03:52,921 --> 00:03:53,754
This is his point.

137
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,760
The novelists we're about a century
ahead of the cognitive scientists and

138
00:03:56,761 --> 00:04:01,761
thinking that you're going to have human
nature or maybe a thousand years ahead

139
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:02,754
of

140
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,070
modern literature anyway,

141
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,330
you know,

142
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:06,930
so we can,

143
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,200
we can gain a lot from that.

144
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,400
Not just the rich emotional
experience of reading a good novel.

145
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,090
Uh,

146
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,570
but actually teasing out this is what
some of these evolutionary literary people

147
00:04:15,571 --> 00:04:16,111
are trying to do.

148
00:04:16,111 --> 00:04:19,470
It's like there's certain themes that
come up over and over and over again.

149
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,190
Uh,

150
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,570
it's not totally random.

151
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,620
Unlike the postmodernists there,

152
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,370
there actually are a certain real meanings
that the author intended and there

153
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,290
problem

154
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:30,561
c,

155
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:33,530
I think the problem with the
postmodernists technically speaking,

156
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:34,730
and I've thought a lot about this,

157
00:04:34,731 --> 00:04:37,670
is that they got their
initial criticism right,

158
00:04:37,671 --> 00:04:41,270
which is that there's an infinite number
of ways of interpreting a finite set of

159
00:04:41,271 --> 00:04:42,104
phenomenon,

160
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,610
but there isn't an,

161
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,563
there isn't an,

162
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:49,250
there isn't an infinite number of valid
ways of interpreting a finite set of

163
00:04:49,251 --> 00:04:50,084
phenomena.

164
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,040
And that's where you get right back
into the issue of the circulation of the

165
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:58,670
interpretation around these great
underlying architectural themes.

166
00:04:58,671 --> 00:05:01,670
And then our belt in large
part right into our biology,

167
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,490
I read a really interesting
analysis of the,

168
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,623
um,

169
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,880
of the symbol of the dragon awhile back.

170
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:10,850
And I can't conjure up the
name of the book unfortunately,

171
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:12,950
but his hypothesis,

172
00:05:12,951 --> 00:05:14,270
which I thought was a very good one,

173
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,104
was that,

174
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,010
um,

175
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,900
a dragon is a Metta Predator.

176
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:22,310
So it's the symbol for Predator and,

177
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,480
but it's more than that.

178
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,400
But the Predator is treat cat,

179
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,300
snake bird,

180
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,030
because the fundamental predators of
tree dwelling primates where cats,

181
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,530
snakes and birds.

182
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,100
And so what it is is an
amalgam of all those things.

183
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,600
And so it's real,

184
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:41,090
just like the category
of Predator is real,

185
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:44,720
even though snakes and cats are both
in the category of Predator and no one

186
00:05:44,721 --> 00:05:44,961
says,

187
00:05:44,961 --> 00:05:45,111
well,

188
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,760
there's no such thing as a predator.

189
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,030
And then you can add fire to
that for a variety of reasons,

190
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:51,660
not least being uh,

191
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,800
being I'm sure that fire white belt,

192
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,490
many of our ancestors as well.

193
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,810
And then the additional,

194
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,810
which is the dragon's also hoard gold.

195
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,400
So human beings,

196
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:02,540
because we're not just prey,

197
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:05,150
animals learned that if we
confronted the Metta Predator,

198
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:06,920
we would gain as a consequence.

199
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,460
There are certain channels down which
good stories go based on our biological

200
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,930
nature or evolved in nature.

201
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:17,180
It's not that it's completely
deterministic in that sense.

202
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,750
No,

203
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:17,930
no.

204
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:19,370
It's variations on a theme,

205
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:19,910
I would say.
