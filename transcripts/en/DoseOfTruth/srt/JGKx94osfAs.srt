1
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,520
So the burrito distribution governs
all sorts of other things too.

2
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:11,354
I mentioned

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:15,050
it governs the popularity of box,

4
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:16,130
the sales of books,

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,360
but it also,

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:22,870
it also characterizes the distribution
of everything that people produce.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:28,790
So if you think of creative production
of any sort of artistic production,

8
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,020
industrial production,

9
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:31,123
it doesn't matter.

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,400
Almost everything fails

11
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:41,340
and a few things succeed beyond
anyone's wildest imagination.

12
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,230
Apple's a good example of that.

13
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:43,711
No,

14
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:45,210
I mean the iPhone,

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,220
they have their competitors,

16
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:51,720
but it's an extraordinarily dominant
product and they rake in billions of

17
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:51,721
dollars,

18
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,554
I think.

19
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:55,440
I don't know if apple is
valued at $1 trillion,

20
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,600
but it's close to that.

21
00:00:58,620 --> 00:00:59,610
And that's a lot of money.

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,211
And I think,

23
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:01,320
if I remember correctly,

24
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,240
it's something like this.

25
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:04,470
I probably have the figures wrong,

26
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:06,150
but like the top 40 people,

27
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,810
the richest 40 people in the world have
as much money as the bottom 2 billion

28
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:11,581
right now.

29
00:01:11,581 --> 00:01:11,821
You know,

30
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,580
it's not like they're stuffing
their mattresses with that money,

31
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:17,100
or they have a skyscraper full of cash.

32
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,780
That money is out in the economy
doing whatever money does.

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,670
So you know you can't spend $28 billion.

34
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:27,780
So,

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,730
and sometimes you can
even do some good with it.

36
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:30,001
You know,

37
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:33,930
Bill Gates seems to be doing
something reasonable with his money.

38
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,310
But the reason I'm telling you this is
because one of the things you should know

39
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,270
is that this proclivity for inequality
is pervasive among the creative products

40
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:47,280
of human beings.

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,550
It's the case with with
goals scored in hockey.

42
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,930
My son told me,

43
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:55,020
and he's a reliable source
on hockey statistics that,

44
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,610
okay,

45
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,570
if Wayne Gretzky,

46
00:01:57,571 --> 00:02:02,571
if you don't count any of the points that
Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring is

47
00:02:02,681 --> 00:02:06,330
still had enough points
just with assistance to have
more points than any hockey

48
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:07,350
player that ever played.

49
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,750
So you know,

50
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,790
even at the upper end of,

51
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,380
of of the distribution,

52
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,730
there's some person who's Ha,

53
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,040
they're so good at what they do.

54
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:21,060
And then there's another person that's
so much better than them that it's not

55
00:02:21,061 --> 00:02:22,140
even comparable.

56
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,543
And so,

57
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,300
and the benefits flow to people
who are in that position.

58
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,500
And you can understand why.

59
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,340
I would say,

60
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,920
because I know,

61
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:35,921
let's say you start writing and
you get a book and a rare things,

62
00:02:36,571 --> 00:02:38,010
very weird things to have happened.

63
00:02:38,011 --> 00:02:39,660
And then some people
read it and they like it.

64
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:42,630
And then of course it's much more
likely that you'll get a next book.

65
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,160
And if people like that,

66
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,440
while it's even more likely
that you'll get a third book,

67
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:48,000
and then people start to know who you are,

68
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,680
and then because they know who you are,

69
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:52,770
they phone you up on offer you
opportunities and your network grows.

70
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:57,771
And it's like this exponential increase
in your reach and your capacity for

71
00:02:58,981 --> 00:03:02,400
production and more and more flows to you.
