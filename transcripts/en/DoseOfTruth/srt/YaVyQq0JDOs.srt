1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,450
[inaudible]

2
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,580
I told you at the
beginning of the class that

3
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:26,180
I started working on this material.

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,460
Okay.

5
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,380
Partly because I was interested in why.

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,240
Okay.

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,180
People were so inclined to,

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:42,150
to go to any lengths to
protect their belief systems.

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,530
I wanted to understand,

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:46,230
and I knew that those
were systems of value,

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:46,531
right?

12
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:51,420
That that belief system is something that
enables you to ascribe value to things

13
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,480
so that so that you can act in the world
towards things in a way from things,

14
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,530
roughly speaking,

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,353
and

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,060
I've already made a case to you,

17
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:03,894
that

18
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:07,860
belief systems regulate
people's own emotions,

19
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:08,694
but not,

20
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,750
not as a consequence of
decreasing their death,

21
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:15,760
anxiety or anything like that,

22
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:18,910
or even directly decreasing their,

23
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:21,760
their threat sensitivity or uncertainty,

24
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:26,761
but more specifically by helping them
orient themselves in the world so that

25
00:01:28,481 --> 00:01:32,260
what they do matches what they
want in the social environment.

26
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:37,860
And it's an important set of distinctions
because the emotional control that

27
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:43,921
belief systems allow is mediated by
success in the social environment.

28
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:45,040
That's the crucial thing.

29
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:45,874
It's not,

30
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,620
it's not directly.

31
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,970
It's not as if you're holding a belief
system and that's directly inhibiting

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,280
somehow your emotional responsivity.

33
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,480
It's more that you share.

34
00:01:58,481 --> 00:02:03,481
You have a motive orienting yourself
in the world so that other people can

35
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:08,020
understand what you're up to so that
you can cooperate and compete with them

36
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,940
without conflict and the fact that you
can do that without conflict and maybe

37
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,960
even with cooperation,

38
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,760
that's what regulates your emotion.

39
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,940
So it's not only the fact of
the beliefs belief system,

40
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:23,350
it's the fact that it's shared
with everyone else and so

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:30,060
people are willing to defend their belief
systems because they're defending the

42
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:35,350
territorial structure that enables them to

43
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,870
make sense of the world and then to
act out making sense of the world with

44
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:41,920
everyone else around them.

45
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,260
Now then the question arises,

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,600
what if two different groups of
people have different belief systems?

47
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,370
What do you do in a situation like that?

48
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,020
And one answer is

49
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,600
you capitulate.

50
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,460
Another answer is that you fight.

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,440
Another answer might be that you come to
some consensus about how the difference

52
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:09,790
between those different belief systems
might be mediated so that you can inhabit

53
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:13,030
the same territory without
subordination or without conflict.

54
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,360
But if you're going to come
together and an agreement,

55
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:24,520
you can't do that simply by abandoning
the belief system because the belief

56
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,380
system is what orients you in the world.

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,290
And so the negotiation is very
tricky and because of that,

58
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,320
it often ends up in
subordination or conflict.

59
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:44,650
Another question that might arise out of
that rat's nest of questions is if you

60
00:03:46,701 --> 00:03:50,840
have belief system a and you have
belief system B and they're in conflict,

61
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,820
is there any principles that you can use
or any guidelines that you can use to

62
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:00,920
take the belief systems apart to under
to try to understand what might be of

63
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,980
central value in either of them or both
so that if you do bring them together or

64
00:04:06,351 --> 00:04:08,210
even if one supersedes the other,

65
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:11,930
that there's some evidence that they're
predicated on principles that are

66
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:12,920
actually viable.

67
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,360
And of course that brings up the question
of what constitutes viable principles.

68
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,520
And I got interested in that
more predicted or question
because when the Cold

69
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,083
War was raging,

70
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,050
there were two ideological
systems set up in the world.

71
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,831
Roughly speaking.

72
00:04:30,831 --> 00:04:31,700
There were of course more,

73
00:04:31,701 --> 00:04:35,990
but we can simplify it for the sake
of argument down to two and one was

74
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,600
predicated on the communitarian principles
that were put forward by Marx and the

75
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:44,570
other was a consequence of,

76
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,530
you know the,

77
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,550
I would say western,

78
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:47,450
individualistic,

79
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,700
free market capitalist democracies,

80
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,600
roughly speaking.

81
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:52,130
And then you might ask yourself,

82
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:52,990
well were those only,

83
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,100
was that only a difference of opinion?

84
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:56,181
Right,

85
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:57,680
because that's the central question.

86
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,540
If it's just a difference of opinion,

87
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:02,120
if what's underneath
it is arbitrary then a,

88
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:04,970
it doesn't matter which
system wins roughly speaking

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:06,921
be,

90
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:09,620
there's no right and
wrong in the discussion,

91
00:05:09,621 --> 00:05:09,951
right?

92
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:13,700
It's that that would be something that
would be more akin to a postmodern claim.

93
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:17,900
It's just group a puts
forward their claims to power
and Group B puts form their

94
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:22,340
claims power and they're both equally
valid and while have add are fundamentally

95
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,090
because there's no way of
of solving the problem.

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,400
But it struck me that that I didn't think
that we should leap to that conclusion

97
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:32,300
so rapidly.

98
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:34,790
And so I started to investigate.

99
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,690
I think I started to investigate
the substructure of Western thought,

100
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:45,530
not so much communist thought because I
thought of communism as an interloper on

101
00:05:45,531 --> 00:05:46,220
the scene.

102
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:50,630
It was a system that wasn't devised and
formalized until the late 19 hundreds

103
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,870
late 18 hundreds and I didn't see it
as part of what you might describe as

104
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:57,110
organic development,

105
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,200
no mythologies,

106
00:05:58,201 --> 00:05:58,821
so to speak,

107
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,690
at the basis of,

108
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,400
of the communist perspective.

109
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:05,300
And one of the things that's
very interesting is that
although those ideas were

110
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,610
roundly defeated by the
end of the 20th century,

111
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:11,390
they're making a comeback so rapidly
that it's almost unbelievable.

112
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,351
You know,

113
00:06:12,351 --> 00:06:16,460
I got an email from a medical student
yesterday at the University of Toronto and

114
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,340
now they're the courses that
they have to take the mandatory,

115
00:06:19,341 --> 00:06:24,341
these are social justice courses
include modules on equity and equity as

116
00:06:24,381 --> 00:06:25,330
equality of outcome.

117
00:06:25,331 --> 00:06:26,164
It they're pushing.

118
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:31,340
People are having the equality of outcome
notion pushed on them in mandatory

119
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:33,020
training and universities everywhere.

120
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:33,351
Again,

121
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,330
an equity isn't equality of opportunity.

122
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,710
It's equality of outcome.

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:37,551
You know,

124
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,570
that was the central dictum of the
Communist states in the 20th century.

125
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:41,841
It's like,

126
00:06:41,841 --> 00:06:42,740
what the hell?

127
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:42,951
How,

128
00:06:42,951 --> 00:06:45,740
how did we get back to that again already?

129
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,150
So,

130
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:51,410
and the idea being is if there isn't
absolute equality of outcome within an

131
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,191
organization,

132
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:55,430
that the thing is corrupt and needs
to be restructured from the bottom up.

133
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,020
And then the question of course,

134
00:06:57,021 --> 00:07:00,500
is who decides that outcomes
are equal by what means?

135
00:07:00,501 --> 00:07:01,490
And with what groups?

136
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:02,324
Cause you can,

137
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:07,390
you can produce an infinite number of
groups of people with equally validly in

138
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:08,361
some sense.

139
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:13,040
And you're never going to get equality
of outcome across the infinite number of

140
00:07:13,041 --> 00:07:15,710
ways that you can parse
up society into groups.

141
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:18,680
It's not even technically possible
unless everyone has nothing.

142
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,080
So anyways,

143
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,290
these are obviously very powerful ideas.

144
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,770
And the mere fact that they killed 100
million people already are more in the

145
00:07:27,771 --> 00:07:28,461
20th century.

146
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:30,230
It wasn't enough to put them to rest.
