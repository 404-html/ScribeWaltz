1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,123
There's the,

2
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:04,670
you talked about the
availability heuristic and
some of the role that the press

3
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:05,451
might be playing,

4
00:00:05,451 --> 00:00:08,540
the fact that negative events stand out.

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,420
We can also see negative
events all over the world now,

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,960
so we can't fake of all over the world.

7
00:00:14,961 --> 00:00:16,640
Whenever you hear about a negative event,

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,390
it's as if it's happening
next door and this is,

9
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,573
he is a threat.

10
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,070
So are the breadth of our
news is exaggerated and the
coverage is exaggerated,

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,840
but there still seems to me to be this,

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,030
this mystery at the bottom of all this,

13
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:35,150
which is in the face of
such radically good news.

14
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,200
Why is there such an insistence
that the system is corrupt?

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:41,510
We're going to hell in
a handbasket then that,

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,261
you know,

17
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:46,070
human beings are a cancer on the planet
and everything is heading towards the

18
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:46,761
apocalypse.

19
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:47,360
It's,

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,193
it's so,

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,260
it's so deep and,

22
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:53,660
and it doesn't seem to be
moved by the fact much.

23
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,900
I kind of think sometimes that
it's a hangover from the cold war,

24
00:00:57,230 --> 00:00:57,501
you know,

25
00:00:57,501 --> 00:00:59,870
that was so deeply
pessimistic for so long.

26
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,401
Uh,

27
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,680
I think it goes back before the Cold War.

28
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:05,790
It certainly as a,

29
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,620
as a psychological syndrome,

30
00:01:07,621 --> 00:01:12,330
it goes back at least to the Old Testament
prophets who combined kind of social

31
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:13,440
criticism with,

32
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,400
uh,

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:14,750
uh,

34
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,530
for telling a apocalyptic
disaster that slat that syndrome.

35
00:01:19,531 --> 00:01:21,090
That combination of,

36
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:21,390
uh,

37
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:26,390
moral schooling with predictions of
doom is something that our species quite

38
00:01:27,091 --> 00:01:28,130
naturally falls into.

39
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,790
Part of it is frankly,

40
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,661
certain amount of,

41
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:33,280
uh,

42
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:33,860
uh,

43
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,820
perfect interprofessional competition
that society has various elites.

44
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,460
Uh,

45
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,890
there's the politicians,

46
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:40,701
the business people,

47
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:41,540
the military,

48
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,440
religious elites,

49
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,251
the academics,

50
00:01:43,251 --> 00:01:44,084
the journalists,

51
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,300
and they're always kind
of competing for status.

52
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:52,190
And since intellectuals don't deserve a
whole lot of credit for getting society

53
00:01:52,191 --> 00:01:53,024
to run for,

54
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:57,450
for putting food in the stores
and that keeping the peace and,

55
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:57,921
and,

56
00:01:57,921 --> 00:01:58,490
uh,

57
00:01:58,490 --> 00:01:59,570
protecting the streets,

58
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,460
it's very easy to,

59
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,180
uh,

60
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,480
to look down on other societal elites on,

61
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:06,201
on government,

62
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:07,940
on business and to say,

63
00:02:07,941 --> 00:02:08,091
well,

64
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:13,070
you guys are all failing and we're the
ones who are morally refined enough to

65
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:13,904
point it out.

66
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:14,780
I wouldn't,

67
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,080
I wouldn't put down just a
sheer human competitiveness.

68
00:02:18,081 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm not the first to say this.

69
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,340
One of my favorite explanations
of the veneration of,

70
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:23,870
uh,

71
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,870
of the past of Golden Ages comes from
Thomas Hobbs who said competition of

72
00:02:29,001 --> 00:02:33,710
praise inclined to a reverence of
antiquity or men contend with the living,

73
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,573
not with the dad.

74
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:36,841
Yeah.

75
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,270
Well it also seems that the,

76
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:39,020
um,

77
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:42,230
there's a certain amount of resentment
that is driving that as well.

78
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:46,250
And that would go along with the status
competition because there's anger,

79
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:51,251
I suppose if you're a member of any
meat group to see that your paradigm,

80
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,320
let's say isn't leading
the charge forward.

81
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,823
MMM,

82
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,261
that's right.

83
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:02,261
And you talked about the astonishing in
global poverty and a part of that story

84
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,890
is it did not come about
through massive redistribution,

85
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,150
which for,

86
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:11,800
for many people on the left was the
only route to lifting up the poor,

87
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:12,321
namely to,

88
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,530
to redistribute resources.

89
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,060
Now that have been of course,

90
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,150
adjust adjustments either to shocks the
fact that China and India and Bangladesh

91
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:24,130
and Indonesia have risen out of poverty,

92
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,940
uh,

93
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,350
came in part of the expense of
manufacturing jobs in the United.

94
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:29,910
Yeah.

95
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,430
Yeah.

96
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,140
That's not exactly what people
meant by redistribution.

97
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,700
And it literally is a
redistribution of resources.

98
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,450
Uh,

99
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:39,180
although it is a shaking up
of the economies of many,

100
00:03:39,181 --> 00:03:40,014
many nations.

101
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,230
But this massive increase in the wealth
of that Asian countries did not come

102
00:03:45,691 --> 00:03:47,280
because it was horses were,

103
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:47,581
uh,

104
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:50,970
were shipped from the wealthy
west to the impoverished east.

105
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:52,171
Right.

106
00:03:52,171 --> 00:03:54,690
So that's also a threat
to the doctrine itself.

107
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,280
Direct threat,

108
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,910
the fact that wealth is being produced
and it's being distributed to people at

109
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:04,911
the low end means that implies that that
redistributive philosophy is likely in

110
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:08,460
error.

111
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,940
And you can understand why that might
be regarded as a catastrophic threat,

112
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,040
particularly to people
on the radical left.

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:14,661
Well,

114
00:04:14,661 --> 00:04:15,141
certainly,

115
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:15,741
certainly for,

116
00:04:15,741 --> 00:04:17,870
for a radical notions of redistribution,

117
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:19,610
but at the same time,

118
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,150
the more limited kinds of
redistribution that have,

119
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:24,023
uh,

120
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,210
that are ubiquitous in wealthy countries,

121
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:28,220
I have a graph showing that the amount,

122
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,260
the proportion of GDP allocated to
social spending a skyrocketed in the 20th

123
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:38,261
century from about 1% to about
22% in every developed country.

124
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:39,320
No exceptions.

125
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,011
Uh,

126
00:04:40,011 --> 00:04:40,590
and,

127
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:40,880
uh,

128
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,510
thanks to,

129
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:44,990
to spending on the cooler
on children on the sick,

130
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:45,651
uh,

131
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:49,550
on the online rates of absolute
poverty have fallen in,

132
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,960
in a wealthy countries.

133
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,430
So not only,

134
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:52,851
uh,

135
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:53,320
have,

136
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,690
uh,

137
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,690
has been developed developing worlds
become wealthier and not directly at the

138
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,590
expensive of the developed world,

139
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:01,650
but it within the developed world,

140
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
thanks to some amount of social spending,

141
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:04,980
I guess you could call it redistribution.

142
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,250
The even as inequality has risen,

143
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
poverty has not.

144
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,490
Right,

145
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:10,671
right.

146
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:11,360
I wonder,

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,840
I was just reading a book by Walter
Shadelle called the great leveler.

148
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,880
Yeah,

149
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,713
excellent.

150
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,110
It is an excellent book.

151
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:22,370
And one of the things he did
was an empirical analysis
of left versus right wing

152
00:05:22,371 --> 00:05:23,204
governments,

153
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,830
I think across the 20th century,

154
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:28,460
but it might've gone farther back to
now to see if there is any difference in

155
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:31,400
the Gini Coefficient across
the classes of government.

156
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:35,360
And what he found was that there
was no difference whatsoever.

157
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:39,830
He makes a fairly strong case that the
only redistributive techniques that work

158
00:05:39,831 --> 00:05:40,360
are,

159
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,910
um,

160
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:42,830
pestilence and war essentially.

161
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:45,170
And that's because they
knock everyone down to zero.

162
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,940
But you're making a different case,

163
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,740
like an incremental case in some sense,

164
00:05:48,741 --> 00:05:53,741
which is that governments
perhaps regardless of their
ideological proclivities

165
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:58,170
in the 20th centuries as
they've become more wealthy,

166
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,550
they have incrementally
devoted a larger part of their,

167
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,270
uh,

168
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,020
of their resources to
incremental improvements in,

169
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,500
you might think about it as an
investment in the future rather than

170
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:15,501
redistribution or investment in social
capital education and healthcare and

171
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:16,710
those sorts of things that,

172
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:17,581
well,

173
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:18,480
it's pounded with some,

174
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,830
it's probably some combination.

175
00:06:19,831 --> 00:06:23,280
It's a combination of investment in
public goods because of course the whole

176
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:24,860
society is better off if the,

177
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,070
if everyone's educated.

178
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,830
I also want assurance people support,

179
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,720
uh,

180
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,900
a a safety net.

181
00:06:30,901 --> 00:06:34,500
That's the most popular euphemism for
social spending because you never know

182
00:06:34,501 --> 00:06:37,980
whether it's going to be you or your or
your mother or your brother who is going

183
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:38,400
to be,

184
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,420
who's going to be a need in
the lottery of misfortune.

185
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,121
I had been,

186
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:44,190
part of it's part of it is,

187
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:44,611
is a,

188
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:45,444
is charity.

189
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:45,810
He,

190
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,410
the modern conscience won't allow the
little match girl to freeze to death.

191
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,290
The jokes to Barry,

192
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,360
Grandpa by the side of route 66.

193
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:57,210
And so I think social spending
has been pushed along by,

194
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,380
by all three.

195
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:58,980
Uh,

196
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:03,210
it hasn't necessary in some countries
it probably has reduced the Gini

197
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:04,680
Coefficient in western European countries,

198
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:05,380
which have a more,

199
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:05,570
uh,

200
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:09,810
aggressive system of taxation then
in the United States or Canada.

201
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:14,010
But more important than the
Jenny distribution is that
it's reduced the number

202
00:07:14,011 --> 00:07:15,090
of people living in poverty,

203
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,360
which is the morally relevant
measuring in any case.

204
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:18,871
Yeah.

205
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:23,340
So those two things are complicated
because obviously you want to raise people

206
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:24,480
out of abject poverty.

207
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:24,960
I mean that's,

208
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,650
that's a,

209
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:29,820
that's a zero argument proposition and
that seems to be happening very rapidly.

210
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:30,943
The theme,

211
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,760
the question after that I suppose is to
what degree does the remaining degree of

212
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:40,100
inequality that's generated by productive
capital assistance also constitute a

213
00:07:40,101 --> 00:07:40,934
social threat?

214
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,120
Is there is evidence it was reviewed
best buy in the spirit level,

215
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:48,930
that as inequality increases
rates of male homicide,

216
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:49,591
for example,

217
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:52,140
increase in all sorts of
other negative measures.

218
00:07:52,141 --> 00:07:57,141
So there's some weird interaction between
raising absolute levels of wealth and

219
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,640
ensuring that inequality doesn't,

220
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:00,901
I don't know,

221
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:05,901
exceed some hypothetical optimum that
that needs to be considered in social

222
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:07,284
policy.

223
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,730
There I cite some skeptical
re analyses of the,

224
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:11,890
uh,

225
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:15,630
the data in the spirit level and,

226
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:16,110
uh,

227
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:21,110
probably absolute prosperity matters
more than inequality in determining a

228
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:25,380
social health include such as happiness,

229
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,513
crime,

230
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,420
um,

231
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:30,060
other kinds of social
pathologies like drug addictions.

232
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,571
Uh,

233
00:08:30,571 --> 00:08:30,801
it's,

234
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:31,634
it's not easy to,

235
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,210
to tease them apart.

236
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,860
No,

237
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:34,501
definitely not.

238
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:34,740
These,

239
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:34,950
you know,

240
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:38,490
countries like Sweden
are a very egalitarian,

241
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:39,510
but they're also very rich,

242
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:42,870
are a more lopsided,

243
00:08:42,871 --> 00:08:44,460
but they're also very poor.

244
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:47,880
And so it takes a little bit of
statistical wizardry to type them apart.

245
00:08:47,881 --> 00:08:51,330
And my reading of the literature is that
it's actually prosperity that is more

246
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:53,130
important than that in any quality.

247
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:53,911
But also,

248
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:54,420
and this is a,

249
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:54,780
a,

250
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,390
a,

251
00:08:55,390 --> 00:09:00,390
that I in the psychological literature
was emphasized by Christina Storman's and

252
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,893
Paul Bloom,

253
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,470
that what people sometimes think of as an,

254
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,180
uh,

255
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,790
as an aversion to inequality,

256
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:12,810
to people having different amounts
is actually an aversion to unfairness

257
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,253
injustice.

258
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:14,710
Yeah.

259
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:15,280
That,

260
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,720
but people that really infuriates people
is that they think that the people at

261
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:21,570
the top half ill gotten gains equal.

262
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,020
If they sense that the
system is basically fair,

263
00:09:25,021 --> 00:09:27,660
that either greater effort,

264
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,470
talent,

265
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,460
or even luck,

266
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:29,970
uh,

267
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,710
result in an unequal distribution,

268
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:32,460
uh,

269
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,720
by an impartial library,

270
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:34,510
for example.

271
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:35,311
They're okay with that.

272
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:36,920
It's cheating that really gets under,

273
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:37,600
yeah,

274
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,930
people are really good at remembering
cheating and recognizing it as well.

275
00:09:40,931 --> 00:09:41,750
And stitching.
