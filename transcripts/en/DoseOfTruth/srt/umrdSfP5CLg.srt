1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,410
So wouldn't it be good if in every
society where every organization,

2
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:13,020
we had some people who specialized in,

3
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:13,400
uh,

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:13,830
uh,

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,521
specialized,

6
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:15,354
insane,

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,751
hey,

8
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:16,710
what are the opportunities?

9
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:18,570
And then we had other people
as specialized in saying,

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:18,931
well,

11
00:00:18,931 --> 00:00:19,830
but what are the risks?

12
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:23,550
And it just so happens that a lot of
people have trouble doing all that in

13
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:24,384
themselves.

14
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,840
When we have systems that are well
constituted with people who have different

15
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:29,670
personalities and different
motives and goals,

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:30,770
we actually can get better.

17
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:32,640
We can have a discussion between them.

18
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:32,941
Yeah.

19
00:00:32,941 --> 00:00:36,780
Well that's exactly why that it's
for that precise reason that,

20
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:39,660
that I've been so interested
in free speech as a,

21
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:40,380
as a,

22
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,790
as a value because well,

23
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,140
even on the economic front,

24
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,870
it's pretty obvious if you
look at things economically,

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,790
that the entrepreneur types who start
businesses are lumped in with the liberal

26
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:51,600
creative types.

27
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,670
We've done a lot of work on the
prediction of entrepreneurial behavior and

28
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,130
ability and it's openness.

29
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,090
That's the big predictor.

30
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:57,921
It's not the only one.

31
00:00:57,921 --> 00:00:59,670
It's openness an Iq fundamentally.

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,790
But for managerial and
administrative expertise,

33
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:03,120
it's,

34
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:03,360
oh,

35
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,310
it's Iq and conscientiousness.

36
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,460
So the liberals start businesses and,

37
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:07,890
and,

38
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,320
but they can't run them
because they're there,

39
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,800
their interests flipped and they don't
have the organizational ability and the

40
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:14,820
conservatives can run them,

41
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:17,280
but they can't continue to
transform and expand the,

42
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:17,720
yeah.

43
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,030
It Yin and Yang.

44
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:19,870
Yin and Yang.

45
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,703
Yup.

46
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,710
So,

47
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:26,420
so one more thing about what happened
in Nazi Germany that it's very relevant

48
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:27,550
and interesting because it's,

49
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,690
it's useful to get these motives right.

50
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:30,590
You know,

51
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,101
first of all,

52
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:31,430
if,

53
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,900
if something disgusts you,

54
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,680
if something,

55
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,670
if you're afraid of something,

56
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:36,290
then you run away from it or you freeze.

57
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,140
But if something disgusts you,

58
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,310
you try to burn it or die or kill it.

59
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:40,701
Right.

60
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,590
You try to get rid of or expel it.

61
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:42,861
That's,

62
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:43,530
that's right though.

63
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,890
You want to get it away and destroy it.

64
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,190
So when Hitler came to power,

65
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,770
he put in above a bunch
of public health schemes.

66
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:52,100
Like,

67
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:52,280
ah,

68
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:55,100
he had vans that went around and
screen people for tuberculosis.

69
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,310
Then he went on a factory cleanliness,

70
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,090
uh,

71
00:01:59,090 --> 00:01:59,923
campaign.

72
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:03,740
So the factories were supposed
to be tidy it up and he washed,

73
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,120
he made about four times a day.

74
00:02:05,121 --> 00:02:05,700
By the way,

75
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,670
it's also a great worship or of willpower,

76
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:11,420
which is associated with orderliness
and seems maybe to be associated with

77
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:11,871
disgust,

78
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:14,240
sensitivity in some way
that isn't yet understood.

79
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:14,900
Yeah.

80
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,620
Yeah.

81
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:15,890
Um,

82
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,310
I don't,

83
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,930
I don't understand that connection either.

84
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,670
So they,

85
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,260
he convinced factory owners in Germany
to get rid of the rats and the mice and

86
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,820
mice and insects in the factories and
also to clean them up and beautify them.

87
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,330
But the gas they use to clean up
the factories was like lawn a,

88
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,040
and it was the variation of that gas
cycle on B that was then used in.

89
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:37,341
Yeah.

90
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:39,210
So you could see this ramping up pay.

91
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,860
So it was,

92
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,280
yeah,

93
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,113
absolutely.

94
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,620
So it was public health,

95
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,410
then it was social cleanliness.

96
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,050
Then he went into the
asylums and cleaned them up.

97
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,210
And so it was just this expansion of,

98
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,270
of who was contaminated
and who was impure.

99
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:58,430
And I think also his fascination with
fire and his use of fire symbolism was

100
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,840
also associated with that,

101
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,340
with that appealed to purification
because the whole idea of purification by

102
00:03:04,341 --> 00:03:05,960
fire is a very ancient idea.
