1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:01,503
MMM.

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,590
All right,

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,423
bye.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:14,570
I see.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:14,901
Hey,

6
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:18,980
we've the inimitable and
disdain Dr. Jordan Peterson.

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:21,950
If you haven't been following
the last couple of years,

8
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:25,280
he might be hiding on Rankin serving
some of the sixth string dimension.

9
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,610
So I don't want to go
into too much detail,

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,080
but I'm very honored and privileged to
be able to have a bit of a conversation

11
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,770
with them today.

12
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:35,650
Um,

13
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:40,220
there's just one or two questions that
I'd like to ask you with regards to the

14
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:40,790
fiasco.

15
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,130
We've,

16
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,120
the kept the caffeine human interview
and talking about journalistic integrity

17
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,140
and how that sort of rent up.

18
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,430
Um,

19
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:53,570
what you were talking about yesterday
in the VIP area about the media now

20
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,540
sending out a memo saying this
is not how to do interviews.

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:58,730
What are your thoughts?

22
00:00:58,731 --> 00:01:02,360
Can you elaborate on the demise of
journalistic integrity or the death of

23
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:03,194
journalistic?

24
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,210
Well,

25
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:04,630
I don't,

26
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:06,640
I don't know so much if there's,

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,160
if you can characterize
it yet as a demise.

28
00:01:09,161 --> 00:01:12,310
It's certainly a transmutation because
journalism is taking all sorts of new

29
00:01:12,311 --> 00:01:12,731
forms.

30
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:17,731
It's emerging and many new forms online
and in print and also on youtube and in

31
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:19,414
podcasts.

32
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:21,970
We're definitely in the midst
of a technological revolution.

33
00:01:21,971 --> 00:01:26,860
And I think that there's a proclivity
on the part of the traditional media,

34
00:01:26,861 --> 00:01:27,670
let's say,

35
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,340
uh,

36
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,173
to,

37
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,303
to,

38
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,323
to panic,

39
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:32,860
to fail,

40
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,880
and to use increasingly desperate means
of attracting attention while that's

41
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:37,714
occurring.

42
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,900
And it's easier to attract attention in
the short term with heavily polarized

43
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:46,480
views and opinion pieces
and that sort of thing.

44
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,000
And it's like clickbait,

45
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,761
I suppose it's,

46
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:49,030
yeah,

47
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:49,570
that's right.

48
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:49,931
It's the,

49
00:01:49,931 --> 00:01:50,380
it's the,

50
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,570
it's the mainstream media
equivalent of clickbait.

51
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,970
It might be a reasonable
short term strategy,

52
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:58,690
but it's a deadly longterm strategy for
any credible news organization because

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,580
credible news organizations live and die
by their reputation and reputation is,

54
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,570
are easily lost.

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,050
And so I think that what happened
with the Channel Four interview was,

56
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,250
uh,

57
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,250
it was an example of
journalistic reputation being
lost because there was almost

58
00:02:14,921 --> 00:02:19,480
a complete disconnect between the
person that Kathy Newman thought she was

59
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:21,220
talking to and me.

60
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,330
And,

61
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:22,661
you know,

62
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,520
she should have noticed that I would say,

63
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,240
let's say she had reason to be
hostile and suspicious to begin with.

64
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,080
Um,

65
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,450
we,

66
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:29,860
we could,

67
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,820
we could give her that,

68
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:35,410
but hypothetically by a few minutes
into the interview with seven or eight

69
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:38,530
minutes after four or five questions
didn't go the way that she thought they

70
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:39,364
might go,

71
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:44,290
I would have been much more appropriate
for her to default back to a normal

72
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:49,291
conversational tech instead of treating
the encounter like a forum for victory.

73
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:52,610
I think that was her
mistake fundamentally.

74
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:56,790
And the mistake of what many journalists
is to think about it as something as a,

75
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,750
as a forum to attain victory.

76
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:00,460
Oh my son could gels to journalistic

77
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,363
Justin.

78
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,181
Yeah.

79
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:02,870
It was dominance,

80
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:03,180
hierarchy,

81
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,670
maneuver match essentially.

82
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,180
Yeah.

83
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:05,541
So,

84
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,360
and I didn't want to play
that game particularly.

85
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,300
So.

86
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,300
So when um,

87
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,620
there was feedback afterwards and she
had said that she thought the interview

88
00:03:13,621 --> 00:03:16,540
went well and she didn't know
what the role cast is about God.

89
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:17,483
Who was about,

90
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,620
do you see from the Union perspective?

91
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:20,040
Cause that,

92
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,880
cause that's my background.

93
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:26,450
I'm looking at it from is there the
capacity and the propensity because self

94
00:03:26,461 --> 00:03:27,420
reflection does,

95
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,510
does a person not to see it.

96
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:28,890
Okay.

97
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:29,281
I don't,

98
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,180
I really don't know.

99
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:31,021
I mean,

100
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:34,440
I would say if you're thinking
about it from a union perspective,

101
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:36,420
that it was a good example
of animus possession.

102
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:36,810
Right?

103
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:37,800
You can see that quite,

104
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,960
there are many examples of that online.

105
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,830
Um,

106
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,840
I've actually thought about making
a video about that because anonymous

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,140
possession is a thing that's
very difficult to describe,

108
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,040
but you can actually,

109
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,980
you can see it and certainly that's
what happened with Kathy Newman.

110
00:03:49,981 --> 00:03:51,510
It was blatantly on display.

111
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,800
Um,

112
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,280
I really don't know how
she has responded to this.

113
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,300
Um,

114
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,133
I don't,

115
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,720
I don't know how you respond
to something like that.

116
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:04,890
I tried to put myself in her shoes and
to imagine that I was the recipient of,

117
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:05,610
well,

118
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:09,780
let's say lots of worldwide
negative publicity essentially,

119
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:10,570
and,

120
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,500
and thousands of cutting comments,

121
00:04:13,501 --> 00:04:13,741
you know,

122
00:04:13,741 --> 00:04:17,520
ranging from pretty damning
to extraordinarily damaging.

123
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:18,421
And I mean,

124
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:21,810
there's the odd comment that is in favor
of what you did and stood up for her

125
00:04:21,811 --> 00:04:23,410
combative nature and all of the outcome.

126
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,690
But I just don't know how you
respond to that psychologically.

127
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,573
Uh,

128
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:28,830
it's,

129
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:29,663
it's gotta be,

130
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,200
you either shut it out,

131
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,240
which isn't helpful because you don't
learn anything or you let it in,

132
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:36,210
in which case it has to be devastating.

133
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:37,463
So,

134
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,593
um,

135
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,240
all right.

136
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,380
Is there a notion,

137
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:40,880
um,

138
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,160
all,

139
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,160
if we go back to the young perspective
of perhaps the transcendent function

140
00:04:46,651 --> 00:04:49,680
coming into play where you are trying
to hold the tension of opposites but

141
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:51,930
you're actually not
doing that effectively?

142
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:53,651
Well,

143
00:04:53,651 --> 00:04:58,420
the problem is I think in her situation
is that because that that interview

144
00:04:58,421 --> 00:05:03,421
failed so dramatically and so publicly
that for her to bridge the gap between

145
00:05:03,521 --> 00:05:04,660
her current persona,

146
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:05,231
let's say,

147
00:05:05,231 --> 00:05:09,730
and the reality that was manifested
in that video would require a very

148
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,980
comprehensive personality overhaul.

149
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,110
And that's a very unpleasant thing to do.

150
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:19,140
There's a lot of falling apart and burning
away that accompanies that because it

151
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:23,350
isn't clear to me that she was
wrong on a superficial level.

152
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:24,161
I mean,

153
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:25,540
maybe she was having an off day,

154
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:26,500
like it's possible,

155
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,310
you know,

156
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:27,900
and,

157
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,480
and,

158
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,480
but I don't think that that video would
have had the carrying power it had if it

159
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:37,350
was merely indicative of an
otherwise competent journalist.

160
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:38,410
Having a bad day.

161
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,040
Yeah.

162
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,460
It seems to me that was a manifestation
of a style that she's used quite

163
00:05:42,461 --> 00:05:43,960
successfully in the past,

164
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,513
that,

165
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,240
that,

166
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,240
that has had its short
term expedient advantages.

167
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,110
But that is a,

168
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,440
is not a credible strategy for someone
who's playing a deep and honest game.

169
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,140
So there's a lot of,

170
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:05,000
my sense was that the video indicated
that there was a lot of work to be done,

171
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,120
but not only on her part because you know,

172
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,013
she,

173
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,420
she was involved in that personally,

174
00:06:11,421 --> 00:06:12,520
but she was also the,

175
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,551
the mouthpiece,

176
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:14,031
let's say,

177
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:17,690
of an entire organization
that was oriented to words,

178
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,390
having her do exactly what she did and,

179
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,224
and the,

180
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,371
you know,

181
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:26,330
what I expected to happen was that why
have the interview and then channel four

182
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:29,630
would chop it and cut it
according to their tastes,

183
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,690
which is essentially what they did for
the broadcast and that the rest of it

184
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,381
would disappear.

185
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:37,790
I think it was unbelievably naive
of them to put it up online,

186
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,750
but they did.

187
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,123
And uh,

188
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,750
well do they credit to some,

189
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,363
well,

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,080
I don't think so.

191
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,343
Maybe.

192
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,220
Maybe.

193
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,360
I think it was more,

194
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,900
they thought it went fine and then didn't
understand what the fuss was about.

195
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:57,720
And then where they genuinely
outraged that she was quote,

196
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,670
victimized.

197
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,690
Or was that just a cynical ploy to,

198
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,840
to spin the narrative in,

199
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:04,200
in,

200
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,480
in an acceptable direction?

201
00:07:05,481 --> 00:07:05,811
I think,

202
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:05,991
you know,

203
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:07,970
a little of column a and
a little of column B,

204
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:08,721
so,

205
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:09,890
but that also failed,

206
00:07:09,891 --> 00:07:13,220
which was quite interesting because for
about four days after the interview,

207
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,570
the narrative that victim narrative was
picked up by many newspapers and spun

208
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,021
heart,

209
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:18,650
you know,

210
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:21,530
that there was security threats and that
she was now in danger and there's no

211
00:07:21,531 --> 00:07:23,240
credible evidence for that whatsoever.

212
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,580
But that came out,

213
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,700
there was a flurry of activity around
that and then that just got criticized to

214
00:07:28,701 --> 00:07:30,560
death and disappeared as a strategy.

215
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:31,850
So,

216
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,810
so would you say that it's possibly a
part of the collective shadow manifesting

217
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:38,720
in projecting itself and maybe
it was just become country?

218
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:39,993
Um,

219
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,980
I guess that the torch bearer for,

220
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:44,441
well,

221
00:07:44,441 --> 00:07:45,610
I think that's often the case,

222
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:45,821
right?

223
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:46,654
I mean the media,

224
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,880
the media chases as much as it leads.

225
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,560
And so it's,

226
00:07:50,561 --> 00:07:50,900
uh,

227
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,730
it's a,

228
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,150
uh,

229
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:54,700
a positive feedback loop
between the media and the,

230
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,890
and the partners.

231
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:56,081
I mean,

232
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:56,591
that's partly,

233
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,620
I think what's driving
polarization is exactly that.

234
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:03,820
And I think that the interview was an
example of what's driving polarization.

235
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:06,970
And that's partly why people
sat up and took notice of it.

236
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:07,271
It's like,

237
00:08:07,271 --> 00:08:07,571
really,

238
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,530
this is where we're at.

239
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,070
It's like,

240
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:09,431
Oh yeah,

241
00:08:09,431 --> 00:08:10,150
this is,

242
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,550
I mean,

243
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:10,830
is,

244
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:13,480
is there a place to
bridge this polarization?

245
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:17,890
Perhaps that the perspective of holding,

246
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:23,040
holding the tension of opposites and
being able to see critically both sides.

247
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,190
There's a philosophy that
I followed for years.

248
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:30,070
I'm Daniel Dennett who's saying that
you're wanting to engage in a discussion

249
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:30,904
with someone and,

250
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:31,721
and,

251
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:32,410
um,

252
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:34,460
move or progress the conversation forward.

253
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,780
That there are some
steps to that including,

254
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:37,360
you know,

255
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,900
always.

256
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:38,733
Um,

257
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,580
what you say in chapter nine of your
book is act as if the person that you're

258
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,980
talking to you or just need
to have something to offer.

259
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,370
And it didn't seem apparent
that that was the case and that,

260
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:49,243
um,

261
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,110
well that's the mistake I think.

262
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:51,291
Well,

263
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,124
first of all,

264
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:55,530
the two people who are engaged
in the process of dialectic,

265
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,210
let's say you have to be of goodwill,

266
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:57,991
you know,

267
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:58,161
and,

268
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:02,100
and they have to be oriented I would say
towards peace and they can be oriented

269
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:02,791
towards victory.

270
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:04,950
But then of course that's
a combat and it doesn't,

271
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:08,430
perhaps it's sometimes the case that
there are times when one conversation,

272
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,540
it should be combat,

273
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:13,290
but it's not very often that
that should be the case.

274
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,311
Most of the time.

275
00:09:14,311 --> 00:09:15,144
It should be,

276
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:16,890
what would you call it,

277
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,783
um,

278
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:18,973
uh,

279
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,400
peacemaking that you're devoted to
because especially if you're discussing

280
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:28,401
something important and it should be
assuming that you're able to trust the

281
00:09:28,411 --> 00:09:28,951
other person,

282
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:31,530
which means they have to bring
goodwill into the situation.

283
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,410
What do you want to do is bridge the
gap because that's what forestalls

284
00:09:34,411 --> 00:09:34,981
conflict,

285
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:35,190
right?

286
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,510
If you can't solve the problem,

287
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,820
then what you have is,

288
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,860
is,

289
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,140
is you have conflict.

290
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:40,441
That's,

291
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:40,921
that's it.

292
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:41,340
So,

293
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,140
and maybe you're ready for that.

294
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:43,860
And that's,

295
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,150
I suppose if you're ready for that,

296
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:45,840
well then that's,

297
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,621
that's how it goes.

298
00:09:46,621 --> 00:09:48,640
But a wise person we'll,

299
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,680
we'll talk for a long time before
they engage in actual conflict.

300
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:53,730
So yes.

301
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:54,770
Speaking of conflict,

302
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:57,920
do you think that in times of
crises and chaos and conflict,

303
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,860
that's an architypes
rise up and spring forth?

304
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,870
Like perhaps that trickster archetype?

305
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,940
Well that's Milo Yiannopoulos.

306
00:10:04,941 --> 00:10:05,680
Yes.

307
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:05,860
No.

308
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,550
And comedians play that role all the time.

309
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:09,850
And comedians play a
disproportionate role on,

310
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,250
you know,

311
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,870
on Youtube.

312
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,320
I would say in guiding the dialogue,

313
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:13,850
most of the people that I know,

314
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,250
they're astute political commentators on,

315
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:20,000
on Youtube and hoof attracted
large following of a very
large number of them are

316
00:10:20,001 --> 00:10:20,720
comedians.

317
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,830
Would you call yourself,

318
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,100
um,

319
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,170
in October because you,

320
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,450
you do last night I was,

321
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,040
what do you know a wise person?

322
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,470
Make sure they stay
dissociated from the archetypes

323
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,920
even if it gets put onto them because you,

324
00:10:32,921 --> 00:10:36,390
you do seem to be the penultimate tell
father pick up of the surrogate father.

325
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,251
Well,

326
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:38,160
that's not too bad.

327
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:39,620
That if that's the archetype,

328
00:10:39,621 --> 00:10:40,460
that's not too bad,

329
00:10:40,461 --> 00:10:40,761
you know,

330
00:10:40,761 --> 00:10:41,890
I mean that's,

331
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,270
I,

332
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,910
I'm of the right age for that.

333
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:44,120
And,

334
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:44,780
and uh,

335
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,290
my,

336
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,550
my discussions too,

337
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:48,140
people are salutary so that,

338
00:10:48,141 --> 00:10:48,770
that's,

339
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,620
that's a reasonable role to play.

340
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:54,740
I would say there's not too much
psychological danger in that.

341
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,720
So,

342
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,400
and just one final question,

343
00:10:57,401 --> 00:11:01,360
just in terms of your meteoric
rise in the last two years,

344
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,194
I'll just say,

345
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,480
how has the start and being,

346
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,050
I mean,

347
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:07,720
um,

348
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,770
I was out there in the line,

349
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:09,610
the cues this today,

350
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,480
even just,

351
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,800
I'm misquoting the um,

352
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,300
archable Peyto down.

353
00:11:13,301 --> 00:11:13,661
He said,

354
00:11:13,661 --> 00:11:14,110
well,

355
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:15,110
he's quite handsome.

356
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,680
He's a quite good looking
fellow in real life.

357
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,550
Um,

358
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,820
young men were quivering at
the knees yesterday saying,

359
00:11:21,821 --> 00:11:22,271
oh my gosh,

360
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:23,410
I've just met Jordan Peterson.

361
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,940
Elderly women were like,

362
00:11:24,941 --> 00:11:25,330
wow,

363
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,163
I wish she wasn't married.

364
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:29,830
How do you take all that
with a grain of salt,

365
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,390
with humility,

366
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,120
knowing that there's a spectrum
between humility and Hubris?

367
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:38,590
I do know that you have close
people in your core that

368
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:39,431
well,

369
00:11:39,431 --> 00:11:39,581
I'm,

370
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:39,840
you know,

371
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,960
I was a psychotherapist for a very long
time and you get accustomed to dealing

372
00:11:43,961 --> 00:11:44,320
with,

373
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,370
with the variance of that,

374
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,204
I would say,

375
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:46,840
I mean,

376
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,830
you stay detached.

377
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,143
I don't mean,

378
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,670
I don't mean detached
in that you don't care,

379
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,240
but you have to not have to stay
outside of the drama in some sense.

380
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:58,170
I guess.

381
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,940
Like it isn't that you
don't take it seriously,

382
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:03,700
but you see it for what it is.

383
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:04,601
No.

384
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:05,830
If people are star struck,

385
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:06,210
there's,

386
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:09,310
they're struck by a projection of
their own imagination in large part.

387
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:09,581
I know.

388
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:11,080
And I can see that in people's faces.

389
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:11,470
I know.

390
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:14,260
And I try very rapidly to get over that.

391
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,120
And also,

392
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,340
so if someone comes up to me and
they're nervous and they're sort of,

393
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,090
let's say starstruck,

394
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,160
for lack of a better word,

395
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,810
I can usually eliminate that immediately
because I just talked to them very

396
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,110
directly and then they calm down and
then we have a conversation that's much

397
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:29,740
better.

398
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:30,573
It's much better.

399
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:31,301
Yes.

400
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:33,790
I do see you doing that are very intense.

401
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,753
Um,

402
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:36,970
uh,

403
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,751
Dr. Peterson.

404
00:12:37,751 --> 00:12:41,740
I am very grateful and thankful you
having done this interview with me and I

405
00:12:41,741 --> 00:12:42,850
really appreciate,

406
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,450
um,

407
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,290
the synchronicity.

408
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:44,591
Again,

409
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:47,290
I'm going by you and a
lot because I'm Indian,

410
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,710
but the synchronicity of being
here and being allowed to do that.

411
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:53,590
Do you do find that that's
the part of your life as well?

412
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,280
Which the synchronicity.

413
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,273
Oh God,

414
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,190
you have no idea.

415
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,720
I would love to hear a story.

416
00:12:58,721 --> 00:12:59,201
I heard y'all go,

417
00:12:59,201 --> 00:12:59,310
yeah,

418
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:04,310
stories and the tap tap through to the
car and the owl and you didn't go further

419
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:04,861
into that.

420
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:07,830
But I'd like to know if you care to share.

421
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,860
I can't,

422
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:09,310
I can't,

423
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,780
they're too complex to layout.

424
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:14,500
Most of them have been
associated with frog imagery.

425
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:15,040
I would say it,

426
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,500
but I can't say more than that
because it's just too complicated.

427
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,011
No,

428
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:19,570
it's like trying to explain a dream.

429
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,171
It's very,

430
00:13:20,171 --> 00:13:21,004
very hard.

431
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,720
Remember the dream that you recounted and
I'm big on the Chantilly in the middle

432
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:24,821
of the,

433
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:25,380
did you,

434
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,360
did you end up resolving that?

435
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:28,421
Yeah.

436
00:13:28,421 --> 00:13:31,630
Well I would say everything I've done
since that dream is probably a resolution

437
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:32,464
of that.

438
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,800
I mean,

439
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,460
it's,

440
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:34,630
it was so,

441
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,130
thank you so much.

442
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,020
All right.

443
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:37,853
Very nice to meet you.

444
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,850
Nice talking with you.
