1
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:12,240
Joseph's father is Jacob and
Jacob is the patriarch of Israel,

2
00:00:12,641 --> 00:00:15,220
essentially that the
father of the 12 tribes.

3
00:00:15,221 --> 00:00:16,350
And um,

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,570
we,

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:18,811
we,

6
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:19,810
you might remember that,

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:20,943
uh,

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,420
he had a very morally

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,400
ambivalent halfway through life.

10
00:00:31,401 --> 00:00:35,950
And it's one of the things that I think
so interesting about the stories in the,

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:37,670
in the Old Testament is that

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,830
these so-called patriarchal
figures are very realistic.

13
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:48,450
And it's something that I was also
being struck by that accounts in the new

14
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:49,350
testament that way.

15
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:54,351
There's lots of things that Christ does
that you'd think would have been edited

16
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:56,510
out over time and sanitize,

17
00:00:56,511 --> 00:00:57,191
but they're not.

18
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:00,010
And the Old Testament is definitely
not a book that's been sanitized.

19
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:00,620
And that's,

20
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,500
it's quite interesting
that that's the case.

21
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,800
So you sort of see people with all
their flaws and I've been trying to also

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,060
derive some general conclusions about

23
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,910
the moral of the story of
the genesis stories and um,

24
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,790
because these stories are fundamentally
moral and moral as far as I'm concerned,

25
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:22,830
it has to do with action,

26
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,100
right?

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:28,100
Because moral decisions are the decisions
that you make when you're structuring

28
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:28,941
action.

29
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:31,340
When you decide to do
one thing or another,

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,690
generally want to do things that are the
best things that you can think of to do

31
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,180
and hence good.

32
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:41,210
But sometimes you also want to do things
that are the worst things you can do.

33
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,541
You know,

34
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:43,700
because you're angry
or resentful or bitter.

35
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:49,130
And so the moral decisions that you make
that govern your actions are really the

36
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:51,260
most important decisions
that you make in your life.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,310
And it's not that easy to figure
out how to make moral decisions.

38
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:57,050
We don't have an unerring

39
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,080
technology for that the
same way as we do for say,

40
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,150
making decisions about empirical reality,

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,910
which in some ways seem a lot simpler.

42
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,293
Um,

43
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,240
partly because we can
work collectively at it,

44
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:13,210
partly because we have a rigorous
methodology for deciding what's true and

45
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:14,044
what's not.

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,190
So one of the things
that's really struck me,

47
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,050
like it's an overarching theme,

48
00:02:20,051 --> 00:02:22,060
I would say that emerges out of genesis,

49
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,670
especially after the
really ancient stories,

50
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,510
uh,

51
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:26,343
say,

52
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:31,830
especially after the stories
of Cain and Abel and Noah and

53
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,420
the Tower of Babel.

54
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,450
When you get to the accounts of the
historically or historically real people,

55
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:49,080
one injunction seems to be get the
hell out there and do something.

56
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,401
You know,

57
00:02:50,401 --> 00:02:50,690
one,

58
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:55,410
one of the major themes for all of the
Patriarchs that we've talked about,

59
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:59,100
Abraham say Jacob and Joseph is

60
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,020
move out into the world regardless
of the circumstances at hand.

61
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,030
Now that's in,

62
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,100
in in the Old Testament stories that's
basically portrayed as hearkening to the

63
00:03:12,101 --> 00:03:13,120
voice of God.

64
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:13,871
Something like that.

65
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:17,080
Maybe you could think about that as
destiny or a psychological calling.

66
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,423
Um,

67
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,070
and the funny thing too is,

68
00:03:20,071 --> 00:03:23,680
is that it's not that these people have
an easy time of it when they heed that

69
00:03:23,681 --> 00:03:24,514
call.

70
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,031
So what's,

71
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:30,820
what's fascinating is that they often
run into extreme difficulties right away.

72
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,100
And I think that's very interesting.

73
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:33,611
First of all,

74
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:37,330
because life is obviously
full of extreme difficulties.

75
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,793
And second,

76
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,010
it's another example of the
failure to sugarcoat things,

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,990
which is one of the things that I
think makes a mockery of anti religious

78
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:48,730
theories that are even
quite sophisticated,

79
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:48,911
say,

80
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:49,770
like Freud,

81
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,210
Freud thought of religion as a,

82
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,150
as a wish fulfillment essentially.

83
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,410
And,

84
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,160
and also marked who thought about
religion as the opiate of the masses.

85
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,800
It's if those were true,

86
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:07,450
it seems to me that there'd be a lot
more wish and a lot less reality,

87
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,500
a lot less stark,

88
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:09,430
harsh reality.

89
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,090
No,

90
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,390
I mean,

91
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,390
the first thing that Abraham encounters
is a famine and then he has to hide his

92
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:17,890
wife and then he,

93
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,490
he basically journeys into a tyranny.

94
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,040
So that's about as bad
as it gets in some ways.

95
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:27,040
And those themes re recur continually.

96
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,200
And no one ever lives where
they're supposed to live.

97
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:32,080
They leave in live in Canaan
and not the promised land.

98
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,250
And so it's a pretty rough,

99
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,650
it's a pretty rough series of stories.

100
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,070
But the fundamental
idea is something like,

101
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,220
there's no time for sitting around.

102
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:45,010
There's time to go out
into the world and engage.
