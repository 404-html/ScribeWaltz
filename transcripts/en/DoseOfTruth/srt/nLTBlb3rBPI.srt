1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:07,480
It was,

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,130
we got very interested in dreams and
started to understand the relationship

3
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:15,780
between dreams and myths because he
would see in his client's dreams,

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,630
echoes of stories that he knew because
he was deeply read in mythology and,

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,580
and then he started to believe that the
dream was the birthplace of the myth and

6
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:27,510
that there was a continual
interaction between the two processes,

7
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,690
the dream and the story
and storytelling and well,

8
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:30,961
you know,

9
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,850
you tend to tell your dreams as
stories when you remember them.

10
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:36,360
And some people remember
dreams all the time,

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,710
like two or three at night.

12
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:41,580
I've had clients like that and they often
have archetipal dreams that have very

13
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,050
clear mythological structures.

14
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:45,360
I think that's more the case
with people who are creative,

15
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:45,721
by the way,

16
00:00:45,721 --> 00:00:48,210
especially if they're a bit unstable at,

17
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:48,900
at the time,

18
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:53,900
because the dream tends to occupy the
space of uncertainty and to concentrate on

19
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:58,800
fleshing out the unknown reality
before you get a real grip on it.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,680
So it's like the dream is
the birthplace of thinking.

21
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,210
That's a good way of thinking about it.

22
00:01:03,211 --> 00:01:04,980
And so because it's the
birthplace of thinking,

23
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,600
it's not that clear.

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:11,690
It's doing its best to formulate something
that was Young's notion as opposed to

25
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,310
Freud who believed that
there were sensors,

26
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:16,440
internal sensors that
were hiding the dreams.

27
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:17,190
True message.

28
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,390
That's not what you and believed.

29
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:22,170
He believed the dream was
doing its best to excel,

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,150
to express a reality that was still
outside of fully articulated conscious

31
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:28,050
comprehension.

32
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,460
It was cause you think,

33
00:01:29,461 --> 00:01:31,350
look a thought appears in your head,

34
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:31,621
right?

35
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,030
That's obvious pit bang.

36
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:33,321
It's it.

37
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:34,800
It's nothing you ever ask about.

38
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:36,420
But what the hell does that mean?

39
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,550
A thought appears in your head.

40
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:41,100
What kind of ridiculous
explanation is that?

41
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,233
You know,

42
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,910
it just doesn't help with anything.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,500
Where does it come from?

44
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,371
Well nowhere.

45
00:01:47,371 --> 00:01:49,500
It just appears in my head.

46
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:50,071
Okay,

47
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:53,310
well that's not a very sophisticated
explanation as it turns out.

48
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:54,030
You know?

49
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,370
And so you might think
that those thoughts,

50
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:57,330
thoughts that you think,

51
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:58,530
well where do they come from?

52
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,360
Well they're often
someone else's thoughts,

53
00:02:00,361 --> 00:02:00,571
right?

54
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,710
Someone Long Dad,

55
00:02:01,711 --> 00:02:02,640
that might be part of it.

56
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:07,290
Just like the words you use to think our
utterances of people who've been long

57
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:08,124
dead.

58
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:11,550
And so you're informed by
the spirit of your ancestors.

59
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:12,930
That's one way of looking at it.

60
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,100
And your motivation,

61
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,360
speak to your motion,

62
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:16,560
speak to in your body,

63
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:17,430
speaks to you,

64
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,320
and it all does all that,

65
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,210
at least in part through the dream.

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,650
And the dream is the birthplace
of the fully articulated idea.
