1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:04,790
So anyways,
you can think from the phenomenological

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,810
viewpoint of your experience as a whole
instead of you being a subject in an

3
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:12,480
objective world.
And so here's another way of.

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,930
Here's something that's quite useful.
[inaudible] talked about this because he

5
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,990
was moving towards a phenomenological
perspective later in his life.

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,770
The last book he wrote was called
mysterium conjunction us and he talked

7
00:00:22,771 --> 00:00:27,750
about three conjunctions that needed to
take place in order for someone to be

8
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:32,010
well constituted psychologically.
And you know how piaget talked about

9
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,260
learning that you could not only follow
rules but that you could make rules for

10
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:39,720
new games as sort of the highest level
of moral development.

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,110
I would say you extended the Piagetian
moral continuum up past what piaget had

12
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,630
envisioned.
Now he didn't.

13
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:51,930
He didn't do that because he wasn't
trying to extend piaget's model,

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,080
but.
But you can think about it the same way

15
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,730
and it's not easy to come up with a
moral motive being say,

16
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:02,460
that transcends the ability to make
rules for new games.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,990
That's damn smart man.
That's,

18
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:06,870
that's,
that's a major home run by piaget as far

19
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:09,450
as I'm concerned.
But Young said something like this said,

20
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:11,670
look,
when you're going through the process of

21
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:16,671
psychological integration,
here's a way of conceptualizing it,

22
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:20,820
and he thought about this as
symbolically as male,

23
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:25,140
female pairings,
because as I've tried to point out the

24
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:26,930
most,
one of the most fundamental character

25
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,230
categories that are mythological
imagination uses to structure the world

26
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:33,060
is the category of masculine and
feminine.

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,860
And it moves that around.
You know,

28
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:36,300
it's,
it's a fundamental metaphor.

29
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,240
So you can move that around anywhere.
And so young thought,

30
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,710
well,
one of the things that you're trying to

31
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:44,670
do is to get your thoughts and your
emotions integrated.

32
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:46,291
And so,
you know,

33
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:49,290
the Classic Enlightenment Viewpoint,
roughly speaking,

34
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,530
is something like passion is the enemy
of reason,

35
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,890
right?
And so to the degree that your rational,

36
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,060
it's sort of afraid of viewpoint.

37
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,620
It's because he got your emotions under
control and there's some truth in that,

38
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:05,070
but not enough truth.
I like the psg an idea better,

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,180
which is that,
no,

40
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,590
no,
that isn't what happens.

41
00:02:07,591 --> 00:02:11,550
What happens if you're playing the
proper game is that you integrate your

42
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:14,850
emotions underneath.
You're thinking something like that.

43
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:17,040
So they're all working in the same
direction,

44
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,750
you know.
So for example,

45
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,050
you can make your anxiety work against
you or for you.

46
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,670
And one of the ways I get it,
I made a program called the future

47
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:30,000
authoring program that I think helps
people do that because one of the things

48
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:32,760
you see when you're talking to people
and they're trying to solve problems is

49
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:36,960
that they're afraid to face the problem
and so then their anxiety is working

50
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:38,640
against them and you can think about it
as a,

51
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,840
as antagonistic to rationality,
but then I could say,

52
00:02:42,841 --> 00:02:45,120
well,
why don't you think for awhile about

53
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,390
what your life would be like if you
didn't face this problem?

54
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:52,080
Because if you think that through,
if you have a problem and you really

55
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:56,220
think through what the consequences are
going to be in three to five years of

56
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:58,860
not facing it,
then you're going to get more afraid of

57
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:02,180
not it then facing it.
And that's great because then your

58
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:04,570
anxiety,
instead of standing in front of you,

59
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,410
instead of you having a dragon guarding
the path in front of you,

60
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:11,350
will you have one chasing you down the
path from behind?

61
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:15,010
That's a lot more useful.
And so you know,

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,140
that's just a minimal example of the
utility of getting your emotions and

63
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:22,960
your and your thoughts aligned the same
way.

64
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,020
The same thing happens with aggression.
You know,

65
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:29,440
one of the most common reasons that
people come and seek psychotherapy

66
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:33,250
really is because they're too agreeable.
But what that means is they're not

67
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,470
assertive enough.
They haven't integrated their capacity

68
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:38,400
for aggression and so other people can
push them around and,

69
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,700
and there are very conflict avoidant and
and so the consequences of that across

70
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:48,610
time is that you don't stand up for
yourself well enough and you get taken

71
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:51,520
advantage of and that spirals badly
downward.

72
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520
And so partly what you do when you're
doing assertiveness training with people

73
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:01,360
is you find out what they're angry about
and there are usually angry,

74
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:04,210
angry if they're not assertive enough
because other people are taking

75
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,000
advantage of them or you could say
because they're not putting their own

76
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,680
necessities forward with enough force.
It's hard to distinguish between those

77
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:13,540
two things.
But anyways,

78
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,450
you know,
you get them to talk about what they're

79
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:20,020
angry about that often makes them cry
often many times.

80
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:23,530
And then you get them to kind of
envision what they would want to have

81
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:26,290
instead,
which they're often afraid to do because

82
00:04:26,291 --> 00:04:30,550
people are afraid to think about what
they want because that makes it more

83
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:33,160
clear when they're not getting it.
And that's painful,

84
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:35,140
right?
Or maybe they're afraid of hoping so

85
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,600
they won't specify a clear aim.
But anyways,

86
00:04:37,601 --> 00:04:39,850
you get them to think about what they
might want.

87
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:43,570
Instead you get them to think about the
costs of not pursuing that.

88
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,860
And then you help them develop
strategies for integrating their

89
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,810
aggression and with their thinking so
that they can come up with a plan to

90
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,330
approach the world.
In a more confident way,

91
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,250
so for example,
someone might come to me and say,

92
00:04:57,251 --> 00:05:00,610
I'm being bullied badly at work,
and so then I'll say,

93
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:02,110
well,
what are your options?

94
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,840
You have to put up with it.
Well,

95
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:06,430
we'll,
we'll figure that out because maybe you

96
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,720
do.
Maybe you don't have options,

97
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,740
but here's how to find out.
Get your damn cv together so it's

98
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:13,090
pristine,
right?

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,500
It's,
it's ready to go.

100
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,370
Get over your fear of a new interview
because it people are generally afraid

101
00:05:18,371 --> 00:05:20,680
of that.
Get over your fear of applying for a new

102
00:05:20,681 --> 00:05:22,660
job.
Start thinking about what it would mean

103
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,980
to have a different job.

104
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,630
Start thinking about what it would mean
to have a better job even because maybe

105
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,870
your fear is just making you stuck here,
but I can tell you one thing.

106
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,900
If someone's picking on you at work and
you don't have options,

107
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,190
you lose so you get the person to start
building a strategy.

108
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:40,024
It's like,
okay,

109
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,670
if you're going to tell this person to
stop,

110
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,540
you have to know how to make them stop
and one and the one thing you need for

111
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,910
sure is an option.
And if you can't,

112
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:52,540
if you don't have an option,
then maybe we start thinking about the

113
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:56,230
fact that you need some more training or
something like that because you cannot

114
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,980
negotiate if you don't have any power.
So because while,

115
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,040
especially if you're dealing with
someone who's really out to get you or

116
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:05,810
really disagreeable,
if you don't have a leg to stand on,

117
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:08,630
they'll just push you over and maybe
they'll jump on youtube because that's

118
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,120
what they're like and they enjoy it
anyway.

119
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:15,120
So it's no joke.
So you put your options behind you and

120
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:17,720
then you start to think about strategy.
So I tell people,

121
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,180
look,
if you're being harassed at work,

122
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,750
you documented every time it happens and
you write it down so you've got like 20

123
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,830
stories about it and it's fully
documented and then you go confront the

124
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:30,380
person at some point,
but with at least three pieces of

125
00:06:30,381 --> 00:06:34,700
evidence and you have some sense of what
you tell them about what will happen if

126
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:37,280
they don't stop.
So you have to figure out,

127
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:38,810
well,
if they don't stop,

128
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,240
what are you gonna do about it?
Leave.

129
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,770
Not if you can't leave.
So you,

130
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,720
you have to be able to wield a big stick
and speak softly,

131
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,400
but you see that way.
It's.

132
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:53,900
That's how you take your aggression,
which is an absolutely necessary part of

133
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:58,901
your psyche and manifest it up into a
sophisticated means of dealing with the

134
00:06:59,451 --> 00:06:59,960
world.

135
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,220
You don't just suppress it.
You say,

136
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:02,750
well,
I should be able to put up with it,

137
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,090
or I wish I wasn't so angry or
something.

138
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,260
It's like,
forget that.

139
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,520
That's all that'll happen is your blood
pressure will stay high and you'll die

140
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,350
of a heart attack.
Because anger for example,

141
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:16,220
is a very toxic emotion and it does
cause heart damage over time.

142
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:19,670
It's the only emotion that we really
know that's been linked to things like

143
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:24,671
cardiovascular risk and anger is is
toxic because it's like you're driving a

144
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:25,510
car.
You've.

145
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,340
You're stepping on the gas and pushing
on the brake at the same time because

146
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:32,690
anger tells you to run away and to
attack at the same time because you

147
00:07:32,691 --> 00:07:34,510
don't know what's gonna happen and so
it.

148
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,810
It really amps up the physiological
demand on your body.

149
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,230
And so if you are including your heart
and your musculature,

150
00:07:42,231 --> 00:07:44,390
so if you stay like that for like 10
years,

151
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:49,250
you know you're going to age 20 years
and that's a bad plan.
