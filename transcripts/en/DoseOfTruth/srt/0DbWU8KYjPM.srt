00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,400
Hello Dr Peterson,
so I've been listening back to all of

2
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:16,460
these biblical lectures for the second
time now and um,

3
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:19,730
I wanted to show you an observation I
came upon because I was trying to find a

4
00:00:19,731 --> 00:00:21,710
question that you haven't been asked
before,

5
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:24,620
which is harder than doing my ryerson
exams,

6
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:27,370
that's for sure.
So,

7
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,230
so I've noticed,
I think you're getting funnier.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,350
Oh yes.
Oh No.

9
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:35,570
I think Michael Koren said that this
week I think,

10
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,640
but the word he used was bizarre.
I think

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,120
actually I'm feeling better,
so that's.

12
00:00:41,121 --> 00:00:44,150
I actually have a sense of humor.
It's hard to believe that,

13
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,670
but.
So it sort of comes back when I'm not

14
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,560
feeling like I'm going to die at any
moment.

15
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:53,500
So I basically noticed one,
you're making more attempts a jokes,

16
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:54,334
so that's great.

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,900
Okay,
thank you.

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,170
Those jokes are landing more often,
but then there's this third element

19
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:11,650
which I think was what Steve Martin quit
because of,

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,120
which is that I think the audience is
anticipating jokes more and they're

21
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:16,300
actually,
you know,

22
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:19,300
I've noticed people laughing more at
things that aren't intending to be

23
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:21,580
jokes.
So I was just wondering what you make of

24
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,710
that and um,
their intended.

25
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,010
I'm hoping they're intended.
Just because I keep a straight face

26
00:01:27,011 --> 00:01:28,960
doesn't mean they're not intended to be
jokes.

27
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,460
So.
Yeah.

28
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,301
No,
it's good.

29
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:32,670
Look,
one of the things is like,

30
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,450
it's,
and I've tried to keep this,

31
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,290
I learned a while ago probably about it
five years ago,

32
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,220
and even when you're dealing with really
serious matters that if you're not

33
00:01:41,221 --> 00:01:44,130
handling it with a light touch,
you're not an expert at it.

34
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:46,500
You're not a master at it.
And you'd think while there are some

35
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:50,010
things that are so deep and dark that
you can't handle it with a light touch.

36
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:53,460
And that's actually not true.
You can.

37
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,860
That doesn't mean you make light of
them.

38
00:01:55,861 --> 00:01:58,020
It doesn't mean anything like that.
It's that you don't,

39
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,090
it's minimal necessary force,
something like that.

40
00:02:02,091 --> 00:02:04,280
You don't hit it any harder than you
have to.

41
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,650
And it's a,
it's an art when you're discussing

42
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,270
serious matters.
And so,

43
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,240
well,
one of the upshots of that is that

44
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:15,200
because we're discussing serious matters
and because serious matters are being

45
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,850
discussed in the ultra at large right
now,

46
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,550
it would be really good if everybody
could keep their sense of humor,

47
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,130
you know,
and I see positive signs of that.

48
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:25,070
Like there's a lot of satirical activity
on the net,

49
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:27,320
you know,
and that could easily categorize into

50
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:29,420
horror mob.
But it isn't,

51
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,530
it is,
it is.

52
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,670
That's happening to some degree,
but a lot of it's satire and comedy and

53
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,430
as long as we can keep a sense of humor
about this,

54
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:42,020
then I think,
well we're not as close to disaster as

55
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:42,830
we might be.

56
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,320
And so what?
One of the things that I have found

57
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:47,630
rather ominous is that there are
comedians,

58
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:51,050
first of all,
being persecuted for under free speech

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,470
restriction legislation,
which I think is absolutely appalling.

60
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,950
But also that there are comedians now
who won't perform on university

61
00:02:57,951 --> 00:02:59,680
campuses.
John won't

62
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,490
Seinfeld as like,
well,

63
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,430
you know how offensive he is.
It's no wonder that.

64
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,030
I mean he's like the straightest nicest
comedian you could possibly imagine.

65
00:03:10,031 --> 00:03:14,290
He won't perform on college campuses,
I think Louis Ck won't perform or or

66
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:19,090
anywhere else,
but it's a bad sign.

67
00:03:19,091 --> 00:03:22,210
But no humor.
Humors is good and it's interesting

68
00:03:22,211 --> 00:03:27,010
because I've been kind of watching how
I'm represented on the web weirdly

69
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,130
enough and there's all these memes that
have emerged,

70
00:03:30,131 --> 00:03:34,060
I don't know,
thousands of the bloody things and most

71
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:37,560
of them are comical and that's good.
Like people are,

72
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,620
are,
are,

73
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,650
they're there,
whatever it is that they're doing.

74
00:03:41,651 --> 00:03:44,710
I don't know what the hell it is,
but it's being done with a relatively

75
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,930
light touch and that's really,
really good.

76
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,720
That's how it should be.
You got to have a sense of humor.

77
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,670
I mean,
it's one of the things that makes life

78
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,640
bearable so,
or maybe even better than bearable.

79
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,180
So.
