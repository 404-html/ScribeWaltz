1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:06,850
Well,

2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:07,300
the other,

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,650
the other element is very important
to this is music is the voice of a

4
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:11,563
subculture.

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,310
So when you tell 100 million
kids who filled out early,

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:15,630
isolated and alone,

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,201
that they,

8
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:19,440
that their experiences had not been
reflected in the experience of any other

9
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:20,274
person on earth,

10
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,780
that in fact they are not alone.

11
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:22,680
Layer a movement.

12
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,080
You give a subculture,

13
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,420
a boys and you can see that with,

14
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:27,791
well,

15
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,000
when I finally got into
working with music,

16
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,450
one of the first things I did was
work with country and western music.

17
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,583
Now George,

18
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:35,481
uh,

19
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:37,520
I worked with a company
called doc records.

20
00:00:37,521 --> 00:00:41,660
I was hired by a Gulf and western to
found a public and artist's relations

21
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:43,640
department for their 14 record companies.

22
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,790
And one of those companies
was not records and dot.

23
00:00:46,791 --> 00:00:51,560
Records was number three on the country
charts and that it was with third place

24
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:53,960
company and they wanted to be number one,

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:54,720
uh,

26
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:56,220
in country and western music.

27
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,660
Now when I was a child,

28
00:00:57,661 --> 00:00:59,550
when I was about three
and a half years old,

29
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,080
I woke up on a Sunday before anybody
else in the house had woken up,

30
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,510
went out to the front room
where there was sunlight,

31
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:10,420
which I didn't get to see as often as
I'd like and turned on the radio and

32
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:13,150
because it was six o'clock in the
morning or something like that,

33
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,900
what I got were farm reports
and country and Western music.

34
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:21,580
This was in 19 1946 or
something like that,

35
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,420
or 1947 and I immediately knew

36
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,620
that that music was alien to me and I
knew that it was the music of another

37
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:35,390
subculture would not necessarily be kind
to the subculture from which I came.

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,470
So I never liked country music

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,510
in the 1970s when I got this
position with Gulf and western,

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:47,190
one of the things I crusaded for the
hardest was country and western music

41
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,000
because I felt that these people had
a right to express their identity.

42
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:54,810
I felt they had a right to get
beyond the ghetto of the Bible belt,

43
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,370
which is where they were kept.

44
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:57,630
And where are they were suppressed.

45
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:02,930
It was an era of subculture is finding
themselves and expressing their right to

46
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:04,154
exist.

47
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,053
It started

48
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:08,030
music really does seem to
have that binding capacity.

49
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:08,660
You know,

50
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:13,660
I think there's also something
neurological about that
because to tell me what

51
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:14,750
you think about this,

52
00:02:14,751 --> 00:02:16,760
if this is in accordance
with your observations,

53
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:21,761
but it seems to me that the music that
people listen to as their catalyzing

54
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:23,150
their adult identity,

55
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,390
say between the ages of about 14,

56
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:27,740
15 to 20,

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,221
you know,

58
00:02:28,221 --> 00:02:28,680
there's a,

59
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,121
there's a,

60
00:02:29,121 --> 00:02:30,410
there's a real intense

61
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,863
mmm

62
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,040
period of neural pruning that
occurs at the end of adolescence.

63
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,680
So you'll get none this amount
of neural neural pruning after,

64
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,310
uh,

65
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,680
after you're born in the
early stages of infancy,

66
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:44,170
cause you have a lot of neural
connections and then a lot of them,

67
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,860
you kind of dye into your childhood self,

68
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,080
right?

69
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:47,300
You're,

70
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,970
you're born with twice as many
neurons as you will actually need.

71
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,530
Right?

72
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:50,781
Right.

73
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:51,321
Exactly.

74
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:51,651
And so,

75
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:52,431
so you're,

76
00:02:52,431 --> 00:02:53,990
you're a mass of possibility.

77
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:55,850
And then you dye into your actuality.

78
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:57,980
And then that happens
again in late adolescence,

79
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,230
right?

80
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:02,110
Which is also in schizophrenia develops
because that process seems to go wrong

81
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,801
for some people.

82
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,740
But as you're diving
into that adult identity,

83
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,240
one of the things that seems to catalyze
that is the music of your culture at

84
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:10,781
that time.

85
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:15,640
And that also seems to unite you in some
way underneath rational thought with

86
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:17,790
the people of your generation,

87
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:20,580
let's say with the people you'd have
to cooperate with and compete with.

88
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,920
And so there's something
really deep about that too.

89
00:03:22,921 --> 00:03:24,420
That's not well understood.

90
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:24,980
And,

91
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,813
and,

92
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,840
and so

93
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:27,560
I,

94
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,801
well,

95
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:31,520
so I don't know what you think about the
second element of that because it's a

96
00:03:31,521 --> 00:03:32,540
brilliant observation.

97
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,900
And then the second element of
that is that in your late teens,

98
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,240
your prefrontal cortex gets wired up.

99
00:03:38,241 --> 00:03:39,830
Now what's the pre frontal cortex?

100
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,730
It's pro.

101
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:42,230
We talk about it as the,

102
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:45,590
the center of Administration in
the brain executive functions.

103
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,620
It's primary job is making you human.

104
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,341
What does that mean?

105
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:52,640
You would think that means encouraging
certain things like creativity and

106
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:53,390
thought,

107
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,180
no,

108
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,420
the job of the prefrontal
cortex and making you human

109
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,563
is

110
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,073
press things.

111
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,120
Um,

112
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,010
it's too damp things down.

113
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:08,011
It's to inhibit things and you are
learning which things to inhibit after you

114
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,980
become utterly grafted
into your subculture.

115
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,700
And what is one of the elements that
has grafted you when do your subculture

116
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:15,863
music?

117
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,160
And so what Freud would call the Super
Ego is formed to a certain extent based

118
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,420
on your subculture,

119
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,130
where connections that you've developed
as a team and again use it helps

120
00:04:27,131 --> 00:04:30,070
identify that subculture
of which you feel apart.

121
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:30,650
Right?

122
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:30,801
Well,

123
00:04:30,801 --> 00:04:31,021
okay.

124
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:31,221
So,

125
00:04:31,221 --> 00:04:35,790
so partly what's happening there is that
because music is poetic and also it's

126
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:36,840
poetic and emotional,

127
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:37,674
let's say,

128
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:40,470
it also constitutes the,

129
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,520
the pre rational substrate from which
the values of that subculture emerge.

130
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:46,563
So it's like the,

131
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,930
it's part of the mythological substructure
of the values of that culture.

132
00:04:49,931 --> 00:04:51,490
And you can make absolute sense.

133
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:51,720
Yeah.

134
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:51,971
Yeah.

135
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:53,920
You can see that expressed
in the lyrics in,

136
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:54,520
right.

137
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,110
And where,

138
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:57,820
which lay out a system
of values in some sense.

139
00:04:57,910 --> 00:04:58,610
Right?

140
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,400
Something like hip hop for example.
