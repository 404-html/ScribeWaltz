1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:03,361
Well,

2
00:00:03,361 --> 00:00:06,150
I think certainly one of
the things I've learned,

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:06,421
see,

4
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:10,950
I already knew before all this happened
that people were primarily conforming.

5
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:15,690
I actually don't have much of a problem
with that because most of the time the

6
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:17,250
tradition is correct,

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,460
but sometimes it's not correct at all.

8
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:21,810
That's the problem is that,

9
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:22,920
so you know,

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,400
one of the things I always tell my
clients and my students for that matter is

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,820
you should do what everyone else does
unless you have a really good reason to

12
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:32,784
vary.

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,490
And one of the things I learned
from young Carl Young was that,

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,600
and if you do very,

15
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,690
you should try to only do it in a couple
of directions because you probably

16
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:41,310
can't handle doing it more than that.

17
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,460
It's just too much to
too much psychologically.

18
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,601
But you know,

19
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,830
the problem is is that sometimes the
group is rowing off a cliff and then it's

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,940
then you know,

21
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,320
that's partly why the individual in some
senses the eternal savior of the group

22
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,370
because the group has,

23
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,320
it has the aspect of sheep,

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,131
let's say,

25
00:00:59,131 --> 00:01:00,840
and the sheep are doing fine.

26
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,000
They've got the whole
herd thing going for them,

27
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:05,610
decreases the risk of
individual predation.

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,740
They've got all their
nervous systems in tune.

29
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:09,450
So there's real utility in the herd,

30
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,880
but they're also subject to all the
problems that herds have like heard panic

31
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,240
and so,

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,500
so that's not good enough.

33
00:01:16,501 --> 00:01:19,800
That's what human beings figured
out was that being part of the herd,

34
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:20,970
although necessary,

35
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:21,930
isn't good enough.

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,080
There has to be a balance
between the tradition,

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:29,550
the old dead tradition and the
river vivifying force of the,

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,350
of the law of the living.

39
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,790
Essentially that's,

40
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,570
those are actually how the
gods split up and need you.

41
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:38,670
Because Horace was roughly a
representation of the living and oh,

42
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,630
Cyrus was roughly a representation
of the dead and it was the combined

43
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:46,440
combination of those two that made
up the sovereign very intelligent,

44
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,410
like dramatic political philosophy.

45
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:50,431
So,

46
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,270
but you know,

47
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:53,640
one of the things I have
seen since September is,

48
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:53,911
I mean,

49
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,520
I knew that people were conformance,

50
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:57,480
but I really had,

51
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:00,540
I really had no idea to
what degree that was true.

52
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:01,531
You know,

53
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:01,741
like,

54
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:03,810
I mean I've got ver very,

55
00:02:03,811 --> 00:02:07,290
very few letters of support from
people who are academics for example.

56
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:08,220
And they,

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,440
I get secret reports really.

58
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:10,681
You know,

59
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,640
people will come and say,

60
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:12,240
well,

61
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,350
we agree with what you're doing,

62
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:15,240
but we wish you could be
a little nicer about it.

63
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,373
Which,

64
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,340
which we know it's a funny thing for
people to say because it implies that if

65
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,300
they did what I was doing,

66
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,530
they would do a better job,

67
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,251
you know,

68
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:24,270
in which is fine,

69
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:24,991
but you know,

70
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,060
you can always try it
out and see how it goes.

71
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,830
So when I gave talks,

72
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:30,953
equity,

73
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:35,370
one of the most common comments I would
get after the thing's over and people

74
00:02:35,371 --> 00:02:36,204
are finally,

75
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,960
I agree with everything you said,

76
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:39,863
I would never,

77
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,620
yeah,

78
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:40,861
yeah.

79
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,270
Well it's no wonder it's,

80
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:42,461
no,

81
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,440
it's not surprising,

82
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:43,801
you know?

83
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:44,430
I mean,

84
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,860
there are real reasons not
to stick out from the herd.

85
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,390
If,

86
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,180
if you,

87
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,410
if you mark a zebra so that you
can identify it against the herd,

88
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,850
the lions will kill it.

89
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,411
Right.

90
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,244
And that's that.

91
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,240
Then I tell you,

92
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:00,180
no one that you like
that because they can't,

93
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,660
they can't organize their haunted less.

94
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:03,390
They can identify the individual

95
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:05,881
that's right.

96
00:03:05,881 --> 00:03:06,290
While they're,

97
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,610
they're camouflaged
against the herd zebras.

98
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,901
So that's,

99
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:10,201
man,

100
00:03:10,201 --> 00:03:11,040
that's worth knowing.

101
00:03:11,041 --> 00:03:12,330
It explains a lot that.
