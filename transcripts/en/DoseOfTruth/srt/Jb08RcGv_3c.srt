1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,070
Carl jung says that everything
unconscious is projected into reality.

2
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:09,030
How do you know if you are perceiving
reality accurately or are just projecting?

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,810
Great.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:10,111
Yeah,

5
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:10,291
well,

6
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,180
that's partly why I'm a pragmatist.

7
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,620
While there's a bunch of ways,

8
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,823
um,

9
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,440
there's a bunch of ways that you know,

10
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,480
pain tells you

11
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,560
if you make a mistake and you hurt
yourself while then you're stupid.

12
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:23,400
Theory was wrong,

13
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:23,671
right?

14
00:00:23,671 --> 00:00:24,840
That's what the pain says.

15
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,830
You're stupid theory was
wrong and that's a pragmatic,

16
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:28,051
you see,

17
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:31,590
that's another indication of
pragmatic theory of truth.

18
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,603
You lay out.

19
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,390
Look,

20
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,320
when you look at the world,

21
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,720
you look at the world with
a set of presuppositions.

22
00:00:36,721 --> 00:00:39,540
I outlined that in chapter 10 in in rules,

23
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,450
in 12 rules for life called
be precise in your speech.

24
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,900
It indicates that when
you look at the world,

25
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:47,640
you look at it through a value structure.

26
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,550
You can't help that because you're always
aiming at something in the world and

27
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:53,190
you're always aiming at something
you want and you're trying to get it.

28
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,250
And so that means that you look at
the world through a value structure.

29
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,550
Now the question is whether or
not that value structure is valid.

30
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,800
And that's a very complicated question.

31
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,131
Okay,

32
00:01:02,131 --> 00:01:03,510
so how do you know if it's valid?

33
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,560
Number one,

34
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,960
you lay it out and you acted out,

35
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:07,341
you,

36
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:09,780
you implement it perceptually
and then you act it out.

37
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,760
And if you get what you wanted,

38
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,290
what the theory predicted,

39
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:14,550
that's another way of thinking about it,

40
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,440
but wanted is a better
way of thinking about it.

41
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,510
Then the fact that that behavioral routine
and perceptual structure produced the

42
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:25,830
intended result validates it as
a tool for obtaining that result.

43
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,270
And that's a form of truth.

44
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:28,740
Now,

45
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,240
it might be the only form of truth,

46
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:32,250
although I'm not convinced
of that completely.

47
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:33,084
But it might be,

48
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,650
it's a very complicated question.

49
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:35,341
Now,

50
00:01:35,341 --> 00:01:37,560
how do you know if you're
stupid theory is wrong?

51
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,610
Okay?

52
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,443
A,

53
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,070
it fails and you're hurt.

54
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,270
Pain tells you,

55
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,530
you pragmatically,

56
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,940
your theory was wrong.

57
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,240
So that's why you should pay attention
to your own pain because your suffering

58
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,400
is indication that you
still have things to learn.

59
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,160
And maybe the suffering of
other people is also that,

60
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,240
um,

61
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,660
maybe something unexpected
or unpredictable happens
when you're laying out your

62
00:01:57,661 --> 00:02:00,660
plan and then the
anomalous manifest itself,

63
00:02:00,661 --> 00:02:03,270
the unexpected or chaos
and then you get anxious.

64
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:03,961
Well,

65
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:06,150
anxiety is an indication that your plan,

66
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,710
your Arrow didn't fly too.

67
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:11,880
It's mark so you aimed wrong and
that might mean a small error,

68
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:12,511
you know,

69
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,230
maybe a tiny adjustment of your bowl or
it might mean you just don't know what

70
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:18,510
the hell you're doing at
all and everything is lost.

71
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:22,920
And so anxiety tells you if
your theory is wrong and then,

72
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,560
and then other people tell you that.

73
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,490
And that's why you want to surround
yourself with other people because you

74
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:32,040
distribute your cognitive resources.

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,993
Ew,

76
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,570
ew.

77
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:38,570
You distribute your problems to the
cognitive resources of the social group.

78
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,160
That's what we do when we price things,

79
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:41,371
right?

80
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,760
Everyone votes on the price of something
because it's so difficult because the

81
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,940
price of something has to be established
in relationship to the price of

82
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:48,774
everything else.

83
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,640
And that's always in flux and so it's
computationally impossible problem.

84
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:55,890
And so we outsource it to the market,

85
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,950
which is the free cognitive
decision of millions of people.

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,540
And that's how we determined price.

87
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,260
And so one of the things you do to make
sure that you're not any stupider than

88
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:06,610
you have to be blind,

89
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:07,210
ignorant,

90
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:07,811
biased,

91
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,590
and all of that is you surround yourself
with other people and you try to treat

92
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:13,450
them well enough so that
they can tolerate you.

93
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,960
And then every time that you do something
stupid because one of your theories

94
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:17,730
is,

95
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,260
is vague or incomplete or wrong or biased,

96
00:03:20,261 --> 00:03:21,340
or you're willfully blind,

97
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,170
then they slap you on
the side of the head.

98
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,240
They ignore you because you're boring.

99
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,430
They don't laugh at your
jokes because they're stupid.

100
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,230
They,

101
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:28,900
they,

102
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,180
they are irritated at your
auctions because you're not
taking your own longterm

103
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,560
interests or the interests
of other people into account.

104
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,780
And so you have pain,

105
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,980
you have anxiety,

106
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,280
you have the reward of
success that that's,

107
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:44,560
that's a positive indicator
that your theory is okay.

108
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,960
And then you have the
reactions of everyone else.

109
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,480
And if you're clued in,

110
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:52,840
you pay attention to all of those
things and you try to update your,

111
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,310
your order,

112
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,960
which is your perceptions.

113
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:59,920
You try to update your order constantly
as a consequence of being humble in the

114
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:00,940
face of your errors,

115
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,240
which is why humility is the precondition
of her learning and why it's one of

116
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,500
the highest moral virtues.

117
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:06,640
So.
