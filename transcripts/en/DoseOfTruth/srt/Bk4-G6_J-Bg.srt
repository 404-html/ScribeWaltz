1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:06,353
You know that

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,100
the system in Russia,

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:12,050
the Soviet Union,

4
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,360
which was a collection
of states and empire

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,720
and the system that mouse established in
China and the system that still exists

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:24,260
in Korea as a remnant of the Cold War

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,730
and systems in Southeast Asia and in
Africa were all predicated on Marxist

8
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:33,540
presuppositions.

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,373
MMM

10
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,040
presuppositions that
we're Utopian in nature

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,433
and that

12
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,950
posited or Utopian future where property
was held in common and everyone had

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:53,620
enough and everyone was called upon
to do what they could write from each

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:56,960
according to his ability to
each according to his need,

15
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,730
which is a lovely sentiment.

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,820
And you can imagine how it would be
attractive even intellectually because of

17
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:04,814
course,

18
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,900
other systems,

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,550
all other systems produce
vast disparities in income.
