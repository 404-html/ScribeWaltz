1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:06,781
Yeah.

2
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:07,171
And now,

3
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:07,441
you know,

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:07,861
with bill,

5
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:10,560
she's 16 and now we have
motion one oh three,

6
00:00:10,561 --> 00:00:15,561
the nts homophobia bill and then the
whole child and family services act has

7
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,540
been now changed to a bill 89.

8
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:19,374
And uh,

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:21,900
basically if your child,

10
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:25,110
if Jimmy comes home and
identifies as a girl,

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:25,950
um,

12
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:27,450
and do you kind of,

13
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:27,871
you know,

14
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,760
talk them out of it or saying it in a no.

15
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:30,630
Uh,

16
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,610
you could have cs at your doorstep.

17
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,650
Hold off on the puberty delay,

18
00:00:34,690 --> 00:00:35,310
uh,

19
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,210
hormones there,

20
00:00:36,211 --> 00:00:36,900
Kiddo.

21
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,280
You might change your mind.

22
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:39,150
Yeah.

23
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:43,590
You could keep your breasts for a while
and chased you decide that you're wrong.

24
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,640
I consider this child abuse as a form
of child protection worker for eight

25
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:47,851
years.

26
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:51,510
To me this is a flat out child abuse
that's being sanctioned by the state.

27
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:53,420
And uh,

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,940
what I'm really surprised about is that
more and more parents aren't speaking

29
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:57,774
out about this.

30
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,800
They dropped their litter with a movement.

31
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,020
There are terrified.

32
00:01:01,021 --> 00:01:02,310
Like the teachers are terrified.

33
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:02,850
Serena,

34
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:05,700
there's going to be lawsuits
Galore in 15 years though,

35
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,901
that's for sure.

36
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:11,010
These kids who from whom
consent is being derived,

37
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:14,250
despite the fact that there
have no age to provide consent,

38
00:01:14,251 --> 00:01:19,251
are going to be a vicious
legal protagonists when
they go after the physicians

39
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,880
and,

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,540
and other authorities who've made
these reprehensible decisions.

41
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,520
I wanted to talk to you briefly vote the
law society and about what's happening

42
00:01:29,521 --> 00:01:29,881
recently,

43
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,470
the doctors and the law society.

44
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,311
Uh,

45
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:36,060
and basically the issues that you
were talking with in predicting.

46
00:01:36,061 --> 00:01:37,800
Now we see them come true.

47
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,890
Okay.

48
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,750
So,

49
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:40,643
uh,

50
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,310
when the loss,

51
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:46,310
see I think that the Law
Society of Ontario will
succeed in its pushed to make a

52
00:01:48,001 --> 00:01:53,001
statement of principles reflecting
social justice ideology mandatory.

53
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:54,420
I think they're going to win that.

54
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,380
Um,

55
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,490
I think there will be lawyers
who will refuse to write it,

56
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,390
that will take them to court and then
it'll be dragged out for a long time.

57
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:04,311
But,

58
00:02:04,311 --> 00:02:05,144
um,

59
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:09,600
as soon as the law society capitulates
are soon as the lawyers capitulate,

60
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,450
which they show virtually
every sign of doing that,

61
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:15,600
every professional organization and
counted is going to follow suit.

62
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,580
I don't know if you saw the agenda episode
where Steve Pakan had a whole panel

63
00:02:20,581 --> 00:02:21,181
of lawyers on it.

64
00:02:21,181 --> 00:02:22,170
They were talking about this.

65
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:22,621
No,

66
00:02:22,621 --> 00:02:23,454
I didn't see it.

67
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,090
It just,

68
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,301
uh,

69
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:25,380
it was actually quite recent.

70
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:26,360
I'd say maybe the last two,

71
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:26,761
three weeks,

72
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:28,680
but you should look it
up and you're right.

73
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,640
They have capitulated.

74
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:29,851
Like,

75
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:33,410
it was pretty obvious to me that
this is where we're headed right.
