1
00:00:08,350 --> 00:00:08,951
I know,

2
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:11,860
I know that I have to ask this
because this is one of the,

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,750
I've seen you answer this question,

4
00:00:13,751 --> 00:00:15,500
is that do you believe in God?

5
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:20,180
And I saw a youtube video with you
when you said that you didn't like the

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,350
question because you were,

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,940
you were being boxed in.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,241
And I sort of,

9
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:24,321
I,

10
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:28,900
I felt that because one of the things me
and my wife had been wrestling with is

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,780
we've talked a lot about this.

12
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:36,470
What do we mean when we say that we
believe in God because in Sweden to be

13
00:00:36,471 --> 00:00:37,304
Swedish,

14
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,893
to be Christian,

15
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,020
it was sort of what it means
today to say that you are Swedish.

16
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:43,460
So if you said that you were a Christian,

17
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:45,410
you were sort of a good family father,

18
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:50,510
you had a lot of values within that
being like a good Christian man is.

19
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:53,380
So today when you say
you're a good Swedish brand,

20
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:54,223
perhaps,

21
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:56,060
so it used to mean a lot more,

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,380
but then you had the,

23
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,590
the Evangelical Christians,

24
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,280
uh,

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,420
criticizing exactly this and saying that
you are lost contact with God and then

26
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,760
they meant it in a much smaller sense.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:08,690
Okay.

28
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:13,430
And so they tend to confuse the
biblical stories with lit with empirical

29
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:14,264
history.

30
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:14,990
Yeah,

31
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,320
and it's not surprising they do that
because they're trying to defend their

32
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:19,220
faith against,

33
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,000
let's call it the postmodern assault
or even the modernist assault for that

34
00:01:23,001 --> 00:01:23,271
matter.

35
00:01:23,271 --> 00:01:25,690
I have some sympathy
with their motivations,

36
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:27,380
but the problem is,

37
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:32,381
is that they don't understand that not
all truth is empirical truth in in fact

38
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:36,680
the fundamental truths as far as I
could tell paradoxically enough our

39
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:37,514
Darwinian,

40
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,110
and they actually line
up with religious truths,

41
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,640
which is the point that I've been
trying to make when I discussed this.

42
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:45,590
Such issues with people like Sam Harris.

43
00:01:45,591 --> 00:01:47,510
Like Sam is a very,

44
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:48,560
very smart guy,

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,570
but he's,

46
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,120
he worships the intellect.

47
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:54,410
That's the first thing I would say.

48
00:01:54,411 --> 00:01:58,730
And the second thing is that I was
never able to push him to his solution.

49
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,670
He'd never let me go
there because you know,

50
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:06,500
his idea is that we could rationally
order society so that the wellbeing of

51
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,000
people was maximized.

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,601
And you know,

53
00:02:08,601 --> 00:02:10,130
he even said to,

54
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,253
I think it was,

55
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:14,840
I can't remember which interview it was,

56
00:02:14,841 --> 00:02:18,290
but he said explicitly to the
person that he was interviewing,

57
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:22,430
that he could sit down right now and
come up with a religious system that was

58
00:02:22,431 --> 00:02:23,390
much more rational,

59
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:27,020
inappropriate than any of the ones
that have that have existed to date.

60
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,471
And I think,

61
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:27,800
well,

62
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,070
you know,

63
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:31,820
you're falling right into that
rationalist Utopian pitfall there.

64
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,421
Your nurse,

65
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:33,350
not that smart.

66
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,550
No one can do that.

67
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,080
And as soon as you do it,

68
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:37,610
you end up where the socialists,

69
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,650
like the radical Soviet socialists
or the Nazi utopians ended up,

70
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:45,570
we will be speaking as
grown by now though.

71
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:46,501
Yeah.

72
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:47,334
Well,

73
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:47,700
yes,

74
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,410
exactly.

75
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,760
Except for word restaurant language than,

76
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,683
than Swedish.

77
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,003
Much more.

78
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,250
Most languages are.

79
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,210
Yeah.

80
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:55,541
Yeah.

81
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:55,811
Well,

82
00:02:55,811 --> 00:02:56,410
and that it's,

83
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:57,790
it's like,

84
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,151
you know,

85
00:02:58,151 --> 00:03:02,470
one of the things I really about
Dostoyevsky is that this was in notes from

86
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,041
underground.

87
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:03,874
He,

88
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,320
he just states it very clearly.

89
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:05,651
He said,

90
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,070
you know,

91
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,400
the one thing that you cannot claim about
the history of the world and he meets

92
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:13,960
the history of being is that it's rational
and it isn't that he's criticizing

93
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:17,050
the idea that you could use scientists,

94
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:22,051
scientific investigation and rationality
to lay out a clear representation of

95
00:03:22,061 --> 00:03:23,110
objective reality.

96
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,370
What he's saying is that if you take the
terrible suffering and malevolence into

97
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:29,320
account as fundamental realities,

98
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:34,321
that a rationalist perspective is
absolutely insufficient to tell the story.

99
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:35,823
And that's,

100
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,150
there's no doubt about that.

101
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,230
It's just rationality just breaks
down in the face of those things.

102
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,590
It hits an obstacle that
it cannot contend with.

103
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,350
So you need something else.

104
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,190
And you know,

105
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,680
there's this great image
of Christ as Pantokrator,

106
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:51,071
very,

107
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:52,000
very old image.

108
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,923
Um,

109
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:55,930
fortunately can't remember which
cathedral it's represented in,

110
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:59,860
but it's a great image and I'm having
one of them carved for me right now.

111
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:01,420
It's so,

112
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:05,950
it's a medieval image of Christ and
his face is divided into two halves.

113
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:10,840
So it's very asymmetrical and one half
the eyes are different than the facial

114
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,100
expression is different than the other.

115
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:12,910
And he's also,

116
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,390
he's on portrayed on the top
of the Dome and holding a book.

117
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,460
So the book is sacred,

118
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:18,731
right?

119
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,980
So that's a great idea
that the book is sacred.

120
00:04:20,981 --> 00:04:22,180
That's a great idea,

121
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:22,900
man.

122
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,640
And the idea that the word is sacred,

123
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:29,641
but then the picture also represents
human beings as creatures with one foot in

124
00:04:29,951 --> 00:04:30,784
the,

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,713
in the,

126
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,800
in the profane and one foot in the sacred
or one foot in the finite and one foot

127
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,634
in the infinite.

128
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:38,110
And I actually think that that's,

129
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,240
that's empirically true.

130
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,160
Like we are these weird creatures that
are both finite and infinite at the same

131
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:45,551
time.

132
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:47,320
And we have experiences of that,

133
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:49,630
even like deep religious experiences,

134
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,910
psychedelic experiences for that matter.

135
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,193
Um,

136
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:57,340
invoke that feeling of
that invoke the reality,

137
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:57,911
I would say,

138
00:04:57,911 --> 00:04:59,800
of our connection with the infinite.

139
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,380
Now what that infinite is,

140
00:05:02,381 --> 00:05:04,090
so let's call that God.

141
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:07,600
I mean the Christian ideas that that's
actually outside of time and space

142
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,171
itself,

143
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,170
which is quite a grant,

144
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:09,970
no ship,

145
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,320
and not the least bit

146
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,380
unsophisticated by the way.

147
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:18,880
It's a tremendously sophisticated idea
that something actually exists outside

148
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:21,310
the fabric of time and
space that transcends it,

149
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,460
that they are at the
beginning and at the end.

150
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:28,780
That's an unbelievably sophisticated idea
and I think that people can experience

151
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:30,190
that and do quite commonly,

152
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:34,990
which was why the psychedelic revolution
in the 60s was so absolutely potent.

153
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:40,600
So these sorts of things can't just be
dismissed with some rationalist sleight

154
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:41,434
of hand and,

155
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:41,910
and,

156
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:45,670
and some discussion of the idea that
Christianity Judeo Christianity,

157
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:50,530
let's say as some like primitive set of
wish fulfillment superstitions or some

158
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,251
power game.

159
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:55,390
It's like you just have no
depth of scholarship whatsoever.

160
00:05:55,391 --> 00:05:56,950
If that's what your criticisms are.

161
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,110
I would say when,

162
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:00,501
when,

163
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:00,800
uh,

164
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,430
when you,

165
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,150
your ass,

166
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,140
when you ask someone,

167
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:04,310
do you believe in God?

168
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,233
You,

169
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:09,230
I ask myself if I say that
I don't believe in God

170
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,110
within me.

171
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,450
When I say eh,

172
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,690
what is different within me when I say
that I don't believe in God compared to a

173
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,880
person that says that
he does believe in God.

174
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,080
I mean is if I feel sort of a irrational,

175
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:29,140
I wake up or I take a glass of wine and
then suddenly I'm overwhelmed with love

176
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,360
for human kind or for my fellow
man or something like that.

177
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,831
So if I,

178
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,680
if I was a person who will
say that I believed in God,

179
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:39,140
would that be something?

180
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:43,220
Is it something qualitatively
different between the person,

181
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,460
between me compared to that person?

182
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,020
You understand what I'm saying?

183
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:49,790
I haven't quite got that yet.
