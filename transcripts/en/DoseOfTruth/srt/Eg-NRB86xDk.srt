1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,850
No wonder people disliked this research.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:10,713
It's so,

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,550
it's so anti egalitarianism and it's
essential and it's essential structure.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,090
Well,

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,410
I wanted to make a second point that I
said would be provocative if you want to

6
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:23,650
do something about this and you know,

7
00:00:23,651 --> 00:00:25,690
be tried to a bunch of interventions,

8
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,450
earnest,

9
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,460
well funded,

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,430
warm term interventions
don't seem to work,

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,960
but no science has been excluded from
discussions about what to do about this

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,420
and I believe that neuroscience,

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,440
the progress in neuroscience research
has the potential to really dramatically

14
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:50,080
increase the g factor.

15
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:53,050
Well that's an optimistic statement,

16
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,780
so I'm sure looking forward
to some support for that one.

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:59,980
It's optimistic and reversal and you know,

18
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:01,930
just as a thought experiment,

19
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,620
and I can tell you why I
believe this is possible.

20
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,671
What will first,

21
00:01:06,671 --> 00:01:08,350
before I tell you the thought experiment,

22
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:08,971
the reason I,

23
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:13,971
I'm optimistic is that B is because of
the high heritability of the g factor.

24
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,120
That means your genes are involved.

25
00:01:19,121 --> 00:01:20,800
Gene's work through biology,

26
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,050
even if environment interacts with that,

27
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,770
but basically you have a
neuro biological system.

28
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,420
It's complex,

29
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,550
but as you begin to understand it,

30
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,630
you can tweak it.

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,480
This is what all medicine is doing now.

32
00:01:34,481 --> 00:01:39,481
They're trying to understand the neural
biology slash genetic basis of our

33
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,220
health and our diseases.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,293
Why?

35
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,440
So they can fix it.

36
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,263
So they didn't get,

37
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,740
when you go to the doctor,

38
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:52,660
you're going to cause your biology is
broken and you let your biology fixed.

39
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:53,591
Well,

40
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:55,660
let's think about the brain.

41
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,081
Now,

42
00:01:56,081 --> 00:02:01,081
no one conceptualize as low Iq is a
disease and it's a little dangerous.

43
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,320
But to the extent to which low Iq has
a genetic input or a genetic influence,

44
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,990
that's the extent to which you might
be able to to find out how that works,

45
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,300
how that's what that system is,

46
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:21,540
and then figure out how to tweak
that system to increase Iq.

47
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,670
It's not science fiction.

48
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,490
I mean that's it.

49
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,390
That's a plausible sequence of events.

50
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,090
What the problem is,

51
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:33,310
it's a very complex sequence,

52
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:34,144
the shirt,

53
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,820
but I also think it's a
finite set of problems,

54
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,590
not an infinite set of problems.

55
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,160
So no physicists,

56
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:46,050
physicists configure out what happened
during the first nanoseconds of the big

57
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:47,524
bang.

58
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,310
We can certainly figure out what the
neurobiology of intellect it is and how to

59
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:55,834
tweak it.

60
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,880
So I think that's possible.
