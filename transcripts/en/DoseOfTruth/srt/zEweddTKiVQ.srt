1
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:04,430
How is it that society has not learned
from history about the dangers of

2
00:00:04,431 --> 00:00:05,001
socialism,

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:05,834
Marxism,

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,060
ideology,

5
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,460
et Cetera,

6
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,293
after years,

7
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,890
how to Marxists get away with it?

8
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:10,641
Well,

9
00:00:10,641 --> 00:00:11,474
let's,

10
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:17,300
let's not go with the dangers of etiology.

11
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:21,410
Let's go with the dangers of like
call it radical left wing ideology.

12
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:23,060
Well,

13
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:24,200
I think the reason for this,

14
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,670
and this also might buy the reason,

15
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,440
be the reason that there's a strange
thing that the iconography of,

16
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,220
of social communism is
still acceptable socially,

17
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:36,740
whereas the iconography of Nazi-ism isn't.

18
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:37,970
Now,

19
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:42,970
I'm not saying that we should make the
icons of Nazi as socially acceptable

20
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:44,084
either.

21
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,780
I think that the communist icon
shouldn't be socially acceptable,

22
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:48,614
but they are.

23
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,540
And there's probably a reason for that.

24
00:00:50,541 --> 00:00:51,374
You know,

25
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,311
now,

26
00:00:52,311 --> 00:00:55,790
part of it is that the
left has never taken on.

27
00:00:55,791 --> 00:01:00,791
The radical left has ne never
taken responsibility for
being on the same side as

28
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:05,180
the Stalinists and the Maoists and the
Cambodian murderers and all of that.

29
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,460
So that's part of it.

30
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,890
But then the next part is I
think there's something deeper.

31
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:12,913
I think that,

32
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:13,911
you know,

33
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:18,911
inequality is a reality and it's a
reality that cannot be put at the feet of

34
00:01:19,521 --> 00:01:23,180
capitalism or at the feet of
human political structure.

35
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,770
There's a good book you guys might want
to read this called the great leveler by

36
00:01:27,771 --> 00:01:31,430
Walter Shy Dale and it's a new book
and it's the study of inequality.

37
00:01:31,431 --> 00:01:35,120
And one of the things he does is do an
empirical analysis of the relationship

38
00:01:35,121 --> 00:01:36,260
between inequality,

39
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:37,760
the Gini Coefficient,

40
00:01:37,761 --> 00:01:42,500
which is a measure of inequality and
the ideological position of governments.

41
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,060
So here's the theory.

42
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:45,350
The hypothesis would be,

43
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:45,921
well,

44
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:48,380
because the left wingers are
concerned with inequality,

45
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,670
if you measured inequality in left wing
under left wing governments and you

46
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:54,770
measured inequality under
right wing governments,

47
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:57,980
you'd expect a reduction in inequality
under left wing governments.

48
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,380
And the results are

49
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:02,040
okay,

50
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,940
no difference.

51
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,010
And so what does that mean?

52
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:06,660
It doesn't mean that left
wings are hypocrites,

53
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:09,570
although it might mean that
because people can be hypocrites.

54
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:14,571
But what it means is the problem of
inequality is so intractable that we don't

55
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:18,120
know of any appropriate

56
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,700
political sociological or economic
solutions that actually work.

57
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,650
It's a real catastrophe.

58
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,023
Now,

59
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,310
inequality in itself might not be a
bad thing unless it's too extreme.

60
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,091
It's extreme.

61
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:38,940
When people say start to starve
and then clearly somethings,

62
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:39,931
you know it's,

63
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,100
it's very difficult to,

64
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:46,240
I think everyone would agree
that that's a suboptimal outcome.

65
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:46,571
You know,

66
00:02:46,571 --> 00:02:48,640
we don't need to get all
ideological about that,

67
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,850
but some degree of
inequality is useful because,

68
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:52,601
well,

69
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:54,460
it gives people something to strive for.

70
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:55,420
It gives them an op,

71
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,373
right?

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,640
It means,

73
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,080
I was thinking about this,

74
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:03,190
sometimes you actually want people to
be rich because if a new product is

75
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,570
introduced into the market,

76
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,950
the people there have to be people around
who have substantial pools of capital

77
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,590
to be able to afford it
when it's still novel.

78
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:15,310
And then that market brings the
price down for everyone else.

79
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,950
And so if everyone had
exactly the same income,

80
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:21,220
it would be very difficult to introduce
expensive products into the market with

81
00:03:21,221 --> 00:03:22,750
the hope that their price would plummet.

82
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,370
Not actually is a big deal.

83
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,790
You want large pools of
capital sitting around too,

84
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,290
so that people can invest in very,

85
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:30,640
very complex things.

86
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:34,780
And you also want large pools of capital
to be the hands have to be in the hands

87
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:37,990
of private individuals so
that there's competitive,

88
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,670
there's forces that are powerful,

89
00:03:39,671 --> 00:03:43,510
that are competitive with the government
and with other large organizations.

90
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:46,380
So anyways though,

91
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,950
back to the Marxists,

92
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:53,910
despite the fact that there are reasons
for inequality and despite the fact that

93
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:58,750
you can't lay the fact of inequality at
the feet of capitalism and despite the

94
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:03,751
fact that capitalism also appears to be
making every one not absolutely poor at

95
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:08,860
the same time as it makes
some people very rich,

96
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:15,040
there's still inequality is still painful
reality and no one really likes it.

97
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:15,971
You know?

98
00:04:15,971 --> 00:04:17,770
I mean you can lord it over someone,

99
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:18,341
I suppose,

100
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:18,880
and,

101
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,960
and extract out some sense of your
moral superiority because you happen to

102
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:26,230
occupy a hierarchical
position that's higher.

103
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:28,150
And sometimes there's
some validity in that,

104
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:29,350
especially if you've earned it.

105
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,800
Although I would say like glorying in
it is probably a suboptimal outcome.

106
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,430
It's still the case that that inequality
violates a moral intuition that

107
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:40,151
everyone has.

108
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:40,481
I think,

109
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:44,080
and that's probably the moral intuitions
that lie along the agreeable access.

110
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,160
It's like,

111
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,311
well,

112
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:47,350
wouldn't it be better
if everyone had enough?

113
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:48,461
It's like,

114
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:48,671
well,

115
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:49,810
who argues with that?

116
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,350
You know,

117
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:50,561
I mean,

118
00:04:50,561 --> 00:04:51,610
everyone feels that way.

119
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:52,780
And so I think,

120
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:53,980
um,

121
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,270
a thoughtless,

122
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,250
a thoughtless compassion makes Marxism,

123
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:02,890
okay.

124
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,300
Naively attractive.

125
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:09,970
And I'm not being cynical about that
because there is some utility in naive

126
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:10,840
agreeableness,

127
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:15,730
but unfortunately the world
is a very complicated place.

128
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,120
And merely wanting to be nice about things
and wishing that everything was fair

129
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,640
doesn't justify imposing an
equity outcome and Gerrymandering,

130
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:31,540
complex economic systems that will bite
you if you mess with them because you're

131
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,920
ideologically possessed.

132
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,390
I am 46,

133
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:47,410
retired executive,

134
00:05:47,411 --> 00:05:47,831
wealthy,

135
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,330
competent and full of Jews.

136
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,340
Who could I talk to if I want to invest
time slash money slash energy in your

137
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,180
university

138
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,130
people,

139
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,240
lots of people are,

140
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:03,560
are asking me such things and
it's very much appreciated.

141
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:04,341
It's a weird,

142
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:04,581
you know,

143
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:08,960
because you'd think that if people are
offering you time and money that it would

144
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:10,640
be a straight forward thing to say,

145
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,391
yes,

146
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,980
please climb aboard and help.

147
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:15,800
But it's not that simple
because first of all,

148
00:06:15,801 --> 00:06:20,450
I don't want to involve people in
something that I can't be sufficiently

149
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:21,284
committed to.

150
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:22,790
It's not fair to them.

151
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,500
Um,

152
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,370
and it isn't obvious to me how I can be
committed to this yet fully committed to

153
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:28,521
it.

154
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,300
And so I'm sort of playing with
it at the level that I can manage.

155
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,920
It's not like it's a game.

156
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:39,100
We have a good product in
involved or a good product in,

157
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,000
in motion at the moment,

158
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,250
but I'm not,

159
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:46,100
I don't have the wherewithal
to scale at the moment.

160
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,680
And you know,

161
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,821
you can say,

162
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:54,150
and people who are developing
new businesses like to do this,

163
00:06:54,151 --> 00:06:57,390
like let's say I could come up with
a draft business plan for an online

164
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,210
university and then I could
contact people like you,

165
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,730
Paul and say,

166
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:03,031
look,

167
00:07:03,031 --> 00:07:04,950
I'm ready to gather investments in,

168
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:08,760
let's say I could raise $20 million or
let's say I could raise $200 million.

169
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,290
Then I have a new problem.

170
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:11,671
The problem is,

171
00:07:11,671 --> 00:07:11,881
well,

172
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:12,481
Oh my God,

173
00:07:12,481 --> 00:07:14,790
I've got all this money now I have to
figure out something to do with it.

174
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,340
And that's actually a
really big responsibility.

175
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:18,030
Not,

176
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:18,863
it's not like,

177
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,261
you know,

178
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:20,730
it's a success catastrophe,

179
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,350
let's say it's a first world problem.

180
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:23,071
I get all that,

181
00:07:23,071 --> 00:07:25,620
but that doesn't mean that it isn't real.

182
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,000
So I have to do a lot
more thinking and planning

183
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,880
and figure out how to disperse my time
most effectively before I dare to take on

184
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,820
any additional people
who would like to help.

185
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:41,300
Now,

186
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,300
once my organization as it is in a
place where that sort of help would be

187
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:48,471
useful,

188
00:07:48,471 --> 00:07:51,950
then I'll make a public announcement and
I would be more than happy for people

189
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:53,960
to jump on board.

190
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:55,310
Let's say climb on board,

191
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:56,240
start pushing,

192
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,560
devote resources,

193
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:58,400
all of those things.

194
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,980
I'd be happy for that to happen that,

195
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,020
but I don't want to do it prematurely
because I don't want people to,

196
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,360
to risk their valuable resources in
an endeavor that isn't yet solid.

197
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,553
So,

198
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,641
all right,

199
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:17,470
so I'm only going to do,

200
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,790
I think one more question.

201
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,823
Um,

202
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,800
I am a sober alcoholic slash drug addict.

203
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:41,910
How can I find my way back to belief
in a higher power after 10 years in the

204
00:08:41,911 --> 00:08:43,200
empty void of atheism,

205
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,550
I'm falling apart.

206
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,741
Well,

207
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:57,741
I would say your best bet is to
actually start devoting some time to it.

208
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:00,840
You know,

209
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,673
for me,

210
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:05,730
I became convinced of the
validity of a religious viewpoint.

211
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,330
I think as a consequence of study

212
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:12,961
read,

213
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:16,980
Joseph Campbell read
Carl Young Young's hard.

214
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,050
Campbell's a good introduction though.

215
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,030
Richa Ellie out as well.

216
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,110
I don't know if you can find
your way back to belief,

217
00:09:26,111 --> 00:09:30,010
but you might be able to find your way
back to meaningful engagement and that

218
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:30,844
might,

219
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,710
that's a better way of thinking about it.

220
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:34,610
You know,

221
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,320
the belief thing is a really tricky one.

222
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:36,951
People ask me,

223
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,060
do you believe in God?

224
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,553
And I think,

225
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:40,641
I really think,

226
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:42,530
how dare you ask that question.

227
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,780
I think that's really what I think.

228
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,303
Yeah.

229
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,660
But on a more prosaic level,

230
00:09:49,661 --> 00:09:50,321
I usually think,

231
00:09:50,321 --> 00:09:50,501
well,

232
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:52,060
I don't know what you mean by belief.

233
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:56,500
I don't know what you mean by belief
and I don't know what you mean by God.

234
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:58,800
These are very,

235
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,050
these,

236
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,050
these are very difficult questions
and none of that self evident.

237
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,610
Now I would say,

238
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,060
do I believe in the crucifixion?

239
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:07,751
Well,

240
00:10:07,751 --> 00:10:08,261
certainly,

241
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:09,094
I mean people,

242
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,420
the crucifixion,

243
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,210
how can you not believe in it if,

244
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,900
if you think symbolically,

245
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,720
it's like human beings are,

246
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,850
we're eternally crucified,

247
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,013
right?

248
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,080
Our lives are tragic and
they end in death and were,

249
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,370
we're all betrayed.

250
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:25,930
We're all betrayed.

251
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,900
We all experienced betrayal.

252
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,830
So how could you,

253
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,120
you can't not believe in the crucifixion.

254
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:35,500
Do you believe in the resurrection?

255
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,203
Well,

256
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,210
people die and are reborn all the time.

257
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,170
You know,

258
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,010
they go through,

259
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,450
this is what you're after here.

260
00:10:43,451 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm a sober drug and
alcohol and drug addict.

261
00:10:45,761 --> 00:10:45,941
Well,

262
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:46,211
you know,

263
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:46,930
you,

264
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,380
you had to let a lot of you die when you
stop being an addict and something new

265
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:51,250
be reborn.

266
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,910
It's like what's the ultimate significance
of that and how is it tied to the

267
00:10:54,911 --> 00:10:56,830
notion of bodily resurrection?

268
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,490
Well,

269
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,620
I don't know what the
ultimate significance is,

270
00:10:59,621 --> 00:11:02,050
but it does seem to be
the pathway through life

271
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,853
to believe.

272
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,750
I would say you start
believing not by attempting to

273
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,370
convince yourself that the
statement there is a god is true,

274
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:24,380
like a fact is true,

275
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:29,710
but to act out the proposition that you
should shoulder your cross and stumble

276
00:11:30,321 --> 00:11:32,510
uphill towards the city of God.

277
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,890
That's belief,

278
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:34,724
man,

279
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,470
and you can do that

280
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,133
right away.

281
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
Now you might ask,

282
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:43,751
well,

283
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:48,751
do I have any guarantee that that has
transcendent and universal significance?

284
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:49,834
It's like,

285
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,883
well,

286
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,290
it's not a bad model for emulation.

287
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,750
It has universal
significance in that regard.

288
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:02,670
We each have to shoulder the tragedy
of our existence and stumble upwards.

289
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:06,830
Despite that it has
universal significance.

290
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11,390
Does it have significance outside of
life and like get the internal eternal

291
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,224
realm?

292
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,443
Okay.

293
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,370
I wouldn't surprise me if it did.

294
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:22,040
I suppose it depends on what
you mean by the eternal realm.

295
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:22,874
The

296
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,930
seems to have significance in the
eternal realm of consciousness.

297
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,210
It seems to have significance in the
eternal realm of unconscious fantasy,

298
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,730
implicit fantasy and mythology.

299
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,390
How is it connected
with the factual world?

300
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,153
Okay.

301
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,960
That's a hard question because the factual
world in some sense divorced itself

302
00:12:48,961 --> 00:12:53,220
from that transcendental world during
the development of the scientific

303
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:54,060
methodology.

304
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,960
So never the Twain shall meet.

305
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,520
It's a methodological issue.

306
00:12:59,521 --> 00:13:00,354
In part,

307
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,970
I think you probably have to draw on the
same forces that enabled you to sober

308
00:13:10,971 --> 00:13:12,830
up and abandoned your drug addiction.

309
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:14,331
No,

310
00:13:14,331 --> 00:13:16,460
something was guiding you forward.

311
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,750
Go forward again,

312
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,461
go forward again,

313
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:21,320
as if there is a higher power.

314
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,300
That's your manifestation of faith.

315
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,040
Go forward again,

316
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:28,940
as if being is benevolent and God is good.

317
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:31,820
That's the hallmark of courage

318
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,100
and that's a good place to stop.

319
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,730
Thank you all for showing up today and uh,

320
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,100
and for all the support and,

321
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,830
and that's enough for March,

322
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,290
March 4th,

323
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,090
2018 bye bye.
