1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:07,811
And they say,

2
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:08,380
look,

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:08,670
you know,

4
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,790
we're in real trouble unless someone
goes out there and confronts tire Matt

5
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,330
Straight on,

6
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:14,890
she's going to wipe everything out.

7
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,150
It's a dangerous and terrifying job,

8
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:20,290
but somebody has to do it.

9
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:20,981
And Mark says,

10
00:00:20,981 --> 00:00:21,160
oh,

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,941
that's no problem,

12
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:24,910
but I got a few rules here
and this is the first rule.

13
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:25,850
Hi,

14
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:28,480
I'm in charge from here on forward.

15
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,970
What does that mean exactly?

16
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,503
Well,

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,910
these archaic stories,

18
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:40,911
our policy in our policy policymakers
in Northrup fries terminology,

19
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:45,330
and what that means is that they can
be read validly at multiple levels of

20
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,010
analysis simultaneously.

21
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,190
And so one thing it means is that if
you take the two year old child who's

22
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,060
essentially under the dominion of
assorted primordial Gods and Goddesses,

23
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,720
right?

24
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,590
Aggression,

25
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,600
fear,

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,793
panic,

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,840
and according to Freud,

28
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,770
a certain degree of sexual aggression,

29
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:09,780
the child moves from domination,

30
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,260
from motivated state to
domination for motivated state.

31
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:17,580
And it isn't until the age of three and
four when under the pressure applied by

32
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:18,480
the social world.

33
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,110
And as a consequence of the
maturation of the prefrontal Cortex,

34
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,680
which matures throughout
childhood and adolescence,

35
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:29,640
and doesn't reach its final form
until perhaps into the early twenties,

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,350
all of those fundamental motivational
force to start taking on a structured

37
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:36,060
relationship to one another,

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,540
which is to say that once your,

39
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:41,970
as your personality becomes integrated,

40
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,570
a single motive force forward has to
bring all of these underlying motivational

41
00:01:48,091 --> 00:01:50,430
systems into some sort of
harmonious arrangement.

42
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,001
Okay,

43
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:51,610
so let's,

44
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,580
let's see what the
Sumerians are doing here.

45
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:53,821
Okay.

46
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,361
First of all,

47
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:54,800
they're,

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,950
they're doing psychology.

49
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:57,030
They're trying to figure out,

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,870
given the dominion of the elder gods,

51
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:04,380
the indisputable dominion
of the elder gods instincts.

52
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,850
Who should rule,

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,810
right?

54
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,860
What should be in charge,

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,710
how do you construct
the hierarchy of values?

56
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,930
And then more complex.

57
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:13,764
Lee,

58
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,630
when you integrate a state,

59
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,090
which is what the Mesopotamians did,

60
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:18,331
right?

61
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:19,800
The first great civilization.

62
00:02:19,801 --> 00:02:20,634
What does that mean?

63
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,820
The first time hundreds of tribes were
hammered into some sort of stable,

64
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,200
hierarchical order.

65
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:29,850
How do you represent that order?

66
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,240
So Marta gets his act together.

67
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,580
The gods all meet in a huge chamber.

68
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,730
They elect him king and then
they prepare them for battle.

69
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,110
When the gods of the father's
beheld the power of his word,

70
00:02:46,111 --> 00:02:49,080
they were glad and didn't
homage saying Martin is king.

71
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,120
They bestowed upon them a sceptre,

72
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,841
a throne,

73
00:02:51,841 --> 00:02:52,890
and a royal robe.

74
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,120
They gave him an irresistible weapons,

75
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:56,430
fighting the enemy saying,

76
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,340
Golan cut off the life of tire.

77
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:58,980
Matt.

78
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,000
May the winds carry her
blood out of the way.

79
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,460
Places after the gods.

80
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:05,980
His father's had determined
the destiny of Marduk.

81
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,551
They said,

82
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:09,190
I'm on the road the way
to success and attainment,

83
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,160
so then he goes to the heart of darkness,

84
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:14,881
so to speak,

85
00:03:14,881 --> 00:03:15,800
and confronts tire.

86
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,550
Matt accuses her of treachery
and challenges are to battle.

87
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,290
When Tom had heard this,

88
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:25,050
she became like one in a
frenzy and lost her reason.

89
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:29,010
She cried out loud and furiously
to the very roots or two legs,

90
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,180
shook back and forth.

91
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,050
She recited an incantation
repeatedly casting her spell.

92
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,880
As for the gods of battle,

93
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,910
they sharpened their weapons Tiamat and
Marduk the wisest of the gods advanced

94
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,000
against one another.

95
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,990
They pressed onto single combat
and approached for battle.

96
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,251
Okay,

97
00:03:47,251 --> 00:03:49,280
well things don't go
out so well with time.

98
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,040
Matt,

99
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,970
from this point forward,

100
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:53,160
the first thing that Martech does,

101
00:03:53,161 --> 00:03:54,900
it encapsulate her and then net,

102
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,040
and I think that's a really interesting
metaphor because that's essentially what

103
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:01,160
human beings do when they
encounter the unknown,

104
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:01,411
right?

105
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:04,890
They encapsulated in
an explanatory network,

106
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:10,250
so it's a way of binding up the the
anomaly or the unknown and giving it a

107
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,050
substandard form.

108
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,240
Then he cuts her into pieces.

109
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,620
Then he makes the world out of her pieces.

110
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:19,791
In fact,

111
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:24,791
one of Martin's names is he who makes
ingenious things as a consequence of the

112
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:28,580
combat with ty and mapped out.

113
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,211
That's very,

114
00:04:29,211 --> 00:04:32,990
very interesting because what it means
is that the Samaritans are presenting in

115
00:04:32,991 --> 00:04:36,530
metaphorical form the notion
that when the chips are down,

116
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:41,531
the survival of being depends
on the capacity of whatever
Martech represents the

117
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:45,080
solar God to encounter
the Matrix of being,

118
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,660
to cut it into pieces
and to make the world.

119
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,100
And if you think about it in those terms,

120
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:49,551
it's a very,

121
00:04:49,551 --> 00:04:50,870
very straightforward story,

122
00:04:50,871 --> 00:04:51,051
right?

123
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:52,880
It's basically the story of human beings,

124
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,020
fundamentally the story of
human beings because we,

125
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,910
in the words of a famous evolutionary
psychologist whose name completely escapes

126
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:02,360
me.

127
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,280
We occupied the cognitive niche,

128
00:05:04,281 --> 00:05:04,790
right?

129
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:09,770
Our motive being his creativity in the
in the face of the unknown and when chaos

130
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:14,630
threatens the established motive being,

131
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,830
it's necessary for us to
put our creativity into
action and to carve out new

132
00:05:18,831 --> 00:05:23,150
territory or territory as a consequence
of encounter with the unknown.

133
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,193
Why?

134
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,441
Well,

135
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:28,190
because we can take the world apart with
our hands and put it together in new

136
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,570
ways and then we can scold what we've
done verbally and we can transmit it to

137
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:36,080
another person and then they can do the
same thing and we're all doing this all

138
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:38,570
the time and we're all telling
each other how we're doing it.

139
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,050
And that's how the embodiment
of logos in the human being,

140
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,020
which is precisely equivalent
to this Sumeria notion of Marta.

141
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,400
That's precisely how it is.

142
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:49,940
That we're constantly capable
of redeeming the world.
