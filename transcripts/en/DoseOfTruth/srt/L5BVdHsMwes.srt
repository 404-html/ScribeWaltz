1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,470
See,

2
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:04,910
one of the things that's happened
in Ontario recently is that we've,

3
00:00:05,210 --> 00:00:06,950
our our government is introduced

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,030
legislation that is predicated on the
idea that all families are equal and the,

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,630
the idea behind that you
could argue is laudable.

6
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,670
I wouldn't argue that,

7
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:23,680
but you could argue it that you know,

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,650
people have a variety of ways of solving
the problem of having children and that

9
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:33,651
there's a variety of viable solutions
to that problem and that no one family

10
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:38,400
organizational type should be
privileged above the others.

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,030
I mean,

12
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,300
I suppose with the exception
of multipart in your marriages,

13
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:45,090
which we still don't approve of.

14
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:49,830
Let's say the problem with that as far
as I can tell is that it does appear from

15
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:54,690
the research that the nuclear
family is the smallest viable unit.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,280
Which is not to say that there aren't
single mothers or single fathers who do an

17
00:00:59,281 --> 00:01:01,500
admirable job under trying conditions.

18
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,790
But part of the problem,

19
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,020
this is a deep problem,

20
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:04,854
is that

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,073
whenever you,

22
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,370
whenever you pause it,

23
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,480
something as a value.

24
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,201
So you might say,

25
00:01:10,201 --> 00:01:10,381
well,

26
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:12,510
we want intact families,

27
00:01:12,511 --> 00:01:13,500
mother and father.

28
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:14,160
That's the.

29
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:16,950
That's the value we're heading for
because that seems to be best for the

30
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,610
children.

31
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,660
Then you produce a rank
order of accordance with that
and the people who aren't

32
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:22,980
in accordance with that value,

33
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:26,940
you can easily make a case that they're
being discriminated against and we're in

34
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:31,680
a situation in our society now where
even if the discrimination occurs,

35
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,663
let's say,

36
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,130
because of the pursuit
of an admirable value,

37
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:39,630
it's regarded as prejudicial and I
think that's fed by that underlying

38
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:43,020
hypothesis that was anti nuclear family,

39
00:01:43,021 --> 00:01:48,021
that any sort of hierarchical structure
is part of the tear radical patriarchy.

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,040
It's something like that
that's running underneath it.

41
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,821
So anyways,

42
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:53,370
let's review if you would be very helpful.

43
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:54,300
I think for everyone,

44
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,800
some of the many ways that it's
necessary for children to have fathers,

45
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,280
why that's better and perhaps
also for for society as well,

46
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,300
not just for children.

47
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:04,723
Absolutely.

48
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,350
Children that have a lot about an equal
or more than equal father involvement

49
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,250
have a number of things in common as a
rule and obviously there's reversals of

50
00:02:13,251 --> 00:02:15,680
this and not that everyone puts this,

51
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,010
this,

52
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,843
this pattern,

53
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,420
but the first is they're far more likely
to have postpone gratification and I'll

54
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,470
elaborate on that a little bit more.

55
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Postpone gratification is probably the
single most important quality to becoming

56
00:02:30,471 --> 00:02:32,930
successful and becoming successful,

57
00:02:32,931 --> 00:02:37,700
especially being employed in a job that
has some meaning for you is one of the

58
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:42,701
most important ingredients in happiness
and a sense of purpose and a sense of

59
00:02:43,221 --> 00:02:47,660
motivation and a sense of willingness
to get up in the morning and so I'm in a

60
00:02:47,661 --> 00:02:48,081
little while.

61
00:02:48,081 --> 00:02:52,100
I'll be happy to just trace back how
that postpone gratification happens more

62
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:53,410
when you have a father.

63
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:53,791
Yeah,

64
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:55,740
because I'm really interested
in hearing about that.

65
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,080
Second.

66
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,270
Second layer is far children and that
have an equal amount of father involvement

67
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,980
are far less likely to be depressed.

68
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:03,600
They're far less,

69
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,120
more likely to be assertive
and not aggressive,

70
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,780
which is something you usually
think of men as being aggressive,

71
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,610
but actually the children,

72
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:17,470
both girls and boys whose fathers are
involved are far more likely to understand

73
00:03:17,471 --> 00:03:20,650
the distinction between being assertive
and being aggressive and choose

74
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:21,484
assertiveness.

75
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,160
Boys and another surprising one for me,

76
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,590
I'm doing the research was finding that
boys and girls who are raised with about

77
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:34,390
an equal amount of father involvement
are far more likely to be empathetic

78
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,350
because I always thought of empathy
coming predominantly from moms and I'll be

79
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:42,130
happy to explain in a bit why
it does come more from moms,

80
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:42,701
but why?

81
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:46,060
The outcome for the child
is not more empathy.

82
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,250
The outcome for the child is less empathy,

83
00:03:48,251 --> 00:03:49,990
so a little bit more on that later.

84
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,170
Far more likely.

85
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,320
Both boys and girls should drop
out of school if there isn't far.

86
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,430
Father involvement.

87
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,500
A far more likely when a,

88
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,250
when a.

89
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,480
When a relationship breaks up,

90
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,700
a child that has not had significant
father involvement is much more likely to

91
00:04:06,701 --> 00:04:08,740
be depressed and be withdrawn and b,

92
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,910
feel alienated.

93
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,180
I'm far more likely to be
addicted to video games,

94
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:15,790
far more likely to be
addicted to video porn.

95
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,013
I'm far less,

96
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,720
more likely to have a few social skills,

97
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,910
few emotional skills to do
worse in every academic area,

98
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:27,250
but especially in reading and writing,

99
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,770
which are the two biggest
predictors of success,

100
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,100
a far more likely to have
a lower sperm count have.

101
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:33,730
Um,

102
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:34,870
and here's an amazing thing.

103
00:04:34,871 --> 00:04:39,610
I just discovered toward the end of the
research for the boy crisis I saw in

104
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,320
pediatrics magazine,

105
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:46,321
and that children who by the age of
nine don't have a significant amount of

106
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:51,520
father involvement in both girls and
boys who are likely to have shorter

107
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,354
telomeres.

108
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,890
And as most of us know,

109
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,020
the telomeres are pivotal in
predicting life expectancy.

110
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:00,760
So boys and girls,

111
00:05:00,761 --> 00:05:05,761
the average shorter telomere for a nine
year old boy or girl without father

112
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:09,520
involvement was 14 percent a w,

113
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:09,911
I'm sorry,

114
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,650
it was a yes,

115
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,910
a 14 percent shorter,

116
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,530
but the boys,

117
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:19,030
telomeres were then again 40
percent shorter than the girls.

118
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,200
So here,

119
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:25,201
this was predicting about a 14 percent
shorter life expectancy for the average

120
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:28,600
child without father involvement
by the age of nine already.

121
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,940
And yet the boys were suffering more.

122
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,980
So two things fascinated me.

123
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:33,880
There is,

124
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,250
you know,

125
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,520
if all the things like,

126
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:37,000
you know,

127
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,130
dropping out of school
and things like that.

128
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,060
I asked myself,

129
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:40,751
well,

130
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:42,970
maybe this is because boys
with father involvement,

131
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,710
I'm just have better,

132
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,490
um,

133
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,380
better neighborhoods.

134
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:46,830
Um,

135
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,370
they,

136
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:47,800
they,

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,120
the father's earned more,

138
00:05:49,121 --> 00:05:49,980
the families are more,

139
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:52,240
maybe it's a matter of
poverty versus poverty.

140
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,600
So I started looking at a boys and
girls growing up in and good quote,

141
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,610
good neighborhoods with good schools
and comparing them with boys and girls

142
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:06,611
growing up in poor neighborhoods in
poor schools and found that the boys and

143
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:10,940
girls growing up in good neighborhoods
with poor schools that did not have

144
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,410
significant father involvement,

145
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:17,740
did about the same as boys and girls
growing up in poor neighborhoods with poor

146
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:20,120
schools that did have father involvement.

147
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:22,360
That father involvement was really as,

148
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,770
as good a predictor of success.

149
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,460
Um,

150
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,470
as the quality of the school system,

151
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,440
the quality of the neighborhood
and the socioeconomic class,

152
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,330
and this is what's led to,

153
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,643
you know,

154
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:39,220
to the psychologist I'm gathering
together behind people like worship 100

155
00:06:39,801 --> 00:06:41,780
psychologists and researchers saying,

156
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,291
you know,

157
00:06:42,291 --> 00:06:43,700
this is not a correlation.

158
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,110
The involvement of father,

159
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:48,050
this is not a matter of
socioeconomic issues.

160
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,870
This is a matter of actual father's,

161
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:51,770
father's,

162
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:53,000
father's involvement,

163
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:57,710
especially the biological father's
involvement actually makes a significant

164
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:58,520
difference.

165
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
We have been wrong about the assumption
that this would probably just a

166
00:07:01,521 --> 00:07:02,354
correlation.

167
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,820
And so the more I looked,

168
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,240
the more I found just every
nightmare of a parent.

169
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,093
Um,

170
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,090
she'd be so increased,

171
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:11,691
uh,

172
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:14,300
when there was not a significant
amount of father involvement.

173
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,230
And I was seeing,

174
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,030
I was dating between,

175
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:18,520
before I married lives.

176
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,700
The woman you just met,

177
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,060
um,

178
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,390
just before we got on a,

179
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,590
before we got married 14 years ago,

180
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,280
um,

181
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,810
I was dating a number of women.

182
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:28,190
Almost every woman had a,

183
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,370
was a single mother and these,

184
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,650
every single woman was working
her rear end to balance her life.

185
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,860
Every woman used the word
overwhelmed by the way she felt.

186
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:41,120
Every.

187
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,260
Almost every woman said,

188
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:42,411
well,

189
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:44,570
I'd like my dad and the dad involved,

190
00:07:44,571 --> 00:07:45,770
but um,

191
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,550
but when the.

192
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,550
But I started listening to the butts of
the women and then listening to men who

193
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:52,160
had,

194
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,450
wanted to be more involved with their
children and listening to what the

195
00:07:56,451 --> 00:07:58,460
differences were between the mit,

196
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,500
what made the men feel not wanted,

197
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:05,660
what made the men feel excluded and why
the women felt that they needed to not

198
00:08:05,661 --> 00:08:06,680
have the man involved.

199
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,950
And I saw this entire set
of misunderstandings here
and if I hope the boy crisis

200
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,390
does anything is so.

201
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,810
It's just sort of explained,

202
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,381
you know,

203
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:19,220
here are the 10 major
things that Dad's do that,

204
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:24,790
that sort of annoy women or make women
feel that they're not protecting their

205
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,180
children adequately.

206
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:30,890
Which when they understand the purpose
of these things and when dads get their

207
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:35,891
homework done enough to articulate to
the moms the purpose of these things that

208
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,220
will realize that the,

209
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:37,730
that the,

210
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,550
these are necessary
ingredients in a child's life.
