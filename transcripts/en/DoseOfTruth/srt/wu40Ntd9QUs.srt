1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:01,500
How do you define reality?

2
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:04,110
That's a tough one.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,770
So I would say most of you define reality
like you're Isaac Newton or maybe like

4
00:00:10,681 --> 00:00:14,670
your Democritus who was the first
person who hypothesized Adams.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,770
And so in the Newtonian world,

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,360
it's like billiard ball world,

7
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:19,110
right?

8
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,740
Everything is made out of little billiard
balls and they bang together in a

9
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:26,190
causal way and you can predict the
consequences of their banging together.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,690
And if you extend it enough,

11
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:30,510
you can conjure up an
entirely deterministic world.

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:32,300
A happens causes B,

13
00:00:32,301 --> 00:00:37,301
B causes c always the same way and
everything runs like a giant clock.

14
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,150
That's Newton's model.

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,620
And,

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,430
and it was a clock model because you know,

17
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,270
back at that time,

18
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:42,781
clocks,

19
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:43,051
man,

20
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:44,850
those things were pretty damn impressive.

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,360
Clocks got the whole industrial
revolution underway and you know,

22
00:00:48,361 --> 00:00:52,140
medieval cities would put an awful lot
of time and work into their clocks and

23
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,210
they thought those damn
things were really cool.

24
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:54,690
You know,

25
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,180
they could keep track of
where the planets were moving.

26
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,370
It's like that's a big deal at Clark.

27
00:00:59,371 --> 00:01:02,040
And then if you want to think about
an invention that changed the world,

28
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,630
it's like the clock's a big one.

29
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:06,660
Now we can measure time in the same way.

30
00:01:06,661 --> 00:01:08,100
Everyone can measure time.

31
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,270
It's a big deal.

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,700
So the idea that the
universe is like a clock,

33
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,850
given that the clock can
predict the universe,

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,710
it's a pretty damn powerful idea.

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,770
It turns out that it's
wrong because you know,

36
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:21,060
causalities a mass,

37
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:22,350
no one really understands it.

38
00:01:22,351 --> 00:01:26,280
And there are levels of analysis that
which causality just in the way we

39
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,830
experience it doesn't seem
to imply it apply at all.

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
You go down to the subatomic level,

41
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:31,800
it's probabilistic.

42
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,750
You can't predict single events.

43
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:36,180
And I don't believe that
you can predict the future.

44
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,990
You can predict parts of the future
in an extremely limited way for some

45
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:40,710
purposes,

46
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,170
for some span of time that,

47
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:46,380
and you can't even predict how long
that span of time is going to last.

48
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:47,051
You know?

49
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:51,540
And some things seem to be more stable
across more situations and more times

50
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,374
than others,

51
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,610
but there's still,

52
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:56,940
there's instability everywhere and
it makes it predicting things a very

53
00:01:56,941 --> 00:01:58,080
difficult thing to do.

54
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,610
So.

55
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,180
Okay,

56
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,820
so that's one idea about reality.

57
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,050
That's the idea really,

58
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:04,890
that you have,

59
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,470
and that's the reality that
you've been educated to have.
