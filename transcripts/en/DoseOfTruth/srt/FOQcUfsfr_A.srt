1
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,410
One of the things I've learned from
studying that the mythological worldview,

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:11,861
first of all,

3
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:16,420
I think the mythological worldview
conceptualizes the world as a place to act

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,710
rather than as a place of state.

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,720
So it's sort of like Steven g Jay Gould's
idea of two magistarium don't overlap.

6
00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:27,460
There's a moral magistarium
materialists magistarium say,

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,990
but it's been striking to me looking
at the archetypical foundations of

8
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,740
mythological thinking that in
that in the scientific world view,

9
00:00:35,741 --> 00:00:38,830
there seem to be two
fundamental causal elements.

10
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,380
You could say nature and nurture,

11
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,120
something like that or
biology and society.

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:48,420
And then technically sophisticated
western academics argue about the relative

13
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:51,610
contribution of each to any given,

14
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:52,600
uh,

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,830
existential phenomena.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,360
But in the mythological worldview,

17
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:56,890
there's always three actors.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,110
Here's nature,

19
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,290
um,

20
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,650
usually personified as female
or experienced as female.

21
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,690
Cause personified isn't
quite the right word.

22
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,883
There's culture,

23
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,060
but there's also the individual and the
individual seems to be the same thing as

24
00:01:10,061 --> 00:01:10,930
the conscious actor.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:13,990
And that would be the hero of
the dragon slaying hero say.

26
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,610
And there's that,

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,370
there is a kind of primacy given to that.

28
00:01:18,371 --> 00:01:20,170
And so in the oldest creation myths,

29
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:23,980
you always see this interplay
between the the mother,

30
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:28,870
often mother earth and the father that
the sky and then the hero who separates

31
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:32,320
the two and somehow brains
and perversely in some sense,

32
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:37,321
although being their product clearly
as the offspring is also the thing that

33
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:40,570
gives rise to them at the
same at the same time.

34
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,190
And it seems to be something that's in
keeping in some sense with our lived

35
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:50,191
experience is that we confront the social
world obviously and our beneficiaries

36
00:01:51,341 --> 00:01:52,390
and victims of it.

37
00:01:52,391 --> 00:01:55,720
And we confront the natural
world in the same manner.

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:00,900
But we also seem to be a gigantic actors
and without us as a genetic actors,

39
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:04,180
the idea that there is a reality seems to,

40
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:09,070
it seems to be full of paradoxical holes
like reality without a conscious actor.

41
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:12,790
And I think that's the sort of thing
that generates the thinking that you've

42
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:16,520
referred to as characteristic of of
Deepak Chopra and the people who,

43
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,190
who make those sorts of claims.

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,653
So,

45
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,943
I mean,

46
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,350
what's your,

47
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,520
what's your take on,

48
00:02:24,521 --> 00:02:27,280
on consciousness and its role in being

49
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,950
well and the one,

50
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:31,240
and it's everything because,

51
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,360
um,

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:32,800
it,

53
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,650
it's what I tell what I tell deep,

54
00:02:34,651 --> 00:02:36,400
like what I write about
in that chapter is that,

55
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,360
um,

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,991
you're,

57
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,760
you're familiar with
the anthropic principle.

58
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:40,960
So I call this the,

59
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:42,850
that the week consciousness
principle that,

60
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:43,720
um,

61
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:44,650
without consciousness,

62
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,330
without consciousness,

63
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,350
nothing exists.

64
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:47,531
You know,

65
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:49,000
this is one of the points to buck makes,

66
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:49,760
uh,

67
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,820
and for me and you personally,

68
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,710
if we're dead or we're not conscious,

69
00:02:53,711 --> 00:02:55,450
the world doesn't exist for our brains.

70
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:56,284
It's gone.

71
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:56,740
Nothing.

72
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,573
There's nothing.

73
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,820
Uh,

74
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,180
but,

75
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,100
but he goes further than that.

76
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:02,920
He says this is what I call the
strong consciousness principle.

77
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,410
That that consciousness is required.

78
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,980
Our consciousness is required
for material things to exist.

79
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,130
And so there I have a discussion of what,

80
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,983
um,

81
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,120
uh,

82
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,080
Donald Hoffman,

83
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,920
the cognitive scientists
at UC Irvine Coliseum,

84
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,373
um,

85
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,030
uh,

86
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,800
interface perception theory.

87
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:21,881
Uh,

88
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,050
I dunno if you're familiar with this,

89
00:03:23,051 --> 00:03:24,490
but his analogy is like,

90
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:24,660
you know,

91
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,290
your laptop screen here.

92
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,180
Then you'd have these icons on the
screen and like the little trashcan icon

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,193
looks like a trashcan.

94
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,880
But of course there's no
trash get the Oakland,

95
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,410
the open your laptop,

96
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,400
there's no pro trashcan in there.

97
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:36,880
You know,

98
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,990
these are just kind of icons that
represent something that we think of as a

99
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:41,770
trash can.

100
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,130
And um,

101
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:43,391
you know,

102
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:43,920
this is,

103
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,711
gets to the problem of,

104
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:46,030
you know what it's like to be a bat,

105
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,910
a famous thought experiment.

106
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,810
I can't know if like bolted on some,

107
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,340
some huge ears.

108
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:51,581
And I,

109
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,570
and I had an echolocation system and
the neural processes to process that

110
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:57,260
information until on,

111
00:03:57,261 --> 00:03:59,300
I would have some sense of
what it's like to be at that,

112
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,260
but they have everything on
to actually be a bad thing.

113
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,260
And I would just be a bat
and I wouldn't even be a,

114
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,370
wouldn't even know I was a human wondering
what it's like to be a federal case

115
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,221
at some level.

116
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,330
We can't actually know.

117
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,410
Um,

118
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,300
you know what it's like
to be something else.

119
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:14,134
And so you,

120
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:14,711
again,

121
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:17,320
with Deepak and I and these
kinds of traditions like that,

122
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:18,460
we hit this system,

123
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:20,410
logical wall of language.

124
00:04:20,411 --> 00:04:22,810
It's difficult to say what
you mean by certain things.

125
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:23,500
Yes.
