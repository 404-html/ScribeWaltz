1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,550
How are you doing?

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,840
Someone is asking me,

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:16,650
you said some place that you felt like
you were at times dancing on broken

4
00:00:16,651 --> 00:00:16,951
glass.

5
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:17,131
No,

6
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:18,180
I think I said that I was,

7
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:21,150
I always felt like I was
dancing on broken glass.

8
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,980
Are you getting enough rest and R.

9
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,890
And R is the food sensitivity
getting worked out?

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,070
I think maybe the food sensitivity
thing is getting worked out.

11
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:34,071
I think it's at the basis
of this depression that's
been played in my family for

12
00:00:34,711 --> 00:00:35,610
generations,

13
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,220
but I haven't figured
out exactly what it is.

14
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:38,431
Yeah.

15
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:39,030
Town.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,330
I'm working very hard on that with my
daughter who also seems to have the same

17
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:43,021
problem and it,

18
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:44,490
it is absolutely brutal.

19
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,230
It's absolutely brutal.

20
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,490
So,

21
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,323
um,

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,530
am I getting enough rest?

23
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:49,921
And R.

24
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:50,754
And R,

25
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:55,020
that's hard to say because with the
responses that I'd been having that have

26
00:00:55,021 --> 00:00:56,100
knocked my health back,

27
00:00:56,101 --> 00:00:56,261
it's,

28
00:00:56,261 --> 00:00:59,390
it's hard to discriminate
between rest and our and our,

29
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,130
the lack of that and
just getting walloped by,

30
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,740
by eating what appears
to be the wrong thing.

31
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,050
So it's so funny because,

32
00:01:07,051 --> 00:01:07,321
you know,

33
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:12,321
for years I was very skeptical of
anyone who was concerned about,

34
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,471
you know,

35
00:01:13,471 --> 00:01:15,360
gluten sensitivity and that sort of thing.

36
00:01:15,361 --> 00:01:17,220
But I sure learned that that was,

37
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:18,240
um,

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,073
arrogant.

39
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,153
So,

40
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:21,240
yeah.

41
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:21,451
Well,

42
00:01:21,451 --> 00:01:25,440
I've found many times in my life that
you have to be aware of what you are

43
00:01:25,441 --> 00:01:28,230
judgmental about because many
things come back to haunt you.
