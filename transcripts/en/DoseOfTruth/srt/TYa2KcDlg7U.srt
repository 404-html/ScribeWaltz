1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:07,630
And in Western culture,

2
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:11,650
the idea there is that do unto others as
you would have them do unto you is the

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:14,740
rule that it's the matter of
rule that guides all other rules.

4
00:00:14,741 --> 00:00:16,180
Sort of like the one rainy in the,

5
00:00:16,510 --> 00:00:17,620
in the Lord of the rings.

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,510
And so it's this consistent pattern
of abstraction of ethical guidelines.

7
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:23,703
So,

8
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,340
okay,

9
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,160
so well and so that maps onto,

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,001
while there's a,

11
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:28,900
there's a micro,

12
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:33,930
there's a micro level that you instruct
people at and that then there's a more

13
00:00:34,391 --> 00:00:37,990
abstract level that you instruct them at
and then there's a more abstract level.

14
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,320
While maybe at that point you can't
exactly directly instruct the,

15
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,350
you remember in the Pinocchio Story,

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:44,931
Japan,

17
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:49,750
Oh sits PANORG or the cricket Jiminny
Sits Pinocchio Down and tries to lecture

18
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,510
to him about what the highest
level of moral virtual,

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:52,960
yes,

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,780
he sounds like a complete fraud.

21
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:57,550
He sounds like a propaganda artist.

22
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,960
He's a soap box preacher and Pinocchio
doesn't understand them at all.

23
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,110
Why has to be acted out now maybe as a
parent you can be a model for emulation,

24
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:09,370
which is,

25
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,020
so you're a model for imitation.

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,280
What you say matters,

27
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,070
but it doesn't say as much
matter as much as what you do.

28
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,770
Maybe it would if what
you said and what you did,

29
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:18,604
we're the same.

30
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,290
That's the ideal situation,

31
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:20,740
right?

32
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,820
That's what you want to do.

33
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:22,654
If you're a parent,

34
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,910
if you say one thing and act differently,

35
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:28,810
your kids will torture you to death
and they're right to do it too because

36
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:30,580
you're confused and confusing them,

37
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:33,400
makes them anxious and aggressive
and they will go after you.

38
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,361
Consistency,

39
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:35,081
consistency,

40
00:01:35,081 --> 00:01:35,914
consistency.

41
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,420
And if you can't provide it,

42
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,590
you'll drive them crazy.

43
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:39,591
So you,

44
00:01:39,591 --> 00:01:39,840
you,

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,910
you want to bring your words
and your actions into alignment.

46
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,541
Right?

47
00:01:43,541 --> 00:01:45,190
And that's part of the
development of wisdom.

48
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,383
So,

49
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:46,810
okay,

50
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,030
so back to the brain.

51
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,483
Okay.

52
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:55,321
All right.

53
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:55,761
So there's the,

54
00:01:55,761 --> 00:01:57,260
there's the motor homunculus.

55
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,920
So now what I want to tell
you about that is you just,

56
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,730
just think about what this thing is like.

57
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:04,190
It's taking a world to park

58
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,900
and it's talking about it.

59
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,180
So that's what a human being is like.

60
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:09,931
And that,

61
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:10,261
to me,

62
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:12,570
that's kind of an image
of the mythological hero.

63
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,270
It's the thing that can speak magic words.

64
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:16,380
And take the world's apart.

65
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,430
Take the world apart.

66
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:20,220
Now in one of the stories
I'm going to tell you today,

67
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:22,560
which is the story of the Enuma Elish,

68
00:02:22,561 --> 00:02:24,750
which is the oldest
written story that we have.

69
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,520
It's a Mesopotamian story,

70
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,500
and it's from the same pool of stories
that the creation account in genesis was

71
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,334
extracted.

72
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,440
It isn't obvious what the
temporal sequence was,

73
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,440
but imagine there was a pool of
stories in the Middle East that were of

74
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,450
indefinite age,

75
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,130
tens of thousands of years,

76
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,160
and it needs of the more developed
in a slightly different way.

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,720
Although the themes underneath were,

78
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,733
were similar.

79
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,640
There are great parallels between the
Mesopotamian creation account and the

80
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:52,860
first part of the creation
account in genesis.

81
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,190
So it was discovered in the late 19
hundreds and Isis just destroyed a,

82
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,293
uh,

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,340
a treasure trove of that
sort of manuscripts.

84
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,020
So just so you know,

85
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,160
so at Nineveh,

86
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,630
so we can,

87
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,500
we can thank the war in the Middle
East for the destruction of a huge,

88
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:14,950
a huge treasure house of
irreplaceable human knowledge.

89
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,110
And a lot of that's happening
that's happening very,

90
00:03:17,111 --> 00:03:17,801
very frequently.

91
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:22,060
It's an absolute bloody
disgraceful catastrophe.

92
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,380
So anyway,

93
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:26,710
so you know that that's the human being,

94
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,071
lips,

95
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:27,550
tongs,

96
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,383
hands,

97
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,220
and the face.

98
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:34,220
Your face is also extraordinarily
amenable to voluntary manipulation.

99
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:39,640
So you can learn to move single neurons
in the tissue underneath your eyes.

100
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:40,421
That's how,

101
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:42,310
that's how high resolution your faces.

102
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:44,950
And that's partly because
it's a broadcast screen,

103
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,050
which is why people are
always looking at it.

104
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,291
Right.

105
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,850
And that's why if you watch a movie,

106
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:52,420
it's always concentrating on people's
faces is because they're just broadcasting

107
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:57,750
what they're broadcasting their stories
constantly and we're looking at their

108
00:03:58,631 --> 00:03:59,290
faces.

109
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,220
What are you looking at?

110
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,270
What are your eyes pointing at?

111
00:04:01,271 --> 00:04:01,991
What are you up to?

112
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,220
What's your emotional expression?

113
00:04:03,221 --> 00:04:04,240
What are you going to do next?

114
00:04:04,241 --> 00:04:05,170
What do you think about me?

115
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,033
Where are you going?

116
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,080
And your brought like you find someone
who has had too much plastic surgery.

117
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:15,220
Uncanny because their face is dead
because you cannot tell what they're up to

118
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:15,480
there.

119
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,100
They've got this Zombie like
aspect that's terrifying.

120
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,660
And people like that.

121
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,021
Look,

122
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,490
people like that got killed.

123
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,610
That's why we're not like
that or they didn't mate.

124
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,830
It's like you want to know what
that other person is up to.

125
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,761
And I told you already,

126
00:04:27,761 --> 00:04:29,440
that's how the whites of our eyes evolved,

127
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,274
right?

128
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,720
I don't you remember that story.

129
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,960
Gorillas don't have that distinction
between the Iris and the whites,

130
00:04:34,961 --> 00:04:36,100
not like human beings.

131
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,660
And our eyes are very sharp.

132
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,890
And one thing we really want to know
is what are you looking at and why?

133
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
What are you up to?

134
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:44,230
And if I can tell what you're looking at,

135
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:48,940
I can infer what you're going to
do and you want to broadcast that.

136
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,270
Well,

137
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,160
except when you don't
want to broadcast it.

138
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,120
But you know,

139
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:55,000
most of the time you want to be pretty
transparent to other people because

140
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:56,140
otherwise they won't trust you.

141
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:57,280
And if they don't trust you,

142
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,780
they won't cooperate with you,

143
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,070
they won't compete with you.

144
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,400
And the probability that they'll come
after you is extraordinarily high cause

145
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:06,760
you'll be evil Predator in no time flat.

146
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,223
So,

147
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,573
okay,

148
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:15,880
so we'll take a look at the
brain from another perspective.

149
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,280
Now,

150
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,040
a lot of this I got
from El Colon Goldberg,

151
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,353
um,

152
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,220
well that's not exactly right.

153
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,870
I had laid a,

154
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,500
laid this out before that,

155
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:30,220
but I found Elkhorn Goldberg's writings
afterwards and he was a student of

156
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:33,910
lariats and he was trying
to account for the y.

157
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,830
We had different hemispheres
roughly speaking,

158
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,451
because it's,

159
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:38,020
it's not self evident that we should,

160
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,880
they're actually somewhat
separate consciousnesses and they,

161
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:43,060
they communicate,

162
00:05:43,061 --> 00:05:44,830
but the communication isn't complete.

163
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,850
It's like our brain is modularized
and unified at the same time.

164
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,730
And you can think about it
like a meeting of people.

165
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:53,220
Why do you want it Maude,

166
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,000
Maude muellerized while,

167
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,440
so if one person goes down,

168
00:05:56,441 --> 00:05:57,380
all of them don't.

169
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,783
That's one,

170
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,313
one reason.

171
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,240
So it's some separation of function.

172
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,620
Why else?

173
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,453
Well,

174
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:09,560
each little module can do its own creative
thing independently of the others.

175
00:06:09,561 --> 00:06:10,371
And that's useful.

176
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,170
And then there can be
communication between them.

177
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,300
And so there's,

178
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,870
there's utility in modularity and
there's utility and integration.

179
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,930
And part of what we're trying to work
out on the global political scene right

180
00:06:20,931 --> 00:06:23,990
now is how modular things should be
and how integrated they should be.

181
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,170
And the European Community
rushed into integration.

182
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,660
And that's bothering people dreadfully
because they feel that the advantages of

183
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:34,700
modularization have been washed away.

184
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:37,850
You saw that and maybe they're right
because you saw what happened with Greece

185
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:38,684
collapsed,

186
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:39,740
right.

187
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,610
And Greece is very,

188
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,301
very corrupt,

189
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,070
incredibly corrupt and Germany,

190
00:06:43,071 --> 00:06:45,770
whatever else you might think
about Germany is not corrupt.

191
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,450
And so the Isi tried to bring
Greece and Germany together.

192
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,383
That didn't work.

193
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:52,850
There was no unity there.

194
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:57,310
The modularity was actually useful and
the fact that Greece was so destabilized

195
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:01,100
and Italy also very corrupt
and Spain also very corrupt,

196
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,160
was very shaky just about
brought the whole thing down.

197
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,970
It it.

198
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,930
The argument is the modularity
would have been better conserved.

199
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,191
Well who knows,

200
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:10,431
right?

201
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:13,250
Because modularity is useful
and so is integration.

202
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,230
But fall integration seems to be a
mistake and so does full modularity.

203
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,310
How do you get that right?

204
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,420
We don't know.

205
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,770
That's why we're arguing about it.

206
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,550
And right now there's a backlash or
pulling away from the integration and you

207
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,620
can see why too,

208
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,650
because in 2008 with the
American economy collapsed,

209
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,690
the world economy just about collapsed.

210
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,820
That seems like a bad idea.

211
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,151
You know,

212
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:36,170
you might want some,

213
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,610
some separateness so that if one
system malfunctions and goes down,

214
00:07:40,611 --> 00:07:42,920
the whole bloody thing
doesn't go into flames.

215
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,570
And so we don't know.

216
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,100
We don't know how to manage that.

217
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:46,963
It's a really,

218
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,740
really complicated problem.

219
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,080
So anyways.

220
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:51,381
Okay.

221
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:52,010
So how did the,

222
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,090
how does the brain work?

223
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:53,871
Well,

224
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:57,290
the left roughly speaking
in right handed males,

225
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,690
and the reason that I'm concentrating on
right hand had males is because they're

226
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,830
simpler in their neurological structure.

227
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,120
Women have a more complicated neurological
structure and lefthanded people tend

228
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:10,220
to have a more complicated
neurological structure.

229
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,080
So we'll just say that we'll just go
with the standard model to begin with.

230
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:19,220
And you can assume that the same
systems are there in every person,

231
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:22,040
but they're not laid out on the
hemispheric structure quite as neatly,

232
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,150
but they're still there.

233
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,500
So it's sort of like,

234
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,730
these are tendencies.

235
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,050
So for example,

236
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,183
if you're a,

237
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,760
so there's a tendency for the right
hemisphere to specialize for what's

238
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,620
relatively unknown and the left hemisphere
to specialize for what's relatively

239
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:37,454
mastered.

240
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,470
And you can think about it this way too,

241
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,143
left,

242
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:44,793
right?

243
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,660
It's something like that.

244
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,770
Okay.

245
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,603
So

246
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,681
large scale,

247
00:08:49,681 --> 00:08:53,280
low resolution abstractions tend to
be the province of the right high

248
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:54,061
resolution.

249
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:57,030
Detailed knowledge tend to
be the province of the left.

250
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,410
The left is linguistic.

251
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,220
That's where the detailed structures
manifest themselves in articulation,

252
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,870
but the fundamental difference between
the left and right isn't language versus

253
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:08,850
non language.

254
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,500
The fundamental distinction is
relatively explored and mastered versus

255
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:17,940
relatively unexplored and not mastered
and that's both in terms of structure.

256
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,340
The right hemisphere has
a less granular structure,

257
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,840
it's less differentiated.

258
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,540
It's also responsible
mostly for negative emotion,

259
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,010
especially in the prefrontal park.

260
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,570
And the reason for that is,

261
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:27,901
well,

262
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,970
how do you encounter
what's absolutely unknown?

263
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,330
Imagination and emotion,

264
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,583
right?

265
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:37,860
I told you that little experiment that
you could do if you're alone in a house

266
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:40,800
and you hear a strange
noise at night in a room,

267
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:43,260
turn off the lights and
put your hand in the room.

268
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,170
It's like your brain will just
flash off monsters like mad.

269
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,441
You know,

270
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:49,800
you'll be nervous cause
that what's in that room.

271
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,570
Something to make you nervous.

272
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,670
That's a very low resolution category,

273
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:53,881
right?

274
00:09:53,881 --> 00:09:55,860
It's like it's a,

275
00:09:56,130 --> 00:10:00,810
it's some indeterminate manifestation of
the category of things that might hurt

276
00:10:00,811 --> 00:10:01,440
you.

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,640
Very low resolution,

278
00:10:02,641 --> 00:10:03,960
but a very smart category.

279
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:05,220
It's like don't put your hand in there.

280
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,530
You put your hand in there and
you watch your imagination.

281
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:08,670
It's like monsters.

282
00:10:08,671 --> 00:10:12,060
It'll generate monsters like Matt and
that's what the right hemisphere is doing.

283
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:16,050
It's saying what's in there is an exemplar
of the category of things that are

284
00:10:16,051 --> 00:10:16,501
dangerous.

285
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:20,670
Here's a bunch of images of those things
and that thing in there is going to

286
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:22,200
partake of that essence.

287
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,380
And that's a very low
resolution hypothesis.

288
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,690
That's kind of what horror
movies do with people.

289
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:27,961
You know,

290
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:32,640
they sort of lead them through that
initial process and so and so that's what

291
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:33,000
the right,

292
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,680
the right hemisphere seems to me to be
dominated by dominated by subcortical

293
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:38,514
processes.

294
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,280
There's the left hemisphere is reversed,

295
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,420
the cortex is more or less got dominion.

296
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,940
And so the right hemisphere,

297
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,740
while we'll walk through
this neurologically,

298
00:10:46,741 --> 00:10:51,240
but the right hemisphere is
responds rapidly to what's unknown.

299
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:54,390
And that's that subcortical
that the hippocampus is,

300
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,360
is doing an awful lot of
that noting a mismatch.

301
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,000
And then it's using the
right hemisphere to,

302
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,390
to abstractly represent what the
possibility space is in relationship down

303
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:07,410
expected things.

304
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:11,580
And then the right hemisphere
is tracking that continually,

305
00:11:11,581 --> 00:11:15,990
what those unexpected things are and
coming up with models of what you haven't

306
00:11:15,991 --> 00:11:16,830
yet mastered.

307
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,830
And that's kept separate
from the left hemisphere,

308
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:23,490
which already has functional models
and you don't want to blast the left

309
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:26,540
hemisphere continually with enormous
information cause you blow out its

310
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,890
structure and then you
don't know what to do.

311
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,130
So the right hemisphere generates new
models in some sense out of nothing.

312
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,870
And then when the time is right,

313
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,620
taps information into the left hemisphere
slowly so that it doesn't disrupt its

314
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:41,520
function too much.

315
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,360
And that's a lot of that seems to happen
when you're dreaming by the way it

316
00:11:45,361 --> 00:11:46,194
happens at night.

317
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,330
So in what happens with the dreams,

318
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:49,710
you think about how dreams work,

319
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:54,130
cause you might think of dreams as part
of that process where ideas come to be.

320
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:56,170
So they're low resolution to begin with.

321
00:11:56,171 --> 00:11:57,250
Mostly a majestic,

322
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:59,560
really highly emotional and incoherent,

323
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,780
less coherent.

324
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:05,710
Why you can't be coherent
unless you know what to do.

325
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,311
A,

326
00:12:06,311 --> 00:12:06,611
B,

327
00:12:06,611 --> 00:12:06,911
c,

328
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:07,241
d,

329
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:07,511
e,

330
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:08,650
f if that's working,

331
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,760
you've got coherence.

332
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,800
But if you're dealing with
something you don't know,

333
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,260
you have to muck about with
your category structures.

334
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:15,850
And that's what dreams do.

335
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:16,930
And you know,

336
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:18,250
when you're interpreting a dream,

337
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:20,380
one of the things you
watch for is the dream.

338
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,790
The dream presents this.

339
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:22,624
And then this.

340
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,650
That's called metonymy.

341
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,220
By the way,

342
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,450
from a literary perspective,

343
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,690
and what that implies is this
is related to this in some way.

344
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,000
Why else would they be code activated?

345
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:31,961
You know,

346
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:32,471
people say,

347
00:12:32,471 --> 00:12:32,651
well,

348
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:33,490
dreams are random.

349
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,320
That's the stupidest
theory I've ever heard.

350
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,760
Like white noise is random.

351
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:38,860
Dreams are not random.

352
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,300
They're hard to understand,

353
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,340
but they're anything but random.

354
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,860
There are more random than real life.

355
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,341
Well,

356
00:12:45,341 --> 00:12:49,390
that's because what you don't understand
these really random and you're

357
00:12:49,391 --> 00:12:53,080
organized and there has to be an
intermediary that's sort of quasi random

358
00:12:53,081 --> 00:12:55,510
between the more you never
get from one to the other,

359
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,580
and dreams and fantasies,

360
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:58,061
myths,

361
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:03,010
all of that is part of that process that
it stretches you out beyond what you

362
00:13:03,011 --> 00:13:03,251
know,

363
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:04,630
into the absolute unknown.
