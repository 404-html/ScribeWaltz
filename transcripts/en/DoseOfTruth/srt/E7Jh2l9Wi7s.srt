1
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:10,371
Oh,

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:13,880
diversity is actually necessary because
people differ in intelligence and the

3
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:16,580
different temperament and the different
skills and so you actually need

4
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:20,180
diversity cause otherwise you can't
take advantage of all those differences.

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:27,060
So you need diversity but you need genuine
diversity and like what would genuine

6
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:28,720
diversity mean?

7
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,430
If you're trying to put
together a work team,

8
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:31,330
you want enough,

9
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,450
you want people of sufficient diversity
so that they more or less so that you

10
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:41,020
gathered together the appropriate
talents to produce the implement that's

11
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:43,180
necessary to work properly in the world.

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,230
That's a competence marker cause
otherwise your business is going to fail.

13
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:51,940
And so the proper diversity with regards
to employment is that diversity that

14
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,570
meets the requirements of
the business essentially.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Obviously that's why you try to hire
people carefully and not randomly,

16
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:03,974
let's say

17
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,990
third error,

18
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:09,911
first errors.

19
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:10,744
There's

20
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,180
only a finite number of
valid interpretations.

21
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,510
Second error is that um,

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,120
there aren't real differences
between groups of people,

23
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,400
but there's more difference within
the groups then between them.

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:22,670
Third differences,

25
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,420
social status and payment,

26
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:30,280
especially in a free democratic capitalist
society is based more on competence

27
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:31,114
than on

28
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,193
power.

29
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,130
In fact,

30
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,130
we would say that when a
person in a hierarchy starts
to act like their position

31
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,470
entitles them to power,

32
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,590
then that hierarchy has become corrupt.

33
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,990
Harvey Weinstein is a
good example of that.

34
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,401
I'm serious.

35
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,430
It's like he acts acted like a tyrant.

36
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,480
What happened to him?

37
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:55,130
It's not good.

38
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,240
Not good for him.

39
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,580
What he did was not good,

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,580
but it's an indication it's revealed.

41
00:02:01,581 --> 00:02:04,640
It's an indication that that misuse,

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,200
so he's competent,

43
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:06,681
fine.

44
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:11,240
He gets to have position because
we need people who are competent,

45
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,550
but that doesn't mean you
get to turn into a tyrant.

46
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,870
If you turn into a tyrant,

47
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:18,770
then that overshadows your
competence and you go.

48
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:23,000
That's the definition of a functioning
state and our state essentially

49
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:23,780
functions.

50
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,980
It's not perfect,

51
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:25,903
that's for sure,

52
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,040
but compared to what?

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,100
It's the issue compared to your
hypothetical Marxist Utopia.

54
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,671
Well,

55
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:36,370
compared to your
hypothetical Marxist Utopia,

56
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,740
I mean we're living in Auschwitz,

57
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,010
but your what?

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,080
Your actual Marxist utopia is
indistinguishable from Auschwitz,

59
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,550
so we're not listening to that comparison.

60
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:51,400
We're going to take a look at what we
have and we're going to compare it to

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,880
other places that actually existed in
time and geographically and by those

62
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:57,934
criteria.

63
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,600
It's like,

64
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,433
is there another,

65
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,280
you'd rather live,

66
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:02,921
do another place.

67
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:03,581
You'd rather live,

68
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:05,380
I mean a real place in a real time,

69
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,370
and you want to live back in 1895 even
in the western world where the average

70
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:11,230
person lived on less than a dollar a day.

71
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:12,190
In today's money,

72
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,220
you want to live like those coal miners.

73
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,980
It's like the answer to that's no.

74
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:19,150
If you have any sense,

75
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:20,620
you should have some gratitude.

76
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:24,580
That's another problem with the
postmodern neo Marxists like zero,

77
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,631
zero,

78
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,980
zero gratitude.

79
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,600
It's all,

80
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,560
oh my God,

81
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:30,580
I'm more pressed.

82
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,760
Of course you're oppressed,

83
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,090
but you're not oppressed by
the Patriarchy for God's sake.

84
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,103
Yeah,

85
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,820
so you have status in a hierarchy.

86
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:43,231
You might say,

87
00:03:43,231 --> 00:03:43,351
well,

88
00:03:43,351 --> 00:03:46,920
that's like a reward to your
s you're a high status person.

89
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:47,581
It's a reward.

90
00:03:47,581 --> 00:03:49,290
The reward should be shared equally.

91
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,540
It's like a badge of merit that you get.

92
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,470
It's a privilege.

93
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,400
It's not the reason that
in a capitalist society,

94
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,520
filthy selfish capitalists put you in
a position so they can extract maximum

95
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:03,300
productivity from you.

96
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:05,580
And that's exactly why you're there.

97
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:06,450
You get paid,

98
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:07,021
you get paid.

99
00:04:07,021 --> 00:04:08,070
So you keep working.

100
00:04:08,071 --> 00:04:09,240
Why do we want you to work?

101
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:13,620
Because your work is actually valuable
to us and so we're going to pay you so

102
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:14,610
you don't quit.

103
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,920
It's not a reward because
you're a good guy.

104
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,540
It's not a privilege.

105
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,950
That's not what it is.

106
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,350
You don't hand those things
out like merit badges.

107
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,670
That's not how it works.

108
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,370
This society is set up
on selfish principles.

109
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:30,600
We paid people who are competence so they
won't stop striving cause we want what

110
00:04:30,601 --> 00:04:31,620
they can produce.

111
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,050
So you don't just distribute that like,

112
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,520
like it's a gift.

113
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,600
It's not a gift.

114
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,010
It's not a gift at all.

115
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,780
So that's another place
where they're wrong.

116
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:45,180
Social Status and payment is the
consequence of the selfish desire of

117
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:48,810
individuals and the group to
extract resources of intellect,

118
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:49,591
creativity,

119
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:53,730
and industriousness from those
who possess them in excess.

120
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,321
Now of course,

121
00:04:55,321 --> 00:04:57,060
it's not 100% like that.

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,370
There's the incompetent
people who rise to the top.

123
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,910
You can fool people and you can manipulate
them and you can act like a tyrant.

124
00:05:02,911 --> 00:05:03,481
And you know,

125
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:08,481
we might say maybe the system is
like 30% warp to something like that.

126
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,390
It's not much more than that because we
can account for people's success across

127
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:15,270
life by looking at their
individual differences,

128
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,021
intelligence,

129
00:05:16,021 --> 00:05:16,461
comp,

130
00:05:16,461 --> 00:05:17,460
conscientiousness,

131
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,750
emotional stability,

132
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,770
creativity.

133
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:22,860
We can do a pretty good job of
predicting their trajectory.

134
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,870
So there's error,

135
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:25,920
some of its health,

136
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:26,161
right?

137
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:27,720
Because sometimes you've
got what you need,

138
00:05:27,721 --> 00:05:31,200
but you get cut off at the knees or
your family members do or you know,

139
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:33,130
some tragic thing befalls you the,

140
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,870
there's a randomness in the system
that accounts for a fair bit of it.

141
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,820
And then there's a certain
amount of corruption.

142
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,410
Fair enough.

143
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,490
But not so much that the lights go off.
