1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,573
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:10,390
What's your take on universal income?

3
00:00:12,370 --> 00:00:14,710
Is it a fast track to new communism,

4
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:20,260
capitalism killer or a possible
way out of starvation for humanity?

5
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,723
Thank you.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:22,990
Well,

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,990
I don't think it addresses the
fundamental problem and I think it's a,

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,310
I think it's a mirror of the
rights responsibility problem.

9
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:34,540
No,

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,373
you might say,

11
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:40,900
well everyone has a right to the
basics of life at first of all,

12
00:00:40,901 --> 00:00:42,850
that's a debatable proposition because

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,510
the question is who's going
to provide those necessities?

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,930
And the answer shouldn't be
someone else under compulsion.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,513
So

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:57,770
because each right comes at the expense
of someone else's responsibility.

17
00:00:57,771 --> 00:01:02,771
And so you don't want to multiply rights
beyond minimum necessity because you

18
00:01:02,901 --> 00:01:07,901
also multiply diverse
responsibilities beyond tolerance.

19
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,960
But more importantly than
that I would say is that

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,270
let's make it more concrete.

21
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,830
So let's imagine that as the
technological revolution progresses,

22
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,960
more and more people will be in danger
of being replaced by intelligent

23
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:25,620
machines.

24
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,380
Now we don't know if that's true
because it hasn't happened yet.

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,221
Right.

26
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:32,760
And everyone has been predicting that
that was going to happen since like 1960

27
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:33,690
and it hasn't happened.

28
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:37,440
And so there may be an infinite amount
of work and we're never going to run out

29
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:37,801
of work.

30
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,240
I suspect that's probably the case.

31
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:44,241
But let's assume that people do get
dispossessed as technology's transform.

32
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,850
And then we have the problem
of the development of people
for who have no viable

33
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:52,410
means of making a living.

34
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,030
And the question might be,

35
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,450
well,

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,920
what's the fundamental problem there?

37
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,993
And one answer is,

38
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,281
well,

39
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:58,440
they don't have any money,

40
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,860
but I actually don't think that
that is the fundamental problem.

41
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,910
Um,

42
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,910
I've had many people in my
clinical practice who were
unemployed and had money.

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,480
Now they didn't have a lot of money,

44
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,370
but they had enough money and enough
money to keep privation at bay,

45
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,150
let's say.

46
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,200
And enough money to,

47
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:16,891
well,

48
00:02:16,891 --> 00:02:17,850
that was the rub.

49
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:20,610
Enough money to get themselves
into plenty of trouble.

50
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,250
And so one of my clients,

51
00:02:23,251 --> 00:02:23,851
for example,

52
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,684
was a,

53
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,070
I liked him quite a lot.

54
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:26,640
And he had,

55
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,120
he was,

56
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,210
he had worked in a hospital
and he'd been hurt.

57
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,493
And,

58
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,860
and then he got onto painkillers
because he'd been hurt.

59
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:38,910
And then he got addicted to painkillers
and then he got addicted to cocaine and

60
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:43,911
his life took a bad nosedive and he is
actually pretty good unless he had money.

61
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:47,130
But as soon as he had a check,

62
00:02:47,131 --> 00:02:47,490
it was,

63
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:48,301
he was gone.

64
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,320
He was in a ditch,

65
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:50,610
he was in a bar,

66
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,210
he spent all his money and
he was face down in a ditch.

67
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,650
And that's where he woke up the next day.

68
00:02:56,460 --> 00:03:00,580
And the reason I'm telling you that
story is because it wasn't that he didn't

69
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,031
have money,

70
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,080
that wasn't the problem.

71
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:02,943
Really.

72
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,990
The problem was that he
didn't have a purpose.

73
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,640
He didn't have a place anymore.

74
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:11,680
He got thrown out of the structure
that would have enabled him to find

75
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,210
productive meaning,

76
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:13,541
you know,

77
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,141
when you might've said,

78
00:03:14,141 --> 00:03:14,261
well,

79
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:16,330
he should have been able to
conjure that up on his own.

80
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:17,710
And perhaps that's the case.

81
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,770
Although he wasn't the world's
most sophisticated person,

82
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:21,640
you know,

83
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,820
and people very substantially
in their sophistication and it,

84
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,320
and he didn't have a good family.

85
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:27,910
He didn't have a support
network around him.

86
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,740
He was kind of a lost character in many,

87
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:30,574
many ways.

88
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,370
And so it was easy for him
to fall out of the world,

89
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,450
which is what he did.

90
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:39,690
And providing him with money was not
going to fix that and say what is going to

91
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,584
fix that?

92
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,870
Well that's a good question.

93
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:44,530
I mean,

94
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,970
we have a program,

95
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,400
some of you people might
be interested in it.

96
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,343
It's called,

97
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:55,360
it's part of a suite of online writing
programs called the self authoring suite.

98
00:03:55,870 --> 00:04:00,870
It's out self authoring dot calm and
one of the programs is called future

99
00:04:01,631 --> 00:04:02,200
authoring.

100
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,850
And we've experimented with this program
in an attempt to address this problem.

101
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:07,751
Okay.

102
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:12,751
So I mentioned to you tonight the idea
that we live out a story and we need a

103
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:16,780
purpose to live out that story properly.

104
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:19,330
And what that implies is
that you need a purpose.

105
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,381
You need a point,

106
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:21,370
you need a name,

107
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,570
you need to precise saying you
need an aim that's of sufficient

108
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,660
nobility.

109
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,100
I can't think of any other word,

110
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:30,761
sufficient,

111
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:34,480
no ability to justify your miserable
existence even to yourself.

112
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,120
And you need to develop that aim.

113
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,550
And so we built this program.

114
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,750
I started working on it about 15 years
ago when I was giving my students

115
00:04:43,751 --> 00:04:45,850
exercises to do at university.

116
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:50,680
And one of the exercises I had them do
was that they had to pick a small problem

117
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,460
maybe in their family or
with their room and fix it,

118
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,840
not try to fix it,

119
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,231
you know,

120
00:04:56,231 --> 00:04:59,550
but actually pick a problem that
was small that they could fix,

121
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:01,750
clean up the cigarette butts in the yard,

122
00:05:01,751 --> 00:05:02,830
outside the residents.

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,833
Um,

124
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,960
clean the room.

125
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,350
We had one kid whose mother
had died in the family,

126
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,140
got kind of fragmented and he decided
that he was going to take over the

127
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:14,470
maternal duties in the household and the
kids were supposed to write about what

128
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,260
happened when they tried to put this
into practice because doing things like

129
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:19,690
that is way more difficult
than anybody ever realizes.

130
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:23,850
And so he tried to become mother and
the family needed a mother and he,

131
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,680
he encountered all sorts
of terrible resistance,

132
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,750
which is completely unsurprising.

133
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,141
I mean,

134
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:29,591
first of all,

135
00:05:29,591 --> 00:05:32,740
people in his family were annoyed that
he would dare to try to take their dead

136
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:33,730
mother's place.

137
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,121
You know,

138
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:38,080
even though he was trying to do
it for the best of reasons and we,

139
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:40,990
I played with that for a couple of
years and that was very interesting.

140
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,250
And then I realized that I was teaching
students all these stories about

141
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:45,671
purpose,

142
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:50,671
but nobody had ever had them write a
story about their purpose essentially.

143
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,473
So I thought,

144
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:53,201
well,

145
00:05:53,201 --> 00:05:55,540
isn't that interesting here are these,

146
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:55,811
these,

147
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:56,471
these kids,

148
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,500
they've been in university,

149
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,720
they've been in school for 15 years

150
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,040
and no one has ever
sat them down and said,

151
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:07,700
well what sort of character
do you want to develop?

152
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,660
Who should you be and why don't
you write that out and justify it,

153
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,470
you know,

154
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,281
six pages,

155
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:16,700
something like that with the same amount
of care and attention that you might

156
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:21,350
spend or even more on an essay about
the war of 1812 or something like that.

157
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,513
Think well,

158
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,840
and the more I thought about that,

159
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,674
the more

160
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,050
okay.

161
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,600
Flabbergasted I would say
I became because I thought,

162
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:28,691
well,

163
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:29,440
what the heck?

164
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,440
How is it possible that we could set
up an education system and run people

165
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:39,340
through it for 15 years
and never have them forced,

166
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,330
so to speak,

167
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:44,410
to figure out who they want it to be and
to justify it in an articulate manner.

168
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,130
And so I built this program with my
colleagues to help people do that.

169
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:49,510
And I used it my classes first.

170
00:06:49,511 --> 00:06:50,021
And so I thought,

171
00:06:50,021 --> 00:06:50,231
okay,

172
00:06:50,231 --> 00:06:54,430
well here's the game and this is like
rural to treat yourself like you're

173
00:06:54,431 --> 00:06:55,990
someone responsible for helping.

174
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,630
And that doesn't mean be good to yourself.

175
00:06:58,631 --> 00:07:00,760
It doesn't mean me be nice to yourself.

176
00:07:00,761 --> 00:07:05,230
It doesn't mean give yourself an easy
life that isn't actually what you do to

177
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:05,591
people.

178
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,460
If you care for them,

179
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,490
you actually present them with
something like an optimal challenge.

180
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,510
That's what you do with kids.

181
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,420
If you love them as you present them
with an optimal challenge so they can

182
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:14,260
develop and grow.

183
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,740
So that's what you should do for yourself
if you're taking care of yourself.

184
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,791
So I just thought,

185
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:19,031
okay,

186
00:07:19,031 --> 00:07:19,900
well here's the game.

187
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,001
First of all,

188
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:25,390
assume that you're worth taking a
care that you're worth taking care of.

189
00:07:25,391 --> 00:07:27,220
And that it's your
responsibility to do so.

190
00:07:27,221 --> 00:07:29,020
Even if you don't like yourself very much.

191
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,740
And lots of people don't and they have
their reasons because everybody is very

192
00:07:32,741 --> 00:07:33,970
aware of their own flaws,

193
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,510
right?

194
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,710
Unless you're narcissistic,

195
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:39,370
you're more aware of your own
flaws then of anyone else's flaws.

196
00:07:39,371 --> 00:07:41,770
And maybe you're not very happy with
yourself and you don't think that you

197
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:43,780
deserve to have an okay life.

198
00:07:43,781 --> 00:07:47,410
And so you punish yourself and you set
yourself up for failure and all and all

199
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:47,681
of that,

200
00:07:47,681 --> 00:07:48,790
and that happens all the time.

201
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,320
Or you just don't aim or you don't have
any goals or you know you're guilty and

202
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,840
resentful and feel that
you should be punished.

203
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,580
So you have to abandon all that.

204
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,140
Treat yourself like you're someone
you're responsible for helping,

205
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,610
responsible for helping.

206
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,060
Imagine yourself three to
five years into the future.

207
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:08,740
You get to have what you need.

208
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,610
If you're taking care of yourself,

209
00:08:11,611 --> 00:08:12,444
you can have it,

210
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,230
but you have to figure out what it is
because you are not going to get it unless

211
00:08:16,231 --> 00:08:17,064
you aim at it.

212
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,030
And that's rule 10 is be
precise in your speech.

213
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:23,340
And the reason I wrote that rule is,

214
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,460
is because you can be bloody sure that
you're not going to hit a target unless

215
00:08:26,461 --> 00:08:27,001
you ain't mad it.

216
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:28,560
And the more precise you make the target,

217
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,670
the higher the probability
that you'll aim at it,

218
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:32,250
that you'll hit it when you aim at it.

219
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,950
So what do you want?

220
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,341
And you think,

221
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:35,461
well,

222
00:08:35,461 --> 00:08:38,730
I didn't want to even think about what
I want because as soon as I figured out

223
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:39,301
what I want,

224
00:08:39,301 --> 00:08:44,160
then I've made clear Mike conditions
for failure and it's the last thing I'm

225
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:44,940
going to do.

226
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,560
And so people envelop themselves in Vegas
so they don't have to confront their

227
00:08:49,561 --> 00:08:50,370
own failure,

228
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:53,790
but then they fail and just
don't notice except for maybe,

229
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:54,600
you know,

230
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,530
two decades when it's too bloody late
and then they're all catastrophic.

231
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,290
Lee hurt because they wasted their life.

232
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,700
It's a very bad plan.

233
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,720
It's better just to figure out what you
want and to tell yourself and then to

234
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:08,790
tell your partner and to
tell the people around you.

235
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:12,840
And maybe you can get it or maybe at
least while you're struggling towards it,

236
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:14,430
you'll come up with a better plan,

237
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,140
which is more likely the case.

238
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,570
What do you want from your family?

239
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,130
If you could have what you,

240
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,390
what was good for you,

241
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,550
what do you want from your
intimate relationship?

242
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:27,150
How are you going to educate yourself
because you don't know enough?

243
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:31,890
What do you want for a career or job
because not everyone has a career.

244
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,560
How are you going to spend your time
outside of work in a productive and

245
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:35,394
meaningful manner?

246
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,050
How are you going to resist
the temptations of drugs
and alcohol and and and

247
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:41,250
sexual misconduct?

248
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:41,581
Let's say,

249
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:42,870
cause those are the big three.

250
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,253
Um,

251
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:48,190
how are you going to maintain
yourself physically and mentally?

252
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,040
While those are seven good questions,

253
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,230
you can have what you want.

254
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,123
What do you want?

255
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,840
It's an operational realization
of the new testament principle.

256
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:06,150
Ask and you will receive knock and
the door will open and you think,

257
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:06,481
well,

258
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:06,841
no,

259
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:08,760
there's no possibility
that that's the case.

260
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:10,590
It's like actually it is the case.

261
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,390
If you don't specify what you want,

262
00:10:12,391 --> 00:10:13,224
you won't get it,

263
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,410
and if you specify what
you want and you want it,

264
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,830
which means you're willing to make
the sacrifices necessary to get it,

265
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:25,130
then the probability that you'll get it
expands immensely and miraculously in

266
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,124
some sense.

267
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:26,371
Now,

268
00:10:26,371 --> 00:10:26,791
of course,

269
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:31,740
it assumes that what you want is within
the bounds of appropriate reason,

270
00:10:31,741 --> 00:10:32,580
let's say,

271
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,450
but you could also dream big and there's
always the possibility that'll work out

272
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:37,284
too.

273
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,350
So people as answer those questions,

274
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,330
then they write for 15 minutes,

275
00:10:42,331 --> 00:10:42,691
okay,

276
00:10:42,691 --> 00:10:45,900
your life is the way you
want it to be in four years.

277
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,333
What does it look like?

278
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,690
Okay,

279
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:48,901
right.

280
00:10:48,901 --> 00:10:49,950
As much as you can,

281
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,540
don't worry about being too accurate.

282
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,550
Don't worry about grammar,

283
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,190
spelling.

284
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,380
Don't worry about getting it right
because you're not going to get it right

285
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:55,980
anyways,

286
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,660
just sketch the damn thing out.

287
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,280
If you could have what you wanted,

288
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:00,090
what would it be?

289
00:11:00,090 --> 00:11:01,620
And then we have them do the opposite,

290
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:01,891
which is,

291
00:11:01,891 --> 00:11:02,610
all right,

292
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:06,390
take stock of yourself for a minute with
all your weaknesses and inadequacies

293
00:11:06,391 --> 00:11:09,960
and bitterness and resentment
and sinful tendencies.

294
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:10,770
Let's say.

295
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:15,770
Now imagine that you let all of that goal
and occupy you just wear which little

296
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,550
corner of Hell would you
occupy in three to five years.

297
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:21,750
Why don't you write about that?

298
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,680
And everyone knows where they
go if they let themselves.

299
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:31,130
And so then you have something to avoid
and you have something to strive for and

300
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:36,300
that makes you optimally motivated
because maybe you're afraid,

301
00:11:36,301 --> 00:11:36,541
you know,

302
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:40,010
you find out you don't like your job
and you're afraid to change your job and

303
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,873
then you think,

304
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,521
oh,

305
00:11:41,521 --> 00:11:42,900
well if I don't change my job,

306
00:11:42,901 --> 00:11:45,780
then I'm heading for this little
corner of Hell that I outlined.

307
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:46,261
Think,

308
00:11:46,261 --> 00:11:47,760
well that's not a very good plan.

309
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,900
It's very strict,

310
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,940
threatening and stressful
to change my job,

311
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,010
but it beats the hell
out of ending up there.

312
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:56,740
And so then you have your anxieties behind
you pushing you forward instead of in

313
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:57,221
front of you,

314
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:58,420
stopping you called.

315
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:03,840
And then we asked people to write a
plan to implement their positive vision,

316
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,320
to justify it,

317
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:07,120
to come up with this strategy for,

318
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,360
for making it into a
real world realization.

319
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:13,870
And we tested that on thousands
of university students.

320
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:14,704
Now,

321
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,670
and the upshot was that it decreased the
probability that they would drop out of

322
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,070
university by 30% in fact,

323
00:12:21,071 --> 00:12:21,581
in Canada,

324
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:22,150
we,

325
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:26,740
we did it for 90 minutes before
kids went to college in the fall.

326
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,560
They came to their summer orientation,

327
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,610
neither wrote for 90 minutes about
something that required writing,

328
00:12:33,611 --> 00:12:38,110
but there wasn't so relevant or they
wrote out of plan and it dropped the

329
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:43,111
dropout rate among young men 50% in the
first semester and it had the biggest

330
00:12:43,121 --> 00:12:46,270
effect on young men who didn't do that
well in high school and who weren't

331
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:48,280
oriented towards a professional career.

332
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,030
The consequence of that was that the
university used it for one year and then

333
00:12:52,031 --> 00:12:52,930
stop doing it.

334
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:53,831
So,

335
00:12:53,831 --> 00:12:55,480
which was not surprising in the least,

336
00:12:55,930 --> 00:13:00,930
but the reason that I'm laying out this
long story for you is because that's

337
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,260
what people need.

338
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,123
They need,

339
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:06,400
they need a differentiated
and delineated purpose.

340
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,730
It's way more important than the money.

341
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,170
Okay?

342
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,520
It isn't money that you need.

343
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,260
I know you need money for God's sake.

344
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:14,041
I'm not ignorant.

345
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,030
Everybody needs money.

346
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,800
That's not the point here.

347
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,160
It's the provision of money
without purpose is not helpful.

348
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,540
And what people need is a purpose and
they need that to develop that for

349
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,141
themselves,

350
00:13:25,141 --> 00:13:27,270
obviously because it's something
you have to participate in,

351
00:13:27,271 --> 00:13:30,840
but it's something that society has to
foster and the reason they need that

352
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,870
purpose is because that's
what gives their life meaning.

353
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:34,771
Think,

354
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:34,921
well,

355
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:35,754
think about this.

356
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,930
Do you really think that you would
be satisfied if you had money without

357
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:40,830
responsibility?

358
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:42,631
So what?

359
00:13:42,631 --> 00:13:42,871
Okay,

360
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,900
got no responsibility because
that's what everyone wants.

361
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:47,400
It's like I had a client,

362
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,530
he wanted to retire when
he was kind of young,

363
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,181
and I said,

364
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:51,271
well,

365
00:13:51,271 --> 00:13:52,470
what's your retirement dream?

366
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:52,711
He said,

367
00:13:52,711 --> 00:13:52,861
well,

368
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:57,210
I envisioned myself on a
beach in a tropical island
with a Margarita in my hand.

369
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,553
And I thought,

370
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:02,910
what the hell is that?

371
00:14:03,330 --> 00:14:03,601
It's like,

372
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:03,871
okay,

373
00:14:03,871 --> 00:14:04,860
let's play that out.

374
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,000
Let's be adult about this.

375
00:14:06,001 --> 00:14:06,271
Okay,

376
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:07,130
so you go down to the,

377
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,420
you're this like red headed white guy.

378
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,980
You go down to the Caribbean and you
sit on a beach and you're sitting in the

379
00:14:13,981 --> 00:14:17,370
beach and you have like six Margaritas
and you're there for like three hours.

380
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,720
What happens the next day?

381
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:19,560
Okay,

382
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:21,120
your Sun burnt to a crisp,

383
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:21,900
right?

384
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
So you can't even go out of your
hotel room and you're hung over.

385
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:25,831
Okay.

386
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,830
And let's say now you hide in your hotel
room for three or four days and you

387
00:14:28,831 --> 00:14:31,830
recover and then you repeat
that every day for three months.

388
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:36,780
It's like you go outside
and all the locals get away
from you because you're the

389
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,790
new drunk Letcher who's come down from
the north and that's your vision for

390
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:42,624
retirement.

391
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:43,291
It's like,

392
00:14:43,291 --> 00:14:43,920
okay,

393
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,000
so you have all the money.

394
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,320
You want no responsibility.

395
00:14:46,321 --> 00:14:47,670
You don't have to take care of yourself.

396
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,050
You don't have a partner,

397
00:14:49,051 --> 00:14:50,160
so you don't have to take care of them.

398
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,083
You don't have any,

399
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,760
you don't have to take care of them.

400
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,960
You don't have a job.

401
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:54,561
It's like,

402
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,394
what are you going to do?

403
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,530
What are you going to do exactly?

404
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:59,600
Sit in the sun and Drink Margaritas.

405
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,040
It's like there's no,

406
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,673
no,

407
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,300
that's not a good vision.

408
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,000
You don't want no responsibility.

409
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,830
It's wrong.

410
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:13,100
People find the meaning in their
life by adopting responsibility.

411
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,653
And so

412
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,060
provision of money,

413
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,231
you know,

414
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:18,651
they say,

415
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:20,270
man does not live by bread alone.

416
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:22,880
And there's wisdom in that.

417
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,610
It's like you don't
want no responsibility.

418
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:28,040
You might dream about that if
you're crushed by your job,

419
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,690
but then you have the wrong job.

420
00:15:29,691 --> 00:15:32,300
Or do you have the wrong attitude or
you have the wrong job and the wrong

421
00:15:32,301 --> 00:15:32,751
attitude.

422
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:33,770
I don't know what it is.

423
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,350
You want lots of responsibility
and society needs to
foster that and we need to

424
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:44,210
help people find their purpose
and their place and that's,

425
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,690
that's more to the point
then universal income,

426
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,550
it's the wrong solution.

427
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,280
[inaudible].
