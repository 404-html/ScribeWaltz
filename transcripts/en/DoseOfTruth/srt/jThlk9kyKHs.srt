1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,180
Here's a good analogy about
government type thing.

2
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:10,720
So your schools,

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,730
there's always bullies and bullies
are aggressive kids who aren't really

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:19,400
inclined to play by the rules.

5
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,460
So they're aggressive and
they're not very conscientious.

6
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,090
And so they're kind of predatory and
they'll prey on other kids if given the

7
00:00:28,431 --> 00:00:29,090
opportunity.

8
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:29,361
Okay,

9
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:30,530
so how do you stop that?

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:30,771
Well,

11
00:00:30,771 --> 00:00:33,780
you don't go around feeling sorry for
the bullies because that doesn't work and

12
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:35,060
they don't have low self esteem.

13
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,410
They have high self esteem.

14
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:40,760
And the way that you deal with always
is you have parents or teachers watching

15
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:41,390
the school yard.

16
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,580
Every time I kid bully someone else,

17
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:44,473
you stopped them.

18
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,660
Now you don't throw them
in a cell for 10 years.

19
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:52,820
You just stop what they're doing
from having the desired outcome.

20
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,470
And then bullying goes away.

21
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,490
Now this has been demonstrated by
a guy in Scandinavia called Dan.

22
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:58,911
Oh yes,

23
00:00:58,911 --> 00:00:59,540
he's done.

24
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,890
He's reduced bullying in the Scandinavian
countries by 50% and the way he's done

25
00:01:03,891 --> 00:01:08,300
that is by ensuring that in school yards,

26
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:09,800
bullies get caught.

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,950
Not that they get punished now.

28
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:16,220
So translate that into political policy.

29
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,180
Concern is always argued that
you should be hard on crime.

30
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,430
Criminals crack down on crime.

31
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,121
It's like,

32
00:01:23,121 --> 00:01:23,900
yes,

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,520
but their way they do it is by saying,

34
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:25,731
well,

35
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:27,680
let's have more extensive sentences.

36
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,360
That's the wrong approach.

37
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,930
The right approach is to decrease the
probability that the crime will be

38
00:01:32,931 --> 00:01:34,970
successfully undertaken.

39
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,230
So you have to decrease the success rate
of the crime rather than increase the

40
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:40,010
punishment.

41
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:41,050
And that actually works.

42
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,450
There's,

43
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,231
so for example,

44
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:45,140
when they put drug addicts on,

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,460
uh,

46
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,581
uh,

47
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:51,581
tight observation schedule and have a
certain punishment associated with failing

48
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,470
a drug test that the drug
users who are on parole,

49
00:01:54,471 --> 00:01:55,304
they stopped,

50
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,820
they stopped using drugs
because they know they're,

51
00:01:58,850 --> 00:01:59,720
they're not going get away with it,

52
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:00,613
period.

53
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:06,310
So part of the role of the government is
to ensure that rule breakers do not get

54
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:08,354
away with it.

55
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,920
And that's also part of the role.

56
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,790
The citizenry Aa,

57
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,610
you shouldn't break
rules because if you do,

58
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,510
you contribute to the likelihood that
everything will fall apart and be,

59
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:20,930
you shouldn't let other people around
you get away with breaking rules.

60
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,470
So that's the role of government.

61
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,760
And that's not all,

62
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,810
but that's a big part of it.
