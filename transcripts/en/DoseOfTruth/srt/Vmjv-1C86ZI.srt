1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:08,560
One more.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:08,990
Daniel,

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:10,160
shall I like this question?

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:13,940
How would you give a speech to soldiers
entering the army about responsibility?

5
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,270
I will command and basic training unit
and address young soldiers advice.

6
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,170
Daniel,

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,390
what I would do is you
can take about this,

8
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,810
you could ask them to complete
the future authoring program.

9
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,730
I think that would be a really good idea.

10
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:26,900
But if you don't want to do that,

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,660
but you should ask them to like get them
to sit down for 90 minutes or an hour

12
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:33,494
even.

13
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:36,410
I would use the future authoring
program cause it's just easier.

14
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:41,650
But ask them what sort of soldiers
they want to be in three to five years.

15
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:46,661
Like if they could put themselves together
and be the best military and serve

16
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,040
the purpose that they enrolled in the
military for in the best possible manner,

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:55,820
what would they look like
as their own future ideal?

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,200
They have to think it through.

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,753
So,

20
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,130
and then the other thing you can ask them,

21
00:01:01,131 --> 00:01:03,170
and this is also part of the
future authoring program,

22
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:06,950
is like what would your life look like
three to five years down the road?

23
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:08,420
If you fail in your,

24
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,220
in your desire to,

25
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,920
to become a proper soldier,

26
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,510
what sort of hell are you cording by
failing to take on the responsibility.

27
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:19,370
And if you can get them
to think that through,

28
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:19,941
you know,

29
00:01:19,941 --> 00:01:21,830
the probability that
they'll do a good job,

30
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,060
we'll fastly increase,

31
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:24,500
really vastly increase.

32
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,130
Lots of young people have never thought
about who it is that they could be if

33
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:30,260
they started to be the
person they could be.

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,590
And so getting them to think about that
and write about it would be extremely

35
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:33,981
important.

36
00:01:33,981 --> 00:01:38,690
So what I would do first of all is get
them to do the writing and the thinking

37
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:39,920
and then give the speech.

38
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,900
And maybe once they've done it,

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,071
you know,

40
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,610
you could ask them if they'd be willing
to share with you some of what they've

41
00:01:46,611 --> 00:01:46,940
written.

42
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,520
I wouldn't make that mandatory because
then they might not be able to write

43
00:01:49,521 --> 00:01:50,360
about it honestly.

44
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:52,010
So that's how I would go about it.
