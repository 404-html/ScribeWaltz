1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,330
There's any,

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:09,720
there's another strange element to that,

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,670
which is that on the one hand,

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,220
the,

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:17,010
the radical feminist types that
neo Marxists postmodernists are,

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:20,370
are very much opposed to the patriarchy,

7
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,001
let's say.

8
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,930
And that's that unit,

9
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:22,591
dimensional,

10
00:00:22,591 --> 00:00:23,790
ideological represented,

11
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,430
average listed every prayer,

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,080
perhaps the word can be applied
to Republican Rome and that's it.

13
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:29,010
Okay.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,221
Well,

15
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:32,370
and it maybe it could be applied
usefully to certain kinds of tyranny,

16
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:34,640
but not to a society
that's actually functional.

17
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,430
Victorian England and one arguably.

18
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:37,720
Okay.

19
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:38,800
But other than that,

20
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:42,750
and to use the word patriarchy in that
and that slapdash way fulfill amateur

21
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,290
tourists.

22
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:43,791
Absolutely.

23
00:00:43,791 --> 00:00:44,180
Absolutely.

24
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,410
You know,

25
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:46,400
just shows people know
nothing about history,

26
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,291
whatever have you had written,

27
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:48,130
had done no reading.

28
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,771
So,

29
00:00:48,771 --> 00:00:53,340
and so what confuses me about that is
that despite the fact that the Patriarchy

30
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,740
is viewed as this essentially evil entity
and that that's associated with the

31
00:00:57,741 --> 00:01:00,590
masculine energy that built
this oppressive structure,

32
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,930
the antithesis of that,

33
00:01:02,931 --> 00:01:05,810
which would actually be
femininity as far as I can tell,

34
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:10,400
which is tightly associated with care and
with child rearing is also denigrated.

35
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:15,401
So it's like the only proper role for
women to adopt is a patriarchal role,

36
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:18,740
despite the fact that the patriarchy
is something that's entirely corrupt.

37
00:01:18,741 --> 00:01:23,741
So the hypothesis seems to be that the
patriarchy would be just fine if women

38
00:01:23,991 --> 00:01:24,824
ran it.

39
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:26,270
So no changes.

40
00:01:26,271 --> 00:01:29,960
It's just that would just
be a transformation of
leadership and somehow that

41
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:30,410
would,

42
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,960
that would rectify the
fundamental problem,

43
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:35,440
even though it's hypothetically
supposed to be structural.
