1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,350
Why am I telling you this?

2
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:03,023
Well,

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,760
what the children were doing,

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,020
you think about how the tail,

5
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:15,240
did the children come up
with these weird ideas,

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:16,350
you know,

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:16,621
I mean,

8
00:00:16,621 --> 00:00:20,910
first of all we should note the children
are not stupid and they can also dream

9
00:00:20,911 --> 00:00:22,710
up the most horrible things,

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,450
you know,

11
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,030
um,

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,410
because they have an imagination that's
capable of extending itself out into the

13
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:29,071
terrifying.

14
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,770
Now everyone knows that because all you
have to do is remember when you were a

15
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:32,580
kid,

16
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:33,210
you know,

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,560
when you were hiding under the covers,

18
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,870
because there were horrible
things in your dark room.

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:37,680
You know,

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,010
you can populate the darkness
with monsters with no problem.

21
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,000
And you should be able to,

22
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,950
because there are
monsters in the darkness.

23
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,990
Even though your parents
might tell you there aren't,

24
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,430
it's like there might not be any dirt
monsters in that particular piece of

25
00:00:50,431 --> 00:00:51,264
darkness.

26
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,700
And that's a perfectly reasonable
thing to tell your children.

27
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,650
But in the darkness as a whole,

28
00:00:55,651 --> 00:00:56,190
it's like,

29
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,431
yeah,

30
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,450
look the hell out.

31
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,330
So the children aren't stupid now.

32
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:01,310
So then the,

33
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,750
the,

34
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,400
the adults start to question them and
the kids or the back of their brain,

35
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:06,990
the little imaginative part is thinking,

36
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:08,340
what are these people want?

37
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:09,390
What do these people want?

38
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,590
What do these people want?

39
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,620
And so they'll throw him out a little
bit of information and they'll,

40
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:14,970
the adults will perk up.

41
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,220
They'll focus right on
that piece of information.

42
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:22,221
So maybe it's a cop who really
hates childs satanist abductors,

43
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:23,011
which you know,

44
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:25,020
is perfectly reasonable stance.

45
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:29,040
And so when the child offers
any information about,

46
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,200
about the existence of such a thing,

47
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:33,780
well the cop will perk up
and then the child thinks,

48
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:33,991
oh,

49
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:34,351
I see.

50
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:34,591
Well,

51
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:35,860
so sort of what's going on?

52
00:01:35,861 --> 00:01:36,840
It seems to have something to do.

53
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,550
They don't think this consciously,

54
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,061
you know,

55
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:40,740
but their imagination is working.

56
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,730
How do I model the reality
that's been presented to me?

57
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,920
And that's when the dream
start to kick in too.
