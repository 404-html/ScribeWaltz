1
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:05,971
Cause you think,

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:06,430
Lord,

3
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:07,890
I thought appears in your hand.

4
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:08,161
Right?

5
00:00:08,161 --> 00:00:09,420
That's obvious Pedang.

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:09,901
It's it.

7
00:00:09,901 --> 00:00:11,340
It's nothing you ever ask about.

8
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:12,960
But what the hell does that mean?

9
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:15,000
I thought appears in your hand.

10
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,610
What kind of ridiculous
explanation is that?

11
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:18,743
You know,

12
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,450
it just doesn't help with anything.

13
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:23,040
Where does it come from?

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,401
Well,

15
00:00:23,401 --> 00:00:23,880
nowhere.

16
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,040
It just appears in my head.

17
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:26,581
Okay,

18
00:00:26,581 --> 00:00:29,820
well that's not a very sophisticated
explanation as it turns out,

19
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,540
you know?

20
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,880
And so you might think
that those thoughts,

21
00:00:32,881 --> 00:00:33,870
thoughts that you think,

22
00:00:33,871 --> 00:00:33,991
well,

23
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:35,210
where do they come from old?

24
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,870
They're often someone else's thoughts,

25
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:37,111
right?

26
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,250
Someone Long Dad,

27
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,150
that might be part of it.

28
00:00:39,151 --> 00:00:43,800
Just like the words you use to think our
utterances of people who've been long

29
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:44,634
dead.

30
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,060
And so you're informed by
the spirit of your ancestors.

31
00:00:48,061 --> 00:00:49,440
That's one way of looking at it.

32
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:50,610
And your motivation,

33
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:51,900
speak to your motion,

34
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,100
speak to in your body,

35
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,940
speaks to you.

36
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,830
And it all does all that,

37
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:57,750
at least in part through the dream.

38
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,310
And the dream is the birthplace
of the fully articulated idea.

39
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,950
They don't just come from nowhere.

40
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:06,030
Fully fledged,

41
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:06,211
right?

42
00:01:06,211 --> 00:01:07,230
They have a development,

43
00:01:07,231 --> 00:01:09,340
Laura Jun and God only knows how,

44
00:01:09,341 --> 00:01:09,960
how long,

45
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,610
how lengthy that origin is.

46
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,230
Even to say something like,

47
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,580
I am conscious,

48
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,560
you know,

49
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,550
that's taken PE chimpanzees,

50
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,810
don't say that.

51
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,621
You know,

52
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:23,370
it's been 7 million years since
we broke from chimpanzees.

53
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:25,380
Something like that from
the common ancestor.

54
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:25,621
You know,

55
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,570
they have no articulated knowledge at all.

56
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,740
They have very little self representation
in some sense and very little self

57
00:01:31,741 --> 00:01:32,574
consciousness.

58
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,590
And that's not the case with us at all.

59
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:38,550
And we had to painstakingly figure
all of this out during that,

60
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:38,881
you know,

61
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,620
7 million year voyage.

62
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,280
And I think some of that's
represented and and,

63
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,360
and,

64
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,420
and captured in some sense
in these ancient stories,

65
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,850
which I believe were part of,

66
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,040
especially the oldest stories in genesis,

67
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:57,200
which is the stories we're going to
start with that they were at that,

68
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,860
that some of the archaic nature of the
human being is encapsulated in those

69
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:02,250
stories.

70
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,083
And it's very,

71
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,700
very instructive as far as I can tell.

72
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,440
I can give you just a quick example.

73
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:07,651
You know,

74
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:09,480
there's an idea of sacrifice in,

75
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:10,500
in,

76
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:10,860
in,

77
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,910
in the Old Testament,

78
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,380
and it's pretty barbaric.

79
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:13,621
You know,

80
00:02:13,621 --> 00:02:14,160
I mean,

81
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,670
the story of Abraham and Isaac,

82
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,300
there's a good example of that because
Abraham was called on to actually

83
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,530
sacrifice his own son,

84
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:22,890
which doesn't really seem like something
that a reasonable God would ask you to

85
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:23,191
do.

86
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:23,461
Right.

87
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:28,461
And the God in the Old
Testament is frequently cruel
and arbitrary and demanding

88
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,570
and paradoxical and which,

89
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:33,870
which is one of the things that really
gives the book life because it wasn't

90
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,490
edited by a committee,

91
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,090
you know,

92
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,770
a committee that was concerned with,

93
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,280
with,

94
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:38,580
uh,

95
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,020
Nardo offending anyone,

96
00:02:40,021 --> 00:02:40,830
that's for sure.
