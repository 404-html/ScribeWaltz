1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:06,930
Yeah.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:07,763
Piaget,

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:08,220
Piaget,

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,650
the developmental psychologist
who's a very smart guy,

5
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:13,350
he pointed out something very interesting.

6
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,010
He said,

7
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,010
now imagine you ran a set of iterated
games as a competition and in one iterated

8
00:00:19,621 --> 00:00:22,500
game the rule was you bloody
well do what I tell you to.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,300
And the other one is,

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,721
well,

11
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,000
we'll all get together and decide
how we're going to do this.

12
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:27,271
Okay,

13
00:00:27,271 --> 00:00:28,620
now we run the competition.

14
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,230
Uh,

15
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,720
Piaget's claim is you
do what I tell you fail.

16
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,230
And the reason for that is I have
to impose force in order to keep you

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,093
cooperating.

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,800
And the imposition of forest is a cost.

19
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,420
It's an efficiency cost.

20
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,020
And across time that efficiency
cost is going to multiply.

21
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:48,330
And the equilibrated state solution,

22
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,000
which is the one where
we all agree it wins.

23
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,280
Now that's worth thinking about.

24
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,750
You think you think about that locally.

25
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,320
So you've got,

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,730
you're trying to organize your family,

27
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,900
you have a little family conference about
who's doing what in the household and

28
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:01,291
what do you,

29
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,410
if you want peace and
harmony and an iterated game,

30
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,640
you get everybody to say,

31
00:01:05,641 --> 00:01:05,791
well,

32
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,760
here's the tasks and we
they have to be done.

33
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,140
People have to agree on that.

34
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:10,831
And then you say,

35
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:10,951
well,

36
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:12,330
which task would you do?

37
00:01:12,331 --> 00:01:14,160
You have to some how about you?

38
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:14,671
And you know,

39
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:15,720
which task would you do?

40
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:16,950
And everybody agrees.

41
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,690
And then you say,

42
00:01:18,691 --> 00:01:18,961
well,

43
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,670
unless you can come up
with a better solution,

44
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,050
that's the one we're going to go with.

45
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,830
And then people can be a little resentful
and angry about the conditions of

46
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:27,780
existence where they have to work,

47
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,030
but they can't really
blame that on anyone else.

48
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,490
And maybe that's the best
solution you could come up with.

49
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:35,070
And that was Piaget's idea
of the [inaudible] state.

50
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:35,904
It was like,

51
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,060
it's a voluntary agreement that can
be iterated across time that works at

52
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,340
multiple levels of social organization.

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,990
Man,

54
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:46,890
that's a serious,

55
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:47,401
serious,

56
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,080
serious set of constraints.

57
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:50,191
And Piaget.

58
00:01:50,191 --> 00:01:50,641
By the way,

59
00:01:50,641 --> 00:01:54,450
it was looking for a way to
reconcile science and religion.

60
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:59,100
He was looking for a biological origin
to morality and he thought he found it in

61
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:02,250
the idea of the equilla braided
state and it's even deeper than that.

62
00:02:02,251 --> 00:02:04,830
So imagine this equilibrating state ideas.

63
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,660
Actually there's something to it that
if you set the the state up property,

64
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:13,410
it will iterate across time so long
that it becomes a permanent part of the

65
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:14,244
environment.

66
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,540
The hierarchy is exactly,

67
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:17,010
that's exactly what a hierarchies.

68
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,740
Hierarchies are 350 million years old.

69
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,010
They're not that patriarchal invention
of white European Christian males in the

70
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,000
last 300 years.

71
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,700
There are 350 million years old.

72
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,960
They're stable,

73
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,040
they're stable solutions to this iterative
game problem and they've been around

74
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,410
so long that we're
actually adapted to the,

75
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,890
and that's part of the reason we have
archetypal representations of the social

76
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:41,724
structure.

77
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,570
So and then we also have architectural
representations of the relationship of

78
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:48,690
the individual to the social structure.

79
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,000
Your job as an individual in relationship
to the social structure is to embody

80
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,380
the social structure,

81
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,100
but also just serve as as
its eyes and its mouth.

82
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,140
So that can update itself would necessary.

83
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,320
So you take on the mantle of your father,

84
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,250
let's say,

85
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:07,660
but he's dead.

86
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,850
He's the path he can't see.

87
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:10,990
You can see.

88
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,410
So you take the structure that's already
there and you modify it where it's

89
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:19,360
necessary and that modification process
is necessary or the state becomes too

90
00:03:19,361 --> 00:03:20,710
static and collapses.

91
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,920
And that's why the state has to
be subordinate to the individual.

92
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,020
And that's what Western culture has
discovered and we can't just let them go.

93
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:29,790
That's the idea.

94
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,430
The logos,

95
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,080
that's a big idea.

96
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,680
And you'd want to live somewhere where
you want to live somewhere where the

97
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:37,390
individual is subordinate to the state.

98
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:37,691
It's like,

99
00:03:37,691 --> 00:03:38,110
hey,

100
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:38,741
go right ahead.

101
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,970
There's lots of places like that,

102
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,360
man,

103
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,130
emigrate go there.

104
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:45,310
90% of the world's
countries are like that.

105
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,570
If you want to live like that,

106
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:46,811
man,

107
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:48,250
go find out what it's like.

108
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,160
You don't see immigration going there,

109
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,180
that's for sure.

110
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:54,431
Okay,

111
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:57,010
so that's a big mistake
that the postmodernist made.

112
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,420
It's not trivial.

113
00:03:58,421 --> 00:03:59,350
That's a big mistake,

114
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,490
but it's not the only one.
