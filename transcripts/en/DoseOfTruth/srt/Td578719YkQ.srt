1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,320
Just to stay with him for a moment.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:11,040
He's painted as the great
defender of freedom.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,630
It's possible that your country,

4
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:13,201
Canada,

5
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:14,310
and certainly my country,

6
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:19,311
Australia would have not continued as
free societies had it not been for that

7
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:23,100
man courageously standing
at a time when so few did.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,791
He wasn't.

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,080
The inventor of freedom.

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,041
Freedom is,

11
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:29,160
we understand it and I
want to unpack that a bit.

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,270
Something very,

13
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:34,870
very few people in very few cultures
down through the ages and even today I've

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,330
ever really experienced.

15
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,420
Oh well,

16
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:37,900
yes,

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,141
Ben.

18
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,490
Partly because we're afraid of it,

19
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:40,691
I would say.

20
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:41,524
I mean

21
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,030
people think of freedom as the ability
to implement your whim and freedom opens

22
00:00:48,731 --> 00:00:50,080
up that as a possibility,

23
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,150
but sustainable freedom,

24
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,830
that isn't what it's about at all.

25
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,430
It's about,

26
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,260
it's primarily about responsibility.

27
00:00:56,290 --> 00:00:58,960
It's about determining which load
you're going to pick up and carry.

28
00:00:59,110 --> 00:01:01,600
That's the proper definition
of appropriate freedom.

29
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:07,030
It's not grout DM gratification
of instantaneous impulse.

30
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:09,010
It's self evident that that doesn't work.

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,980
Two year olds do that and that's
why they can't live in the world.

32
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,230
They can't organize
themselves across time.

33
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:19,030
They can't sacrifice the moment for the
future and the more sophisticated you

34
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:19,361
get,

35
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:23,200
I suppose in some sense the more you're
able to do that and then your freedom

36
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:26,020
becomes the freedom to choose
the proper responsibility.

37
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:27,370
And that's not,

38
00:01:27,371 --> 00:01:30,370
that's also not something that we've been
good at communicating to young people.

39
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:32,050
If we talk to them about responsibility,

40
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:34,600
we don't generally do it in
a finger wagging sort of way.

41
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,141
It's like,

42
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:36,130
well you're breaking the rules,

43
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,700
you're a bad person and,

44
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:38,140
and,

45
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,980
and well that may be true because people
break the rules and there's no shortage

46
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:43,210
of badness in people.

47
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,040
But the,

48
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,600
the proper message for
young people is to say,

49
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:46,721
well,

50
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:46,931
no,

51
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,190
you don't understand you,

52
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,560
you want to take on responsibility,

53
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:54,220
you want to take on the heaviest load
that you can conceive of that you might be

54
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:58,840
able to move because it gives your life
nobility and purpose and that offsets

55
00:01:58,841 --> 00:01:59,674
the tragedy.

56
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,060
And,

57
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:00,270
and,

58
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,690
and not only psychologically,

59
00:02:01,691 --> 00:02:05,670
not only does it offset it psychologically
because you have a purpose and

60
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,330
something to wake up for,

61
00:02:07,331 --> 00:02:07,571
right.

62
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:09,370
And to face the difficulties of the day,

63
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,930
but also because if you face the
difficulties of the day properly,

64
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:16,780
you actually ameliorate suffering
not only in the psychological sense,

65
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:20,770
but because you make the world
at least a less terrible place.

66
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:21,730
And that's something,

67
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,241
right?

68
00:02:22,241 --> 00:02:24,670
To move things away
from hell is something,

69
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,930
even if you're not,

70
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:26,561
you know,

71
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:29,530
self evidently moving
forthrightly to heaven too,

72
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,800
to move things away from the
worst they can be as well.

73
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:34,630
That's a noble goal in and of itself.

74
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:38,440
So [inaudible] and young people
are starving for that idea.

75
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,150
It's very interesting to watch.

76
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,673
As I look at it

77
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,050
seems to me that that acton had it right.

78
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,970
Freedom properly understood,

79
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,030
needs to be seen as a
negative and as a positive.

80
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:50,080
The negatives is,

81
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,440
is this sort of concept
of freedom from fear,

82
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,191
addiction,

83
00:02:54,191 --> 00:02:55,540
persecution,

84
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,420
Karen tyranny,

85
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:58,310
uh,

86
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,100
in a personal and then,

87
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:00,910
um,

88
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,060
freedom to be used to
reach your potential.

89
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:08,110
But it seems to me that what's missing
is an understanding that freedom exercise

90
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:10,420
within a framework of responsibility.

91
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,190
Are you doing what you ought?

92
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:18,310
We'll guarantee you ongoing freedom for
yourself and fuel and neighbors freedom

93
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:23,311
exercised in a way that confuses it
with license tends to destroy freedom.

94
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:24,401
In fact,

95
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:29,350
you could even go so far as to say that
misunderstood freedom turns out to be

96
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:30,090
its own worst enemy.

97
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,530
Uh Huh.

98
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:30,870
Uh Huh.

99
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:31,321
Well that's,

100
00:03:31,321 --> 00:03:31,780
that's the,

101
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:35,280
that's the difficult distinction
between freedom of the moment and,

102
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:36,090
and freedom of,

103
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:36,923
of the,

104
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,510
the freedom with everything
taken into account.

105
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:42,310
And I remember real admirer
of the work of John Piaget.

106
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,630
Piaget is a developmental psychologist
and few people know the world's most well

107
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:51,540
known developmental psychologists and
few people know that he was actually

108
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:55,650
motivated in his intellectual pursuits
by the desire to reconcile science with

109
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:56,370
religion.

110
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:59,280
That was what his driving force from
the time that he was a young man,

111
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,280
you wouldn't know that even necessarily
by reading his writings because it's

112
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:04,110
implicit rather than explicit in them.

113
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,970
But he,

114
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,170
he,

115
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:10,860
he has a different model of
what constitutes morality than,

116
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,760
than Freud.

117
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,170
Freud's model is combative.

118
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:15,520
It's sort of the superego as tyrant.

119
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,090
So the superego would be
the strictures of society,

120
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,253
the ID,

121
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,240
the biological impulses.

122
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,830
And the eagle crushed between those.

123
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:23,041
Right?

124
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,860
So the ego is this thing that's
crushed between nature and culture.

125
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,090
And so it's a really,

126
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,410
it's a tense and combative model of the
Human Psyche and there's something about

127
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:31,910
it that's,

128
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,400
that's,

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,810
that's accurate because some of the
restrictions that are put on your impulse

130
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,690
gratification are imposed on you in a,

131
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:39,921
in,

132
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,130
in a sense to radically.

133
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,530
But Piaget's perspective was much more

134
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,010
optimistic and I think much more accurate.

135
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,810
He noticed that as children
organize themselves
spontaneously as they developed,

136
00:04:51,811 --> 00:04:54,840
especially within the confines
of their own spontaneous play,

137
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,620
they didn't so much subsume art or inhibit
their dark and aggressive impulses as

138
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:07,970
make them sophisticated and transform
them into universally acceptable games.

139
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,200
So for Piaget,

140
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,770
a game that a group of
children were playing,

141
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:18,270
that all of them were playing voluntarily
and that was going well and that they

142
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:22,650
all wanted to continue playing was a
microcosm of society and literally a

143
00:05:22,651 --> 00:05:23,730
microcosm of society.

144
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:27,540
The reason the children were playing
those games was to practice being

145
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,190
productive members of society.

146
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,710
And he felt that the appropriate game
tended towards what he described as an

147
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,950
Nyquil abraded state.

148
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,550
So in acrylic graded state would be a
game that you'll play because you've

149
00:05:38,551 --> 00:05:39,810
decided it's a good game,

150
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,740
but that you can play with others because
they've also decided that it's a good

151
00:05:43,741 --> 00:05:44,400
game.

152
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,180
And so that can work at the individual
level and at the familial level and at

153
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,080
the social level.

154
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,390
And if you get all those
things working simultaneously,

155
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:53,850
then you have a sustainable enterprise.

156
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,680
And it's,

157
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,820
it's predicated not so much on the,

158
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,620
on the,

159
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,160
uh,

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,010
inhibition of impulse or
on the regulation of it,

161
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:04,160
but of the integration of impulses into a,

162
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,460
into a pattern of being that gratifies
them on a relatively permanent basis.

163
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:10,731
So,

164
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:11,090
you know,

165
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:13,070
if you want to go to university
and become a physician,

166
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,840
I think there's a lot of sacrifice of
impulsive gratification that goes along

167
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:18,530
with that.

168
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,060
But if you become a physician,

169
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:22,130
then it's a noble enterprise.

170
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,820
People support you socially and all
of the needs that you need to have

171
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:26,331
fulfilled.

172
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,610
We'll also be fulfilled
by that enterprise.

173
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:28,971
Well,

174
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:30,110
that's a way better model.

175
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:35,090
And so it's strange that the maximum
freedom comes with the adoption of a

176
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:39,080
discipline and then also the adoption
of responsibility that frees you up and

177
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,700
everyone else around you in the long run.

178
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,500
And if you explain that to people,

179
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,270
especially in this day and age,

180
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:47,810
when they'd be fed a never ending
diet of idiot rights and freedoms,

181
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,580
they're immediately on board
with it because they know
and know that most of the

182
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,520
meaning that people experience in
their life as a consequence of adopting

183
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:56,354
responsibility.

184
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,340
So they're starving for that.

185
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,050
Our idea to be articulated.
