1
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:06,450
You've been betrayed by someone.

2
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:08,490
And so you fall into that underworld of,

3
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,000
of,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,380
of doubt about everything.

5
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:13,020
And it's a serious place
to be in that underworld a,

6
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:17,280
because not only do you not know where
you came from or who you are or where

7
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:17,790
you're going,

8
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,050
that's bad enough.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,460
So that's the underworld itself.

10
00:00:20,461 --> 00:00:22,380
But there's a subdivision
of the underworld,

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,850
like the worst suburb,

12
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,570
which is I think what hell is essentially
from a metaphysical perspective

13
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:28,830
because you know,

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,260
if someone really cuts
you off at the knees,

15
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:33,390
especially if they do
it in a malevolent way,

16
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:35,880
and if you're going to be betrayed
and you really want to be,

17
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:36,810
be trade properly,

18
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:39,810
you want to be betrayed by someone
who's really out to hurt you.

19
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:40,201
You know,

20
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:41,610
they just weren't being stupid.

21
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:43,890
They were like after
you for whatever reason.

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,150
And then that's also you plunged
into that underworld space.

23
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,720
And that's also when you start to nurse
feelings of resentment and a grievement

24
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,820
and murder and homicide.

25
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,660
And even worse,

26
00:00:54,661 --> 00:00:54,961
you know,

27
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:56,880
because if people are betrayed enough,

28
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:57,660
they start,

29
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,660
they start to obsess about the utility
of being itself and perhaps go to places

30
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:06,630
that no one would ever want to go if
they were in their right mind and to,

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,020
and to develop a nurse fantasies
of the ultimate revenge.

32
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,000
And that's a horrible place to be.

33
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:13,900
And that's held as far as I can tell.

34
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:16,860
And that's why hell is always
been a suburb of the underworld.

35
00:01:16,861 --> 00:01:17,694
Because if,

36
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:21,600
if you get plunged into a situation that
you don't understand and things are not

37
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,620
good for you anymore,

38
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,410
it's one step from being
completely confused.

39
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,730
It's only one step from being completely
confused to being completely outraged

40
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,750
and resentful.

41
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:34,200
And then it's only one step from
there to really looking for revenge.

42
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:37,430
And that can take you
places that well that,

43
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,650
that merely to imagine
properly can be traumatic.

44
00:01:40,651 --> 00:01:42,900
And I've seen that happen
with people many times.

45
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,050
And I think that anybody who uses their
imagination on themselves can see how

46
00:01:48,421 --> 00:01:52,530
that happens because I don't imagine
there's a single person in the room that

47
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:55,590
hasn't nursed fairly intense
fantasies of revenge,

48
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:57,150
at least at one point in their life.

49
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:57,871
And usually,

50
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:58,321
you know,

51
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,120
for what appear to be good reasons,

52
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,490
it's no picnic to get betrayed.

53
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:03,231
That's for sure.

54
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:04,740
That can shake your faith in being,

55
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:08,880
but if it shakes it so badly that
you turn against being itself,

56
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,410
that certainly no solution,

57
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:10,981
that's for sure.

58
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:13,050
All it does is make everything that's bad.

59
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:13,860
Even worse.
