1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,010
So,
same thing here,

2
00:00:09,011 --> 00:00:10,360
they're selling,
you know,

3
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:13,990
ha,
he's the great father of the family and

4
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:15,370
these,
these kids are,

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:18,040
they're kind of like the Soviet
equivalent of cub scouts.

6
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:21,000
They're sort of worship a game.
And then I really liked the other one on

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:21,970
the,
on the right,

8
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:25,570
because I mean,
you could hardly find a more hellish

9
00:00:25,571 --> 00:00:27,910
representation of a tyrant than that.
Right?

10
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,110
I mean,
it looks,

11
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:33,310
and this is quite interesting,
it looks like Stellan is standing in

12
00:00:33,311 --> 00:00:36,520
front of a man.
Door lock is Amanda Orla is a shape like

13
00:00:36,521 --> 00:00:39,250
this and all shape.
You see that in renaissance art all the

14
00:00:39,251 --> 00:00:41,470
time.
It's an extremely old symbol.

15
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,710
It's the oldest symbol that people have
ever found evidence for.

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,470
And the thing is on fire.
It's like Stella,

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,300
there he is,
King of Hell.

18
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:51,160
And it's exactly right.
You know,

19
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:51,710
it's,
it's,

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:55,900
it's eerie that that's the mode of
representation that emerged for them,

21
00:00:55,901 --> 00:00:57,580
but it's certainly accurate.

22
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,453
So,
you know,

23
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,490
the whole tyrannical end of the great
father is,

24
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,620
this is the sort of thing that results
from it,

25
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:07,210
you know,
it's like the,

26
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,253
the,
uh,

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:13,300
elevation of the person at the top of
the dominance hierarchy to the status of

28
00:01:13,301 --> 00:01:16,660
some kind of quasi identity certainly
happened in Hitler's case.

29
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,600
And then the brutal murderousness that
can emerge from that,

30
00:01:19,601 --> 00:01:23,890
those are pictures from the
concentration camps at the end of World

31
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,460
War Two.
So,

32
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,310
you know,
so I told you that the feminine can be

33
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,570
rep that terrible unknown things can be
represented by the feminine,

34
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,370
sort of a monstrous figure,
you know,

35
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,640
but it's certainly the case that the
monstrosity of culture is roughly

36
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,080
equivalent to the monstrosity of nature.
You know,

37
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:46,000
and one of the things you might think
about is that common India tend to

38
00:01:46,001 --> 00:01:49,240
utilize these symbolic categories.
It's almost as if they appropriate them.

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,550
So the environmental movement,
for example,

40
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,310
basically says benevolent nature,
right?

41
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:57,970
So that's the positive feminine negative
culture because that's cultures out

42
00:01:57,971 --> 00:02:01,090
there,
rapaciously destroying the pristine

43
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:04,270
wilderness of Mother Nature and the
negative individual too.

44
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:06,580
Because you know,
human beings are part of that as

45
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:10,630
individuals and we're kind of a cancer
on the face of the planet,

46
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:13,060
if you know,
I mean that's pretty dark way of looking

47
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:15,640
at it obviously,
but it's one sided because you could

48
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:16,780
easily say,
yeah,

49
00:02:16,781 --> 00:02:17,261
well,
you know,

50
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:20,020
we're in a war with nature because
obviously she's trying to kill us as

51
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:23,350
fast as possible and we better have some
culture because otherwise we'd be

52
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,930
sitting outside in the freezing snow and
you know,

53
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:29,920
you might be a re patients consumer,
but on the other hand you're just trying

54
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:32,230
to survive and it's not that easy.
And so,

55
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,390
you know,
you need to have both of those stories

56
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:38,050
together before you have a reasonable
representation of the world.

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,450
It's not easy to cope with something
like,

58
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,840
well like that.
It's not easy to cope with something

59
00:02:43,841 --> 00:02:48,841
like that in every institution has this
potential and this element because

60
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:53,950
institutions tend towards
bureaucratization and tyranny as they

61
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,960
develop.
They close up and become rigid.

62
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:56,861
And so,
you know,

63
00:02:56,861 --> 00:03:00,040
that's a rough thing to deal with.
And then of course is a rough thing to

64
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,510
deal with too.
So you might think,

65
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:03,970
well,
you could have a little bit of sympathy

66
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:06,610
for human beings,
not just throw them in the horrible

67
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,180
rapacious creature category,
which I think is an extraordinarily

68
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,510
pathological and also a pre genocidal
thing to do,

69
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,820
you know,
because you hear environment to lists

70
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,820
for example now,
and then say the planet would be better

71
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,590
off without people on.
It's like,

72
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,573
well,
you know,

73
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,840
that's Kinda what Hitler thought as well
about certain kinds of people anyways.

74
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,730
And God only knows where he would have
stopped.

75
00:03:27,731 --> 00:03:30,370
So you know,
when someone says something like that,

76
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:33,550
one of the things you might think is you
should take a good look at your

77
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,180
unconscious structure there Bucko,
because fundamentally you're,

78
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:40,900
you know,
there is a genocidal ideology at the

79
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:42,700
bottom of your thoughts structure.
And you know,

80
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,190
you might think that you're an
environmentalist but you're actually

81
00:03:45,191 --> 00:03:48,640
possessed by a genocidal etiology and
you better do something about that.

82
00:03:48,641 --> 00:03:52,180
Because if you ever get any power,
you're going to be one dangerous

83
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:52,720
creature.
