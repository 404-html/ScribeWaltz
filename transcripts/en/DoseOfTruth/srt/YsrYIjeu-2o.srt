1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,001
No,

2
00:00:04,001 --> 00:00:05,110
you get these stories now.

3
00:00:05,111 --> 00:00:07,960
And then about these companies that
come out with claims that their brain

4
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:12,130
exercises can improve Iq and the
literature on that is damn dismal.

5
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:16,510
I can tell you it's that the holy grail
is to produce cognitive exercises that

6
00:00:16,511 --> 00:00:19,690
produce a legitimate impact
on fluid intelligence and,

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,220
and like there's been a lot of work
done on that and the answer is so far is

8
00:00:24,221 --> 00:00:25,390
that it doesn't work.

9
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,570
So what about the game?

10
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,270
What about the video gay bank?

11
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:28,671
I mean,

12
00:00:28,671 --> 00:00:32,870
I know there has been a suggestion that
played video games actually improves at

13
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:34,970
least sub aspects of intelligence.

14
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,240
There's a couple of studies that
indicated that video games might improve

15
00:00:38,241 --> 00:00:39,320
spatial intelligence,

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,570
but,

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:39,980
but

18
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:40,813
the problem,

19
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:46,060
and I think this is this is a critical
problem or apps and insoluble one,

20
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:47,270
or at least no one's solved it,

21
00:00:47,271 --> 00:00:49,220
is that what you get is that if you,

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,640
if you exercise yourself
substantially on a given game,

23
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,130
you can radically accelerate
your performance in the game.

24
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,010
So you can get much better at
those specific skill share.

25
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:01,310
But you don't get generalization
across cognitive sets,

26
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:03,590
which is what you're really
hoping for it because I thought,

27
00:01:03,591 --> 00:01:05,300
I thought that was the
claim from some of these.

28
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,480
They have shown some
increases in spatial Iq,

29
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:12,950
but there's not very many studies and
I would say they're far overbalanced by

30
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:15,740
the other side of the research equation,

31
00:01:15,741 --> 00:01:17,450
which continually says,

32
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,710
and I've looked at this because I'm really
interested in the improvement of Iq.

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,340
I mean that's,

34
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,110
that's the holy grail in some sense.

35
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:24,944
And that,

36
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,490
and,

37
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:26,323
and uh,

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,513
the,

39
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:27,890
the,

40
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,340
the,

41
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,090
the overwhelming preponderance of
evidence suggests that you don't get

42
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,640
generalization outside the narrow domain.

43
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:36,110
Now why that is,

44
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,921
and even this,

45
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:37,671
it's even worse.

46
00:01:37,671 --> 00:01:37,821
Hey,

47
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,541
because you might say,

48
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,230
well,

49
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:43,190
imagine that you could take five
different domains of intelligence still

50
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:48,340
associated type with g and you had
people practice routines in all five

51
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:50,060
dimensions.

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,970
Maybe you'd get generalization
under those circumstances.

53
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:53,900
And the,

54
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,420
the,

55
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:54,860
the,

56
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,160
the results of the research
attempting that indicate that no,

57
00:01:58,161 --> 00:02:01,040
as soon as you move away from
those specific practice instances,

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,660
you don't get generalization.

59
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,850
So I guess it's,

60
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,270
I guess it's subways.

61
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:10,140
Some of this is to be expected from
the consideration that everything is an

62
00:02:10,141 --> 00:02:14,940
allocation problem with it
within the body at Bray into um,

63
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,930
that,

64
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:16,141
you know,

65
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:17,280
by a large

66
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:23,850
an improvement blood domain tends to be
bought at the expense of something else.

67
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,973
Uh,

68
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,803
yeah,

69
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,773
just that.

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,990
Right.

71
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,230
And then conscientiousness,

72
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,970
I can tell you some research we've done.

73
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:32,804
That's cool.

74
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,870
Although we haven't been able to
demonstrate that it's actually improved.

75
00:02:35,871 --> 00:02:36,800
Conscientiousness,

76
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:40,490
the first thing to note about
conscientiousness is that
no one understands it at

77
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:41,324
all,

78
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,010
especially the industriousness element.

79
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:45,740
There's no plausible biological,

80
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:50,330
psychological neurophysiological or
animal models for conscientiousness.

81
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,340
All we've got is self reports.

82
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,640
We can't even find tasks that
conscientious people do better.

83
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,260
It's unbelievable.

84
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,723
But um,

85
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:00,900
blue self reports really awesome.

86
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:04,180
Well you can get reports from
teachers and parents and so forth,

87
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,560
but it's all human report.

88
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:08,320
She only way we can measure
it and we didn't know.

89
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,130
Like in my lab we probably tried 200
tasks trying to find something that

90
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,030
conscientiousness,

91
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,500
conscientious people do better.

92
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,753
No luck.

93
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,050
We can derive it from linguistic analysis
of verbal output now to some degree.

94
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:21,430
But that's still,

95
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:22,540
that's not a task,

96
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,374
you know.

97
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,530
So now we,

98
00:03:25,531 --> 00:03:29,800
we produced a series of programs called
the self authoring suite and one of

99
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,190
them,

100
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:34,900
the future authoring program to writing
program that helps people lay out their

101
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:37,130
plans for the future in,

102
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,811
in detail.

103
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,280
So they have to consider their,

104
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:40,114
um,

105
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,910
their intimate relationships,

106
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:43,840
their career goals,

107
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:44,980
their educational goals,

108
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:46,600
their use of time outside work,

109
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:50,050
their plans to maintain mental and
physical health or their use of drugs and

110
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:50,800
alcohol.

111
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,550
They have to write for 15 minutes about
what kind of life they'd like to have if

112
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,820
they were taking care of themselves
three to five years in the future.

113
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,330
And then to write for the same amount
of time about how terrible their life

114
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:04,030
could be if all their
bad habits took control.

115
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:04,640
Okay.

116
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,050
And then they have to turn the pause
division into an implementable plan.

117
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:12,930
And we've managed to improve their college
grades by about 20% and dropout there

118
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,970
drug dropped their dropout rate by about
25% over about 10,000 students now.

119
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,181
But you know,

120
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:22,950
we tried to see if that was mediated by
an improvement and conscientiousness and

121
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,310
there was no evidence for that.

122
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,530
Now what it was mediated by was number
of words written during the exercise.

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,700
So it turns out that thinking
more about your future helps,

124
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,780
the more you think about it,

125
00:04:34,781 --> 00:04:35,614
the more it helps.

126
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,610
And maybe that,

127
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,121
you know,

128
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:40,570
maybe that would translate
into an improvement in
conscientiousness across time.

129
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,710
But um,

130
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,780
there haven't been any credible studies
that I know of indicating that there are

131
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:50,620
exercises that can be done
to improve conscientiousness.

132
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,460
So that's also,

133
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,773
you know,

134
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,260
troublesome and worrisome because that
would be a nice thing to be able to do

135
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:57,340
content.

136
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,173
I mean,

137
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:01,590
I haven't thought much about it and I
don't know much about the literature and

138
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:03,240
cut yet just this as a trait.

139
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,490
But the word seems to connote to me as
an ordinary English speaker has a strong

140
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:10,020
social element to it as well.

141
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:13,860
It's kind of like a country yet just
person is somebody who doesn't forget his

142
00:05:13,861 --> 00:05:14,790
obligations.

143
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,170
Your index of conscientiousness
and a university professor is,

144
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,190
you know,

145
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:23,730
somebody has asked you to write them
a reference letter for getting into

146
00:05:23,731 --> 00:05:25,070
graduate school or whatever.

147
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,590
Do you actually prioritize and get the
Dab to think dotted Tibor is there some

148
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:31,800
risks that you'll just forget about it
and shove it to them somewhere else?

149
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,700
Um,

150
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,100
I imagine cut,

151
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:34,671
she had just,

152
00:05:34,671 --> 00:05:36,560
this is having a strong element of,

153
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,640
of attentiveness to social obligation
and to the wellbeing of others as it is

154
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:43,440
defined in the personality.

155
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,880
Literature doesn't have any of that.

156
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,210
Well

157
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:45,500
I would,

158
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,960
I would say not so much attention to the
wellbeing of others because that's more

159
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,280
trait agreeableness.

160
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:50,520
Okay.

161
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,780
That's more than maternal dimension.

162
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:55,950
But there's definitely a massive
effect of social obligation,

163
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,690
which is part of the reason why
conservatives tend to be hired

164
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:00,530
conscientiousness,

165
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,364
the liberals,

166
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,230
but it's not well being of others.

167
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,064
It's duty.

168
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,301
And so the,

169
00:06:06,301 --> 00:06:06,620
the,

170
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:11,090
the conscientious types may form
and maintain social contracts.

171
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,290
Yes.

172
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,850
They implement their plans.

173
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:14,870
Yup.

174
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:18,860
And they seem to feel shame
and self contempt when they,

175
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,740
when they fail to live up
to their social obligations.

176
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:25,070
And so that's another thing
that's interesting about
the income redistribution

177
00:06:25,071 --> 00:06:29,960
idea because it's conceivable to me that
conscientious people would hate that

178
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,110
because conscientious
people do very badly.

179
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:33,681
For example,

180
00:06:33,681 --> 00:06:34,310
if they're on,

181
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,690
if they're laid off from work,

182
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,130
even if it's not their fault,

183
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:39,980
they still take themselves
apart for their failure.

184
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,680
So and so conscientious
people in particular seem
to find in activity without

185
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:47,834
productivity,

186
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:52,910
highly aversive and adverse if enough
to really cause them in all major health

187
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:53,744
problems.

188
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,793
So

189
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:55,741
yeah,

190
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:56,131
that could,

191
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:58,860
that brings us back to what we
were discussing a little while ago,

192
00:06:58,861 --> 00:06:59,930
the problem of

193
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,473
hub,

194
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:08,410
ensuring that large numbers people have
access to BD goof all work in an age at

195
00:07:09,741 --> 00:07:12,030
which it is more and
more the case that uh,

196
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:17,140
the big components of the economy of our
blue bag away with very few employees,

197
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:19,360
I don't know.

198
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
I that's going to continue.

199
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:25,870
That's probably going to ask away or
back to that same topic to some extent.

200
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,553
Yes.

201
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:28,971
But again,

202
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:29,041
I,

203
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:29,874
I mean I think,

204
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:35,200
I think any inequality of opportunity
is sort of the bottom are bedrock of any

205
00:07:37,861 --> 00:07:38,694
quality.

206
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:39,380
Yeah.

207
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:41,690
Having its impacts upon us.

208
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:42,520
It's,

209
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,550
it's certainly the bond,

210
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,480
but bedrock of,

211
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:48,470
of why we should care about it.

212
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,090
Odd moral and social justice.

213
00:07:50,091 --> 00:07:51,590
Grouts it's like,

214
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:54,380
well why should people who,

215
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:56,290
okay,

216
00:07:56,290 --> 00:08:00,070
why should [inaudible] birthright affect
the opportunity is available to what

217
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,383
and

218
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:02,111
well,

219
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:06,340
it's also with social catastrophe because
hypothetically you want to set up a

220
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:11,341
society so that whatever someone has
to offer is maximally offerable to the

221
00:08:13,091 --> 00:08:15,310
community because otherwise
the community loses.

222
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:16,150
Yes.

223
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:16,931
Now it seems to be,

224
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:17,440
I mean,

225
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,270
I think one of the great examples of that,

226
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:21,220
although I don't think this
accounts for all of it,

227
00:08:21,221 --> 00:08:25,390
is that the relationship between the
provision of women's rights by countries

228
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:28,210
and their economic productivity
is staggeringly high.

229
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:33,900
So I think that also has to do with o
openness in general to transformation and

230
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,530
change with,

231
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,010
with,

232
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,800
with the provision of women's
rights being an index of that.

233
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:39,730
But nonetheless,

234
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,820
it's a great predictor of the
eventual economic success.

235
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,760
Well,

236
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,180
partly it had ducks and partly perhaps
bar more direct effect that after all,

237
00:08:48,181 --> 00:08:50,380
it slightly over half the population,

238
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,550
um,

239
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:55,180
maybe their talents are better utilized.

240
00:08:55,430 --> 00:08:56,263
Um,

241
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,680
that's certainly what we would hope.

242
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,660
And I think,

243
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,091
I think,

244
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:00,661
as you said,

245
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:02,760
I think the evidence
at least suggests that.

246
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:03,541
So,

247
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:03,811
okay,

248
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:05,520
so let me recapitulate,

249
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,770
because we should probably fold this up.

250
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,270
And so,

251
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,230
so.
