1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,190
More representations of God the father.

2
00:00:02,191 --> 00:00:03,420
I liked these representations.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,030
I liked the triangle idea.

4
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,970
I mean I don't know why God
is wearing a triangular hat.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,650
It's kind of a strange fashion choice,

6
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:13,980
but I think it's associated with the
idea of the pyramid and I think that's

7
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,400
associated with the idea of the hierarchy
of authority and I think that's why

8
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,980
the Egyptians put their
pharaohs inside pyramids.

9
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,360
I know there's more to it than that,

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,170
but I think some of that has to do
with the notion of this hierarchical

11
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:28,860
structure and you see this now
that's speculative obviously,

12
00:00:28,861 --> 00:00:30,150
and I don't want to make too much of it,

13
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:30,984
but,

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,420
but I can't help but think
that there's something to that.

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,460
See that's on the back of
the American dollar bill.

16
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,720
I like that a lot.

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,980
That's like the eye of
horus from the Egyptians.

18
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:43,200
And so the idea here is something like
at the top of the hierarchy is something

19
00:00:43,201 --> 00:00:44,940
that is no longer part of the hierarchy.

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,141
Right?

21
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:48,000
So if you move up the hierarchy enough,

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,870
what happens is that you develop the
ability as a consequence of moving up that

23
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:55,410
hierarchy to be detached enough from
the hierarchy so you're no longer really

24
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:58,950
part of it and so that you can move
in all sorts of different hierarchies.

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:00:59,641
And the thing,

26
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:02,970
the idea here is that the thing that
you're really developing the capacity to

27
00:01:02,971 --> 00:01:03,804
pay attention,

28
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,060
and I would say from a,

29
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,120
from a mythological perspective,

30
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:14,190
the one thing that seems to compete
with the idea of the spoken word as the,

31
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,430
as the source of the extraction
of habitable order from
chaos is the eye is the

32
00:01:19,681 --> 00:01:20,760
capacity to pay attention.

33
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:21,560
So Marduk,

34
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,141
for example,

35
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:23,700
the Mesopotamian Creator,

36
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:24,660
God who,

37
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:24,940
who,

38
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:29,280
who emerged in the hierarchy
of Mesopotamian gods and
came out at the top right?

39
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:30,840
He was the victor of the gods.

40
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,740
He had eyes all the way around his head
and he could speak magic words and I

41
00:01:34,741 --> 00:01:35,610
really liked that.

42
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,990
I really liked that idea.

43
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:39,450
And the Egyptians develop that
idea too because they're god.

44
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:40,680
Horus was the eye.

45
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,120
Everyone knows the eye of horus,

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,200
that that that image is so
compelling that we still know about.

47
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:50,970
Everybody has seen the eye of horus
with a really open pupil and what the

48
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:55,971
Egyptians learned was that the open I
was what revivified the dead's society.

49
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,540
That's so smart.

50
00:01:57,541 --> 00:01:59,400
So what do you do if
your life isn't in order?

51
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:00,211
Bloody well,

52
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:02,640
pay attention not isn't
the same as thinking.

53
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:03,870
It's a different process.

54
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,250
Paying attention thinking is like the
imposition of structure in some sense.

55
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,900
I know I'm over simplifying,

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,400
but paying attention to something like
watching for what you don't know and so

57
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,160
like one of the things that
I often recommend to my
clinical clients if they're

58
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,890
having trouble with a
family member is number one,

59
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,843
shut up.

60
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,040
Don't tell them anything about yourself.

61
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,990
Just and I don't mean in a rude way,

62
00:02:24,991 --> 00:02:27,360
it's just like no more
personal information.

63
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,373
Number two,

64
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,200
watch them like a hawk and listen.

65
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:32,940
And if you do that long enough,

66
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:36,480
they will tell you exactly what they're
up to and they will also tell you who

67
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:39,990
they think you are and then you'll
be shocked because they think you're

68
00:02:39,991 --> 00:02:41,290
something generally speaking,

69
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,280
that's not like what you are
at all and when they tell you,

70
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:46,080
it's like a revelation to both of you,

71
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,160
but attention is an unbelievably
powerful force and you see this in

72
00:02:50,161 --> 00:02:53,580
psychotherapy to because a lot of
what you do and in any repairative

73
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:56,640
relationship is really pay
attention to the other person.

74
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,750
Pay attention and listen and that would
not believe what people will tell you or

75
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:06,160
reveal to you if you watch them as if
you want to know instead of watching them

76
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,700
so that you'll have your
prejudices reinforced.

77
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,890
That's usually how people interact.

78
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:12,250
It's like,

79
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,760
I want to keep thinking about you the
way I'm thinking about you and so I'm

80
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:18,730
going to filter out anything
that disproves my theory.

81
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,380
That's not what I'm talking about at all.

82
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:23,410
It's like I'm going to watch you
and figure out what you're up to.

83
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:24,400
Not in a rude way.

84
00:03:24,401 --> 00:03:25,061
None of that.

85
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:30,061
I just want to see what's
there and that'll be good
for you probably and also be

86
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:31,294
good for me.

87
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,770
And so well,

88
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,420
so that's the idea that,

89
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:34,750
you know,

90
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,890
climbing up a hierarchy of authority
can give you vision and that vision can

91
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,900
transcend the actual hierarchy.

92
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,270
And I think that's also,

93
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:43,960
I think that's also the,

94
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:44,794
uh,

95
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,300
that's the metaphysical space that an
artist occupies because artists really

96
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:51,280
aren't in a hierarchy
there outside of higher.

97
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:51,730
He's,

98
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,080
you've watched the lion king,

99
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,003
most of you.

100
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,173
Yeah.

101
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,613
That's zoo,

102
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:57,490
you know the little bird,

103
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,950
that's the eye of the king
as the same thing there.

104
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,610
So,

105
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,031
and that's,

106
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,920
that's echoed in this idea as well.

107
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,023
So,

108
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:04,870
so,

109
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,081
well,

110
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:05,914
that's some more,

111
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,860
more ideas of hierarchy.

112
00:04:08,861 --> 00:04:09,521
Same idea.

113
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,440
This is right.

114
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,710
Gold,

115
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,001
silver,

116
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:13,570
bronze.

117
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:16,660
Why gold gold as the sun gold is pure,

118
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,380
right?

119
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,400
And so the idea is that the thing
that's at the top of the hierarchy is

120
00:04:21,401 --> 00:04:23,830
incorruptible because gold
doesn't mix with anything else,

121
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,011
right?

122
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,770
It's this sort of metal that
doesn't ever become corrupted.

123
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:27,610
It's a noble metal.

124
00:04:27,611 --> 00:04:28,780
It doesn't become corrupted.

125
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,800
And so it shines like the sun and it's
associated with whatsoever at the top of

126
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:34,750
the hierarchy and the goal,

127
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,820
the gold medal is a disc like the sun,

128
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:38,650
and it's awarded to those people who've,

129
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:43,510
who've occupied the top position and
who are manifestations of the ideal.

130
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,060
And here,

131
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,740
here's,

132
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,440
here's,

133
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,690
I'll tell you a quick story.

134
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,940
So imagine that you're
watching an Olympic contest.

135
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,560
I found this happens to me very often
with gymnastics because of a gymnast.

136
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,950
So absolutely unbelievable.

137
00:04:53,951 --> 00:04:54,520
You know,

138
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,031
so you go,

139
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:57,810
you watch a gymnastic performance and uh,

140
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,870
the person's out there
bouncing around like,

141
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:02,560
you know,

142
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,090
you can't even imagine doing it.

143
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:05,260
There are so perfect at it.

144
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:06,250
So you see this person,

145
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,420
they're going through this routine,

146
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:10,540
they're just absolutely
spectacular and flawless added.

147
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:10,940
You know,

148
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,680
at the end they stop and everybody claps
and they're all excited to see what a

149
00:05:14,681 --> 00:05:15,550
human being can do.

150
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:18,010
And that's why we're in the audience
watching because we want to see what a

151
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:18,850
human being can do.

152
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,830
And the judges go like nine point eight,

153
00:05:20,831 --> 00:05:21,550
nine point eight,

154
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,211
nine point eight.

155
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:22,991
Everybody's thrilled.

156
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,570
And then the next contestant
comes out and it's like,

157
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:25,841
well,

158
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,220
they're just basically screwed,

159
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:27,401
right?

160
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,500
It's like this person came
out there and was perfect.

161
00:05:29,501 --> 00:05:30,700
How are you going to top that?

162
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:35,940
That's an interesting question because
this is a representation of what you do

163
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:40,450
to top perfection itself
and you can do it.

164
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,470
And here's how you do it.

165
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:43,840
And you know this even though
you don't know you know it.

166
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,080
So let's say the next contestant comes
out and they're kind of shaky because

167
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,500
it's like,

168
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,191
oh man,

169
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,420
the bar has been raised high.

170
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,720
So what they do is they put themselves
right on the edge of chaos and you can

171
00:05:55,571 --> 00:06:00,140
tell by watching them that they are
one bloody fraction of a second from

172
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,123
catastrophe.

173
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,370
There are pushing themselves farther than
they've ever gone in the direction of

174
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:05,204
their perfection.

175
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,190
And everyone in the room is so tense,

176
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,180
they can hardly stand it,

177
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:08,361
right?

178
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,990
You could hear a pin drop and that person
is flipping around and they're just,

179
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,570
it's just right on the
edge of catastrophe.

180
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,140
And at the end they go like this,

181
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:16,700
you know?

182
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:20,150
And there's that gesture that the
triumph that goes along with that,

183
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,960
and everybody rises in one instance
and just collapse like mad.

184
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,291
It's like,

185
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:24,501
well,

186
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,041
why?

187
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,874
What are you doing?

188
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,470
What are you doing when you're doing that?

189
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,311
Right?

190
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:29,540
You can't even help it.

191
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:34,190
It grabs you right in the core of your
being and you stand up and it's an act of

192
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:34,760
worship.

193
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,481
That's what it is.

194
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:40,481
And you saw someone go beyond their
perfection into the domain of chaos and

195
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:44,900
establish order right in front of your
eyes and you're so thrilled about that.

196
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:48,620
You know you're happy to be alive and
everyone's celebrating it all at the same

197
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:49,430
time.

198
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,620
And it's an absolutely amazing thing.

199
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,870
And that's what.

200
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,090
Well,

201
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,710
sometimes that's what this represents.

202
00:06:54,711 --> 00:06:56,480
And sometimes that's what this represents.

203
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:59,750
And that's what we're trying to get at
that because that's at the pinnacle of

204
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:00,411
the hierarchy,

205
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:00,860
right?

206
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,200
Not only are you doing
what you should be doing,

207
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,830
but you're doing it in
a way that increases the
probability that you'll do it

208
00:07:06,831 --> 00:07:08,240
better the next time you do it.

209
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:09,770
And then you could say,

210
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,560
here's another thing to think
about along the same lines,

211
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:14,810
and I know we haven't
gotten to Adam and eve.

212
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,653
Yes,

213
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,870
you tell your kids to play fair,

214
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:21,591
right?

215
00:07:21,591 --> 00:07:22,480
You say it's not him.

216
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,720
It's not whether or not you win.

217
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:24,710
It's how you play the game.

218
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,470
And you say that you don't
really know what you mean.

219
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:30,380
You feel kind of stupid saying it even
though you know it's true and your kid

220
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:32,660
looks at you like there's something wrong
with you because he doesn't know what

221
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:33,770
you're talking about either,

222
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,060
but you know it's true.

223
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,130
And so here's why it's true.

224
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:41,000
Life isn't a game.

225
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:43,010
It's a set of games.

226
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:48,230
And the rule is never sacrificed victory
across the set of games for victory in

227
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,064
one game.

228
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,390
Right?

229
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:52,670
And that's what it means to play properly.

230
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,720
You want to play so that
people keep inviting you to
play because that's how you

231
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:57,554
win,

232
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:57,950
right?

233
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:02,180
You win by being invited to play
the largest possible array of games.

234
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,510
And the way you do that is by manifesting
the fact that you can play in a

235
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,700
reciprocal manner every time you play.

236
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,330
Even if there's victory at stake and
that's what makes you successful across

237
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,180
time and we all know that and
we even tell our kids that,

238
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:16,400
but we don't know that we know it.

239
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,540
And so we're not adapting ourselves
to the game and victory in the game.

240
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,380
We're adapting ourselves to the metagame
and victory across the set of all

241
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,280
possible games.

242
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:26,810
And that's what that.

243
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,111
Well,

244
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:28,280
that's exactly what,

245
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,241
as far as I can tell,

246
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,250
that's exactly what this
is aiming at to that.

247
00:08:31,251 --> 00:08:33,110
That's the same idea that there's,

248
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,490
that there's a transit,

249
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:38,530
there's a mode of being that
transcends the particularities of this,

250
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,280
of the localized contest.

251
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:41,600
That's the other way to think about it.

252
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:46,601
And to act morally is not to win today's
contest at the expense of the rest of

253
00:08:47,751 --> 00:08:49,340
possible contests.

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,451
And again,

255
00:08:50,451 --> 00:08:52,160
I don't see that as
something that's arbitrary.

256
00:08:52,161 --> 00:08:53,660
It's not relativistic.

257
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,600
There's an absolute moral is
an absolute moral stance there.

258
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,160
And everyone recognizes it.

259
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:00,283
And,

260
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,640
and I also think it's the key to success.

261
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,880
And I would also say it's very
much akin in a strange way,

262
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:06,511
like the,

263
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:06,650
uh,

264
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,110
the,

265
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,090
the person who is the master at being
invited to play the largest possible

266
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:12,870
games,

267
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,620
number of games is also the same
person I haven't quite figured out.

268
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,450
The precise relationship between these
two is also the same person that goes out

269
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:26,451
forthrightly to conquer the unknown
before it presents itself as the enemy at

270
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,270
the door.

271
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,590
They're the same thing.

272
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,340
Now I don't,

273
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,210
I can't have him figured.

274
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,740
Well why that is exactly.

275
00:09:31,741 --> 00:09:32,400
But,

276
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,590
but well,

277
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,640
I'll figure it out eventually.

278
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:35,191
And when I do,

279
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,280
I'll tell you if you're interested.

280
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,690
So okay.

281
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:41,970
So here's some other no ideas of,

282
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,390
of,

283
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,350
of God as,

284
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,040
as,

285
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,140
as hierarchical authority figures.

286
00:09:46,141 --> 00:09:50,520
So strip the religious preconceptions off
what you observe and just look at what

287
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:50,971
you see.

288
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:51,680
Well look,

289
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,680
there's primate looking upward at
dominant figure that that's what you see

290
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:57,271
there.

291
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:57,720
Now,

292
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,350
if it's very interestingly symbolically
represented because you have God the

293
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,610
father there with the cross.

294
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,010
And I think what that
means as far as I can tell,

295
00:10:05,011 --> 00:10:08,760
is that there's a recognition there in
the image that the person who's most

296
00:10:08,761 --> 00:10:12,240
dominant is the one who's or
the most has the most authority,

297
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,840
is the one who's voluntarily
accepted the suffering.

298
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,710
That's part of being.

299
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,780
And that's what that picture represents.

300
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:23,830
It's like the authority holds that says
this is what you have to accept and

301
00:10:23,851 --> 00:10:24,031
that,

302
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:24,510
that,

303
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:24,980
that,

304
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:28,110
that trend fix the viewer because of the.

305
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,490
Because of the fact that it's true.

306
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:29,851
And you think,

307
00:10:29,851 --> 00:10:30,001
well,

308
00:10:30,001 --> 00:10:30,601
is that true?

309
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:30,841
Okay,

310
00:10:30,841 --> 00:10:32,340
well think about it this way.

311
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:34,510
Do you like brave people are cowards?

312
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:35,251
Well,

313
00:10:35,251 --> 00:10:35,431
that,

314
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,690
that's pretty straightforward.

315
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:38,700
And what's the ultimate act of bravery?

316
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,840
It's to come to terms with the fact
that you're mortal unlimited and to live

317
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:44,910
forthrightly regardless.

318
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:45,301
Well,

319
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:49,920
obviously that's at the core of what's
of what's admirable and why would we

320
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,660
presume that that's not the case.

321
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,400
We act as if that's the case.

322
00:10:53,401 --> 00:10:55,890
It's what everyone dreams
and wishes that they could.

323
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,933
They could do.

324
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,570
I mean,

325
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,210
assuming that you know,

326
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,680
you've dispensed with the idea
that you're going to be a mortal.

327
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,030
I suppose that might be worth wishing
for two or or perhaps not immortal is a

328
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:07,080
very long time,

329
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,110
but you certainly want
this and that image says,

330
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:12,540
well this is what you
should be and you know,

331
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:16,740
we've got that same opening into the
sky going on in that image that I showed

332
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:17,191
you before.

333
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:20,820
It's like this is a transcendent truth
that constantly read manifests itself

334
00:11:20,821 --> 00:11:25,470
across time and space and young would
say it's built into your psyche that

335
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:26,100
image.

336
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,581
Now you know,

337
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:29,310
there are elements of it that
are culturally constructed.

338
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:31,920
It wouldn't necessarily
have to be the cross,

339
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,870
although the cross is a very old symbol.

340
00:11:33,871 --> 00:11:36,020
It's far older than than it's used in,

341
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:37,950
in Christianity and
it's been used in many,

342
00:11:37,951 --> 00:11:40,770
many religious representations,

343
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:44,100
but that Echo is the
sole echoes with that,

344
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,750
you know,

345
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:45,583
and

346
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:47,540
well,

347
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,560
and then there's Moses up there on the,

348
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,890
on the mountain receiving the,

349
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:52,950
the,

350
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:53,370
the,

351
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,590
the law and so we'll talk a lot more
about that when we get the exodus.

352
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,320
But if.

353
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:01,700
Yeah,

354
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,050
yeah,

355
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,883
yeah.

356
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,110
If we get to exodus,

357
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,040
so.

358
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,730
Well look,

359
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,660
where does it happen?

360
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,740
Well,

361
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,573
on a mountain,

362
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,110
well that's a pyramid.

363
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:11,890
That's op,

364
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,221
right?

365
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:13,180
That's optics up.

366
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:13,440
It's,

367
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,650
it's up in the stratosphere,

368
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:15,790
it's up in the sky where,

369
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,500
where you'll look upward.

370
00:12:17,501 --> 00:12:18,270
Okay,

371
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:20,020
and then so what's happening to Moses?

372
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:20,171
Well,

373
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:20,411
here,

374
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:23,080
here's a bit of a clue
as far as I can tell.

375
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:26,590
I figured this out partly again by
reading jumped piaget because one of the

376
00:12:26,591 --> 00:12:30,520
things that Piaget said about kids was
that they first learned to play a game,

377
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,840
but they don't know what the rules are.

378
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:34,870
Meaning that if you have
a bunch of kids together,

379
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,860
they can play a game.

380
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,290
But if you take one of the kids
out of the game when they're young,

381
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,380
say six and you say what the rules are,

382
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,260
what are the rules?

383
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,510
They can only sort of
give you a representation.

384
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,230
So you take 60 year old one and he'll
tell you some of the rules and six year

385
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:48,760
old to will tell you different rules.

386
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,330
And,

387
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,020
and you know,

388
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,910
six year old three will
tell you different rules,

389
00:12:51,911 --> 00:12:53,770
but if you put them all
together they can play.

390
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:59,110
So they have the knowledge embodied
either individually or in the group.

391
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,420
The knowledge is there to be extracted,

392
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,710
well then they get a little older,

393
00:13:02,711 --> 00:13:07,380
they can extract the rules and then they
started to play by the rules and then

394
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,800
Piaget's last step was,

395
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:09,191
well,

396
00:13:09,191 --> 00:13:12,070
it doesn't just the kids play by the
rules is that they learned that they can

397
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:15,040
make the rules and he thought
about that as moral progression.

398
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,090
First you can play,

399
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,410
then you can play by the rules.

400
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:20,380
Then you learn maybe because he
didn't think everyone learned this,

401
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
that you're actually
the master of the rules.

402
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:24,370
That doesn't mean the rules are arbitrary,

403
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,370
but it means that you can be
the generator of the roof.

404
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,150
That's assuming that you knew how to play
the game and he thought about that as

405
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:33,700
a moral moral progression
and then I thought,

406
00:13:33,701 --> 00:13:37,270
well that's exactly what happened to Moses
and the story of exodus because Moses

407
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:41,710
is out there leading all those Israelites
around and like they don't have a law.

408
00:13:41,711 --> 00:13:42,850
They don't have a law giver.

409
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,270
They have a tradition and
they're all like crabby because,

410
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,530
well they're in the desert.

411
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,060
It's like they're in a tyranny,

412
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:50,350
but now they're in a desert.

413
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:51,920
It's like that's no improvement,

414
00:13:51,921 --> 00:13:52,380
so they're,

415
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:55,480
they're really getting pretty bitchy
about it and so they're worshiping false

416
00:13:55,481 --> 00:14:00,480
idols and having one catastrophe after
another and they get Moses to judge their

417
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,310
conflicts and so he does that for God
only knows how long forever crabby

418
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,500
Israelites come to
Moses and bitch at them.

419
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:08,801
It's like,

420
00:14:08,801 --> 00:14:09,011
wow,

421
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:09,761
he did this,

422
00:14:09,761 --> 00:14:14,761
and she did that and and so then he has
to figure out how to make peace and he

423
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:16,780
does that so long that one of his,

424
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:17,920
I think it's his father in law,

425
00:14:17,921 --> 00:14:20,680
tells him he has to stop doing it
because he's going to exhaust himself.

426
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,101
Well.

427
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:21,521
Then you think,

428
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:21,641
well,

429
00:14:21,641 --> 00:14:22,474
what's happening?

430
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,943
Well,

431
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,750
and I'm not assuming that this is
a like a literal historical story.

432
00:14:28,751 --> 00:14:29,291
I think again,

433
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:31,150
it's a condensation well,

434
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,190
any group has a set of customers
just like a wolf pack does,

435
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:40,330
and so then the customers are being
manifest in someone who's a genius is

436
00:14:40,331 --> 00:14:41,230
watching and thinking,

437
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:41,561
okay,

438
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:44,350
well what's the rule in this situation?

439
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:45,760
What's the rule of this situation?

440
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,110
What's the rule in this situation?

441
00:14:47,111 --> 00:14:49,030
And then in his imagination,

442
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:52,910
the rules turn into a hierarchy and then
he goes up on the mountain and he goes

443
00:14:52,911 --> 00:14:54,080
back and he thinks,

444
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,010
oh my God,

445
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,860
here's the rules that we've
been living by all this time.

446
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,320
And that's the revelation
of the commandments.

447
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:00,881
Well,

448
00:15:00,881 --> 00:15:01,221
and you think,

449
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:01,341
well,

450
00:15:01,341 --> 00:15:02,171
how else could it be?

451
00:15:02,171 --> 00:15:05,060
I think the rules came first
and obeying them came second.

452
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,880
So I know the rules come first,

453
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,260
sorry.

454
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,610
The actions come first.

455
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:10,710
The,

456
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:14,720
the obeying them comes first and then
you figure out what everybody's up to and

457
00:15:14,721 --> 00:15:14,931
you say,

458
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:15,321
hey look,

459
00:15:15,321 --> 00:15:16,670
this is what you've been up to all along.

460
00:15:16,671 --> 00:15:17,480
And everybody goes,

461
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,313
Oh yeah,

462
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,730
that seems to make sense.

463
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,721
And if it didn't,

464
00:15:20,721 --> 00:15:22,040
who would follow them?

465
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,720
No one was going to follow them.

466
00:15:23,721 --> 00:15:25,760
If they don't match what's already there,

467
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,710
you just think about that as unjust.

468
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,783
And so that's,

469
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,020
that's portrayed here as
a cataclysmic human event.

470
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:33,620
It's like,

471
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,550
Oh my God,

472
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:38,000
we've been chimpanzees and we've been
in this hierarchy of authority for so

473
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:38,241
long.

474
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:39,530
We have no idea what we were doing.

475
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:40,483
And all of a sudden,

476
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,533
poof.

477
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,660
It burst into revelatory consciousness.

478
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:45,320
And we could say,

479
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,090
here is the law,

480
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:47,811
and you say,

481
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:47,991
well,

482
00:15:47,991 --> 00:15:49,310
is it given by God?

483
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:50,120
Well,

484
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,600
hey,

485
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,190
it depends on what you mean by God.

486
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,930
We could start with that presupposition,

487
00:15:53,931 --> 00:15:55,940
but it's not like it
just came out of nowhere.

488
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:56,720
It took,

489
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,270
and this is something else Nicha observed.

490
00:15:59,271 --> 00:16:00,170
So interestingly,

491
00:16:00,171 --> 00:16:00,801
and he said,

492
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:05,801
you know that a moral revelation was
the consequence of a tremendously long

493
00:16:06,471 --> 00:16:11,471
process of initial construction and then
formulation thousands and thousands and

494
00:16:12,381 --> 00:16:17,381
thousands and thousands of years of custom
of building custom before you get the

495
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:20,600
revelation of the articulated law.

496
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,870
And that's a description of the
pattern that works and let's say,

497
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:24,021
well,

498
00:16:24,021 --> 00:16:25,400
what's the pattern that works?

499
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:30,320
It's the game that you can play with
everybody else day after day with no

500
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:31,400
degeneration.

501
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,270
And that's another thing piaget figured
out that so brilliant and that's his

502
00:16:35,271 --> 00:16:36,800
idea of the equilibrated state.

503
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,190
It's,

504
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,110
it's an extension of a manual counts idea
about the universal maximum right act

505
00:16:42,111 --> 00:16:45,680
in a way so that each action
could become a universal rule.

506
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,430
That was con,

507
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,760
fundamental moral maximun
piaget put a twist on that.

508
00:16:49,761 --> 00:16:50,031
He said,

509
00:16:50,031 --> 00:16:50,181
no,

510
00:16:50,181 --> 00:16:50,730
no,

511
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,770
that's not exactly yet.

512
00:16:51,771 --> 00:16:56,771
It's act in such a way that it works
for you now and next week and next month

513
00:16:57,711 --> 00:17:00,860
and next year and 10 years
from now and so that,

514
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:01,071
well,

515
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:02,060
it's working for you.

516
00:17:02,061 --> 00:17:06,250
It's also working for the people around
you and for the broader society and,

517
00:17:06,251 --> 00:17:06,551
and,

518
00:17:06,551 --> 00:17:08,480
and that's the equilla braided state,

519
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:12,380
and you could think about that as an
intimation of the Kingdom of the city,

520
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:13,250
of God on earth.

521
00:17:13,251 --> 00:17:16,880
It's something like that and it's based
on this idea that a morality has to be

522
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:18,350
iterable and you know,

523
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:19,184
there's lots of,

524
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,740
there's been lots of
simulations online already,

525
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:22,820
artificial intelligence,

526
00:17:22,821 --> 00:17:24,860
simulations of trading games,

527
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:25,520
right?

528
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,030
I mean,

529
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:29,650
the people who've been studying the
emergence of moral behavior say an

530
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:33,290
artificial intelligent systems
have already caught onto
the idea that one of the

531
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:37,070
crucial elements to the analysis
of morality is interability.

532
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,770
You can't play a
degenerating game because.

533
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,260
Because it degenerates,

534
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,020
like obviously you want to
play a game that had leased,

535
00:17:45,021 --> 00:17:46,850
remained stable across time,

536
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,541
and God,

537
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,100
if you could really get your act together,

538
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,600
maybe it would slowly get better.

539
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,700
And of course that's what
you'd hope for your family.

540
00:17:53,701 --> 00:17:54,300
Right?

541
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,190
That's what you're always
trying to do and less,

542
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:59,190
you're completely hell bent
on revenge and destruction.

543
00:17:59,191 --> 00:17:59,880
It's like,

544
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,030
is there a way that we can continue to
play together that will make playing

545
00:18:03,031 --> 00:18:04,680
together even better the next day.

546
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,490
But I will say something about it,

547
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,780
you know,

548
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,040
and I thought about this a lot,

549
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,360
so there is evidence that Ashkenazi Jews,

550
00:18:12,361 --> 00:18:14,290
so those are Jews of European heritage,

551
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,980
have iqs that are about 15 points
higher than the population average.

552
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,570
So that's a lot 15 points.

553
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:22,570
It's about the average difference between
the typical high school student and

554
00:18:22,571 --> 00:18:24,100
the typical state college student.

555
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,113
It's a lot.

556
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:27,250
And one of the things that means is,

557
00:18:27,251 --> 00:18:30,820
so imagine there's two distributions and
that they overlap and that the Jewish

558
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:31,654
one is,

559
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,523
uh,

560
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:35,950
is the mean is 1:15.

561
00:18:35,951 --> 00:18:38,440
So the whole distribution
has shifted to the right.

562
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:41,890
What that means is that if you
go up into the Higher Iq strata,

563
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,791
1:30,

564
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,800
1:45 way the hell up there,

565
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:49,090
that Jewish people are overwhelmingly
overrepresented at the high end of the ICU

566
00:18:49,091 --> 00:18:49,924
distribution.

567
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,220
Now the price they pay for that is some
increased propensity for neurological

568
00:18:54,221 --> 00:18:57,940
diseases that seems to be associated
in some sense with that heightened Iq.

569
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:58,810
Now,

570
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,051
you know,

571
00:18:59,051 --> 00:19:00,780
the science on this isn't settled but,

572
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:01,810
but it,

573
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,420
it's reasonably solid,

574
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,173
you know,

575
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,810
given the standards of such things.

576
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:08,321
Okay,

577
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:13,270
so Jews are going to be our over
represented at the high end of cognitively

578
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:14,530
complex disciplines.

579
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:15,880
So then I would say,

580
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,200
and that's the case,

581
00:19:17,201 --> 00:19:20,890
like they're way overrepresented among
like outstanding scientists and among

582
00:19:20,891 --> 00:19:23,170
Nobel Prize winners and and so forth.

583
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,750
And so you know,

584
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,840
people look and they think,

585
00:19:25,841 --> 00:19:30,100
well why are there a disproportionate
number of Jewish people in positions of

586
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:30,491
authority?

587
00:19:30,491 --> 00:19:30,791
And they say,

588
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:31,001
well,

589
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:32,560
it must be a conspiracy.

590
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,460
You know,

591
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,590
it must be systemic in some sense.

592
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:35,891
It's like,

593
00:19:35,891 --> 00:19:36,490
no,

594
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,690
it can be simply accounted for by that
relatively large ICU differential.

595
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,150
Now the next criticism would be,

596
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:43,870
well,

597
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,060
don't the Jews tend to lean left?

598
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:47,410
Well first you might say,

599
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:47,980
well,

600
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:48,280
you know,

601
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:53,260
given what happened in Nazi Germany to
the degree that that was right wing as we

602
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:54,100
discussed earlier,

603
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:56,050
that's the nationalism and ethnocentrism.

604
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,360
It's hardly surprising that they might,

605
00:19:58,710 --> 00:19:59,021
you know,

606
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:02,710
in this historical period of time
tend to move towards the left,

607
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,300
but more importantly than that,

608
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,060
Iq is associated with trait,

609
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,650
openness and trade.

610
00:20:08,651 --> 00:20:12,190
Openness is a strong predictor
predictor of political liberalism.

611
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,563
So,

612
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:16,150
and it's the strongest predictor
of political liberalism.

613
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,200
So,

614
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,033
you know,

615
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:19,840
it's very difficult.

616
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,550
So that's what I have to say about that.

617
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,230
It's like in the other
thing I would say is,

618
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,400
you know,

619
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,290
the fact that there's a population as
sub population of people who are much

620
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,490
smarter than average,

621
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,600
not on average,

622
00:20:31,601 --> 00:20:32,080
right?

623
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,870
On average,

624
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:37,270
I've got to get that straight on average
is actually of great benefit to the

625
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:40,390
rest of us because why do
you want fewer geniuses?

626
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,290
Fewer people with Iq of 145 or 160.

627
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,090
That's and you know,

628
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:49,840
and it's no conspiracy that
puts people who are smarter,

629
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:53,680
higher up in competence hierarchies
because I accused the best predictor of

630
00:20:53,681 --> 00:20:56,740
movement up in a complex
con competence hierarchy.

631
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,120
So there,

632
00:20:58,121 --> 00:20:59,680
I've addressed the Jewish question.

633
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:04,830
It's like it's a confusion between
ethnicity and and ICU as far as I'm

634
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:05,620
concerned.

635
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,940
So I'll probably get like painted six
different shades of black for that answer,

636
00:21:09,941 --> 00:21:10,810
but it's.

637
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,160
I've thought about a long time.

638
00:21:12,161 --> 00:21:13,900
It's the best that I can manage.
