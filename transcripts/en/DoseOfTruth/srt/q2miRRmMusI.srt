1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:08,880
Richard Boyle says,

2
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,241
hi,

3
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:09,961
Dr. Peterson,

4
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:14,550
how does this score of 91 for compassion
and one for politeness equals a score

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:16,080
of 35 for agreeableness?

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:16,860
Yeah.

7
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:20,820
While it's because 91 and
one aren't ordinary numbers,

8
00:00:20,821 --> 00:00:24,390
their percentiles and you
can't just average percentiles,

9
00:00:24,391 --> 00:00:25,470
it doesn't work that way.

10
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,360
What it says is that

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,431
at sea,

12
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:33,210
I don't know if I can generate at just a
description on the fly because I'm not,

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,450
I wouldn't say I'm particularly
mathematically gifted,

14
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:38,910
although I know that the answer
I just gave you is correct.

15
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:40,463
Let's see,

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,900
there's a one in,

17
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,830
there's a one in 10 chance that a person
would be that compassionate and a one

18
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:49,920
and 100% chance that a
person would be that,

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:51,143
that,

20
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,010
that uh,

21
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:53,640
nope,

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,990
I can't generate it on the fly,

23
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,100
but that's the answer.

24
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:59,820
So if you want to point
to the proper literature,

25
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:00,780
you'd look up,

26
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,423
uh,

27
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:04,463
uh,

28
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,710
how to transform
percentiles into z scores.

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,360
They're called z scores,

30
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:10,523
then you can,

31
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:11,370
if you,

32
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:11,491
oh,

33
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:12,324
that's how it works.

34
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,760
You convert the percentiles
in disease scores,

35
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,600
you some the z scores and then you
reconvert them into percentiles.

36
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:23,601
And so if you take the z score for not
for compassion 91 and the z score for

37
00:01:23,611 --> 00:01:24,630
politeness one,

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:25,830
add them,

39
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,230
divide them into and reconvert
them to a percentile,

40
00:01:28,231 --> 00:01:29,490
you'll get 35 I know.

41
00:01:29,491 --> 00:01:29,941
It's weird,

42
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,300
but that's,

43
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,170
that's how it,

44
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,700
that's how it is.

45
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,560
That's how it's done.
