Atomic carlos says,

2
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:11,670
my Iq is north of one 30 yet I questioned
my own intelligence all the time.

3
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:15,750
I feel big cognitive dissonance between
what people expect of me and what I

4
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:17,820
considered myself capable to do.

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:18,863
Well,

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,130
you know Carlos would,

7
00:00:20,131 --> 00:00:22,050
I would recommend there is that if,

8
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:23,220
if you haven't done it,

9
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:27,390
just go do the personality test and
understand myself.com because what you're

10
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:32,391
describing sounds very much like high
levels of negative emotionality or

11
00:00:32,641 --> 00:00:33,474
neuroticism.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,640
And you might want to find
out if that's the case,

13
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:39,630
because if you're much higher
than average in neuroticism,

14
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,240
then you're going to be
questioning yourself all the time.

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,740
And you might want to figure out if that's
actually a trait and if it is a trait

16
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,600
while then that gives
you an explanation of it.

17
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:53,601
And then you might also know that your
levels of negative emotion are not well

18
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:55,770
matched to your likely scale.

19
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,580
Now that doesn't necessarily
help you learn to cope with it,

20
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:04,020
but sometimes identifying the reason it's
useful and there's another possibility

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,020
too is that your mood is dysregulated
and that you're depressed.

22
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,940
So that's another thing to consider.

23
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:10,283
Um,

24
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,393
if you,

25
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,880
if you do find that you have high
levels of neuroticism but you're not

26
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,391
depressed,

27
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:18,960
then one of the things you might
do is write down all the reasons,

28
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:20,370
like really think them out.

29
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,090
You know what I mean?

30
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,860
Really get serious about this.

31
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,940
Write down all the reasons why you
might give yourself more credit for

32
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,500
intelligence than you have.

33
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:33,780
And part of that could be like a really
deep reconsideration of successes you've

34
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:37,020
had in the past with
complex intellectual issues.

35
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,920
Um,

36
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,730
because imagine that you are serving as
your own defense attorney against a very

37
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:45,410
critical part of your
mind that can help locked,

38
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,320
that can help.
