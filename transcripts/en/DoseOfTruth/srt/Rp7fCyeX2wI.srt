1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:11,840
And the Midianites sold Joseph
into Egypt unto Potiphar,

2
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:14,060
an officer of Pharaohs
and captain of the guard.

3
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:16,580
And Joseph was brought
down to Egypt and Potiphar,

4
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:17,540
an officer of Pharaoh,

5
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:18,470
captain of the guard,

6
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:21,440
and Egyptian bought him of
the hands of the Ishmaelites,

7
00:00:21,441 --> 00:00:22,280
which had brought him down.

8
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:24,740
Thither so now he's a slave.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,380
So now you'd think,

10
00:00:27,381 --> 00:00:27,531
well,

11
00:00:27,531 --> 00:00:28,364
that would be,

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,760
this is a man who has a lot of reason
to be irritated at the structure of

13
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:34,441
reality,

14
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:34,681
right?

15
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:38,610
He's gone from being the favorite to
being betrayed by all of his brothers.

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,630
That's pretty rough.

17
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:43,500
And then he's being transformed
into a slave and now he's being,

18
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,900
he's being sold to work as a slave.

19
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:49,610
So you'd think that that would corrupt
his character because you know,

20
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,331
one of the things,

21
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:51,890
I think this is the case anyways,

22
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,070
I think people are always looking
for an excuse to have their character

23
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:55,904
corrupted.

24
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,650
Because if your character is corrupted,

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,620
then you get to lie and you get to cheat
and you get to steal and you get to be

26
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:03,440
trade and you get to act resentfully
and he get to do nothing.

27
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,730
And that's all easy.

28
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,680
It's easier to lie than to tell the truth.

29
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:08,600
It's easier to do nothing
than to do something.

30
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,580
So there's always part of you thinking,

31
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,181
well,

32
00:01:11,181 --> 00:01:14,980
I need a justification for being
useless and horrible because that,

33
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,310
that'd be a lot less work.

34
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,720
And so then if something
terrible comes along,

35
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,141
you think,

36
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:21,830
Aha,

37
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,890
that's just exactly the
excuse that I was waiting for.

38
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,840
And then out all of outcomes,

39
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:28,691
you know,

40
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:32,440
a soldier Dimson when he was in
the concentration camps in Russia,

41
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,360
watching how people behaved,

42
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:35,321
you know,

43
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:38,860
he said that there were people that were
put into camps who immediately became

44
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:39,431
trustees,

45
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:40,061
are guards,

46
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:43,490
and they were even more vicious than
the people who had been hired as guards.

47
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:47,210
And his idea was that they
had collected all that,

48
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:50,360
he called it fallenness,

49
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,960
if I remember correctly,

50
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,240
around them in normal life.

51
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,000
But they didn't have the
opportunity to express it.

52
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,800
But as soon as you gave
them the opportunity,

53
00:01:58,801 --> 00:01:59,431
it was like there,

54
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:00,450
it was right away.

55
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,284
And so,

56
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:02,620
yeah.

57
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,620
So one of the messages that seems to echo
through these old testament stories is

58
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:12,940
that just because something
terrible happens to you
doesn't mean that you get to

59
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,774
be,

60
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,180
that you get to wander off the
path and make things worse.

61
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,680
And maybe it doesn't matter how
terrible it is that what happens to you.

62
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,760
That's a tough call,

63
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:25,001
you know,

64
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:28,720
because you see people now and then in
life who they've really got it rough man,

65
00:02:28,721 --> 00:02:31,870
like 50 bad things are happening to
them at the same time and you think,

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,201
oh,

67
00:02:32,201 --> 00:02:35,350
it's no wonder if you are bitter and
resentful and hostile and be like,

68
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,340
yeah,

69
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:37,060
no wonder.

70
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,940
But then you meet people and social
needs and again talked about this in the

71
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:40,810
Gulag archipelago.

72
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:43,300
He said he met lots of
people in the not lot.

73
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,250
He met enough people to impress him in
the concentration camp system who didn't

74
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,230
allow their misfortunes to corrupt them.

75
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:52,410
And that's something man,

76
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:55,680
because maybe the only real
misfortune is to become corrupted.

77
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:58,440
That's a really useful thing to think.

78
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:58,891
You know,

79
00:02:58,891 --> 00:02:59,910
maybe the rest of it,

80
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,080
maybe the rest of it is
trivial in comparison.

81
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:06,770
I know that's a rough thing because
you can be in very harsh circumstances,

82
00:03:06,771 --> 00:03:08,900
but I do think there's something to that.
