1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,760
So
Jacob and Esau are,

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,490
are hostile brothers there.
They're like Cain and Abel except the

3
00:00:15,491 --> 00:00:17,310
mixture of Cain and Abel.
And they're very different.

4
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:21,720
Esau was red and covered with hair.
He was a hunter and a man of the field.

5
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,550
So he's like your basic joc,
right?

6
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:25,020
He's extroverted,
he's outgoing,

7
00:00:25,021 --> 00:00:28,380
he's really tough.
He's extraordinarily masculine,

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,230
he hunts and he's a real favorite of his
father.

9
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,610
And so,
and,

10
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:37,150
and Jacob isn't,
he's a dweller intense and um,

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:37,951
yeah,
right,

12
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,630
exactly.
Exactly.

13
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:42,870
Exactly right.
And it says Isaac loved Esau,

14
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:45,540
but Rebecca loved Jacob.
Now that's a problem,

15
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:46,950
right?
That that's a big problem.

16
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,660
And that there's a Friday in element to
this.

17
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:52,770
It's like this family is now divided
because one child is the favorite of the

18
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:56,250
mother and that's Jacob.
And one child is the favorite of the

19
00:00:56,251 --> 00:00:59,370
father.
And so Jacob is kind of a mother's boy,

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,460
I guess to use an arc or rather archaic
phrase and certainly not as admirable

21
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:09,390
from his father's perspective as Esau,
who a tough guy who goes out with a bow

22
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:10,710
and Arrow and like,
you know,

23
00:01:10,711 --> 00:01:13,180
wanders around in the plains and brings
animals home.

24
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,880
And,
and he's tough.

25
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,190
He's a tough guy.
So,

26
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,390
and,
but,

27
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:23,130
but there's this discord in the family
because one parent prefers one child and

28
00:01:23,131 --> 00:01:26,760
the other parent prefers the other.
And it's obvious from the story that the

29
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:30,210
parents do not communicate about this
because they really take sides.

30
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:34,680
And so there's a split in the family and
that's I think very realistic because

31
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,350
one of the things that you do learn if
you have a family,

32
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:40,290
and of course most of you do,
but if you also think about families is

33
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,890
that there's,
there's deep divisions within families

34
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:46,050
very,
very frequently that no one will ever

35
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:49,920
talk about and,
or even think about often because it's

36
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:51,640
too painful to think about,
you know,

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,980
Freud himself said Freud was clearly his
mother's favorite and the family

38
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:59,040
sacrificed a lot,
including some of the potential

39
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:02,640
ambitions of the other children in order
to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a

40
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:05,010
pedestal and,
and advanced is education.

41
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,030
And it worked.
I mean,

42
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:06,450
you know,
he,

43
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,070
he,
he turned into a great man,

44
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:11,700
but there was a cost to his siblings and
Freud himself said that there was

45
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:16,701
something about being the favorite of
the mother that gave a person additional

46
00:02:17,731 --> 00:02:20,490
confidence throughout their life.
And you know,

47
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:22,650
there's,
there's something to be said about that

48
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,480
is when someone like Eric Erikson,
you know,

49
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,150
he noted that very interested in child
development,

50
00:02:27,151 --> 00:02:29,880
that that first bonding with the mother
was the,

51
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,310
was it the place where trust was
established,

52
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:35,550
maybe trust even in the goodness of
existence was established.

53
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:39,920
And so anyways,
Jacob is Rachel's favorite and uh,

54
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:41,740
yeah,

55
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,090
Esau is Isaac's favorite.
Yeah.

56
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,280
Okay.

57
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,280
Now eso being extroverted let's say is
also a bit impulsive and maybe he's not,

58
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,580
he's a man of action.
He's not a forward thinker,

59
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,260
but he's also doing hard work.
And so,

60
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:01,090
you know,
he goes out and he's hunting and he's

61
00:03:01,091 --> 00:03:04,330
worn out and he comes home and he's
faint with hunger.

62
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,630
And
Jacob is at home,

63
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:09,430
cooking is boiling up,
lentils,

64
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:11,540
red lentils,
and you know,

65
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:14,920
Esau comes in from the haunt and eats
like half starved to death.

66
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:19,921
And he's sitting there and the aroma of
these red lentils reaches them and he's

67
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,060
exhausted.
And,

68
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,980
and,
and he tells Jacob that he wants some of

69
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,960
this stew and Jacob who's being a pain
in the neck,

70
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,720
fundamentally,
they have basically says,

71
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:35,441
no,
there's a,

72
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,290
there's a teasing thing going on here
and,

73
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,650
and won't give him any.
And,

74
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,140
and,
and there's,

75
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,620
you have to imagine this because it's
not laid out explicitly in the story,

76
00:03:44,621 --> 00:03:49,621
but there's some dispute about whether
Esau gets to have lunch.

77
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,490
And Jacob finally says,
well,

78
00:03:51,491 --> 00:03:53,860
I'll give you some,
but you have to s you have to give me

79
00:03:53,861 --> 00:03:57,060
your birthright.
And you saw,

80
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,200
you think he might say something like,
you know,

81
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,090
well,
to hell with it,

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,290
take it,
you know,

83
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,270
you son of a bitch,
take it.

84
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,330
Just give me some damn stew.
It's something like that.

85
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,250
So that's what happens.
But you know,

86
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:11,980
with these archaic people,
once he made a statement like that,

87
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:12,880
that was,
you were done.

88
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,890
That was it.
And so,

89
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,000
um,
east south sells his birthright and this

90
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:24,001
turns out to be incredibly significant.
Benson who wrote Biblical commentary

91
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:26,140
said,
Oh,

92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,120
there's a bit of a twist to it.
So Esau eats the,

93
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,680
the red lentils and then from then on,
his name is red.

94
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,440
And you've got to use your imagination a
bit.

95
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,750
I mean,
people are making fun of him,

96
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:38,020
right?

97
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,550
That's why they're calling them red.
I mean,

98
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,920
he's already read because we established
that,

99
00:04:41,921 --> 00:04:43,720
but no one was calling him read before
this.

100
00:04:43,721 --> 00:04:46,510
And so for the rest of his life,
you know,

101
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:49,030
every time he goes out amongst his
friends and family,

102
00:04:49,031 --> 00:04:51,520
they call them red and sort of snicker
because he's the,

103
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:53,770
you know,
half famished idiot who sold his

104
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,470
birthright for a bowl of lentils.
And so it's,

105
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:59,410
it's not,
it's not that funny actually.

106
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,140
And so Esau is not happy about this.
And,

107
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,600
and it actually turns out that this,
so what does it mean?

108
00:05:04,601 --> 00:05:08,350
It means don't sell the future for the
desires of the present and don't be

109
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,620
casual about what you have.
And then there's an archetype element to

110
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:13,330
this too.
And Benson says,

111
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,970
various have been the opinions what this
birthright was,

112
00:05:15,971 --> 00:05:19,840
which Esau sold.
But the most probable is that together

113
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,560
with the right of sacrificing,
so determining what should be sacrificed

114
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,080
and win and being the priest of the
family,

115
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,220
it included the peculiar blessing
promised to the seed of Abraham,

116
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,570
that of being the progenitor of the
Messiah and the error of the special

117
00:05:34,571 --> 00:05:37,210
promises of God,
respecting Christ's kingdom.

118
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,330
It was at least typical of spiritual
privileges.

119
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,240
Those of the firstborn that are written
in heaven.

120
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,860
Well,
that's a lot harsher than meets the eye

121
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:54,730
to begin with.
And so there's a very interesting deep

122
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:57,200
moral story there,
which is,

123
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:01,970
it's sort of Esau does the opposite of a
sacrifice.

124
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:03,140
It's the reverse,
right?

125
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,330
He sacrifices the future for the
present.

126
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,060
And so the,
the,

127
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,640
the story basically says,
the way it's laid out across stories is

128
00:06:10,641 --> 00:06:15,641
that if you're the sort of person that
sacrifices the future to the present,

129
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,040
then that eradicates the possibility
that you will bring the most noble being

130
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:24,590
into existence.
That's what it means.

131
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,000
And you can,
again,

132
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,370
this is the psychological significance
of the biblical story.

133
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:34,070
So that's a bad thing to do if you want
to realize your potential.

134
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,860
Let's say you don't do reverse
sacrifices.

135
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:38,120
That's a very bad idea.

136
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:42,620
And so east,
so really did himself in by being too

137
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:46,310
attached to the present without a vision
of the future.

138
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,020
So he's too in the moment,
you know,

139
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,080
and,
and he pays a heavy price for it.

140
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:51,960
I mean,
he's the,

141
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:55,190
first of all,
he loses his birthright and has double

142
00:06:55,191 --> 00:06:57,210
inheritance.
So there's a practical consequence.

143
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:58,700
And then there's a spiritual
consequence.

144
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:02,330
And then he's,
while he's being made a fool of by his

145
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,930
brother,
Jacob means supplanter by the way,

146
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,650
that's what the name means.
And Jacob has always trying to usurp

147
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,030
Esau as,
as we see.

148
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,640
And so Jacob gets one over on him and
you know,

149
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,010
that's not,
doesn't make an older brother happy when

150
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,630
a younger brother gets something over on
them,

151
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,420
that's for sure.
And then he loses the opportunity to be

152
00:07:20,421 --> 00:07:22,550

154
00:07:24,711 --> 00:07:25,850
but it seems to be,

155
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:27,260
it's kind of rough that so.
