1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,213
Oh,

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:07,500
I was wondering if you could,

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:08,820
if it's plausible,

4
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:13,350
it's race and our narcan
tipple or narrative origin
for some of the intellectual

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,380
tenants of the postmodern as oppose to
like deny the structures of language as

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:20,730
corresponds to reality.

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:21,520
Uh,

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,030
deny the sanctity of the individual.

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,690
I think you've done some of that in your,

10
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,520
your talk today,

11
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,990
but you think it's possible from a
psychological perspective to trace kind of

12
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:31,830
the narrative,

13
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:32,940
um,

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,740
origin of postmodernism and human
behavior or is it so unnatural?

15
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:37,801
No,

16
00:00:37,801 --> 00:00:38,101
no,

17
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:38,311
no,

18
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:38,461
no.

19
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:39,221
It's an architect,

20
00:00:39,221 --> 00:00:40,054
an architect.

21
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,550
I mean there's always,

22
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:46,740
there's always a force so to speak that
opposes the logo's hallways that that's

23
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:47,640
the hostile brothers.

24
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:49,620
It's a classic archetipal story.

25
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,630
There's always Cain and Abel.

26
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,890
There's always hostility between the
two primary modes of operating in the

27
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:56,724
world.

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,770
So,

29
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,440
and this is the,

30
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,330
this is the modern manifestation of that.

31
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:01,501
And it's partly,

32
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:06,501
it's partly a good thing in some
sense because it's useful to be deeply

33
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:07,380
challenged.

34
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:11,430
It's good to have an enemy
because the enemy makes you think,

35
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,100
the enemy tells you things
that no one else will tell you.

36
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,300
It's the [inaudible].

37
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,760
It's an advert adverse.

38
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,370
It's an ad.

39
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:22,370
It's the adversary that that that that
stops you from being merely inert and so

40
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,050
postmodernism plays that role.

41
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:25,520
It's,

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,320
it's extraordinarily critical but,

43
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,400
but things can go too far and and,

44
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,240
and the motives and things can go too far.

45
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:37,080
When they go too far,

46
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:37,914
they reverse.

47
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,300
That's what happens and hopefully
they're reversing now hopefully

48
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:49,543
as being mainly

49
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,060
we seem to be seeing something that has
a different form today that might be,

50
00:01:58,061 --> 00:02:00,070
is more associated with the feminine.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Can you speak to that and also what is
the nature of its power over men that it

52
00:02:07,181 --> 00:02:08,920
seems to be able to silence us.

53
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:11,931
Okay,

54
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:16,220
so the question is that the totalitarian
forms that we've seen primarily in the

55
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:18,650
past have been male and,

56
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,900
but maybe we're seeing
something different now.

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,630
I really don't think it's different.

58
00:02:23,631 --> 00:02:24,464
I think it's,

59
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,270
it's other common kind that's
expanded in its dominion.

60
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,520
So you imagine that there is an essential
feminine pathology just as there is an

61
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:39,380
essential masculine pathology and the
essential feminine Pathology Freud mapped

62
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:39,591
out.

63
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:43,550
It's the oedipal mother and
the mother is the mother.

64
00:02:43,551 --> 00:02:45,710
That gets too close to her children.

65
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,341
Right.

66
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:48,410
And intermingles herself with them too,

67
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:53,411
too great a degree that in her attempts
to protect them undermines them fatally.

68
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,470
And so there's a classic representation
of the feminine in the West and the

69
00:02:59,471 --> 00:03:01,300
classic representation is married.

70
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,351
And here,

71
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:03,820
here's one of the representations.

72
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:08,590
It's lovely and it's derived at least
in part from the story of Mary and the

73
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:09,790
snake in the garden of Eden.

74
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:14,790
And so Mary has her foot on a serpent
and she's holding Christ off to the side

75
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,113
like this.

76
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,430
Well that's exactly what
mothers have always done.

77
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's a biological portrait of human women
is they hold their infants out of the

78
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:27,250
reach of the terrible Serpentine Predator.

79
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,740
Obviously that's what we do.

80
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,113
Well that's fine,

81
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,350
but adults aren't infants
and neither are children.

82
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,690
And if you treat them like they are,

83
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,190
you undermine them.

84
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,150
Ew,

85
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,480
ew,

86
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,260
ew,

87
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,800
ew.

88
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,850
Pathologize them.

89
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,070
You turn them into old infants.

90
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,660
That's an ugly thing.

91
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,790
And that's the Friday in nightmare.

92
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:49,863
You know,

93
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:50,310
in,

94
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:52,930
in this happens in
therapy very frequently.

95
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,321
I mean,

96
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:56,080
you can be tangled into a terrible
relationship with your father.

97
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,380
That's often either because he was absent,

98
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,930
abusive or tyrannical,

99
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,010
something like that.

100
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,930
But that the standard pathology with
mom is she did everything for you.

101
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,071
Well,

102
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:13,540
what's left for you to do
nothing including never leaving.

103
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,333
Right.

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,570
And that's the motivation.

105
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,200
You know,

106
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,480
for the woman who's nothing
but protective mother,

107
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,910
there's no role outside of nurturing,

108
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,940
of nurturing,

109
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,783
nurturing,

110
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,511
of nurture,

111
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:32,261
and of infants,

112
00:04:32,261 --> 00:04:32,801
of nurturer,

113
00:04:32,801 --> 00:04:33,634
of infants.

114
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,061
Well,

115
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:35,230
you just keep them infants.

116
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,393
They'll never leave.

117
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,740
Am I kill you in night in your sleep?

118
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,230
But they'll never leave.

119
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,501
Sure,

120
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:44,861
sure.

121
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:45,310
I mean,

122
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:50,260
it's so comical watching the feminists
postmodernist in particular rattle on

123
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:55,261
about the absence of gender reality and
act out the archetipal devouring mother

124
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:00,250
at exactly the same time for them.

125
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,481
For them,

126
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:06,481
the world is divided into predators and
infants and the predators are evil and

127
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,990
need to be stopped and the
infants need to be cared for.

128
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:12,461
Well,

129
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:13,690
that's what the mother does,

130
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,050
but adults are not infants

131
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:21,070
and all you do is destroy them
when you treat them that way,

132
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,740
especially when they're adolescents
and just starting to develop,

133
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,150
you know there's,

134
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,980
there's a rule that I attempted to abide
by when I had small children and the

135
00:05:29,981 --> 00:05:34,150
rule was don't do anything for your
children that they can do themselves.

136
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,250
And it's annoying that rule because
it takes you like 15 seconds to,

137
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,410
to dress a two year old,

138
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:43,300
but you let the two
year old dress himself.

139
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:47,740
It's like it's 15 minutes or
20 minutes or half an hour.

140
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:48,880
You chase them around the house.

141
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,550
But if you let them learn
to dress themselves,

142
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:53,100
then you don't have to
dress themselves any.

143
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,620
Do you address them anymore and they can
do it and you do that with setting the

144
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:58,190
table and you do that with everything.

145
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,521
It's like,

146
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:58,881
no,

147
00:05:58,881 --> 00:05:59,331
it's okay.

148
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,700
You do that now while
I care for you so much.

149
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:02,660
Let me do that for you.

150
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,170
It's like I don't care for you at all
when I say that I don't care for you at

151
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:06,830
all.

152
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,070
I'm going to stop doing everything I
possibly can for you as rapidly as I

153
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:11,540
possibly can say.

154
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:12,200
Well that's great.

155
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,760
That's how you work in an old age home.

156
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,710
Do not do anything for the inhabitants
that they can do themselves cause you rob

157
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,830
them of the last vestiges
of their independence.

158
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:22,400
Right?

159
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,750
It's what you do when you're a manager.

160
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:24,650
If you're a good manager,

161
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:29,651
you make yourself Sir perf Lewis by
extending autonomy and independence to the

162
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:33,110
people that you manage so that
they can take over the whole job.

163
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,400
You don't do that by doing everything for
people and you certainly don't do that

164
00:06:37,401 --> 00:06:42,080
by dividing the world archetipal
Lee and uncritically into predators.

165
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,080
Those who have more and victims,

166
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,920
infants,

167
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,820
those who have nothing and acting like
all you can ever do is protect them.

168
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,893
You don't protect,

169
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:51,381
first of all,

170
00:06:51,381 --> 00:06:52,400
you can't protect people.

171
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,810
You can only make them strong.

172
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,040
That's it.

173
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,120
You cannot protect them.

174
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,390
You can make them strong and
then they can protect themselves,

175
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,650
but then they don't need you.

176
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,270
Right,

177
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,540
and there's the underground pathological
element of the devouring mother.

178
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,051
It's like,

179
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:06,741
never leave me.

180
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:07,574
Here's the deal.

181
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,870
I'll do everything for you.

182
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,700
You just never leave.

183
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,230
Right.

184
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,640
That's sleeping with your mother,

185
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:14,571
right?

186
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:15,950
That's the Friday at nightmare.

187
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,700
Right?

188
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,620
You don't invite your child into your bed.

189
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:19,521
Right.

190
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,860
You distinguish between them and you,

191
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:25,940
you distinguished between them and
your husband and you facilitate their

192
00:07:25,941 --> 00:07:26,774
independence.

193
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,740
A part of the reason why it's useful to
have a mother and a father is because

194
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,520
the mother has to fall insanely in love
with the infant or she throwed out the

195
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:35,270
window.

196
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:35,541
Right?

197
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:36,260
Because they're,

198
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,020
they're insanely demanding
and they're always right.

199
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:39,831
Right?

200
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,330
Because the right way to treat an infant,

201
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:42,620
especially before nine months,

202
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:45,770
is I'll do everything for you and
you're always right in your needs.

203
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,780
Take priority over everyone's one else's.

204
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:49,730
And anybody that
threatens you is terrible.

205
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,990
Exactly right.

206
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:51,951
But after,

207
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:52,131
you know,

208
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:54,950
once the kid is ambulatory and
starting to be independent,

209
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,180
that's the wrong attitude.

210
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,650
The attitude then is no,

211
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,750
get the hell on with it.

212
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:05,080
And men who are less prone to negative
emotion and less compassionate are much

213
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,930
better at fostering that
kind of independence.

214
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,890
And so it's usually then when they step
into the family and start playing with

215
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:16,850
the kids rough and tumble play and
pushing them forward and saying,

216
00:08:16,851 --> 00:08:17,450
you know,

217
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:18,171
get on with it.

218
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:18,830
You can do it,

219
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,663
you can do it.

220
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,180
And it's very hard for a mother to play
both those roles because she has to

221
00:08:23,181 --> 00:08:23,451
fall.

222
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:27,400
So in love with her infant that it's
difficult for her to be universal care

223
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,540
giver and disciplinary.

224
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,510
And at the same time,

225
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,101
you know,

226
00:08:30,101 --> 00:08:32,630
cause the roles or the roles
run contrary to one another.

227
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:36,650
So now women have entered the political
sphere right on Mohs and so they're

228
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:40,340
going to bring their essential nature
with them all the while saying there's no

229
00:08:40,341 --> 00:08:42,050
such thing as essential nature.

230
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:42,351
It's like,

231
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:42,890
yeah,

232
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,490
there is.
