1
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,133
Yeah,

2
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:16,730
would give you stadiums and why

3
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,090
even really contemplating
what we're doing.

4
00:00:22,091 --> 00:00:24,790
We're you see the sports team,

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,320
it's a,

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,320
it's a cooperative and competitive attempt
to specify and hit a target and we're

7
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:33,970
so excited about that.

8
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,840
Probably because of these two part were
built physiologically going on hunting

9
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,683
platform,

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,240
throwing platform,

11
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:40,410
right?

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,310
I mean human beings can throat and we
can throw a punch or throw a ball and

13
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:47,470
throw a spear and that's a big deal.

14
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:49,030
That's a big part of what we are.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,710
So Ricardo seeking creatures and
so to be precisely for speeches,

16
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,850
to specify the target is specify
the target is to have an aid.

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,210
They have an aim is to have a purpose
and to aid properly institute attain your

18
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:02,890
purpose at least in principle.

19
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:08,220
And so partly what we're doing in the
future authoring exercises to specify your

20
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:10,970
purpose with your precise fish.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,000
And so we asked people to,

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,500
well here's another thing to contemplate.

23
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,510
We are creatures were
built one hunting platform.

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,660
We'd like to hit targets as
possible that we're good at it.

25
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:28,330
And then what that also means is that,

26
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:28,541
well,

27
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:30,350
if we aren't good at it and it's,

28
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,420
that's part of what we are,

29
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:33,960
then if you specify target,

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,240
you might be able to hit it.

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,630
That's a hell of a thing.

32
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:38,020
There's a,

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,760
there's a statement in the New Testament,

34
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:42,740
it's quite a strange statement and it's a,

35
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,610
it's a,

36
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,830
it's a suggestion.

37
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,150
The suggestion is that if you knock
the door will open that if you ask,

38
00:01:49,151 --> 00:01:51,340
you will receive a new thing.

39
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:55,860
Well that seems highly likely and
well I got to see highly unlikely,

40
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,360
right?

41
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,470
I'm sure that's the way
the world is set up.

42
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,690
It's like that is actually
the way the world is set up.

43
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,030
It's very strange thing and it's not
that surprising if you start thinking

44
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,050
through and stuff,

45
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:07,750
even after all,

46
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,040
hypothetically through to
the world evolution has been
working three and a half

47
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:14,290
billion years to produce you.

48
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,183
And so,

49
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,830
you know,

50
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,440
maybe I could've done a better job.

51
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,433
That's

52
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,590
such a bad job.

53
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:24,030
So maybe she could have taken your aim.

54
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,420
What of the things that certainly
learned as a clinical psychologist once.

55
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:32,260
Because a lot of the people that I saw
who were unhappy with their life say

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:35,270
sometimes they're bigger than that,

57
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,330
and he had him detained what they wanted
had been detained in Austin in large

58
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:42,410
part because they never specified it,

59
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,620
and the probability that you're going
to hit a tiny target precisely without

60
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:49,220
aiming at it,

61
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,450
is serum.

62
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,060
That's not gonna happen so well.

63
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:55,940
So what would have happened
if you would aim at.

64
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,010
That's the question,

65
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,730
how should you best aim?

66
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,000
That's another question.

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,750
That's part of what rules for
life about the rule for example,

68
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:09,040
is treat yourself like you're
someone responsible for helping.

69
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,490
It's kind of a nice start,

70
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:13,050
so I can imagine again,

71
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,050
if you're aiming a rifle,

72
00:03:14,051 --> 00:03:17,050
you have to put yourself in a
certain physiological state,

73
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:17,630
right?

74
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,470
What I'm taking some deep breaths and
calm down and you want to make sure your

75
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:22,270
hands are shaking a particularly good,

76
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:26,920
so forth and put yourself in the right
frame of mind and if you're going to take

77
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:27,701
able with your life,

78
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:28,690
it's the same thing.

79
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:32,380
You have to put yourself in the right
frame of mind and what's the right frame

80
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:36,130
of mind and it might be something
you can assume that you're actually,

81
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:40,680
hypothetically a valuable preacher even
though you might not think that self is

82
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:41,470
your soul.

83
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,040
Absolutely knowledgeable about
your own flaws insufficiencies,

84
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,870
but independent of that,

85
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,471
you might think,

86
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,304
well,

87
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,040
you can lend yourself a hand and you can
do something good for yourself just up

88
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,590
with the goodness of your heart,

89
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:53,890
you know,

90
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,340
like you might do for
someone that cared about.

91
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,890
Now that's actually very
difficult for people.

92
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,540
You know,

93
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,540
like most of us love someone or a
couple of people or just half heartedly

94
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,030
released,

95
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,330
managed our children.

96
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:06,871
Well,

97
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,220
you know,

98
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,350
it's going to be fully
committed to something,

99
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,330
but generally,

100
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,000
generally we do a pretty
good job with our,

101
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,590
with our partners or husbands and wives
and a pretty good job with our children.

102
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,190
It's a little more iffy there.

103
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,570
A decent job with parents.

104
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:21,850
Oh,

105
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:22,091
you know,

106
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,590
it's 70 slash 30 or whatever,

107
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:27,520
but maybe you can get elevated more
than that with a lot of effort.

108
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
But I don't know how good we are
about doing that for ourselves.

109
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,680
I would say much less so.

110
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:36,760
And part of that is definitely the fact
that we're very aware of our own flaws

111
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:38,620
and insufficiencies personally,

112
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:43,210
you know more about how regine useless
you are fundamentally then above anyone

113
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:43,600
else.

114
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,600
And so that's rather disheartening given
that it's disheartening then it's not

115
00:04:48,671 --> 00:04:50,500
so easy to take care of yourself properly,

116
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:51,430
but he doesn't know him.

117
00:04:51,431 --> 00:04:53,280
He is to me that you really have that,

118
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,020
that right not to take care of yourself.

119
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,010
I think you have a responsibility to
take care of yourself as if you're

120
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,200
something of value,

121
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:03,850
which you are.

122
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:06,850
And so that's a responsibility.

123
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:10,120
And so when you filled out
the future authoring program,

124
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,460
you're,

125
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,293
you're asked to,

126
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,890
for the sake of experimentation,

127
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,260
the frame of reference,

128
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:25,350
a frame of reference within which you
give yourself the benefit of the delta.

129
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:29,890
Then there's something about you that
might be usefully brought forward into the

130
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:30,724
world.

131
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,170
And you know,

132
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:32,390
it's,

133
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:32,751
it's,

134
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:33,584
uh,

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,620
an axiom of arts society that there
is something about you that would be

136
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:41,980
usefully be brought forward into the
world because our whole society that's

137
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:46,260
predicated on the notion of the sovereign
individual or even of the dividing

138
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,360
people and we wouldn't have a exceeded
political power to each and every one of

139
00:05:53,861 --> 00:05:58,861
us if and would work unless there was
actually something to the proposition that

140
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:04,870
each individual is something
approximating a divine locus of value,

141
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,570
just our insufficiencies.

142
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:11,840
And so allowing yourself the
benefit of the doubt seems like,

143
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,770
and philosophically appropriate,

144
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:16,290
but it takes a certain amount of.

145
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,970
It takes a certain amount of courage.

146
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:20,420
And so we asked people to think,

147
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:20,721
okay,

148
00:06:20,721 --> 00:06:21,501
well here,

149
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:22,370
here's a game.

150
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,680
You can have it if you a matter

151
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,100
possibility,

152
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,470
if you're able to progress.

153
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,850
And would that make sense?

154
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:33,380
Because it's really been
something in property.

155
00:06:33,381 --> 00:06:34,131
You're not going to hit it.

156
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:35,450
So you could have that.

157
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,650
You can hit were you a map?

158
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,640
If you make progress?

159
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,950
The question would be how
when you eat properly nouns,

160
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,390
right?

161
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,190
Well,

162
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,670
imagine you started to take care of
yourself like something worth taking care

163
00:06:46,671 --> 00:06:47,390
of.

164
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,223
Oh,

165
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,490
so then you could say,

166
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:50,324
well,

167
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,120
if you could have one you wanted
three to five years down the road,

168
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,310
what would it be?

169
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,240
One of the needed,

170
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,780
assuming you were taking care of yourself.

171
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,600
Like if you can think about it like,

172
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:00,780
do I take care of the Child?

173
00:07:00,781 --> 00:07:02,900
And if you're going to
take care of a child,

174
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:05,270
you wouldn't just grab him or her,

175
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,760
his or her every whim.

176
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,200
That's not care.

177
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,660
So that isn't how you treat yourself.

178
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,480
You have to be more sensible not.

179
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,091
But we could say,

180
00:07:14,091 --> 00:07:14,511
well,

181
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:14,781
okay,

182
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:17,900
you get to have what you need
three to five years down the road.

183
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,140
What do you want from your family?

184
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,640
If you could put your family together
the way you wanted it to be together so

185
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:26,000
you have what you want it from your father
and your mother and your siblings and

186
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:26,840
your kids,

187
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,070
just hypothetically,

188
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,150
what would that look like?

189
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,420
Probably wouldn't look like the situation
where you're all around Thanksgiving

190
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:34,190
dinner with your hands
around each other's necks,

191
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,660
squeezing slowly,

192
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,730
which is the condition that many
families at Thanksgiving dinner.

193
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,980
You probably wished for that and it
would probably not be for the basket.

194
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,093
Then you might ask,

195
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:46,941
well,

196
00:07:46,941 --> 00:07:50,480
what would you want from your
from your intimate partner,

197
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,340
if you could have what you needed,

198
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:57,090
what would you want from your
career and how you educate yourself?

199
00:07:57,091 --> 00:08:02,091
If you could do that with an auditable
way or at least benetrends benefits

200
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,260
panicking now,

201
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,780
how would we take care of your
mental and physical health?

202
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:09,530
What would you do outside of work that
would be meaningful and engaging in

203
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,160
productive.
