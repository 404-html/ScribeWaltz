1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,010
You could say a life without
risk is hardly worth having.

2
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:09,841
You know,

3
00:00:09,841 --> 00:00:10,800
it might be secure.

4
00:00:10,801 --> 00:00:12,570
Although it isn't because as I said,

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:15,840
not taking a risk also constitutes a risk.

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:16,441
And you know,

7
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:17,280
when you look back,

8
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,750
people often are more

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,980
upset about the things they didn't do,

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,540
the chances they didn't take then
the failures that they encountered.

11
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:27,721
Now,

12
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:28,351
not always,

13
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:29,820
obviously it depends on the failure,

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,230
but you know,

15
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:35,040
you can sit at home and Cayston Styrofoam
and have your meals delivered and

16
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:35,880
you're probably,

17
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:36,743
you know,

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,030
you're not going to get mugged probably.

19
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:41,760
But what's a hell of a life?

20
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:46,830
Psychologists have struggled for a long
time to define mental health and and

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:47,670
pathology.

22
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,270
It's really hard because mental
illness and even physical illness,

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,140
it's not simple.

24
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:52,710
It's not.

25
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,460
Sometimes it is,

26
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,290
there's a pathogen or not.

27
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,850
Even then it's complicated cause he
can't tell why the pathogen popped up at

28
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:00,420
that point.

29
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,253
But anyways,

30
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,150
in mental health it's even more difficult.

31
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,291
So you know,

32
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,430
people have tried to define what
constitutes optimal health or optimal

33
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:11,490
performance in a system or a person
in a bunch of different ways.

34
00:01:11,491 --> 00:01:11,911
You can say,

35
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:12,660
well,

36
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,910
deviation from the
average is pathological,

37
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:18,750
but we don't think about that with
talent or beauty or intelligence.

38
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,160
So as a general principle,

39
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:21,240
that can't be right.

40
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:22,643
Um,

41
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,070
some people have said for mental health
that assist them is unhealthy when it

42
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:28,590
deviates from its evolutionary function.

43
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,450
Well I don't buy that because

44
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,540
it's very difficult to specify
the evolutionary function
of all sorts of things.

45
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:40,050
So that just doesn't
solve the problem for me.

46
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:42,990
What seems to happen as
far as I can tell is that

47
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,090
things are useful up to a certain point.

48
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,380
And once they dominate and sort of like
the cyclops image with the cyclops only

49
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:53,340
seeing one thing,

50
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,970
if you get to single
minded about anything,

51
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,330
any virtue or any
behavior for that matter,

52
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,230
it,

53
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,110
it hits a point where it
starts to turn back on itself.

54
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,310
And then you've gone too far.

55
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,050
And when it turns back on itself,

56
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:09,750
it hits him what's technically
called a positive feedback loop.

57
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:11,820
And then the things
spirals out of control,

58
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,620
catastrophic Lee and unpredictably.

59
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,450
And I can give you some examples of that.

60
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:17,370
So let's say you start to get depressed.

61
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,151
Okay.

62
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:18,631
And you know,

63
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:21,960
maybe you're slowly getting more and more
depressed while there's going to be a

64
00:02:21,961 --> 00:02:26,160
tipping point or they're often as a
tipping point where you're so depressed,

65
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,140
you quit going to work
and you lose your job.

66
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:32,430
Well that's not so good for your
depression because now you're not only

67
00:02:32,431 --> 00:02:32,881
depressed,

68
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,040
you're unemployed and
you don't have any money.

69
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:35,611
Well,

70
00:02:35,611 --> 00:02:38,460
and then maybe your know your wife is
getting pretty tired of having to deal

71
00:02:38,461 --> 00:02:41,070
with you because you're depressed and
now you also don't have a job and the

72
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,240
stress is too much for her.

73
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,490
And so you find a lot and
that makes you more depressed.

74
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:47,550
And then you start to stay at home
because you don't really want to show your

75
00:02:47,551 --> 00:02:48,280
face in public.

76
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,210
So you lose all your friends and man,

77
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,073
it's a cliff.

78
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:52,800
So you're,

79
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,940
you're doing not too bad.

80
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:58,941
Even though it might be a downhill walk
until you hit this like single event and

81
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,860
then it just goes won't,

82
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,171
you know,

83
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:05,800
because being unemployed makes you more
depressed and that makes it more less

84
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:08,380
likely that you're going to
look for a job and you can okay.

85
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
With alcoholism what seems
and other forms of addiction,

86
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:16,360
what seems to happen to me is that you
hit the positive feedback loop point when

87
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:20,350
you start using the drug to cure
it's own withdrawal symptoms.

88
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:25,120
So you're not in trouble with cocaine
until you start using it because the

89
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,650
cocaine has made you feel bad.

90
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,193
And the withdrawal,

91
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,260
same with alcohol,

92
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,470
you're all shaky and you got the shakes
and so on and you figured out one day

93
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,760
Jesus shot of vodka.

94
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,833
I'm good.

95
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:35,733
Yeah,

96
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,723
no,

97
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,980
you're firmly in that grip of the devil.

98
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,030
And now at that point,

99
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,730
and I think a lot of
systems are like this,

100
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,870
they worked fine but,

101
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,870
but as they get more and more exaggerated,

102
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:49,330
they get closer and
closer to a tip off point.

103
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:54,450
And then the tip off point is where all
hell breaks loose and virtues or even

104
00:03:54,491 --> 00:03:54,971
like that.

105
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:55,631
So we know,

106
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,261
for example,

107
00:03:56,261 --> 00:04:00,850
that conscientiousness is a trait and
conscientious people are industrious and

108
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,450
orderly.

109
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,250
So it's like the Protestant work ethic.

110
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,713
Okay?

111
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,660
We also know that orderliness
is grounded in disgust.

112
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,494
Sensitivity.

113
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:09,670
Okay?

114
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,630
We know that orderly people on average
have better hygienic habits and they live

115
00:04:13,631 --> 00:04:14,464
longer,

116
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,510
but they're also more,

117
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,733
uh,

118
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,760
inclined to radically disapproved
of homosexual behavior.

119
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,970
They're also more anti-foreigner because
they have a real tight me not mean

120
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,550
discrimination system,

121
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:32,530
and they're disgusted by what's not me.

122
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:32,741
Oh,

123
00:04:32,741 --> 00:04:33,280
that's good.

124
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,240
You don't like dirt.

125
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,480
And you can be sure that
among our forefathers,

126
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,620
it was very frequent.

127
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:41,290
If you are an explorer and you went
out to meet a bunch of strangers,

128
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,040
you and your whole damn crew were dead
three weeks later because they gave you

129
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,671
some disease.

130
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,830
You have no resistance to whatsoever,

131
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:49,000
and it just wiped you out.

132
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,241
I mean,

133
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:52,000
that's what happened to the native
Americans and the White Dove,

134
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,410
95% of them,

135
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:53,861
you know,

136
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:54,391
it's it,

137
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:55,720
this is a deadly thing.

138
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,461
Anyways.

139
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:00,670
As orderliness increases in its intensity,

140
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:04,090
it starts to shade into
like vicious intolerance.

141
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:05,140
So the fascists,

142
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:05,711
for example,

143
00:05:05,711 --> 00:05:07,840
the Nazis were orderly.

144
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:12,010
They didn't like parasites and they
thought of anything that wasn't just like

145
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:12,670
them.

146
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,930
They're corporate body.

147
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:17,050
The areas was a parasite and
it shouldn't be eradicated.

148
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,990
That's a pretty good idea when
you're eradicating parasites.

149
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:20,830
I mean,

150
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:23,260
Hitler tried to get rid of
tuberculosis to begin with,

151
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,330
but then the question arises,

152
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,790
what's a parasite?

153
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,620
At some point it's like
everyone who isn't meek,

154
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:31,871
you know,

155
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:34,870
hitting her got to that point before
he died because he felt that the whole

156
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,950
German society,

157
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,540
the lost faith in the air,

158
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,410
in society as the war was being lost and
he was perfectly happy that the bloody

159
00:05:41,411 --> 00:05:42,850
place went up and fire,

160
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,530
which is a purifying element.

161
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:45,461
So,

162
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:45,671
you know,

163
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:47,020
even Lord,

164
00:05:47,021 --> 00:05:49,240
conscientiousness is virtuous,

165
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:53,770
but you take any virtue
too far off the cliff,

166
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:54,604
you fall.

167
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,223
So,

168
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,920
so there's,

169
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,390
there's like this range
within which something works.

170
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,310
And when you push it past that range,

171
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,680
it starts to feed on itself.

172
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,990
And it turns into some variant of health.
