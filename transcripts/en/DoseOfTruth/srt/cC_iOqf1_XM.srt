1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,323
Are you,

2
00:00:03,130 --> 00:00:06,150
I did a lot of counseling work
with people who were coaching work,

3
00:00:06,151 --> 00:00:10,290
I guess with people who were fairly
spectacularly successful and they were

4
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:11,780
usually workaholics,

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:11,971
you know,

6
00:00:11,971 --> 00:00:13,350
they're the sort of people that were like,

7
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,570
they'd work 80 hours a week just nonstop.

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,770
That's just what they were like.

9
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:19,230
And one of the things we were
always trying to figure out was,

10
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:19,591
well,

11
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:20,730
how much should you work?

12
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,790
Because one answers you'd
just work til you die,

13
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,091
right?

14
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:25,860
I mean he just exhaust yourself.

15
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:27,090
And while that's not,

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,620
that's not a good idea.

17
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,440
And then you have to figure
out why that isn't a good idea.

18
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,700
It's gotta be something like this is that
you don't want to do so much work that

19
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,520
the amount of work you do interferes
with the amount of work that you could

20
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,570
still do.

21
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,950
Right?

22
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,540
Because if you work like mad
for two weeks and then you,

23
00:00:43,541 --> 00:00:43,820
you like,

24
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,290
you have to lie in a
hospital bed for a month,

25
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,120
that obviously isn't very productive.

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,740
So you have to figure out how much you
can work diligently and then how much you

27
00:00:52,741 --> 00:00:55,890
have to recuperate so that you
can get back up and work again.

28
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:56,400
And you know,

29
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,821
that's,

30
00:00:56,821 --> 00:01:00,690
people have basically settled on something
like this and given it the divine

31
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,820
imprimatur that that's one
way of thinking about it,

32
00:01:02,821 --> 00:01:03,810
which is well,

33
00:01:03,811 --> 00:01:06,960
you can toil away for six days and
no wonder because you have to work,

34
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:10,410
but you should rest at least one
day out of seven because otherwise,

35
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:12,630
well you don't appreciate life.

36
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:13,750
That might be part of it.

37
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,520
And plus I think it's more a matter
of iterative interability you know,

38
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:21,540
because one of the things that defines
morality is the capacity to repeat

39
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,374
something,

40
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:22,801
right?

41
00:01:22,801 --> 00:01:25,920
So if something is properly
structured in a moral manner,

42
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,220
then you can do it over and over and
over again without any degeneration.

43
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:31,380
And so that's kind of like a relationship.

44
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:33,270
If your relationship isn't negotiated,

45
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,810
you can continue to negotiate it and then
you can have a relationship that lasts

46
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:37,441
for a long time.

47
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:40,090
You can do it today and
next week and next month,

48
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:40,860
the next year.

49
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,720
You could maintain it across time.

50
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:43,381
And this,

51
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:47,940
I would say is the wisdom that's been
associate that's been garnered over God

52
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,070
only knows what period of time to say,

53
00:01:50,071 --> 00:01:50,400
well,

54
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:50,701
look,

55
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:51,060
I mean,

56
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,720
even God needed to take a break and
appreciate what was going on and it's not

57
00:01:54,721 --> 00:01:56,510
such a bad thing for
people to follow that,

58
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,690
that pattern.

59
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,780
That's a good thing for modern
people to know because we seem to be,

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,400
even though you know,

61
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,310
we're very wealthy by
historical standards,

62
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,190
our capacity to relax isn't
exactly what it could be.

63
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,780
And I think that's really hard on people.
