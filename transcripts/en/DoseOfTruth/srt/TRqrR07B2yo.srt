1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,493
Well,

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,310
we actually have it in Sweden.

3
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,380
It's called the,

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,250
I think the translation is

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,300
and gender mainstreaming in,

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,190
in English,

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,220
but it's basically you have to include
gender scientific perspectives into all

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,820
this is happening within all
Swedish universities right now.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,450
Uh,

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,350
so you have to include
the perspective of gender,

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,213
gender,

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:37,580
gender,

13
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,750
scientific perspective,

14
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,140
all parts of the university.

15
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,590
So it's not just literature
lists of courses,

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,240
it's also the who are
you going to recruit?

17
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:46,830
Uh,

18
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,663
the number,

19
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,290
and we have a goal in Sweden and,

20
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:50,800
uh,

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,670
from the government.

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,580
This is all the government's doing.

23
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,993
MMM.

24
00:00:56,510 --> 00:01:00,840
We have a goal that I think
it's 40% of all the professors,

25
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,680
uh,

26
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,750
by 2020 should be women.

27
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:04,151
Right.

28
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:07,480
Which means that if you're a
young man who's entering academia,

29
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:10,540
the probability that you're
going to get to job zero.

30
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,830
Yeah.

31
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:12,120
Right.

32
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,400
And that,

33
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,581
yeah,

34
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:13,780
the same thing's happening here.

35
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,680
So for example,

36
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:14,980
this,

37
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,191
there,

38
00:01:15,191 --> 00:01:16,330
our minister of science,

39
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,150
who was one of the people,

40
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:20,731
let's say,

41
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:24,960
selected because of Trudeau's insistence
upon gender equity in his cabinet.

42
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,353
Um,

43
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,503
you know,

44
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,430
he could have picked a number of women
that was proportionate to the number of

45
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,420
women elected.

46
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,990
Like even that I wouldn't have agreed
with because I think he should've gone on

47
00:01:36,991 --> 00:01:38,080
straight competence and,

48
00:01:38,081 --> 00:01:38,370
and,

49
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,760
and taken on the heavy moral burden of
trying to figure out what competence

50
00:01:41,761 --> 00:01:44,230
meant but just,

51
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:45,171
but no,

52
00:01:45,171 --> 00:01:46,040
it had to be 50,

53
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:46,461
50,

54
00:01:46,461 --> 00:01:47,690
because I guess that was,

55
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,020
you know,

56
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,550
this is a very snide thing to say,

57
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:52,760
but that seems to be at the level of
arithmetic intelligence that he could

58
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:53,594
manifest.

59
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,531
You know,

60
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,100
it's,

61
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,700
and,

62
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,560
and one of his ministers,

63
00:01:57,561 --> 00:01:58,940
our Minister of science has,

64
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,550
we have this program called camp.

65
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,370
The Canada research chairs and the Canada
research chairs were set up so that

66
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:08,630
Canadian universities would
have an additional amount
of money to hire the most

67
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:13,490
qualified people they possibly could
for senior named chair positions.

68
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,760
And the idea was to attract
international talent,

69
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,253
like high level.

70
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,610
Now what has happened,

71
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:21,170
because it wasn't very well designed,

72
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:25,070
this program was that
Canadian universities mostly
ended up poaching from each

73
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:25,904
other,

74
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,783
which was,

75
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,070
you know,

76
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,780
relatively counterproductive because
it just elevated the salaries of the

77
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:31,321
professors,

78
00:02:31,321 --> 00:02:35,070
which maybe they deserve rather than
bringing in a lot of international talent.

79
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,480
But man,

80
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:40,650
we're radically overrepresented
in Canada research chairs now.

81
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,860
The Minister of science is very annoyed
about this and thinks that that's a

82
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:45,210
consequence of systemic.

83
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:45,440
Yeah.

84
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,960
You know,

85
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,480
misogyny or some some bloody thing.

86
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,280
Failing to note entirely.

87
00:02:50,281 --> 00:02:50,640
See,

88
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,710
if you look at scientific productivity,

89
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,820
it's very interesting because and gender,

90
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,700
the median professor male and

91
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,350
publish approximately the same amount.

92
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:03,700
So the typical,

93
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,013
but the,

94
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,410
the exceptional professors
are almost all men.

95
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,820
Even though the typical male and
female can't really be distinguished in

96
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,390
academia.

97
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,900
If you'd take that tiny subset
of hyper productive professors,

98
00:03:16,901 --> 00:03:17,950
they're almost all male.

99
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,420
Now why that is is my suspicions are
that it's pretty straight forward.

100
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:27,070
I suspect that the reason it is is because
to be a hyper productive in any given

101
00:03:27,071 --> 00:03:31,900
field means you have to be absolutely
single minded and obsessed about it as

102
00:03:31,901 --> 00:03:33,430
well as being very intelligent,

103
00:03:33,431 --> 00:03:34,360
conscientious.

104
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,171
So it's rare,

105
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:35,620
right?

106
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,540
You have to be intelligent,

107
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,410
say 99th percentile conscientious,

108
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,060
95th percentile.

109
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:43,661
So that's hard.

110
00:03:43,661 --> 00:03:44,830
The anybody right there.

111
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,040
And then you have to have the time
available to do nothing whatsoever,

112
00:03:50,351 --> 00:03:51,790
but concentrate on your work.

113
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,141
No family,

114
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:53,951
no friends,

115
00:03:53,951 --> 00:03:54,880
nothing like that.

116
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,230
If you're going to be at the very top
of your profession because obviously

117
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,120
you'll get out competed otherwise.

118
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:03,700
Now that's a lot harder for women because,

119
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:04,923
well,

120
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,280
for obvious reasons,

121
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,410
I mean so,

122
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,110
so the mere fact that
most of these people were,

123
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,030
see the other thing people
don't understand is that
people can on average be

124
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:16,960
very similar.

125
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,090
So their distributions,

126
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:22,030
but if you go way out on to
the edges of the distribution,

127
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:26,260
small differences in the middle can
make massive differences at the edge.

128
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,461
And so,

129
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:30,790
and that's the kind of phenomena you
see where you are selecting the highest

130
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,720
qualified people.

131
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,030
It's a,

132
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,390
it's an edge of the
distribution phenomena.

133
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,350
So here's an example.

134
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,340
This is really cool one.

135
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,510
So if you look at the overlap
between male and female aggression,

136
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:41,741
it's pretty high.

137
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:46,030
So if you randomly select a man and
a woman from the general population,

138
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,420
and you bet that the woman was
the more aggressive of the two,

139
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,670
you'd be right 40% of the time,

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,710
which is actually pretty often.

141
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,113
So,

142
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,940
but if you go way the hell out to where,

143
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,980
let's say you only imprisoned the
one in 100 most aggressive people,

144
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,713
they're all men.

145
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:10,530
Even though on average it's 60 40
you'd go out to the 99th percentile.

146
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,091
It's all men,

147
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:16,390
which is why almost all the
people in prison are men now.

148
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,670
So people,

149
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,371
well it's,

150
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:20,204
it's,

151
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:21,130
yeah.

152
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,570
What you're describing in Sweden,

153
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:24,070
that's the death of the universities.

154
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:24,730
It's another,

155
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,110
it's another sign of like,

156
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,670
the universities are killing themselves.

157
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,850
They're hiring adjunct professors
and not faculty members.

158
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,630
Like I think it's up to 70%
in some American universities.

159
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:35,800
They have no salary,

160
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,610
no power,

161
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,480
no autonomy,

162
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,070
no job security,

163
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,680
nothing.

164
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,011
It's,

165
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:40,271
it's,

166
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,104
it's,

167
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:41,501
you know,

168
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:45,340
some of these adjuncts teach four or
five courses a year and make $25,000.

169
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,510
So it's,

170
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,970
I read about one who lived in her car.

171
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,310
Yeah.

172
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:51,611
Okay.

173
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,800
So they've jacked up tuition,

174
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:55,750
but you honorary proletariat.

175
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,411
Yeah,

176
00:05:56,411 --> 00:05:56,960
exactly.

177
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,290
Well,

178
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:57,921
there you go.

179
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:58,754
You know,

180
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,720
um,

181
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,553
they've jacked up too.

182
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,980
They've jacked up tuition to the
point where it's unsustainable.

183
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:11,660
They've made it impossible for kids
who rack up tuition debt to declare

184
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:14,780
bankruptcy because they've taken
that out of the bankruptcy laws.

185
00:06:14,781 --> 00:06:17,780
Now you can take away their driver's
license if they don't pay their,

186
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:18,591
their,

187
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,340
uh,

188
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,173
their tuition,

189
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,620
their student loan bills.

190
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,690
So it's basically indentured servitude,

191
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:24,560
right?

192
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,200
The administration has
become completely top heavy.

193
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:32,530
The academy is completely infested by
these terrible equity ideas that you're

194
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,310
laying out.

195
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,143
I mean,

196
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:36,093
it's,

197
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:36,440
and,

198
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,380
and the people who are in the
radical leftists disciplines,

199
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:43,670
which increasingly are spreading
their influence out through the entire

200
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:47,750
universities are tenured and
won't be moved for 25 years.

201
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,190
So as far as I can tell,

202
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:51,230
it's done.
