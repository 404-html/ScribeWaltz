1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,720
Let me ask you a couple
more personal questions,

2
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,554
if you don't mind.

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:11,803
You mentioned

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:14,260
briefly during our,

5
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:15,860
during our conversation that you know,

6
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,280
you,

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:16,610
you,

8
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:17,220
you were,

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,150
you're from a pretty fundamentalist
Christian background and you became a

10
00:00:21,151 --> 00:00:22,970
skeptic and you'd be pursuing that with,

11
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:23,730
with,

12
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,740
with well adamantly,

13
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,180
let's say for a very long time.

14
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,800
So two questions is

15
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:35,600
what put you on that path and what do
you think your positive function as a

16
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:36,840
skeptic is?

17
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,760
Yeah,

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,440
so first of all,

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,350
my family wasn't religious at all.

20
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,900
They weren't antireligious
to just wasn't a thing.

21
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,130
I became interested in it and the early
seventies when I was in high school,

22
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:52,450
which was sort of the early development
of the Evangelical Movement in the

23
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:53,284
United States.

24
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,820
So I called born again movement,

25
00:00:54,821 --> 00:00:57,310
and there was no affiliation
with any church or particular,

26
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,300
we all recognize that,

27
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,020
you know,

28
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,120
organized religion was
probably not all that great.

29
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,610
So just sort of a one on one,

30
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:05,350
it's just you and Jesus and the Bible,

31
00:01:05,351 --> 00:01:06,400
you and God and so on.

32
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,451
And uh,

33
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:08,560
that was that whole,

34
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,500
you know,

35
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,241
Jesus Christ,

36
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:11,920
superstar time and all that.

37
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:12,851
So,

38
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:17,530
but I took it very seriously and I went
to Pepperdine and I took courses in the

39
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,281
Old Testament and New Testament.

40
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:21,820
I read everything cs Lewis wrote to the
course in the writings of Cs Lewis said

41
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,290
I was into it then.

42
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,360
You know,

43
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:24,880
at Pepperdine,

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,540
you're in the bubble of
the Christian worldview.

45
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:30,610
This totally consistent.

46
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:32,230
It's internally coherent,

47
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:32,891
uh,

48
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:34,150
until you're outside the bubble.

49
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:39,100
So when I went to a secular university
and to study experimental psychology,

50
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,503
um,

51
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,710
not only was that more of a grounding in
the scientific method of understanding

52
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:45,131
reality,

53
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:45,881
but just for fun.

54
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:46,900
I took courses in,

55
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,411
first of all,

56
00:01:47,411 --> 00:01:48,880
I took courses in evolutionary theory.

57
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:50,050
I was kind of a creationist.

58
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:51,580
I remember sitting there thinking,

59
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,211
Holy Shit,

60
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:53,350
this stuff is real.

61
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,933
There's an actual site.

62
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,190
But then I took a course in,

63
00:01:57,191 --> 00:01:57,690
um,

64
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,480
and mythology,

65
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,080
anthropology and comparative mythology
and that kind of opened up my eyes.

66
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:06,520
So I sort of went through my Joseph
Campbell stage and the myth of the hero,

67
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:08,530
I read the hero of a
thousand faces and all that.

68
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:08,741
It's like,

69
00:02:08,741 --> 00:02:09,011
okay,

70
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:09,844
this is,

71
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,990
this is a different way of looking at
things than the pure scientific way.

72
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:16,870
But it's also different from a
lot of these religious traditions,

73
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:17,380
you know,

74
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,100
so that,

75
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,460
that's sort of told me that the
particular religion I was in,

76
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,310
it's wrong to ask,

77
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:24,640
is that,

78
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,660
is it right or wrong?

79
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:26,140
It's just,

80
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,560
it's a completely different thing.

81
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:27,740
And,

82
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,573
and it,

83
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,030
it just wasn't working for me anymore.

84
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:31,630
So,

85
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,270
and I enjoyed the scientific way of
thinking about the world and I was

86
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:38,440
surrounded by people that it's not that
they were atheists in graduate school

87
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:39,940
and after that it's like,

88
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:42,040
remember this is now the late seventies.

89
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:47,041
And then when I went to graduate school
in the second time for my phd and his of

90
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:48,070
science and late eighties,

91
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,473
um,

92
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:49,841
again,

93
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:50,770
the whole eighth science,

94
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:51,281
religion,

95
00:02:51,281 --> 00:02:51,851
atheist,

96
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:52,540
new atheism,

97
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:53,321
that wasn't a thing.

98
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:54,580
No one really talked about it.

99
00:02:54,581 --> 00:02:55,750
It wasn't like a big thing.

100
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:56,584
You have to decide,

101
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,480
are you at the east or an atheist?

102
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,920
No one talked about that.

103
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,180
And so my focus is really on this,

104
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,790
on science and understanding things.

105
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:08,260
Now the problem with being a sort of
an intellectual or historian of science

106
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,490
psychologists like I am,

107
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:12,580
and you're interested in
study beliefs like I do.

108
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,540
Um,

109
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,750
and then also being a public intellectual
is the publisher of skeptic magazine.

110
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:19,990
And I write this column for scientific
American every month I got to essentially

111
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:24,991
debunk something or analyze something
is it kind of puts you in the role of

112
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:25,360
like,

113
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:25,481
well,

114
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,190
I've got to say if this is right or wrong,

115
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,110
this is true or false or,

116
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,490
or something in between.

117
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,180
So I,

118
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,421
I'm,

119
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,030
I'm us constantly and just
kind of razor edge between,

120
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,920
I just am curious observer
of people's beliefs.

121
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:39,910
And then on the other hand,

122
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,300
I have to actually have to kind of
pass judgment in writing every month,

123
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,510
well as this one correct or not
correct or something in between.

124
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,530
Um,

125
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,071
and,

126
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:48,360
uh,

127
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,080
so,

128
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,913
uh,

129
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:50,531
again,

130
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,790
it's at that different levels.

131
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,070
You know,

132
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,490
sometimes I'm just talking
about people's beliefs.

133
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,660
Other Times I'm at,

134
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:57,190
I'm actually kind of forced to say,

135
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:57,461
well,

136
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,600
I think this is probably true.

137
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,590
We're probably not true.

138
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,031
And,

139
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:01,211
uh,

140
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,021
and I think this is,

141
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:02,231
you know,

142
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:02,921
I listened to,

143
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:05,800
I tried to listen to that
first podcast you did with Sam

144
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:11,500
to get through it again to me,

145
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:11,681
you know,

146
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:14,680
two hours you were just talking past
each other at different levels of,

147
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:14,920
you know,

148
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,160
you know,

149
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,110
Sam's laser focused on,

150
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:17,950
you know,

151
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,750
people will behave,

152
00:04:19,751 --> 00:04:22,150
they act on certain beliefs and you know,

153
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,240
the obvious one flying planes into
buildings is because you have a certain

154
00:04:25,241 --> 00:04:26,380
belief that leads to that.

155
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,311
Yes,

156
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:27,851
that's true.

157
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,310
And it would be good if people didn't
believe these things that lead them to do

158
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,630
those kinds of violent x.

159
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,800
But there's a whole nother level you can
talk about beliefs that have nothing to

160
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:37,750
do with leading to violence or so on.

161
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:42,160
And to me it just depends on what's
your goal when you're talking about this

162
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:43,360
particular thing right now.

163
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,093
And,

164
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:45,910
and you know,

165
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,140
so there I was good friends with
Stephen Jay Gould and you know,

166
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:51,820
I was sympathetic to his noma

167
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,610
in the sense that the world's already to
tribal and so if we can calm everybody

168
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:57,971
down,

169
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:58,804
that's good.

170
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,861
On the other hand,

171
00:04:59,861 --> 00:05:03,600
I do think science and reason can
inform and maybe even in some cases to

172
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:07,700
determine human values and moral
decisions right and wrong and so on.

173
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,190
I've written quite a bit about that too.

174
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:09,960
And so,

175
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,481
but again,

176
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:14,800
that's sort of a different level of top
of what you're talking about and what

177
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:16,600
the goals are at that particular moment.

178
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:17,801
Yeah,

179
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:17,981
well,

180
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:18,520
I mean this,

181
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,680
the skeptic when,

182
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:19,960
when,

183
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,340
when I think of a skeptic,

184
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,860
this is a strange leap of course,

185
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:24,800
but um,

186
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,630
there's a,

187
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,470
there's a scene in revelation where
Christ comes back and he comes back with a

188
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,630
sword coming out of his mouth and that's
where he divides the damned in the

189
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:33,464
safe.

190
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:33,941
And that's,

191
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:34,120
uh,

192
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,800
that's also an image of the logos,

193
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:36,101
right?

194
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,880
The word that brings forth order out of
chaos because partly what you do as a

195
00:05:40,881 --> 00:05:41,530
skeptic,

196
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:45,670
it isn't so much that you dam the
untrue is that you rescued the true.

197
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,630
And that's really necessary for people
because we need to stand on a rock.

198
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,500
And one of the big problems
I have with new age movement,

199
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,740
and I've kind of studied this technically
looking at the way that creative

200
00:05:56,741 --> 00:05:57,410
people,

201
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:00,170
because there are creative people who
are critically minded and there were

202
00:06:00,171 --> 00:06:04,550
creative people who are not critically
minded and non critically minded.

203
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:08,360
Creativity seems more associated with
mental illness and psychopathology.

204
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:12,470
Or you have to be able to discriminate
between what's worth saving and what

205
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:12,801
isn't,

206
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:13,634
so to speak.

207
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,350
And that's what a good skeptic does.

208
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:17,750
Cause the skeptic isn't
necessarily someone who says,

209
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:18,201
oh,

210
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:19,430
this is all false.

211
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,590
A good skeptic is someone who says,

212
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,543
oh look,

213
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
there's a kernel of truth here,

214
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,160
but it's deeply buried
under layers and layers of,

215
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,730
of rust and nonsense that needs to be
burned away or polished away so that we

216
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:33,500
can get to what's absolutely essential.
