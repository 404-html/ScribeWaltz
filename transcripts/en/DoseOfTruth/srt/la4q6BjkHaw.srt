1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,213
So anyways,

2
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,600
Jacob gets away with this,

3
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,980
but Esau is not happy and,

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,880
and Jacob is quite convinced
that he might kill them.

5
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:19,330
And I think that was a reasonable fear
because he saw was a tough guy and he was

6
00:00:19,331 --> 00:00:23,620
used to being outside and he knew how
to hunt and he knew how to kill and he

7
00:00:23,621 --> 00:00:27,760
actually wasn't very happy about
getting seriously screwed over by his,

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,510
you know,

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,820
stay at home younger brother twice.

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,710
And so Jacob runs off and goes to
visit his uncle and on the way,

11
00:00:35,711 --> 00:00:37,840
and this is a very
interesting part of the story,

12
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,410
he stops and to sleep and he takes a
stone for a pillow and then he has this

13
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:45,670
vision,

14
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,630
it's called a dream,

15
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,260
but the context makes it look like a
vision of a ladder reaching up to heaven

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,370
and with angels moving
up and down the ladder,

17
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,263
let's say.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,790
And there are some
representations of that.

19
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:03,040
I showed you some of them
the last time we met,

20
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,590
but I'll read it to you first.

21
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:07,510
And he lighted upon a
certain place and tired.

22
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:10,390
They're all night because the sun was
set and he took of the stones of that

23
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:14,080
place and put them for his pillows
and laid down in that place to sleep.

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:17,920
And he dreamed and beheld a
ladder set up on the earth.

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,570
And the top of it reached to heaven.

26
00:01:19,571 --> 00:01:20,404
And behold,

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,050
the angels of God ascending
and descending on it.

28
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:23,951
And behold,

29
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:25,300
the Lord stood above it and said,

30
00:01:25,301 --> 00:01:26,740
I am the Lord God of Abraham,

31
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:29,380
thy father and the god of Isaac,

32
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,780
the land where on the Elias to the,

33
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:33,460
I will give it Nti seed.

34
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:37,180
And I see Chubby as the dust of the
earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the

35
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,430
west and to the east and
to the north and the south.

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,130
So that lays out the canonical directions,

37
00:01:42,131 --> 00:01:42,371
right?

38
00:01:42,371 --> 00:01:45,430
So now there's a center with
the canonical directions,

39
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,600
like the thing that you see,

40
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:46,811
you know,

41
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:48,580
that little symbol you see on maps,

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,330
it's the same thing that
symbolically placed upon the earth.

43
00:01:52,331 --> 00:01:55,750
So a center has been
established with radiating,

44
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:56,860
uh,

45
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,311
well with,

46
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:57,880
with what?

47
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,121
With,

48
00:01:58,121 --> 00:02:01,000
with direction lines radiating from it.

49
00:02:01,001 --> 00:02:02,160
So it establishes as,

50
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,280
as a place

51
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,320
and in the young nice seed shall all
the families of the earth be blessed.

52
00:02:08,321 --> 00:02:12,010
So that's pretty good news for Jacob
and it's not self evident why God is

53
00:02:12,011 --> 00:02:15,280
rewarding him for running away
after screwing over his brother.

54
00:02:15,281 --> 00:02:17,170
But that seems to be what happens.

55
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:20,200
And so here's a couple of representations,

56
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:21,760
classic representations.

57
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:22,870
Um,

58
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,990
the one on the right is William
Blake has when I particularly like,

59
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:27,641
you know,

60
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:32,590
and Blake assimilates God
with the sun when with light,

61
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,503
right?

62
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:38,580
So that's quite an common mythological
idea that that God is associated with

63
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:40,780
light and the day

64
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,460
will not leave thee
until I have done that,

65
00:02:47,461 --> 00:02:51,180
which I have spoken to the and Jacob
awaked out of his sleep and he said,

66
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,910
surely the Lord is in this
place and I knew what not.

67
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,110
And he was afraid,

68
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:58,320
which is exactly the
right response and said,

69
00:02:58,321 --> 00:03:00,010
how dreadful is this place?

70
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,430
It is none other than the house of
God and this is the gate of heaven.

71
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,090
And Jacob Rose up early in the morning
and took the stone that he had put for

72
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:10,870
his pillows and set it up for a pillar
and poured oil on the top of it.

73
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,500
And that's,

74
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,540
that's a more important
thing than you think.

75
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:14,181
And what,

76
00:03:14,181 --> 00:03:18,020
we'll go into that a little bit more
deeply because up to this point in the

77
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:18,640
story,

78
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,170
there isn't anything really,

79
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,250
there isn't anything that's really
emerged to mark a sacred space,

80
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:24,551
right?

81
00:03:24,551 --> 00:03:25,000
There's no,

82
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,990
there's no cathedral,

83
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:26,771
there's no church,

84
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:27,820
there's nothing like that.

85
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,230
But here's this idea that emerges that
you can mark the center of something

86
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:33,250
that,

87
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,061
and that's important.

88
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:38,230
Any market with a stone and a stone
is a good way to mark things that,

89
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,270
that are important because
the stone is permanent,

90
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,900
right?

91
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,520
And we mark things with stones now,

92
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:44,590
like we marked graves
with stones for example,

93
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,550
because we want to make a memory
and to carve something into stone,

94
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,330
to carve a stone and then to
carve something into stone
is to make a memory and

95
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,540
to use stone is to make a memory
because stone is permanent.

96
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,990
And to set it up right
is to indicate a center.

97
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,040
And so that's what happens in
pours oil on the top of it,

98
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:04,300
which is kind of offering,

99
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,670
and he called the name
of that place Bethel.

100
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,100
But the name of the city was
called [inaudible] at the first.

101
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
And Jacob vowed a vow saying,

102
00:04:11,921 --> 00:04:14,200
if God will be with me and
we'll keep me in this way,

103
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:17,050
that I go and will give me bread
to eat and Raymond to put on.

104
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:23,870
Okay.

105
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,120
Then a 10th of what I earn,

106
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:26,954
I will give him.

107
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,183
I missed that.

108
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,710
That's interesting too,

109
00:04:30,711 --> 00:04:33,260
because now there's a
transformation of sacrifice,

110
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:33,471
right?

111
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:35,090
Because until that point,

112
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:38,420
sacrifices have had
been pretty concretized.

113
00:04:38,421 --> 00:04:39,770
It was the burning of something.

114
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:40,881
Whereas here,

115
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,830
all of a sudden it's the offering of,

116
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:43,580
of,

117
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,413
of,

118
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,330
of productive labor per se,

119
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,223
like a tie,

120
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,000
because the tie,

121
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,360
there's a form of sacrifice.

122
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:52,790
And so there's an abstraction
of the idea of sacrifice,

123
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,953
sacrifice.

124
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,890
It's really important that the
idea of sacrifice gets abstracted,

125
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:58,701
right?

126
00:04:58,701 --> 00:05:01,790
Because it should be abstracted
to the point where it's,

127
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,250
it's used the way that we use it today,

128
00:05:04,251 --> 00:05:04,761
which is,

129
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:05,001
you know,

130
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:08,810
we make sacrifices to get ahead and
everyone understands what that means.

131
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:13,990
But the sacrifices are generally some
combination of psychological lend and,

132
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,400
and practical.

133
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,110
So we're not acting them out where it
precisely we're not dramatizing them or

134
00:05:21,111 --> 00:05:23,600
ritualizing and we actually
act them out in our,

135
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,850
in the covenant that we
make with the future.

136
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:27,680
And we do that well.

137
00:05:27,681 --> 00:05:31,730
Unless we're extraordinarily impulsive
and aimless in our lives and have really

138
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:36,200
no conception whatsoever of the future
and are likely to sacrifice the future

139
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:36,861
for the present,

140
00:05:36,861 --> 00:05:38,990
which is what he saw does right?

141
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,260
Then we make sacrifices and you gotta
think like the idea of making sacrifices

142
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,730
to make the future better is an
extraordinarily difficult lesson to learn.

143
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:50,750
It took people,

144
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,020
God only knows how long to learn that,

145
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,560
you know,

146
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,180
like we,

147
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,210
we have no idea.

148
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,670
It's something that animals do easily.

149
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:01,520
Chimpanzees don't store leftover meat,

150
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,210
you know,

151
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,710
they just needed a wolf.

152
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,041
They just,

153
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,740
wolf can eat about 30 pounds
of meat in one setting.

154
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:10,190
And that's where the idea of
wolfing it down comes from.

155
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,270
They're not hiding it,

156
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,380
saving it for later.

157
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:12,621
You know,

158
00:06:12,621 --> 00:06:13,640
they can't do that,

159
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,630
so they can't sacrifice
the present for the future.
