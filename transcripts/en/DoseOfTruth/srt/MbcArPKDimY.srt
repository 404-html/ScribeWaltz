1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,080
You know,
lots of times soldiers develop post

2
00:00:09,081 --> 00:00:11,540
traumatic stress disorder because they
go out in the battlefield,

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,310
they're kind of naive.
They're young guys,

4
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:14,144
you know,
and,

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:14,841
and,
and,

6
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:17,870
uh,
it actually is worse if they're not that

7
00:00:17,871 --> 00:00:20,270
bright.
It turns out because having a lower Iq

8
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:23,180
is one of the things that predisposes
you to post traumatic stress disorder.

9
00:00:23,181 --> 00:00:25,340
But anyways,
they go out in the battlefield and they

10
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:28,310
see what they're capable of under
battlefield conditions.

11
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:29,420
And like,
you know,

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,270
we,
we've been fighting wars for a very long

13
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:34,130
time,
millions of years.

14
00:00:34,131 --> 00:00:36,770
You know,
chimps basically have wars with other

15
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:38,330
chimps,
the troops,

16
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:41,060
right?
Cause the juveniles will patrol the

17
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:45,020
perimeter perimeter of their territory.
And if they find other chimps from other

18
00:00:45,021 --> 00:00:49,370
troops that they outnumber,
they will tear them to pieces like in

19
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:50,990
chimps are really,
really strong.

20
00:00:50,991 --> 00:00:53,210
And so when I say they'll tear them to
pieces,

21
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:54,560
I mean that literally,
you know,

22
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,570
they,
they tear them to pieces.

23
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,040
And Jane Goodall discovered that
originally in 1970s she didn't even

24
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,920
report it for a while because she was so
shocked.

25
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,770
You know,
she kind of assumed like most followers

26
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:11,680
of roots so that the human proclivity
for warfare was part,

27
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,210
that part that was something that was a
uniquely human.

28
00:01:14,211 --> 00:01:15,710
You know,
it had something to do with our,

29
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,820
our unique self consciousness or our
intelligence or something like that.

30
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,930
She had no idea that it was rooted that
deeply.

31
00:01:23,931 --> 00:01:26,240
You know,
we split from chimps about six,

32
00:01:26,241 --> 00:01:28,190
7 million years ago,
something like that.

33
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,220
And so we were patrolling territory.
We were gang members 7 million years

34
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:36,260
ago.
And you know,

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,800
it that that's,
that's minimum estimation because of

36
00:01:39,801 --> 00:01:44,801
course that ancestor shaded back maybe
20 million years into entities that were

37
00:01:48,591 --> 00:01:53,020
roughly primate like,
and so territoriality and a,

38
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:56,540
and a proclivity to defend territory is
so deeply embedded in us.

39
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,910
It's,
it's,

40
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,783
it's like,
it's,

41
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:03,200
it's like it's the control center for
our whole brain.

42
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:06,020
And so there isn't anything more
important to us,

43
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:11,021
I would say.
Then maintaining the match between what

44
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:16,340
we want to have happen and what other
people are doing in response to our

45
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:18,740
actions.
Like that's that that's what we want.

46
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,160
And as long as that match is maintained,
then our emotional systems,

47
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:28,010
and I would say anxiety's probably
primary in that regard.

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,250
Our emotional systems remain inhibited.
They're on,

49
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,320
they're ready,
like,

50
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,220
like a nuclear reactor.
Rods are on and the rest of the brain

51
00:02:40,221 --> 00:02:42,780
dampens them down.
But it's like it,

52
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,630
you don't want them to take time to
start it up,

53
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:46,820
man.
You want them to be on at a,

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,760
at a 10th of a second's notice when it's
necessary.

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,571
And so,
you know,

56
00:02:50,571 --> 00:02:52,850
that's kind of why,
well if you look like look at a wild

57
00:02:52,851 --> 00:02:54,800
animal,
it's like it's alert,

58
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,400
it's ready to dark this way or that way,
especially a prey animal

59
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,070
instantaneously.

60
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:04,060
And it has reflexes built into it.
As you do that,

61
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:07,570
we'll respond way before your conscious.
So for example,

62
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,080
if you happen to be walking down a trail
and you detect something snake,

63
00:03:12,081 --> 00:03:16,180
like in the periphery,
you'll leap away before you even know

64
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,020
that you lapped.
And,

65
00:03:18,021 --> 00:03:21,730
but that's because it takes a fair bit
of time to actually see a snake.

66
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,840
By which I mean form a conscious
representation of the snake,

67
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,970
you know?
And maybe it takes a quarter of a second

68
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:30,220
or something like that,
or even longer,

69
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,440
but it doesn't matter.
Maybe it takes,

70
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,110
you know,
20th of a second,

71
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,960
a 10th of a second.
But the thing about the damn snake is

72
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:40,480
it's way faster than that.
It's really fast.

73
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:43,210
That thing and it coevolved with
primates by the way.

74
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,470
And so it can nail you like way faster
than you can look at it.

75
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:52,471
So you have your eyes map snake like
objects right onto your reflexes so that

76
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,560
the eyes go,
the eyes make you jump,

77
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,470
and then they see after that it's like,
yeah,

78
00:03:59,471 --> 00:04:01,990
well now you can see that's no problem.
You know,

79
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,500
so all right.
All right.

80
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,570
Now what I would say that what we do is
we live in a shared story and the story

81
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:16,030
is a way of looking at the world and its
way of acting in the world at the same

82
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:18,610
time.
And that story has to operate within

83
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:21,070
narrow parameters.
And this is something that's

84
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:23,920
extraordinarily important to understand
because,

85
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:26,470
and this is something I think that
Piaget figured out,

86
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,720
John Piaget figured out better than
anyone else.

87
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:30,880
I think he really got this right.
And by the way,

88
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:32,980
one of the things that Piaget was trying
to do,

89
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,220
you never hear about how strange these
great thinkers are.

90
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,950
But Piaget was a very strange guy and he
was a,

91
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:43,600
he was a hyper genius and he was offered
the curatorship of a bloody museum when

92
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,340
he was 10 years old.
You know,

93
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,800
cause he wrote this little paper on
molluscs which parent?

94
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,740
It was a very good,
so they offered him the curatorship of a

95
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,080
museum and his parents wrote back and
said,

96
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:55,060
well you know,
no,

97
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,990
probably not because he's,
he's actually 10 and so that was Piaget

98
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:00,370
man.
The guy was a genius.

99
00:05:00,371 --> 00:05:01,480
And you know,
he,

100
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:06,130
he was actually motivated by the desire
to reconcile science and religion.

101
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,820
That was,
that was actually his entire motivation

102
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,380
for what he did.
You never hear that.

103
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,790
But that's,
that's the case.

104
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,480
And so Piaget was very interested in how
you produce structures that enable you

105
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,710
to regulate yourself.
Cause you're like a kind of a,

106
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:26,320
a colony of strange sub animals that
have to figure out how to get along so

107
00:05:26,321 --> 00:05:29,230
that you can sort of be one thing.
You kind of learn that,

108
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:33,100
I would say between the ages of two and
four as you're being socialized,

109
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:34,990
you know how erratic two year olds are.

110
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,040
I mean,
they're a blast.

111
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,540
And it's partly because they were
erratic.

112
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:41,290
It's like they're unbelievably happy and
then they're unbelievably hungry and

113
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:44,350
then they're really hot.
And then they're really upset and

114
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:45,131
crying,
you know?

115
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:46,660
And then they're really scared.
It's like,

116
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,740
and all of that's just untrammeled.
And so it's really fun to be around

117
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:52,120
them,
especially when they're happy because

118
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:54,370
they're so happy that it's just,
you know,

119
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:58,700
you don't ever get to be that happy.
And so it's nice to be around a two year

120
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:02,450
old because you can kinda feel that
again,

121
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,680
you know?
And a lot of what the,

122
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:07,400
one of the horrible things about being a
parent is that you spend a tremendous

123
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:10,850
amount of your time making your child
less happy.

124
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,380
And the reason for that is that positive
emotion is a very impulsive,

125
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,611
you know,
and you know,

126
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,350
cause everybody says,
well you should be happy.

127
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,850
It's like,
well no,

128
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,310
when you're happy you're actually quite
stupid.

129
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,100
And so because happiness makes you
impulsive,

130
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:27,020
happiness makes happiness,
says,

131
00:06:27,021 --> 00:06:28,490
hey,
things are really good right now.

132
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:30,680
Get Wet.
You can while the getting's good.

133
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:35,660
And so as a like if you're a hyper
optimistic manic,

134
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,930
we'll say it's like every stock
investment looks like a really good

135
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:41,630
stock investment.
It's like you won't spend all your money

136
00:06:41,631 --> 00:06:43,760
because look at,
there's those wonderful things

137
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:45,950
everywhere and you could do such great
things with them.

138
00:06:45,951 --> 00:06:46,820
And then,
you know,

139
00:06:46,821 --> 00:06:50,810
you spend all your money and then you
crash and you think,

140
00:06:50,811 --> 00:06:52,310
Oh God,
my life's over.

141
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,210
You know,
cause I just,

142
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,750
I just spent all my money on all this
useless stuff.

143
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,390
And it's all under the grip of
impulsive,

144
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,220
positive emotion,
you know?

145
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:04,490
And so when,
when you're telling your kids to be

146
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:08,330
quiet and settled down,
it isn't because they're making a lot of

147
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:08,690
noise.

148
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,690
Being in pain is because they're running
around like wild baboons having a blast.

149
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,220
And disrupting things like mad,
you know,

150
00:07:16,221 --> 00:07:16,880
and say,
wow,

151
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,620
you got kids,
you got to settle down,

152
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,080
you know,
like quit having so much fun.

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,440
And it's,
it's kind of awful that you do that,

154
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,510
but,
but you do.

155
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:32,140
And that's because the emotions and the
motivations have to be brought into like

156
00:07:32,481 --> 00:07:35,270
a relationship with one another within
the person.

157
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,980
So that,
you know,

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,170
one thing I remember with my son who is
quite,

159
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,160
he's quite disagreeable by temperament,
which is actually a good thing as far as

160
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:45,770
I'm concerned,
although it brings its own challenges.

161
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,040
And so with my daughter,
when she was misbehaving,

162
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:54,340
she was pretty agreeable and uh,
you know,

163
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:57,620
if she was misbehaving,
I can basically just look at her and

164
00:07:57,621 --> 00:07:58,730
then she'd quit,
you know,

165
00:07:58,731 --> 00:07:59,900
but my son,
it was like,

166
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,880
that was just nothing.

167
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,930
You're looking at me.
It's like,

168
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:04,610
no,
that's just not going to go anywhere,

169
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:07,280
man.
And so then I'd like tell him to stop.

170
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:09,830
And that really wasn't having much of an
effect either.

171
00:08:09,831 --> 00:08:12,710
He just sort of maybe laugh or run away
or whatever.

172
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:14,180
I mean,
he was a tough little rat.

173
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,890
And you know what?
I would do with him is he would be doing

174
00:08:18,891 --> 00:08:21,870
something and identity or,
and he'd get upset and you know,

175
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,410
angry.
And so then I get them to sit on the

176
00:08:24,411 --> 00:08:27,170
steps and I had told him,
this is when he was about to,

177
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,131
I said,
look,

178
00:08:28,131 --> 00:08:29,990
you're going to sit on the steps.
That's time out.

179
00:08:29,991 --> 00:08:34,580
You're going to sit on the steps until
you've got control of yourself and you

180
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:38,060
can come back and be and play the family
game again.

181
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,450
I basically said,
be a civilized human being and then

182
00:08:41,451 --> 00:08:42,380
you're welcome again.

183
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,500
And so he'd sit on the steps.
It was so interesting to watch because

184
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,980
he was just enraged.
He'd sit there like if you ever seen a

185
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:52,520
two year old have a temper Tantrum,
it's really quite the bloody phenomena.

186
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,950
If you ever saw an adult do that,
you'd like,

187
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,970
you'd call nine one one right away.
It's like,

188
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:59,400
oh my God.
And I've seen adults do that.

189
00:08:59,401 --> 00:09:01,560
You know,
because people say with borderline

190
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:04,290
personality disorder will have temper
tantrums and it's like,

191
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,990
man,
you want to be about 30 feet away from

192
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:08,310
that person.
That's for sure.

193
00:09:08,311 --> 00:09:10,860
It's really,
but in kids it's like,

194
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,020
well first of all,
they're only this long,

195
00:09:13,021 --> 00:09:14,880
so how much trouble can they really
cause?

196
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:15,930
But it's like,
you know,

197
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,250
they're just completely gone there.
Like on the floor or their face is red.

198
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,210
They're just furious.
Like way more furious than you ever get

199
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,500
if you're even vaguely socialized there.

200
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:30,300
Just outraged and they're kicking and
hitting the ground and like,

201
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:33,180
it's like a little epileptic fit of
anger.

202
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:35,340
You know,
they're completely controlled by their

203
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:38,130
rage.
And we took care of one kid for a while

204
00:09:38,131 --> 00:09:40,700
who he was actually a pushover,
that kid,

205
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,950
you could get them to behave by,
you know,

206
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,600
kind of shaking your finger at him.
But his mother thought he was really

207
00:09:45,601 --> 00:09:49,050
tough because he had her,
he had her figured out and one of the

208
00:09:49,051 --> 00:09:51,060
things he would do is have a territory
temper tantrum.

209
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:55,110
And during the temper tantrum he would
hold his bloody breath until he turned

210
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,490
blue.
It's like,

211
00:09:56,491 --> 00:09:57,570
try that.
Like,

212
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,160
you know,
as that's your homework,

213
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,490
go home and go home and have a temper
tantrum and while you're doing it,

214
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:05,310
hold your breath until you actually turn
blue.

215
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,750
It's like you won't be able to do it.

216
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,260
You don't have the willpower of a two
year old now.

217
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:11,190
That's for sure.
That little varmint man,

218
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:13,710
he just have a fit.
Then he'd hold his breath and then he'd

219
00:10:13,711 --> 00:10:14,850
turn blue.
It was like,

220
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,743
wow,
that's,

221
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,750
that's amazing.
And we would just like,

222
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,450
let him do it.
You know,

223
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,010
he turned blue and everybody would be
gone and he'd come out of it,

224
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,470
you know,
and it didn't work.

225
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,040
So he just quit doing it.
I think he did it like twice and he

226
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,590
figured out,
oh well that's a lot of work for very

227
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:32,940
little outcome.
And you know,

228
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,870
it's not like two year olds are stupid.
They're,

229
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,950
they're not stupid.
They're probably smarter than you,

230
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,190
but they're not civilized by any stretch
of the imagination.

231
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:42,690
And so anyways,
back to my son,

232
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,970
I'd put him on the steps and he'd be
like,

233
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:49,980
[inaudible] just like aged and,
and trying to get himself together,

234
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,250
you know?
And I wait a few few,

235
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,340
I kind of strict rule,
which was as soon as you're done,

236
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,510
you're welcome again.
So it's completely under your control.

237
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,430
You,
you get yourself calmed down,

238
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:04,800
you come and talk to me again.
If you're calm enough,

239
00:11:04,801 --> 00:11:07,440
so I like you,
then you're welcome back in the family.

240
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:08,670
No grudge or nothing.
