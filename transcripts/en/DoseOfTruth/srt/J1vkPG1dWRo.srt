1
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:08,730
There's the,

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:11,110
the chemical makeup of
the classic psychedelics.

3
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:11,361
You see,

4
00:00:11,361 --> 00:00:13,360
they all have the same
fundamental structure.

5
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:14,710
This is serotonin.

6
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:17,320
That's the one of the major
brain neurotransmitters.

7
00:00:17,321 --> 00:00:20,050
And so what happens with the
psychedelics is that they,

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,900
they altered the,

9
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,420
they alter the brain function by
altering the neurochemical utilization of

10
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:29,410
serotonin.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:32,320
They changed the manner in which
the serotonergic systems work.

12
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,280
And that is the serotonin system is very
basic system may cause when you're an

13
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:38,350
embryo and your brain is developing,

14
00:00:38,351 --> 00:00:42,130
it's the serotonin projections that
basically orchestrate the development of

15
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:42,964
your brain.

16
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:43,780
So they're,

17
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,280
and they're very archaic circuits,

18
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:45,551
very,

19
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:46,780
very archaic circuits.

20
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:47,973
So,

21
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,230
and this is the paper,

22
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,260
I think I stole this from
a silicide Ben Griffiths,

23
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:57,560
who's been doing a lot of this research
siliciden can occasion mystical type

24
00:00:57,561 --> 00:01:01,040
experiences having substantial and
sustained personal meaning and spiritual

25
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:01,880
significance.

26
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,700
So why,

27
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:07,010
that's a good question.

28
00:01:07,011 --> 00:01:07,251
Right?

29
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:08,030
Like so,

30
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,470
so here's a question for you.

31
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:13,400
It is beyond dispute that human beings
are capable of religious experience.

32
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,523
Why?

33
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:16,760
Why is that?

34
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,593
Exactly?

35
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,591
And they're like,

36
00:01:18,591 --> 00:01:20,450
you can associate with psychosis,

37
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,600
but that doesn't work is the
theory doesn't hold a theory,

38
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:24,440
doesn't hold water.

39
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,670
It's not the same thing.

40
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,530
So why is it there?

41
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:28,483
Exactly.

42
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,211
And it,

43
00:01:30,211 --> 00:01:31,620
it's not an easy thing to figure out.

44
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:32,550
Like I've been trying to figure,

45
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,160
I'm always trying to figure out a
biological explanation for everything,

46
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:35,371
right?

47
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:38,400
Because if you want to find something to
stand on and you want to make sure that

48
00:01:38,401 --> 00:01:39,840
it can resist the challenge.

49
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,320
And so if I can find an explanation
for something that's reductionistic and

50
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:44,790
materialistic and biological,

51
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,170
then I'm going for that.

52
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,370
But that's a tough one.

53
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,140
Consciousness is a tough one.

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,810
The,

55
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,450
the moral sense is a tough one.

56
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,890
They're not easy things to crack.

57
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,360
The Big Bang is a tough one.

58
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,913
So,

59
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,120
you know,

60
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,371
I mean,

61
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,960
a cynic might say that maybe.

62
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:02,973
Yeah.

63
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,880
Sometimes when people
are close to suicide,

64
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,800
they'll have a mystical experience,

65
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:09,580
you know,

66
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,420
and you maybe you say,

67
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:10,601
well,

68
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:14,890
it's a last ditch attempt of your brain
to delude you into thinking that your

69
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:16,450
life has some significance.

70
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,200
You know?

71
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,330
And that's a plausible theory,

72
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:24,250
but I don't think it accounts for
the generality of the phenomena,

73
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,773
so,

74
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,180
so I don't buy it.
