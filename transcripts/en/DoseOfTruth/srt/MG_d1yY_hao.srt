1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm,

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,440
roughly 95 percent of the lyrics in pop
culture or about mating or there about

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,090
mating rituals.
There are about courtship rituals and

4
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:19,470
you as a person who is white,
the meeting has been upgraded by the

5
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:22,080
best and now includes,
okay.

6
00:00:22,081 --> 00:00:25,470
God knows what it was trying to tell us.
So at any rate,

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,700
um,
you have just emerged from childhood,

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:31,470
um,
your hormones,

9
00:00:31,471 --> 00:00:36,120
your sexual hormones and begun to act
girls as young as 11 can become pregnant

10
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:41,240
already and you were obsessed with
finding your place in the world and

11
00:00:41,521 --> 00:00:46,521
finding a mate and courtship rituals
mean an awful lot to you there about to

12
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:50,200
what they're there,
what you were about to embark on for the

13
00:00:50,201 --> 00:00:53,210
next 10 years of your life at least.
Um,

14
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:58,040
and so this obsession with courtship
rituals with mating and dating and

15
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:01,250
breaking up and,
and be trail and all of that kind of

16
00:01:01,251 --> 00:01:03,830
stuff makes,
makes absolute sense.

17
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,081
Right?
Exactly.

18
00:01:05,081 --> 00:01:07,000
Well,
and the thing is music frames that too

19
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:10,390
because it gives you something that's in
common with your potential mate.

20
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:15,280
And it also gives you a set of rather,
I wouldn't say stereotyped activities,

21
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:18,640
but at least predictable activities that
are associated with courtship and made

22
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:20,950
again,
so that would be going to concerts and

23
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:24,700
going to movies which are heavily
musically influenced and dancing and,

24
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,650
and even discussing your,
your shared immersement in whatever that

25
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,450
subculture happens to be.
Right.

26
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,640
And my guess is that at some point music
provokes oxytocin because oxytocin is

27
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,981
the ultimate bonding hormone and music
is a bath in the sense of human

28
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,500
belonging in the field.
But even if you're alone and you're

29
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:50,040
listening to Pandora or spotify all by
yourself,

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,940
it feeds you social,
bread and meat.

31
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,480
And in the,
in the nervous system,

32
00:01:56,481 --> 00:02:00,560
the central nervous system,
everything boils down to inhibition or

33
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:04,160
excitation.
There is a hormone of excitation and

34
00:02:04,161 --> 00:02:07,220
it's glutamate is a hormone of
inhibition,

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,700
and that's the Gaba and oxytocin feeds
down into the Gaba system.

36
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,850
The system that keeps you calm down.
Basically,

37
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,350
it gives you a sense of peace.
