1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,851
Here's why.

2
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:09,730
I want to talk to you about the brain
a little bit because if you make the

3
00:00:09,731 --> 00:00:10,570
radical case,

4
00:00:10,571 --> 00:00:15,280
let's say that these are actually the
categories of reality and we're going to

5
00:00:15,281 --> 00:00:15,461
say,

6
00:00:15,461 --> 00:00:18,310
well reality is what selects
for this for the sake of,

7
00:00:18,311 --> 00:00:18,791
for this,

8
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:19,870
for the sake of argument.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Then the then are our
neurological structures and
our physical structure should

10
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:27,850
be adapted to that reality.

11
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,713
It's it's,

12
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,500
it's a,

13
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,300
it's a necessary conclusion from that.

14
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:32,320
So then the question is,

15
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,460
well are they,

16
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,900
and as far as I can tell,

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,340
the answer to that is yes,

18
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:37,300
and so we'll,

19
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:38,320
we'll go through the,

20
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,160
the neuropsychological
evidence quite rapidly.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,070
The first bit of evidence is
that you have two hemispheres.

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,710
Why one deals with the unknown and the
other deals with the known that sale

23
00:00:50,711 --> 00:00:51,670
Conan Goldberg.

24
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,060
And that's,

25
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:55,120
that's hypothesized completely
independently of any of this underlying

26
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:56,350
mythological substructure,

27
00:00:56,530 --> 00:01:00,850
which is really important thing to note
because if you're trying to determine

28
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:02,650
whether or not something is true,

29
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,430
valid,

30
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:07,960
if the constructs upon which you base
your thinking are valid and true,

31
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,640
there's rules for doing that.

32
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,180
And one of the rules is you have to
be able to detect the existence of the

33
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,640
categories using multiple methods of,

34
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,863
of uh,

35
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,440
of,

36
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,610
of what,

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,810
using multiple methods.

38
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,390
It's the multi-method multitrack matrix.

39
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,470
Technically speaking,

40
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:28,450
it was established as a technique by
two psychologists named crone back C,

41
00:01:28,451 --> 00:01:28,691
R,

42
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:29,141
O n,

43
00:01:29,141 --> 00:01:29,351
B,

44
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:29,531
a,

45
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:30,970
c h and meal M,

46
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:32,140
e e h l,

47
00:01:32,141 --> 00:01:34,990
Paul Meehl back in the
1950s when psychologists,

48
00:01:34,991 --> 00:01:38,230
we're trying to figure out how do you
determine if something actually has an

49
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,650
existence like anger or anxiety
as something that you could study

50
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:42,484
scientifically.

51
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,361
And the answer is,

52
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:47,320
well you have to be able to measure it
multiple ways and all those measurements

53
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:49,540
have to read the same way.

54
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,770
And then the question is,

55
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:50,921
well,

56
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,470
what do you mean by multiple ways?

57
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,880
Cause his sight and vision and his sight
and hearing different while somewhat

58
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:58,960
and somewhat the same,

59
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,400
but you know,

60
00:02:00,401 --> 00:02:00,760
you do,

61
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,890
you make them as different
as you can manage,

62
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:03,340
let's say.

63
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:06,190
And our sensory systems
are quite different smell,

64
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,150
molecular signature sound is auditory are,

65
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:10,541
you know,

66
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,440
auditory pressure.

67
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:15,370
You need a gas around you or some
liquid in order for that to occur.

68
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,630
Site uses light.

69
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:16,841
You know,

70
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:17,051
we're,

71
00:02:17,051 --> 00:02:20,890
we're using different inputs that
converge and allow us to say,

72
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,041
well,

73
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:23,890
if we get convergent information
across these multiple measurements,

74
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,710
then we'll assume that the
thing we're perceiving as real,

75
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,970
we even extend that in science because
we say if you take your multiple

76
00:02:30,971 --> 00:02:32,920
measurement system and
you take your multiple,

77
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,480
multiple measurement system and then
you compare them will only allow what's

78
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:40,210
constant across both those
comparisons to be real.

79
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,980
And so that's the multi-method multi
trade matrix process essentially.

80
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,120
And my sense is that,

81
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:48,751
so I,

82
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,130
I think that the pattern
that I'm describing to you,

83
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:53,290
it's manifested itself evolutionarily.

84
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,820
It manifest itself at the neural,

85
00:02:54,821 --> 00:02:59,050
in the learner logical space
and it manifest itself in
the conceptual space and

86
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,850
probability of all three of those things
happening at the same time without

87
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,170
there being something valid.

88
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,170
There is lessons with each
level of interpretation you
manage to stack on top of

89
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,374
one another.

90
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,311
So that's the,

91
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,150
that's the method.

92
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,480
Well,

93
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,220
so,

94
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,310
well let's think about the
brain a little bit and I'll,

95
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,680
I'll tell you a little bit
about how the brain works and,

96
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,861
and you know,

97
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,230
a lot of this stuff I'm telling
you right now is quite old.

98
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:26,591
Actually.

99
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,270
Most of it was worked out in the 19,

100
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,650
in the 1980s but it's been remarkably
stable as far as I can tell.

101
00:03:32,651 --> 00:03:35,830
In some sense we're filling in the
details and not in every sense,

102
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:38,140
but in some sense we're
filling in the details.

103
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:38,381
Okay.

104
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,100
So you take,

105
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,910
this is from Alexander
Luria who was the greatest,

106
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,340
perhaps the greatest
neuropsychologist who ever lived.

107
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,230
He was a Russian,

108
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,860
uh,

109
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,311
more work,

110
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:49,710
mostly after the Second World War,

111
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:51,370
mostly on people who had brain damage.

112
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:54,400
And he was interested in
trying to outline the,

113
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,473
the,

114
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,190
the,

115
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,023
the,

116
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,920
the overarching picture of brain function.

117
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,130
And so he did that partly
by looking at its function,

118
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:05,140
but also partly by
looking at its structure,

119
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,960
trying to get both of those
things working simultaneously.

120
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,590
And so we'll go through a brief
picture of how the brain works.

121
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:12,820
And so one of the ways of,

122
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,890
so you can,

123
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,070
you can look at the brain from front to
back and you can divided roughly into

124
00:04:18,071 --> 00:04:21,430
two sections and one section has to
do with sensory processing and that's

125
00:04:21,431 --> 00:04:25,570
roughly the back half and one
section has to do with motor output.

126
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,980
Now those things aren't,

127
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:30,510
has clearly differentiated as
you might think because you,

128
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,610
there's very little sensation
without motor output.

129
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:34,653
Maybe the,

130
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:35,880
the pot,

131
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,900
the closest to an exception is smell,

132
00:04:37,901 --> 00:04:38,321
I would say.

133
00:04:38,321 --> 00:04:40,000
But you at least have to breathe in,

134
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:40,661
you know,

135
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:43,270
and when an animal is actively
searching out a scent trail,

136
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:43,990
it's breathing in.

137
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,281
So it's,

138
00:04:44,281 --> 00:04:47,890
it's using its motor output constantly
to modify the sensory stream.

139
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,020
It's really difficult
to dissociate the two.

140
00:04:50,021 --> 00:04:51,550
And when you're looking at something,

141
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:51,880
you know,

142
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,960
it kind of feels to you like you're
a passive recipient of sense data,

143
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,400
but you're no such thing.

144
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,400
Your eyes are,

145
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,170
are moving back and forth in
multiple ways all the time,

146
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,050
including the ways that you
can control voluntarily.

147
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:08,380
So there's multiple involuntary systems
that are moving your eyes in multiple

148
00:05:08,381 --> 00:05:08,950
ways.

149
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:11,050
And really what you're
doing is feeling the,

150
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,000
the array of,

151
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,230
of electromagnetic,

152
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,420
of the electromagnetic
spectrum with your eyes.

153
00:05:16,421 --> 00:05:19,930
You're feeling it and you're actively
exploring if you're not a passive

154
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:20,980
recipient at all.

155
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,530
So even in sensation,

156
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,420
you can't purely pull sensation
out for motor processing and say,

157
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:33,421
I'm getting untrammeled unbiased census
data because you can't look at something

158
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:38,800
without focusing and you can't focus
without wanting to look at something.

159
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,340
You know,

160
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,590
you can't just lie there with you while
you could with your eyes have cross.

161
00:05:42,591 --> 00:05:43,540
But you know,

162
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,500
that's sort of like,

163
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:49,900
imagine you dropped a video recorder from
an airplane and it just spun around in

164
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:50,920
an unfocused manner.

165
00:05:50,921 --> 00:05:53,620
Well that's the world sampled randomly.

166
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:53,930
You know,

167
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:54,421
why do you,

168
00:05:54,421 --> 00:05:55,480
what are you gonna do with that?

169
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:56,343
Nothing.

170
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:56,861
And you know,

171
00:05:56,861 --> 00:05:57,140
your,

172
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,730
you're concentrating on the,

173
00:05:58,820 --> 00:05:59,653
on the,

174
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,080
on the auditory stream constantly
and segregating out some things and

175
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,210
suppressing others.

176
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,950
Like if you listen in the classroom,

177
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,703
you can hear

178
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,180
probably four or five different types
of mechanical noise going on at the same

179
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:17,014
time.

180
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,320
Most of the time in the
classroom that's silent.

181
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,500
You don't hear it like you don't hear
your fridge except when it turns on or

182
00:06:23,501 --> 00:06:23,831
off.

183
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:28,150
Right is zero that out and so you're
very selective in your perception,

184
00:06:28,810 --> 00:06:33,810
so you can't really technically separate
out motor output from sensory input and

185
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:38,200
that's really useful to know because
it destroys the idea that you're just a

186
00:06:38,201 --> 00:06:38,710
path.

187
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:42,160
You know that there's that
world of sensation out there
that's imprinting itself

188
00:06:42,161 --> 00:06:44,740
on you and that's how
you get your information,

189
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:45,640
which is really the,

190
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,500
that's the fundamental presupposition of
the empiricists of the raw empiricists.

191
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,450
There's a world of sense data out there.

192
00:06:52,451 --> 00:06:54,730
You sample it randomly and
that's what informs you.

193
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,090
It's like,

194
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:55,900
yes,

195
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,640
except that you're always an active
harvest or of the information so you can't

196
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:02,830
get rid of the interpretive
structure a priority.

197
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,570
That was a manual count by the way,

198
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,480
who first established out in
his critique of pure reason.

199
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,160
You can't get away from the fact that
you're actively harvesting the data so you

200
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:12,491
can say,

201
00:07:12,491 --> 00:07:12,641
well,

202
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,140
where does human structure come from?

203
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,720
The sense data that's sort
of the blank slate idea.

204
00:07:16,721 --> 00:07:21,550
It's like no wrong because a blank
slate cannot process information.

205
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,130
You're actively engaged
right at the beginning.

206
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,280
So that's another example of
the knower and the unknown.

207
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,653
You know,

208
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:33,690
working in a cyclical manner because you
interact with something you divided up

209
00:07:33,971 --> 00:07:35,860
into you,

210
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:39,670
you and the world roughly speaking and
I mean you really make it that way cause

211
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:42,940
you build yourself out of the information
and then of course that makes you a

212
00:07:42,941 --> 00:07:46,480
more differentiated processor
with a broader range of skills.

213
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,040
Then you interact with the unknown.

214
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:48,371
Again,

215
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:50,140
you gather more information at,

216
00:07:50,141 --> 00:07:51,370
differentiates the world.

217
00:07:51,371 --> 00:07:53,980
It makes you a more
differentiated harvester.

218
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:57,880
And then so it's just continually
cycling and that consciousness,

219
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:58,630
the logos,

220
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:03,630
the knower is that thing that's doing
that harvesting and you can never say it's

221
00:08:03,821 --> 00:08:04,690
not there.

222
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,350
Now what happens is that it's in
it's nascent form to begin with,

223
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:09,400
low resolution,

224
00:08:09,401 --> 00:08:10,300
nascent form,

225
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,070
low resolution knower,

226
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,410
low resolution category system,

227
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,850
low resolution world.

228
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:19,870
But that's enough to kickstart it
and to start a differentiating.

229
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,200
And that happens as you
develop as an individual

230
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,810
because you start out as
a single celled organism,

231
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,160
for all intents and purposes,

232
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,000
a very low resolution thing in
a very low resolution world.

233
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,190
And that differentiates
itself across time.

234
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,710
But exactly the same thing
happened over evolutionary time.

235
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,203
So,

236
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,080
so there isn't a time when those
three elements aren't there.

237
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,850
For all intents and purposes,

238
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,960
they're always there.

239
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,680
They're permanent.
