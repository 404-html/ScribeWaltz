00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,110
I've recently developed a nasty
case of hitting the phobia,

2
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:13,450
generally suffer from
anxiety surrounding sleep.

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,850
It's become a significant
negative force in my life,

4
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:16,750
cause unknown,

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,170
I'm rather well put together and
successful across many domains.

6
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:21,010
Any advice?

7
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:22,143
Yes,

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,350
go to bed later.

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:27,790
So one of the things that happens to
people when they're having a hard time

10
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,880
going to sleep and their sleep is
disrupted is that they tend to go to bed

11
00:00:30,881 --> 00:00:32,560
earlier to catch up on their sleep.

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,670
And that actually has
a counter that's cut,

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,730
that works at counter purposes to
what they're trying to attempt.

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,780
What you want to do is delay your
sleep until you're really quite tired.

15
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:45,040
So stay up much later.

16
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:46,670
Get up at the same time in the morning,

17
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,420
but move your sleep time later,

18
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,210
maybe half an hour night until
you actually do fall asleep.

19
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,080
Um,

20
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,430
the other thing that you could look into
is that there are relaxation exercises.

21
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,170
Behavior therapist offered those,

22
00:00:59,171 --> 00:01:02,260
but I'm sure you could find one
online at a breathing exercise.

23
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:06,730
And so often what you do is imagine
you're laying in your bed and you're

24
00:01:06,731 --> 00:01:07,241
nervous.

25
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:11,980
And so what you do is you concentrate
on your feet and you flex your toes and

26
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:13,990
then breathe in and out and relax them.

27
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:17,470
And then you flex your ankles
or their soles of your feet and,

28
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,620
and breathe in and out and relax and do
that with every muscle group all the way

29
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:27,130
up your body and remember to breathe
deeply and regularly and that can help

30
00:01:27,131 --> 00:01:28,330
regulate your anxiety.

31
00:01:28,331 --> 00:01:32,590
So I would say stay up later
till you're clearly tired.

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,490
Um,

33
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:35,950
the other thing you might try
is sleeping in a different room.

34
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,113
Um,

35
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:41,950
and then the final thing is there are
pretty effective sleep medications like

36
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,810
Zap laplant for example,

37
00:01:43,811 --> 00:01:45,520
which is seems to be pretty effective.

38
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:47,770
And if you're really having
a hard time sleeping,

39
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:52,150
maybe you could try something like
that and see if it and see if it helps.

40
00:01:52,151 --> 00:01:53,440
You don't have to try it forever.

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,100
But,

42
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,360
so the simplest thing to do though is
to go to bed later and because you'll be

43
00:01:58,361 --> 00:02:00,410
more tired and more likely
to fall asleep then.

44
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,410
And it's really not going
to cause you any trouble,

45
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:04,210
so that's what I recommend.

46
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,180
Okay.
