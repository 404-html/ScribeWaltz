1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:09,220
It really started when I was about 13.

2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,540
I was a junior high school student and,

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,393
um,

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,870
I met this librarian who's
kind of an eccentric person,

5
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,820
very well educated person,

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:25,683
and she,

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,920
we,

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,800
I used to hang around with my
delinquent friends in the library,

9
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:33,970
which tells you how eccentric
the librarian was because
that's not normally the

10
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:37,060
place where the delinquent kids hang out,

11
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:37,870
you know?

12
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:42,070
But she talked to us like we
were adults and that was a,

13
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,171
what would you call it,

14
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,040
a refreshing.

15
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,130
That was a refreshing experience.

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,563
And uh,

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:55,600
she knew that I liked to read and
she started giving me real books.

18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,370
She gave me one day in the
life of Ivan Denisovich,

19
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:05,371
which was the first book published by
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the Soviet

20
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:05,530
Union.

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:05,770
It's,

22
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,100
it's a story about the day
of a political prisoner in a,

23
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:09,580
in a,

24
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,580
in a work camp and brave new world and
1984 and animal farm and Ayn Rand's

25
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:17,381
books,

26
00:01:17,381 --> 00:01:22,360
which was quite interesting because she
was the wife of our member of parliament

27
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:26,620
who was the only member of the
opposition in our province.

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,620
And he was a socialist and
NDP new Democratic Party
leader as a matter of fact.

29
00:01:31,871 --> 00:01:32,704
And,

30
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,760
but despite that,

31
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:38,290
she gave me Ayn Rand's books because she
thought that I should be exposed to the

32
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,030
other side of the argument.

33
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,040
So I read atlas shrugged and,

34
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,393
um,

35
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,650
the fountain head and well,

36
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,390
she was the first person who
helped me discover literature,

37
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,313
let's say.

38
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:59,730
And while at the same time I got
interested in what had happened in Nazi

39
00:02:00,971 --> 00:02:01,730
Germany.

40
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:06,610
Then I wrote an essay about that when I
was about 13 or 14 about Auschwitz and

41
00:02:06,611 --> 00:02:07,450
what had happened there.

42
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:09,280
And I never read that,

43
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:10,990
really never left my mind.

44
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,913
I would say,

45
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,880
I think I read Viktor Frankl's man's
search for meaning at that point,

46
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,470
which is a book I would highly recommend.

47
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,020
I have a reading list on
my website by the way,

48
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,520
at Jordan B.

49
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,151
Peterson Dotcom.

50
00:02:22,151 --> 00:02:26,110
And so there's a variety of books there
that have really influenced me and I put

51
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:27,810
them up for other people's,

52
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:28,570
um,

53
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,403
use.

54
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,330
Anyways.

55
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,950
I never,

56
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:37,240
what I learned about Auschwitz and about
Nazi Germany never really left my mind.

57
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:41,920
And because I couldn't understand
how people could act that way,

58
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,210
how they could not only be possessed
by an ideology to the degree that the

59
00:02:46,211 --> 00:02:48,850
Germans were in a very civilized country,

60
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:49,301
Germany,

61
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:49,511
you know,

62
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:50,320
so it was,

63
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:55,320
I suppose even a more spectacular shock
that something so catastrophic happened

64
00:02:55,451 --> 00:02:55,960
there.

65
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,910
There wasn't just the
ideological possession,

66
00:02:57,911 --> 00:03:02,440
it was the cruelty and the gratuitous
cruelty in the service of that ideological

67
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:04,030
possession that I couldn't understand.

68
00:03:04,031 --> 00:03:04,864
It didn't,

69
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:08,730
I couldn't establish a relationship
between my own being and,

70
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,660
and those patterns of action.

71
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,050
And as I got older,

72
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,520
that concern transformed
itself into an obsession.

73
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:22,240
I would say not so much with what
had happened to Nazi Germany,

74
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:23,643
but with,

75
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,300
I think what happened,

76
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,580
what was happening as a consequence
of the collectivist philosophy per se,

77
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:36,030
which you might think of something that
manifested itself both on the right in

78
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:41,071
Nazi Germany and then on the left in
all the multitudeness and catastrophic

79
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:46,510
communist regimes that characterized
the bulk of the 20th century.

80
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,520
And they're insane.

81
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:53,790
Murderousness and that probably
culminated for me in the 1970s when I Read

82
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:57,850
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
the Gulag archipelago,

83
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:02,850
which is another book that everyone
should read because in some sense it might

84
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,560
be the defining document
of the 20th century.

85
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,270
And the fact that everyone in the West
isn't familiar with that book is actually

86
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:14,080
a signal of our
catastrophic moral failing,

87
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,943
I would say.

88
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,443
Um,

89
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,920
I started writing this book called maps
of meaning in about 1985 although I had

90
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,240
been working on variants
of it before that.

91
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,840
And what I was trying to understand
was maybe the psychological

92
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,770
motivations for the Cold War,

93
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:36,940
something like that.

94
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,640
Many of you are old enough to remember
what it was like in the 1980s we just

95
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:44,680
went and visited the house in,

96
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,520
in Reykjavik where
Gorbachev and Reagan met,

97
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:50,050
which was quite something to see.

98
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,460
And when they decided they were going to
bring at least some of the insanity to

99
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,480
irrelative halt,

100
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,523
thank God.

101
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,110
And the 80s were a very contentious time.

102
00:04:59,140 --> 00:04:59,411
You know,

103
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:04,411
the Cold War sort of peaked in two at
two times a peaked in 1962 during the

104
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,010
Cuban missile crisis.

105
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,300
I don't know if you know this,

106
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:10,330
but I w I visited a uh,

107
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:13,420
nuclear missile site in Arizona

108
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,330
both 10 years ago.

109
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:18,070
It was a decommissioned missile site,

110
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,750
intercontinental ballistic missile,

111
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,560
intercontinental ballistic missile is
a very large rocket and can go halfway

112
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,020
around the world and its ballistic,

113
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,420
which means it has the
same function as a bullet.

114
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,820
And the bullet is ballistic
because once you fire it,

115
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,900
it's gone.

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,400
You don't control it after it.

117
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,241
It leaves.

118
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,010
So once you launch a ballistic missile,

119
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,660
it's launched,

120
00:05:37,661 --> 00:05:38,890
there's no calling back.

121
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,830
And they told us they
did a simulation launch,

122
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,210
which was very eerie thing.

123
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,720
And so to launch a nuclear
missile is a big console.

124
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:51,721
It sort of looks like the star
Trek control a control module,

125
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:54,874
let's say.

126
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,010
And One person stands here.

127
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,600
One person stands about 20 feet away,

128
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,080
each have a key around their neck
and they put the key in the lock

129
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,090
simultaneously and then turn it for 10
seconds and at the end of 10 seconds the

130
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:09,050
missile is gone.

131
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,670
And that's that.

132
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,230
And they both had their
keys in the lock in 1962 so,

133
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,600
and we came close again in 1984 when,

134
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,860
I don't know if you know this,

135
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:23,861
but there's Soviet missile
detection system signal.

136
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:28,370
The launch of four or five missiles
from North America and a single Russian

137
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,520
soldier decided that it was a false
alarm and refuse to push the button that

138
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:39,920
would have resulted in major retaliation.

139
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:41,300
He just died about a year ago.

140
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:43,310
You can read about him on Wikipedia.

141
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,241
Anyways,

142
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:47,530
I read soldier Nixon in 1970s and,

143
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,400
and I made me,

144
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,790
me even I would say more obsessed
with what was happening in,

145
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,100
in on the world stage.

146
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,140
I was trying to understand why it was that

147
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,820
the systems of belief that we inhabited,

148
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:06,710
let's say one typifying the Soviet
Union and in similar states,

149
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
Maoist China,

150
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:08,900
North Korea,

151
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,370
wonderful places like
that versus the West.

152
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,310
We each had our own way
of construing the world,

153
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,630
the ways of construing the world
were set at odds with one another.

154
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,000
And the fact that they were set at
odds with one another appeared to be so

155
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,150
significant that we'd armed ourselves with

156
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,050
50,000

157
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,000
yeah,

158
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,910
hydro hydrogen bombs on each side,

159
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:37,744
something like that.

160
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,880
And I don't know how much
you know about hydrogen bomb.

161
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,361
You know,

162
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:41,710
you know about atomic bombs,

163
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:45,850
you know that a hydrogen bomb has
an atomic bomb for the trigger,

164
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:48,470
right?

165
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,010
So,

166
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,530
so like the atom bomb that
was dropped on Hiroshima,

167
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:54,080
that was something that
was a fission bomb,

168
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,850
not standard atomic bomb,

169
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:56,690
the first generation,

170
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,960
but hydrogen bomb is incontestably
more powerful than that.

171
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:06,830
And we were producing them
in the tens of thousands.

172
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:08,720
It's not like we don't have any now,

173
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:13,721
but it was really some insanity in the
1980s and people seem to have a very

174
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:16,220
itchy trigger finger.

175
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,670
So I was very confused
about this in two ways.

176
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,580
One from a psychological perspective,

177
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:23,900
because by that time I had just studied,

178
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,480
decided to study psychology
instead of political science,

179
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:28,820
which was my original major.

180
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,230
I get,

181
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:33,140
I got disenchanted with political science
because I didn't believe that people

182
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:36,170
were fundamentally motivated
by economic issues.

183
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,760
I still don't believe that that's true.

184
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,120
They're motivated by whatever
they're motivated by.

185
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,650
It can't be captured by economics,

186
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:43,410
not,

187
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,300
not precisely.

188
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,150
It's very curious about what it was that
was so important about a belief system

189
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,990
that people would risk putting the
entire planet to the torch to ensure that

190
00:08:56,371 --> 00:09:00,690
their particular mode of construing
the world prevailed was an interesting

191
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,650
psychological problem.

192
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:06,651
What was so important about belief
system that would justify destroying

193
00:09:06,691 --> 00:09:07,171
everything,

194
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:07,461
let's say,

195
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:09,000
or risking destroying everything,

196
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,430
because that was certainly the
situation we put ourselves in.
