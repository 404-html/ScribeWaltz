00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:26,630
[inaudible] [inaudible]

2
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:27,410
oh well,

3
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:28,191
welcome everyone.

4
00:00:28,191 --> 00:00:30,260
I'm assuming that applause was not for me.

5
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:37,270
My name is Bill Flanagan and I'm the dean
of law here at Queen's University and

6
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:43,781
I am pleased to welcome all of you here
today for the inaugural liberty lecture,

7
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:49,570
generously sponsored by Greg [inaudible]
law 80 a long time and very generous

8
00:00:49,671 --> 00:00:53,200
supporter of the law school and Greg is
here today and I just want to corrupt

9
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,270
the join me in thanking
Greg for sponsoring this

10
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,530
[inaudible] [inaudible].

11
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,600
The Liberty Lecture is intended to
explore the meaning of liberty in our

12
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,920
contemporary society,

13
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,700
a subject of rich
interest to philosophers,

14
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,200
political scientists,

15
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,820
and legal scholars.

16
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,080
Just to name a few.

17
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:27,540
And today's liberty lecture is moderated
by Professor Bruce Party to my right of

18
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:31,980
the Faculty of Law and
experts in a variety of areas,

19
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,110
including environmental law,

20
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,510
environmental law and governance,

21
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,520
ecosystem management,

22
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,990
climate change,

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,340
water law,

24
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,840
and university governance.

25
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:45,810
Our guest today is Dr. Jordan Peterson,

26
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,140
a professor of psychology at
the University of Toronto,

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,360
and a clinical psychologist.

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,320
His many publications include
his recently published book,

29
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,150
12 rules for life,

30
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,510
an antidote to chaos and his research
spans a number of topics including the

31
00:02:02,611 --> 00:02:07,611
psychology of religion and the modern
understanding of creativity and

32
00:02:07,741 --> 00:02:08,574
personality.

33
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:14,670
I know that today's lecture has generated
a great deal of interest as is evident

34
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,590
from the packed hall here today.

35
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,920
It's also generated a
certain amount of heat.

36
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,290
The proposed topic,

37
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,440
the rising tide of compelled speech in
Canada is for many a controversial one

38
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,110
and I know that many of you in the
audience will hold widely divergent views.

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,140
I fully support your opportunity to be
heard and should you wish challenge the

40
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:42,210
speakers to defend their positions.

41
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,550
I know that today's speakers likewise
share this conviction and we'll welcome

42
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,610
your comments and questions as might be
appropriate for a lecture series named

43
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,110
after liberty.

44
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,610
I believe it is also important for me
to affirm at the outset that the core

45
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,640
values of the Faculty of law end of
Queens University include academic freedom

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,930
and respectful dialogue among
those with differing views.

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:16,030
This includes providing our speakers
with the opportunity to be heard and

48
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:20,830
providing all of you with the
opportunity to respond in a respectful

49
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,753
environment,

50
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,590
free from any harassment or any
attempts to shut down the conversation.

51
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,300
So it is in this spirit of free and
respectful academic exchange that I'm

52
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:35,230
pleased to launch or
this new lecture series.

53
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,550
Welcome again and welcome to our guest
and I look forward to our discussion.

54
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:40,503
Thank you.

55
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:45,520
[inaudible].

56
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,473
Okay,

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:54,993
thank you bill.

58
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,300
Welcome and thank you for coming.

59
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:02,170
I would like to underline what bill said,

60
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:07,171
which is that this event would not
have happened without the initiative in

61
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,430
support of Greg kids asking you.

62
00:04:09,431 --> 00:04:10,151
So Greg,

63
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:11,260
thank you very much

64
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:17,190
[inaudible]

65
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,231
as well.

66
00:04:19,231 --> 00:04:20,100
Before we start,

67
00:04:20,101 --> 00:04:24,510
I would like to thank some
people from the Faculty of Law,

68
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,320
Diane Butler at him,

69
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:31,340
Blake Galippo and Christina Julian for
their help in putting this together.

70
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,740
I would also like to
acknowledge the support,

71
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:42,770
help and generous assistance of
several people around the university.

72
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,210
Uh,

73
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:47,190
Lisa plater and event services,

74
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:51,060
David Patterson and the
campus security office.

75
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:52,500
Uh,

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,090
you have been professional,

77
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,640
helpful,

78
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,680
straightforward and I thank you
very much for making this possible.

79
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:04,910
I would also like to return to
being Flanagan's observation
about the importance

80
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:12,531
of this moment and to acknowledge
the role that both being Flanigan and

81
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:18,681
principal wolf have played in enhancing
the reputation of this university in

82
00:05:21,661 --> 00:05:26,070
terms of its commitment to academic
freedom and academic debate.

83
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,690
They have

84
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,250
reflected an unflinching
commitment to those ideas.

85
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:35,160
As Principal Wolf said on his blog,

86
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,580
informed respectful debate
is central to academia.

87
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,450
And Gentlemen,

88
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,970
I salute your academic statesmanship.

89
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:45,804
Thank you very much.

90
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,920
[inaudible]

91
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:57,980
so

92
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,410
we're going to proceed as follows.

93
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,070
A the first thing I would like to say is
that in the hall behind you afterwards,

94
00:06:04,071 --> 00:06:06,860
there will be some of
Jordan's books on sale.

95
00:06:06,861 --> 00:06:07,430
12.

96
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,263
Um,

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,021
what,

98
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:09,860
what's the title again?

99
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:12,860
12 rules for like 12,

100
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,050
12 rules for like wanting
to get the 12 what it was,

101
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:15,900
right?

102
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:16,280
It's not,

103
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,190
that's not 12 steps.

104
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:18,140
It's 12 rules.

105
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,123
Right?

106
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,773
Um,

107
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,630
we are going to proceed as follows.

108
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:30,160
Jordan and I are going to have
a conversation for half an hour,

109
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,310
maybe 40 minutes and then we are going
to throw the floor open to questions.

110
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,480
We'll describe what kinds of questions
that you should ask later on when we get

111
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,314
to that stage,

112
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,440
but our topic is the rising tide
of compelled speech in Canada.

113
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,310
I am going to take just a couple of
minutes to give us some context and set it

114
00:06:55,311 --> 00:07:00,311
up and then I'll ask Jordan
to tell us what he thinks.

115
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:10,640
You may have seen the CBC
production of the tutors.

116
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,250
The story of King Henry the eighth

117
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,550
in one episode,

118
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:22,710
the king has condemned
Thomas Moore to death

119
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:29,400
for refusing to say that the king
is the head of the Church of England

120
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:35,250
more isn't his cell awaiting execution.

121
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,540
A friend comes to him to plead with
him to say what it is the king wants to

122
00:07:44,921 --> 00:07:45,754
hear.

123
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Morris says he cannot do that for
he does not believe it to be true.

124
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,640
Yeah.

125
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,610
In exasperate

126
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,050
the friends says,

127
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,400
you don't have to believe it.

128
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,610
You just have to say it.

129
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:15,650
When your brain makes
that kind of calculation,

130
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:21,380
you know you are under
the thumb of a tyrant

131
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,230
and Thomas Moore lost his head.

132
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,500
The tide of compelled
speech in Canada is rising.

133
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:40,660
The Law Society of Ontario has introduced
a new policy that requires each lawyer

134
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:47,291
to develop a statement of Principles
which endorses and acknowledges an

135
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,430
obligation to promote certain values.

136
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:59,990
The Ontario Human Rights Commission
says that under the Human Rights Code,

137
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:06,770
failing to address somebody by their
preferred Pronoun will constitute

138
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:13,610
discrimination for which you may
be investigated and prosecuted.

139
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,980
The Elementary Teachers,

140
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:22,820
Federation of Ontario has
introduced new curriculum

141
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,320
to require teachers to teach elementary
students about white privilege

142
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:37,860
and the Federal Summer Jay Grants Program
requires applicants to attest to the

143
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:39,574
values,

144
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:41,770
but the government believes it.

145
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:44,180
Okay.

146
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,740
They don't have to believe it.

147
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,790
[inaudible] [inaudible]

148
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,080
that's pure narcissism at work.

149
00:10:51,081 --> 00:10:51,730
By the way,

150
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:56,730
[inaudible]

151
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:11,910
you do to hijack hijacking event like
this that other people put time and effort

152
00:11:12,221 --> 00:11:17,221
into and to use the civility of the crowd
and the civility of the organizers as

153
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,710
an excuse to blatantly yellow.

154
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,360
You're ill informed opinions is no
way to conduct a civil dialogue.

155
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:26,650
It's absolutely appalling.

156
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,461
The people who do that,

157
00:11:27,461 --> 00:11:28,294
she'd be embarrassed.

158
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:38,700
[inaudible] [inaudible]

159
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,740
I would also say that as
students and his faculty members,

160
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,150
you shouldn't put up with it.

161
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,570
There's no way that you should allow
people who are doing this to hijack your

162
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:53,190
educational opportunities and
to bend and twist the functions,

163
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,670
the structures of the university.

164
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,320
It's not a good thing.

165
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,430
Not In any way at all.

166
00:11:57,810 --> 00:12:01,030
He would say that was a very
disgraceful display fundamentally.

167
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,320
So let's,

168
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,183
let's stick with it.

169
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:04,503
Why,

170
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,970
why do you think people
are afraid of free speech?

171
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,160
Well,

172
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:12,993
you know,

173
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,570
people develop an ideological view of the
world because they don't want to think

174
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:21,220
through things in real detail and they're
aided and embedded in that endeavor by

175
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:23,860
their pathological professors
who were feeding them.

176
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,793
Uh,

177
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:27,250
what would I say over simplified?

178
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,110
An oversimplified radical view
of the world in my estimation,

179
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,510
is fundamentally based in,

180
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,480
in resentment.

181
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,910
Not that there's no reason for say,

182
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,400
a left wing view of the world
and we can get to that later.

183
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,670
It's,

184
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,830
it's easy virtue.

185
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:42,610
You know,

186
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:47,080
you can stand up in front of 900 people
with your black card and your and your

187
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,340
screeching and you can,

188
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,740
you can declaim to the entire audience,

189
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:52,600
your fundamental moral superiority.

190
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:54,100
You can tell everyone at,

191
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,490
at once that they're all beneath you
and you're standing for the right thing.

192
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,410
And absolutely none of that is earned.

193
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:00,281
You know,

194
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:00,461
like,

195
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:00,880
what the hell?

196
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,020
What the hell was that?

197
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,120
There's no seriously man.

198
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,931
There's just,

199
00:13:04,931 --> 00:13:06,520
it's just complete misbehavior.

200
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,611
It's embarrassing.

201
00:13:07,611 --> 00:13:11,170
And the fact that the people who do
that don't have enough sense to go hide

202
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:14,350
their head in shame just tells you
how badly socialized they are and how

203
00:13:14,351 --> 00:13:15,790
terribly educated they are.

204
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:16,841
And the thing is,

205
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:20,650
the thing that's so awful is that there
are professors and educators who promote

206
00:13:20,651 --> 00:13:20,921
that.

207
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:21,131
They say,

208
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:21,281
well,

209
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:22,450
that's how you change the world.

210
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,860
It's like it is how you change the world,

211
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:25,750
but it's certainly not
how you make it better.

212
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,040
You make it worse.

213
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:28,083
Clearly,

214
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,193
you know,

215
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,230
there's no comfort and out
and there's nothing about it,

216
00:13:32,231 --> 00:13:33,040
this impressive.

217
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:33,790
It's no,

218
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:37,210
it's no better in some sense than a two
year old having a tantrum on the floor.

219
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:37,830
It's a,

220
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,850
it shows as far as I'm concerned,

221
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,940
it approximate the same level
of psychosocial development.

222
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:46,180
So when the fact that that
this is happening continually,

223
00:13:46,181 --> 00:13:47,110
universities is,

224
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,060
it's,

225
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,550
it truly makes me embarrassed to
be associated with the university.

226
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,630
And now I say that with great
displeasure because you know,

227
00:13:55,631 --> 00:13:59,110
I've been working for great universities
for a very long time and the university

228
00:13:59,111 --> 00:14:01,450
is an absolutely remarkable institution.

229
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:01,631
You know,

230
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,420
it's survived for a thousand years and,

231
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,680
and to see it,

232
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,420
to see it brought down by,

233
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,320
by people whose behavior would be out
of place at a four year old's birthday

234
00:14:11,321 --> 00:14:12,154
party is,

235
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,950
is something something Bizible to behold.

236
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:16,360
So,

237
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:21,360
so what about the actions of government
now because it has government after all

238
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,760
that is the source of this compelled
speech as law as well as other ways in

239
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,990
which they seek to restrict speech.

240
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,990
But the compelled speech is the most
egregious form of violation of how well

241
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,231
tell us about that.

242
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:35,411
Well,

243
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:36,244
I've been trying,

244
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,340
I've been trying to sort
this out because you know,

245
00:14:39,341 --> 00:14:40,360
if you're a clinician,

246
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,500
I would say one of the problems you
always have when you're dealing with

247
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,450
behavior that's gone astray is to
understand at what level of analysis you

248
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:50,284
should address it.

249
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:50,591
You know,

250
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:53,000
is it a theological problem?

251
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,800
Is it a philosophical problem?

252
00:14:54,801 --> 00:14:56,480
Is it a psychological problem?

253
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:57,291
Is it social?

254
00:14:57,291 --> 00:14:58,220
Is it economic?

255
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,320
These are very complicated questions.

256
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:01,700
Is it a trivial issue?

257
00:15:01,701 --> 00:15:02,990
Is it an issue of rights?

258
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:03,311
Is it,

259
00:15:03,311 --> 00:15:04,220
is it something else?

260
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:08,060
The people who put in the
bill see 16 for example,

261
00:15:08,061 --> 00:15:11,600
and its associated legislation
make the claim that it's,

262
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,740
it's a legislative womb that's facilitated
by nothing but compassion and desire

263
00:15:15,741 --> 00:15:17,320
to expand the domain of,

264
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,060
of,

265
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,160
of let's say,

266
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:20,930
of rights and freedoms.

267
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,010
And you know,

268
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:26,270
there's nothing wrong in principle
with expanding the domain of rights and

269
00:15:26,271 --> 00:15:26,780
freedoms,

270
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,680
except of course for every right and
for every freedom there's an attendant

271
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:32,240
responsibility and obligation.

272
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,650
So you have to keep that in mind.

273
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,910
When I looked at bill [inaudible] 16
and the legislation that surrounded it,

274
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,760
especially that was written by the
Ontario Human Rights Commission,

275
00:15:40,761 --> 00:15:44,720
the policies that surrounded it and
also the policies that gave rise to the

276
00:15:44,721 --> 00:15:48,560
social justice tribunals named
social justice tribunals.

277
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,570
Appallingly enough that that that gave
rise to those tribunals in Ontario.

278
00:15:53,571 --> 00:15:55,670
The things I read just
made my hair stand on end.

279
00:15:55,671 --> 00:15:56,210
You know,

280
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:59,780
the social justice tribunals have the
right to place themselves outside of

281
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:00,614
legal,

282
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,110
out of outside of jurors
prudential precedence.

283
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:03,890
It's like,

284
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:05,130
what the hell is that?

285
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,490
It's really what you're
going to make the case.

286
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:11,210
The only way I think that you could
justify doing that is it if you torture

287
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:16,270
yourself into the ideological proposition
that English common law is somehow an

288
00:16:16,881 --> 00:16:18,800
oppressive branch of the patriarchy,

289
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:23,300
and because of that you have every right
and even obligation to place yourself

290
00:16:23,301 --> 00:16:25,430
outside of its structure of precedent.

291
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:26,420
But we don't want to.

292
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:29,900
Police are so outside of the structure
of precedent of English common law.

293
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,290
I can tell you that it's,

294
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:34,070
it's one of the supreme
achievements of the human race.

295
00:16:34,071 --> 00:16:34,520
It's,

296
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,360
it's produced societies that are as free
and as productive as any societies have

297
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:43,361
ever been anywhere on the
planet and certainly are now
and to dare to state that

298
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:47,120
you would place yourself
outside of that precedent.

299
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,560
That's the sort of thing that
made my hair stand on end.

300
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,480
And there were other elements of the
policies that were equally reprehensible,

301
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:54,201
not least,

302
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,690
their complete incoherence of formulation.

303
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:57,290
You,

304
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:58,760
I couldn't understand some of it,

305
00:16:58,761 --> 00:17:00,260
like I don't understand,

306
00:17:00,261 --> 00:17:00,861
for example,

307
00:17:00,861 --> 00:17:02,390
with regards to the gender,

308
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,240
uh,

309
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,951
propositions,

310
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:06,950
how it can be that you can be
anywhere on the gender spectrum,

311
00:17:06,951 --> 00:17:07,551
which by the way,

312
00:17:07,551 --> 00:17:11,120
it's not a spectrum technically and it
actually matters which words you use.

313
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,350
If you're writing law,

314
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,930
you can be anywhere or
nowhere on that spectrum.

315
00:17:14,931 --> 00:17:18,350
Like I don't know what that means and I
don't believe that the people who wrote

316
00:17:18,351 --> 00:17:18,441
it,

317
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:18,561
no,

318
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:22,340
what it means either and you don't write
things that you don't understand into

319
00:17:22,341 --> 00:17:23,330
the damn law.

320
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,220
You don't do that because the law unfolds
in society and it tangles people up as

321
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:29,054
it unfolds.

322
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,920
And it's no joke when that happens.

323
00:17:30,921 --> 00:17:31,701
So you'll be very,

324
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:35,180
very careful when you're writing law and
you certainly don't want to write law

325
00:17:35,181 --> 00:17:37,730
to push forward your
ideological commitments,

326
00:17:37,731 --> 00:17:42,200
especially in the face of precedent
because precedent is what keeps law from

327
00:17:42,201 --> 00:17:44,390
degenerating into audiology essentially.

328
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,390
So and so.

329
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,030
And so,

330
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:46,250
you know,

331
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,630
Tamtam answer your question,

332
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,620
you know,

333
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:48,960
more,

334
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,320
more,

335
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,070
more,

336
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,180
more fundamentally,

337
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,720
I don't believe that this argument has
ever been about the rights of transgender

338
00:17:56,851 --> 00:17:57,684
people.

339
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,040
I think that it's an attempt by the
radical left ideologues to push their

340
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:04,290
ideological agenda forward using,

341
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,303
using,

342
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,340
they're using attempts to
manipulate the linguistic domain.

343
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,940
And I'm not willing to seat the loot
linguistic domain because I don't think

344
00:18:11,941 --> 00:18:12,750
there are any more,

345
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,810
anything more important
than the words that you use.

346
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,490
And then when the government says we,

347
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:19,080
you should start using these words.

348
00:18:19,081 --> 00:18:22,830
You should start thinking hard about your
damn government because your words are

349
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:25,320
no different than your
thoughts and your thoughts.

350
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:26,310
Orient Yourself,

351
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:28,350
your thoughts orient you in the world.

352
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:31,830
And if someone who's going to tell
you what it is that you have to think,

353
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,350
then they're going to
disorient you in the world.

354
00:18:34,351 --> 00:18:37,620
And I wouldn't recommend that because
there's lots of terrible things that can

355
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:38,454
happen to you.

356
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:39,690
And if you're disoriented,

357
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:42,030
you're going to run into a
very large number of them.

358
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:44,010
So that's how it looks to me.

359
00:18:44,011 --> 00:18:44,770
So,

360
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:45,170
but,

361
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:45,860
but the

362
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,960
ideological context of this,

363
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,300
it seems like something has changed.

364
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:50,511
Yes.

365
00:18:50,511 --> 00:18:54,470
Because if you think back decades earlier,

366
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,030
liberals were the
champions of free speech.

367
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,600
Yes.

368
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,660
It was the conservatives at
a certain moment in time,

369
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:04,340
who are the sensors,

370
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:04,791
you know,

371
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:04,951
they,

372
00:19:04,951 --> 00:19:05,221
they,

373
00:19:05,221 --> 00:19:09,050
they sought to curb a
blasphemy and obscenity,

374
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,540
sedition and so on.

375
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:11,741
And the,

376
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:13,370
and the Liberals said,

377
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:13,881
no,

378
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,860
free speech is the way we want to go.

379
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,350
And yet today that has flipped a,

380
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:21,731
if you,

381
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:26,731
if you look back to what left leaning
officials and authorities and,

382
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,560
and,

383
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,050
and figures said,

384
00:19:30,051 --> 00:19:31,010
lemme just give you one quote.

385
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:36,040
This is Samuel Gompers who is the founder
of the American Federation of Labor in

386
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:42,260
1886 he said this,

387
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:42,621
he said,

388
00:19:42,621 --> 00:19:47,600
the freedom of speech has been granted
to the people in order that they may say

389
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:48,710
the things

390
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,133
which,

391
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:52,890
sorry.

392
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:56,660
Misquoted that have not been granted to
the people in order that they may say

393
00:19:56,661 --> 00:20:01,610
the things which please and which
are based upon accepted thought.

394
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:07,120
But the right to say the things which
displease the right to say the things

395
00:20:07,641 --> 00:20:10,850
which may convey the new
and yet unexpected thoughts.

396
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:14,960
The right to say things
even though they do a wrong.

397
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Now that is not a sentiment now carried
on by the left and today what has

398
00:20:21,441 --> 00:20:22,274
happened?

399
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:26,310
Well again I see that it's a
consequence of continued agitation,

400
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:30,240
agitation by I would say
a minority of of the left,

401
00:20:30,241 --> 00:20:31,770
the radical left in particular.

402
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:36,771
And those are people who aren't Marxist
Slash Neo Marxist in their fundamental

403
00:20:36,961 --> 00:20:41,961
ideological orientation and have joined
that in an unholy union with the worst

404
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:42,871
of French,

405
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:47,871
postmodernism and and they
push it ideological certainty.

406
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,560
And the thing that,

407
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,100
the thing that's really distressing
about that is that if you know anything

408
00:20:54,101 --> 00:20:56,320
about the history of oppressed people,

409
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,310
let's say much as I hate to engage in
that particular form of dialogue under the

410
00:21:00,311 --> 00:21:01,210
current conditions,

411
00:21:01,450 --> 00:21:05,800
it's pretty obvious that it's
freedom of speech is freedom.

412
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,980
That's particularly important for
people who don't have anything else.

413
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:09,681
Right?

414
00:21:09,681 --> 00:21:13,180
It's if you're supporting freedom of
speech are not supporting the status quo.

415
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:13,391
I mean,

416
00:21:13,391 --> 00:21:14,111
just think about,

417
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:14,321
let's,

418
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:18,750
let's use the logic of the radical
leftists and assume that society is a

419
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,630
tyrannical hierarchy and the people at
the top have the upper hand in everything

420
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,970
including access to communication.

421
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:34,520
These people are not your friends.

422
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,603
No.

423
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,690
Mark my words.

424
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,380
Now it's the sounds of the
barbarians pounding out the gate.

425
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,343
Right?

426
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,633
Yeah.

427
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,780
That's all.

428
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,613
I'll tell you again,

429
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:09,250
that use of in Kuwait,

430
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:15,550
what would you call it in Kuwait
sensation is the best formulation of their

431
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:16,384
argument.

432
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,080
And there's not much difference between
knocking on the doors and knocking on

433
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:20,914
you.

434
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,810
So keep that in mind.

435
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,550
It's not a music,

436
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,780
there's nothing to it,

437
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:26,920
there's nothing for it.

438
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:31,240
The thing that's also quite appalling
is that there's no evidence whatsoever

439
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:34,390
that the people who are conducting these
protests know what it is that they're

440
00:22:34,391 --> 00:22:35,650
protesting against.

441
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:36,461
You know,

442
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:37,294
I was in,

443
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,040
alright,

444
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,420
alright.

445
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,420
I was in the midst of a discussion and
attempting to make the case that it's

446
00:22:51,491 --> 00:22:52,420
freedom of speech.

447
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:53,230
That's,

448
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:55,900
that is what people who
have nothing still have,

449
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,890
right.

450
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,310
So if you look at the tyrannical
structure of our society,

451
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:04,240
let's say the people at the top have
access to means of communication.

452
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,860
Everyone knows that it's the people at
the bottom who have the right to say what

453
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:09,670
they think,

454
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,320
however badly they say it,

455
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,500
that enables them to get a toe
hold into the system and to,

456
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,780
and to make their suffering known.

457
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,850
That's what freedom of speech is for.

458
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,970
And so like what's the
protest against that?

459
00:23:21,971 --> 00:23:22,661
And I'll tell you,

460
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:25,540
you know the rowdy called
Neo Marxists types.

461
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:29,290
They speak the language of power and
that's what they're speaking right now.

462
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,830
And if you want to live in a world where
everyone speaks the language of power,

463
00:23:32,831 --> 00:23:36,070
then just let them do what they're
doing and see what happens.

464
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,540
I wouldn't recommend it.

465
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,010
It's not a pretty rote.

466
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,720
And you're all in a position,

467
00:23:40,721 --> 00:23:43,840
you're on a situation in your life now
where you have to make decisions about

468
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:44,674
this sorts of things.

469
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,810
Like is this the sort of institution
that you want this to be?

470
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,020
Nope.

471
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,800
One of the,

472
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,040
uh,

473
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,873
one of the

474
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:57,300
arguments against what you
said about the pronouns Yup.

475
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,780
Was that,

476
00:23:58,810 --> 00:23:59,320
well,

477
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,280
after all,

478
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,200
all you're being asked to do is to
say something that is reasonable.

479
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:10,060
It's not unreasonable to address somebody
by the pronouns that they prefer.

480
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:13,960
And yet,

481
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:18,520
if you think of any kind of
speech which is prescribed,

482
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,360
imagine a statute that said people
shall use the words hello and please and

483
00:24:27,731 --> 00:24:30,160
thank you in their conversations.

484
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,180
That statute is untenable.

485
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,223
Yes.

486
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,920
Because it now required there's

487
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:40,770
people to use certain words
in their conversations,

488
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,280
even if those words are
reasonable themselves.

489
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:45,750
So that is not the question.

490
00:24:45,751 --> 00:24:47,400
And it was not your case.

491
00:24:47,401 --> 00:24:50,630
You are making that using a
pronoun was unreasonable itself.

492
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:51,503
Do I have that correct?

493
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,010
Well,

494
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:53,843
yeah.

495
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,110
First of all,

496
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,050
there's a couple of things
I'd like to say about that.

497
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,760
No,

498
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,760
I looked up the process by which the
Ontario government formulated it's

499
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:09,510
legislation with regards to the pronouns
and the consultation process that you

500
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:13,260
used and the consultation
process was deeply flawed.

501
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,290
They contacted activists and say,

502
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:18,840
let's activists of the Trans Community.

503
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,291
Okay.

504
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:19,680
Well,

505
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:21,870
there's a couple of things
I'd like to say about that.

506
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:24,570
The first is there is no trans community,

507
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:25,581
right?

508
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:28,890
Trans people are as diverse
as any other group of people,

509
00:25:28,891 --> 00:25:33,060
and to the idea that somehow
because of one of their attributes,

510
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:35,340
they constitute a homogenous group is a,

511
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:35,941
well,

512
00:25:35,941 --> 00:25:37,720
you'd think that that
would be a false with dip,

513
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,730
the people who are concerned
about treating groups of
people adequately would be

514
00:25:44,041 --> 00:25:44,874
loath to,

515
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:45,870
to put forward,

516
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,490
but even more importantly,

517
00:25:47,491 --> 00:25:51,810
there's absolutely no evidence whatsoever
that the activist types are actually

518
00:25:51,811 --> 00:25:56,040
representatives of any of the communities
that they hypothetically activate on

519
00:25:56,041 --> 00:25:56,880
behalf of.

520
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,620
It's like they're not elected,

521
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,790
they're not appointed,

522
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,260
they don't pull,

523
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,400
they do this.

524
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:02,970
They say,

525
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,803
look,

526
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:04,710
here's a group.

527
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,620
It's a minority group and it's oppressed.

528
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,490
I'm a member of that group and
therefore I stand for the group.

529
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,150
It's like,

530
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:12,601
actually,

531
00:26:12,601 --> 00:26:12,811
no,

532
00:26:12,811 --> 00:26:13,644
you don't.

533
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,630
You don't stand for your group.

534
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,790
You maybe stand for yourself.

535
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:18,751
You know,

536
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:21,810
I don't stand for men and I don't
have to stand for white men.

537
00:26:21,811 --> 00:26:22,230
I'm not,

538
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,690
I'm not entitled to speak on their behalf.

539
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:30,060
And so the idea that it's the trans
community that wanted this is a completely

540
00:26:30,061 --> 00:26:31,380
unsustainable idea.

541
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,610
It's certainly unproven.

542
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:37,230
I've had like 40 letters from trans
people since I started to engage in this,

543
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:38,723
call it

544
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,120
chaotic battle.

545
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:46,380
The only one of them was mildly
critical of what I was doing.

546
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,693
All the other ones,

547
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,680
there aren't that many trans people,

548
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:50,490
you know.

549
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:52,890
So to get 40 letters is
actually quite a few.

550
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,680
I'm not saying that this
is a scientific Paul,

551
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:59,730
but it's at least as scientific as the
process by which the Ontario government

552
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:03,670
generated it's legislation and I'm not

553
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:11,760
okay

554
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,620
and I'm not generating legislation.

555
00:27:13,890 --> 00:27:17,190
And what these people
said to a person was,

556
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,970
I didn't ask to be the newest whipping
boy for the radical postmodernists.

557
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,610
All it's done is made
my life more difficult.

558
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,310
You know,

559
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,710
that basic letter would say,

560
00:27:28,711 --> 00:27:28,921
well,

561
00:27:28,921 --> 00:27:32,340
I'm transitioning from one gender to the
other and it's very difficult and I'm

562
00:27:32,341 --> 00:27:34,080
not sure that it's the right thing to do.

563
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:39,620
And this has made the
process spectacularly more
difficult on all fronts.

564
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,700
It's like these people don't speak for me.

565
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,530
And just because they say they do,

566
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,150
that doesn't mean they do.

567
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:53,220
And so the other thing that we seem to
have swallowed as a society is this crazy

568
00:27:53,221 --> 00:27:54,054
notion that,

569
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:54,901
well,

570
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:55,381
first of all,

571
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:58,290
that we should be portioned up
into our different minority groups,

572
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,270
which I think is a return to tribalism,

573
00:28:00,271 --> 00:28:01,830
an unbelievably dangerous,

574
00:28:01,831 --> 00:28:04,380
I can't really think of anything
more dangerous than that.

575
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,630
And then we've swallowed the idea that
if you identify yourself as a member of a

576
00:28:09,631 --> 00:28:12,360
minority group and then you
bring forward a grievance,

577
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:15,750
you have to be treated as if you're
a valid representative of that group.

578
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,500
It's like,

579
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,333
Whoa,

580
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,250
why in the world would we do that guilt?

581
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:25,140
I suppose maybe that's part of
it or I think it's mostly guilt.

582
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,550
You don't want to stand up and say,

583
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:27,270
well,

584
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,970
you know who died and
made you king so to speak.

585
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,130
You know?

586
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,610
And can we,

587
00:28:32,611 --> 00:28:35,190
can we stay on that logic for a moment?

588
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,450
The the idea.

589
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,340
So this,

590
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,340
this compelled speech material seems
to insist upon treating people not as

591
00:28:46,411 --> 00:28:47,011
individuals,

592
00:28:47,011 --> 00:28:52,011
but as members of groups do either blame
them or to favor them as a member of a

593
00:28:52,891 --> 00:28:53,250
group.

594
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,590
Like we take that logic and extended,

595
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,390
you know that the group identity thing
becomes intersectionality where you're

596
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,100
not just blogging to one group,

597
00:29:02,101 --> 00:29:03,660
but you're also abuse characteristics.

598
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,860
Spin that outbursts.

599
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,150
What,

600
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:05,820
what,

601
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,500
what is the logic of that?

602
00:29:07,501 --> 00:29:09,030
Where does it lead us to know?

603
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,601
Okay,

604
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:14,410
so the first thing I would say
to everyone in the room is,

605
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,303
I don't think,

606
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,090
and this is why I decided to do
what I did right from the beginning,

607
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,380
you know,

608
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:25,270
is that I don't want to play
the group identity game.

609
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,770
I don't want to construe the world in
those terms and I'm not going to use

610
00:29:29,771 --> 00:29:33,360
terminology that would require me to
formulate my thoughts in that manner.

611
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,380
I think it's a terrible catastrophe
to divide us all up into our tribal

612
00:29:37,381 --> 00:29:38,214
entities.

613
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,050
Don't see anything
positive about that at all.

614
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,140
So I just don't want to go there.

615
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,041
And then second,

616
00:29:45,041 --> 00:29:45,730
I would say,

617
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,290
and maybe this is even more relevant,

618
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,220
you may or may not have heard
about intersectionality,

619
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,640
but intersectionality is a new
development on the radical left.

620
00:29:54,641 --> 00:29:56,200
And I think it's actually,

621
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:01,030
if I wasn't so in tandem on
serious this and these matters,

622
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:04,390
I would be constantly laughing
about intersectionality.

623
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:08,440
And the reason for that is that it's
the radical left has discovered its own

624
00:30:08,441 --> 00:30:09,520
Achilles heel.

625
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:10,691
So look,

626
00:30:10,691 --> 00:30:13,390
what's the problem with
dividing us up into groups?

627
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,063
Well,

628
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,970
there's many.

629
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,180
And the descent into tribalism
is not least among them,

630
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,830
but the next is that,

631
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:21,873
well,

632
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,520
it turns out that we
don't fit into one group.

633
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,593
Any of us,

634
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:27,850
we fit into multiple groups.

635
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,200
And it's not obvious at all.

636
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:30,760
Which of those groups should take,

637
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:32,590
should be of paramount importance.

638
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:33,191
You know,

639
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:35,650
there's a racial group and
an ethnic ethnic group,

640
00:30:35,651 --> 00:30:38,260
and there's groups of intelligence
and there's groups of temperament,

641
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:39,580
there's groups of attractiveness,

642
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:43,240
and there's groups of wealth and you
can multiply them really indefinitely.

643
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:47,380
And I do mean indefinitely because
you can categorize a finite number of

644
00:30:47,381 --> 00:30:47,891
entities,

645
00:30:47,891 --> 00:30:49,780
a virtually infinite number of ways.

646
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,300
And so the intersection
lists discovered this.

647
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:52,631
They said,

648
00:30:52,631 --> 00:30:52,811
well,

649
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:53,644
there's,

650
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,041
there's,

651
00:30:54,041 --> 00:30:55,990
let's say there's Latinos and there's,

652
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,040
and there's Asians.

653
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:57,461
It's like,

654
00:30:57,461 --> 00:30:58,294
okay,

655
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:58,991
well wait a minute.

656
00:30:58,991 --> 00:31:02,500
There's male and female Latinos
and there's male and female Asians.

657
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,813
So,

658
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,080
so do we treat,

659
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,680
is the division into two enough or
do we need a division into four?

660
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,391
Well then,

661
00:31:09,391 --> 00:31:09,551
then,

662
00:31:09,551 --> 00:31:13,420
well then there's socioeconomic
class of male and female,

663
00:31:13,421 --> 00:31:15,640
Asians and male and female Latinos.

664
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:16,660
And,

665
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:20,740
and you can keep fractionating the
groups and technically without,

666
00:31:20,741 --> 00:31:20,951
and,

667
00:31:20,951 --> 00:31:23,290
and you actually see this
happening in real time,

668
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,124
so to speak,

669
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,623
as the,

670
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:26,621
as the,

671
00:31:26,621 --> 00:31:27,100
uh,

672
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:32,100
acronym for the LGBT activists continues
to expand really without end and see

673
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,650
what's at the bottom of intersectionality.

674
00:31:35,651 --> 00:31:36,251
And this,

675
00:31:36,251 --> 00:31:36,941
I suspect,

676
00:31:36,941 --> 00:31:40,360
will be discovered eventually by the
radical leftists if they get that far as

677
00:31:40,361 --> 00:31:40,810
the,

678
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,870
you have to fractionate the groups
right down to the individual.

679
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:47,930
And that's what Western culture
discussed in articulated,

680
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,581
discovered in,

681
00:31:48,581 --> 00:31:50,800
articulated over the last 5,000 years.

682
00:31:50,801 --> 00:31:51,490
It's like,

683
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:51,821
oh,

684
00:31:51,821 --> 00:31:52,181
right.

685
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:54,520
The group isn't the paramount division.

686
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:55,331
It's the individual.

687
00:31:55,331 --> 00:31:58,180
Because unless you treat each
person like an individual,

688
00:31:58,181 --> 00:32:01,150
you're not taking all the
intersections into account.

689
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:02,830
And so it's extraordinarily,

690
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,870
it's extraordinarily comedic.

691
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:10,560
But it also isn't as if it's treating
everyone as they're an individual,

692
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:12,490
as if they're an individual,

693
00:32:12,491 --> 00:32:15,640
is an instant solution that
will bring us to utopia.

694
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:16,391
You know,

695
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:16,621
it's,

696
00:32:16,621 --> 00:32:19,180
it's like Winston Churchill
said of democracy,

697
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:19,481
right?

698
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:20,010
It's,

699
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:23,680
it's essentially the least
terrible approach we have.

700
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,540
An life isn't the sort of problem that
is amenable to an instantaneous utopian

701
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,141
solution,

702
00:32:29,141 --> 00:32:34,141
but our best bet is to meet each
other with the desire for peace and

703
00:32:34,601 --> 00:32:36,640
productivity on this,

704
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:41,270
on the stage that enables individual
interaction because then we meet soul,

705
00:32:41,271 --> 00:32:41,771
the soul,

706
00:32:41,771 --> 00:32:42,471
so to speak.

707
00:32:42,471 --> 00:32:46,820
And we also meet in a domain that we
bear responsibility for as individuals.

708
00:32:46,821 --> 00:32:48,380
And that's also extremely important,

709
00:32:48,381 --> 00:32:48,740
right?

710
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,810
You should be responsible
for what you say.

711
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,570
You should have to suffer the
consequences of what you say,

712
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,610
not least so that you learn.

713
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,230
And so the individual is
paramount as far as I'm concerned.

714
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,320
I think that's the fundamental
principle of Western civilization.

715
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,890
You know,

716
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:07,100
it's not only the west that
has come across that discovery,

717
00:33:07,101 --> 00:33:10,150
but I think we've done the best
job so far of articulating it.

718
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:15,320
And so we don't want to lose that because
the alternative isn't a multicultural

719
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,213
utopia.

720
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:19,310
The alternative is a descent
into tribal barbarism.

721
00:33:19,311 --> 00:33:20,144
And,

722
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,510
and there are people who would be
just as happy if that happened.

723
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:28,060
But I would suggest that it's not a
destiny that in a weak person would,

724
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,513
would,

725
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:30,610
would long for.

726
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,803
Yeah.

727
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,020
Do you feel like taking a few questions,

728
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:39,050
do you feel like taking some
questions from the storage shirt?

729
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:39,581
All right,

730
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:42,910
so we're going to have questions and
we'd like you to participate in this

731
00:33:42,911 --> 00:33:45,160
conversation now.

732
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:49,870
Please do ask a question.

733
00:33:49,871 --> 00:33:53,530
We welcome you up to say what you'd like.

734
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:58,650
If there is a preamble to the question
that's fairly shorts then so be it.

735
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,930
But please do ask a question.

736
00:34:01,931 --> 00:34:04,810
We're not actually in buddy speeches
and we do primarily want to hear,

737
00:34:04,811 --> 00:34:05,920
but Jordan has to say,

738
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:09,670
so feel free to line up
at the two microphones.

739
00:34:09,671 --> 00:34:11,470
We'll take one at a time.

740
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:12,873
Go ahead sir.

741
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,071
Uh,

742
00:34:14,071 --> 00:34:14,940
so first of all,

743
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:16,080
thank you so much for being here.

744
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:16,920
I really enjoyed it.

745
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:17,843
Um,

746
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:24,060
[inaudible]

747
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,330
and a second,

748
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:28,193
I'm,

749
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,610
this ties into my question.

750
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,990
I just last week my free speech coalition
at Bishop's University was officially

751
00:34:33,991 --> 00:34:37,440
ratified and I would love to invite
you to be our first guest speaker,

752
00:34:37,441 --> 00:34:38,550
if that's at all possible.

753
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:40,363
Um,

754
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:41,800
oh,

755
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,633
thank you.

756
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,220
Um,

757
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,640
and my,

758
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,380
my question pertains to this,

759
00:34:46,381 --> 00:34:46,830
um,

760
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,850
for Dr. Peterson,

761
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:51,450
what would you consider the
most under discussed or,

762
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,260
um,

763
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:57,180
overlooked ideas and topics that you
think should be discussed in the club?

764
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:00,990
Because I know we're looking
for controversial ideas
that we think are maybe not

765
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,370
as discussed as much as they should be.

766
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,653
Well,

767
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:06,801
that's,

768
00:35:06,801 --> 00:35:07,010
uh,

769
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,450
that's a difficult question.

770
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,680
I would say that

771
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:17,390
it isn't obvious to me that on university
campuses at the present time or in the

772
00:35:17,391 --> 00:35:18,980
education system in general,

773
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:24,110
we've done a good job of taking stock of
the advantages and disadvantages of our

774
00:35:24,111 --> 00:35:27,290
current sociopolitical systems now.

775
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,040
And I think there's enough data so
that we could start having intelligent

776
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:31,791
conversation.

777
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:36,500
So one thing I would recommend to you
all if you're interested is a book I just

778
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,334
finished reading.

779
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,840
It's called the great leveler,

780
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,780
the great leveler by Walter Shy Dale.

781
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:47,760
And it's a discussion of inequality
and it's a very intelligent book.

782
00:35:47,761 --> 00:35:48,400
So one of,

783
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,440
so inequality,

784
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,390
as you may or may not know,

785
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:54,120
is rife throughout human societies,

786
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:54,420
right?

787
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,280
And that's the case in the present day.

788
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:57,960
And it's been the case historically,

789
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,260
but it's also the case in animal
societies by every measure.

790
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,810
So inequality is the rule of life,

791
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,673
let's say.

792
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:07,470
And that doesn't mean it's
not an ethical catastrophe.

793
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,610
I'm not saying that,

794
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:14,240
I'm just saying that the
fact of inequality cannot
be laid at the feet of the

795
00:36:14,311 --> 00:36:15,960
west or of capitalism or,

796
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:18,480
or really have any human
construction for that matter.

797
00:36:18,481 --> 00:36:23,010
One of the things Shydel did was to
investigate empirically the relationship

798
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:26,250
between inequality and
the pole of government.

799
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,020
So because let's say if you,

800
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:31,440
if you surveyed a very
large number of states,

801
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:35,010
you could determine whether this,

802
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:37,500
the governments were left wing
or right wing and then you could,

803
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:42,920
you could do a compilation of inequality
coefficients and you could find out if

804
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,210
left wing governments had any,

805
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,270
any ability to ameliorate inequality.

806
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,680
Just as an empirical question.

807
00:36:49,681 --> 00:36:52,140
And the answer that
Shydel generated was no,

808
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:55,680
there's no difference whatsoever in the
inequality coefficients and left and

809
00:36:55,681 --> 00:36:56,610
right wing states.

810
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,880
And what that points to is a
much more fundamental problem.

811
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:04,590
And Shydel in his book also points out
that the only known historical forces

812
00:37:04,591 --> 00:37:09,300
that limit inequality or that produce
inequality are war revolution and

813
00:37:09,301 --> 00:37:10,140
pestilence.

814
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,930
It's doesn't look like it's easily under,

815
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:14,130
under human control.

816
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:14,760
And so,

817
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,001
you know,

818
00:37:15,001 --> 00:37:18,840
the Marxists talked about inequality
and the fact that capital tends to

819
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:21,000
accumulate in the hands
of fewer and fewer people,

820
00:37:21,001 --> 00:37:22,080
which is sort of true,

821
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:26,100
except that the people at the top tend
to rotate lot more quickly than that.

822
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,890
Then the communists in the
Marxist separate presumed,

823
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,400
but it doesn't look like that's
a consequence of capitalism.

824
00:37:32,401 --> 00:37:36,030
It looks like it's a much deeper
process and capitalism at least,

825
00:37:36,031 --> 00:37:36,331
well,

826
00:37:36,331 --> 00:37:41,331
it's shoveling money and resources up to
the top also does lift the bottom very,

827
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:42,990
very quickly.

828
00:37:42,991 --> 00:37:43,530
You know,

829
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:46,200
and this is something we need to have
a serious discussion about it in the

830
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:46,741
university.

831
00:37:46,741 --> 00:37:47,910
So like one,

832
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,440
because we shouldn't be doing this,

833
00:37:49,441 --> 00:37:51,150
we should be partying in the streets.

834
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:55,470
And here's one reason why do you know
that the level of absolute poverty in the

835
00:37:55,471 --> 00:38:00,471
world fell by 50% between the year 2000
and the year 2012 do you know that was

836
00:38:00,871 --> 00:38:05,460
three years faster than the most
optimistic UN projection considered.

837
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,270
It was the fastest decline in absolute
poverty that the world has ever seen.

838
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,280
And like that's a big deal.

839
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:12,114
You know about,

840
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,090
there's hundreds of thousands of
people a week right now that are being

841
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:18,930
connected to the power grid and almost
everybody has access to high speed

842
00:38:18,931 --> 00:38:19,800
computation.

843
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:20,720
And the,

844
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,080
the,

845
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,390
the,

846
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:25,230
the struggling economies in Africa
have for the last four years being the

847
00:38:25,231 --> 00:38:27,360
fastest growing economies in the world.

848
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:27,781
You know,

849
00:38:27,781 --> 00:38:30,180
there's almost no absolute privation left.

850
00:38:30,181 --> 00:38:33,060
There aren't people starving
except for political reasons.

851
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,350
We're at a point where
obesity is the worst,

852
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,030
worst problem than starvation,

853
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:38,351
you know,

854
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:38,900
and,

855
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:42,340
and now I also think that a
lot of that was purchased out,

856
00:38:42,341 --> 00:38:43,240
the cost of the,

857
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,870
of the dreams and hopes of
the working class in the west.

858
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:47,051
You know,

859
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:50,830
I think what we did some sense for
about a 30 year period is sacrificed the

860
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:54,750
aspirations of the Western working
class to alleviate poverty,

861
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:57,190
get India and China
and in South East Asia.

862
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,560
And it looks like that might
have been a really good deal,

863
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,890
although it was a little bit hard on the
working class people and that has to be

864
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:03,820
taken into account,

865
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,000
but we're not having discussions
of is sort universities.

866
00:39:07,001 --> 00:39:12,001
It's like we're stuck in 1980 or maybe
a 1960 we haven't updated our bottles.

867
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:16,930
We take into account the new and often
extraordinarily positive realities and

868
00:39:16,990 --> 00:39:19,870
we're tearing ourselves apart
in the west with this identity,

869
00:39:19,871 --> 00:39:20,411
politics,

870
00:39:20,411 --> 00:39:20,891
idiocy.

871
00:39:20,891 --> 00:39:21,820
At the same time,

872
00:39:22,030 --> 00:39:23,460
the things are getting better and better,

873
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:27,160
faster and faster than they ever have
by a huge margin in the history of

874
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:27,994
mankind.

875
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:29,223
So it's like,

876
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:34,090
it's time to wake up and throw off
the depression of the Cold War and,

877
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:34,820
and,

878
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,380
and,

879
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:39,010
and to look around and see what's what's
available in front of us and what we

880
00:39:39,011 --> 00:39:42,040
could accomplish that would
be much better than Oh,

881
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:42,850
yes.

882
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,240
Yeah.

883
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,073
So

884
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,640
right.

885
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,270
Told that,

886
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:54,960
uh,

887
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,310
there are developments outside.

888
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,380
I'm sorry for the noise.

889
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,701
The,

890
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:57,980
uh,

891
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,920
we'll will,

892
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,100
they're doing the best they can.

893
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,090
Uh,

894
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:01,923
yes ma'am.

895
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,560
Was there a fetus in youth said that
Europe had one was one of your highest

896
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,730
priorities is the pursuit of truth?

897
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,870
Could you just clarify what Ruth,

898
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,030
you mean when you're presented
with a situation where you have to,

899
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:21,250
or you're being asked to refer to
someone to their preferred pronouns,

900
00:40:21,251 --> 00:40:21,790
and is it,

901
00:40:21,790 --> 00:40:25,030
is it a truth they do see is
that their truth is your truth

902
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,330
be the issue

903
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,490
isn't the request of the individual
to be addressed in a certain matter.

904
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,570
It's the compulsion of that by law.

905
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:40,740
So at least issues get
conflated constantly.

906
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,491
Look,

907
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:43,410
I've dealt with all sorts
of people in my life,

908
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:47,820
a much broader range of people than most
people ever encounter in the course of

909
00:40:47,821 --> 00:40:48,800
their entire lives.

910
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,400
And I'm perfectly capable of deciding
how to treat someone on a one to one

911
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:54,234
basis.

912
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:56,070
But when the demand for,

913
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,800
for terminology becomes
part of the legal system,

914
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:00,780
I don't care what the rationale is.

915
00:41:01,310 --> 00:41:03,150
It's not happening as
far as I'm concerned.

916
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,381
And people say,

917
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:05,070
well,

918
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,990
we're pushing it forward
because of compassion.

919
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,990
And maybe you could stop just
being such a mean professor.

920
00:41:09,991 --> 00:41:10,590
It's like,

921
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,910
why should I believe that?

922
00:41:11,911 --> 00:41:15,360
You know what the hell you're
doing with your compelling laws.

923
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,463
You're willing to,

924
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:20,700
you're willing to move past illegal wine
in the sand that's been drawn for let's

925
00:41:20,701 --> 00:41:20,890
say,

926
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:22,170
700 years.

927
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,250
You do not write compelled speech into
the legislation all but we're doing it

928
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,600
with the best of intense.

929
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,440
Yeah.

930
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:28,651
No,

931
00:41:28,651 --> 00:41:29,550
you're not.

932
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:33,150
So these issues have to be separate.

933
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:33,591
Look,

934
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,960
if this was about transgender rights,

935
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,740
it would have disappeared in September
of 2016 it's not about transgender rights

936
00:41:42,021 --> 00:41:42,920
and everyone knows it.

937
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,860
So this is not about transgender rights.

938
00:41:45,861 --> 00:41:46,370
What these,

939
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,960
what these people are doing outside.

940
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,180
It's about something far deeper than that.

941
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:53,270
We ask the question this way.

942
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,163
Can we say,

943
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,453
don't

944
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,650
have the rights,

945
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,700
the liberty to decide how
to present themselves.

946
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,390
You know how to be who they want to be,

947
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:06,920
what's aware.

948
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:07,641
You know,

949
00:42:07,641 --> 00:42:07,851
what,

950
00:42:07,851 --> 00:42:09,440
what gender to call themselves.

951
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:10,640
And the answer is yes.

952
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,820
Everybody has the liberty to do that.

953
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,420
What everybody else has liberty too.

954
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,770
And the liberty to do that doesn't mean
they have the right to compel other

955
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:22,850
people to agree with it.

956
00:42:23,630 --> 00:42:24,081
In other words,

957
00:42:24,081 --> 00:42:28,970
liberty is not the right to demand that
the world validate the choices that

958
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:29,720
you've made.

959
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,770
You have your choices,

960
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,640
you have the freedom to make the choices
and everybody else has the freedom to

961
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:38,240
make their choices too and to approve
or disapprove and they call you this or

962
00:42:38,241 --> 00:42:39,110
like all your that.

963
00:42:39,230 --> 00:42:40,063
In other words,

964
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:43,010
liberty is a two way street
and everybody has it.

965
00:42:43,011 --> 00:42:44,540
And the fact that you've made choices,

966
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:47,810
it doesn't mean everybody else doesn't
have the same ability to make the same

967
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:48,644
choices

968
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,490
back.

969
00:42:59,490 --> 00:42:59,701
Mike,

970
00:42:59,701 --> 00:43:00,534
Please go ahead.

971
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,060
Hi.

972
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:01,893
Um,

973
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,730
that was loud.

974
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:04,260
I just want to thank you for being here.

975
00:43:04,261 --> 00:43:06,120
I'm really big fan and um,

976
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,050
I have a bad habit of making or,

977
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:09,600
uh,

978
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,590
getting in arguments with a lot of
radical leftists and I'm the most common

979
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,090
argument they present to me,

980
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:20,160
I generally is bills you 16 only
covers the Ontario human rights code.

981
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:23,130
So those are protected areas under
the Ontario Human Rights Code,

982
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:23,641
uh,

983
00:43:23,641 --> 00:43:24,474
such as,

984
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:24,631
uh,

985
00:43:24,631 --> 00:43:25,620
universities,

986
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:25,831
uh,

987
00:43:25,831 --> 00:43:26,610
elementary schools,

988
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,443
et cetera.

989
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:28,500
I was just wondering,

990
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:29,190
um,

991
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,260
how you would combat this argument.

992
00:43:31,261 --> 00:43:33,480
Seeing is their argument is generally,

993
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,560
um,

994
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,480
they're only dealing with vulnerable
groups such as young students and um,

995
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:40,060
he's still got about enough.

996
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,311
It doesn't matter.

997
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:41,671
They say,

998
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:42,240
well it's,

999
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,710
it's restricted in scope.

1000
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:43,870
Yeah.

1001
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,240
It's not restricted enough.

1002
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:46,393
Look,

1003
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:49,250
here's a couple of facts.

1004
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,330
Okay.

1005
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:54,480
So when I first made my video
is about bill [inaudible] 16,

1006
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:59,310
one of the things that I suggested was
that the act of making the video itself

1007
00:43:59,311 --> 00:44:01,080
could well have been illegal.

1008
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:06,390
And of course people immediately accused
me of fear mongering and perhaps with

1009
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:06,960
reasons,

1010
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,740
it's not always easy to understand
the full intent of the new piece of

1011
00:44:10,741 --> 00:44:12,660
legislation surrounding policies.

1012
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:14,040
But I can tell you one thing.

1013
00:44:15,030 --> 00:44:18,720
When the lawyers at the University of
Toronto read through the new legislation

1014
00:44:18,721 --> 00:44:20,010
and the surrounding policies,

1015
00:44:20,011 --> 00:44:23,910
they also decided that what I was doing
might've been transgressing the law.

1016
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:27,250
And that's why they wrote me
two letters telling me to stop.

1017
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:28,740
Okay.

1018
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,660
So that's number one.

1019
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:31,710
Okay,

1020
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,190
fact

1021
00:44:32,190 --> 00:44:33,023
number two,

1022
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,680
two words,

1023
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:36,840
Lindsay Shepherd.

1024
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:45,890
Okay,

1025
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:46,723
so

1026
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:50,290
let's say for the argument
that I'm a paranoid,

1027
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:53,590
make a little maniac and that I'm a
bigot and all of the other things that

1028
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:56,260
people have decided that I might be okay.

1029
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:56,441
Well,

1030
00:44:56,441 --> 00:44:57,221
I'll tell you what,

1031
00:44:57,221 --> 00:45:00,130
in my paranoid Megalomania,

1032
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:04,090
I never envisioned a situation
where a teaching assistant,

1033
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:08,800
a 22 year old teaching assistant at a
major Canadian university would be hold in

1034
00:45:08,801 --> 00:45:13,801
front of a quasi myo is inquisition and
have to record it because she dared to

1035
00:45:14,741 --> 00:45:19,741
show five minutes of a video from a
mainstream news program run by public

1036
00:45:21,101 --> 00:45:23,710
television funded by the
government of Ontario.

1037
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,470
So paranoid as I was,

1038
00:45:26,530 --> 00:45:27,370
let's say,

1039
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,490
it isn't obvious that
I was paranoid enough.

1040
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:32,200
So,

1041
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,160
and I don't see that.

1042
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:37,840
I don't see how either of
those examples can be disputed.

1043
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:38,291
You know,

1044
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:41,950
it wasn't like the University of Toronto
wrote me two letters without thinking

1045
00:45:41,951 --> 00:45:42,784
about it.

1046
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:46,960
They went and consulted their high powered
lawyers and the lawyers reviewed the

1047
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:48,910
policies and the legislation
and they thought,

1048
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:49,211
oh,

1049
00:45:49,211 --> 00:45:50,110
Dr. Peterson,

1050
00:45:50,111 --> 00:45:52,300
he might be contravening that legislation.

1051
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,200
It's like,

1052
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:57,100
it was a weird paradoxical gift to me
that they sent out those two letters

1053
00:45:57,101 --> 00:46:00,640
telling me to stop because it was
instant proof that what I was doing was,

1054
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:02,043
um,

1055
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,170
I wouldn't say right because
God only knows about that.

1056
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:10,410
But at least if my interpretation of
the bill and its intent was correct,

1057
00:46:11,470 --> 00:46:13,870
so can we just make this observation that,

1058
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:14,530
that,

1059
00:46:14,530 --> 00:46:19,270
that response to Jordan's
critique of see 16,

1060
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,193
the one that went,

1061
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:20,741
oh,

1062
00:46:20,741 --> 00:46:21,880
he's overreacting.

1063
00:46:22,270 --> 00:46:25,150
Nobody's going to be punished
or sent to jail for this

1064
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,613
silly.

1065
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:27,491
In this sense,

1066
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:28,324
remember,

1067
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:31,390
every single legal rule there is,

1068
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:37,050
is a legal rule only because
it is backed with the mum.

1069
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,490
Monopolistic violence of the state.

1070
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:40,550
They're ready.

1071
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:45,550
[inaudible]

1072
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,270
there's no such thing as a
rural without punishment.

1073
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:51,990
So if,

1074
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:52,920
if for example,

1075
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,500
there's a no parking sign,

1076
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,030
what the practicing science says,

1077
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:57,870
oh by the way,

1078
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,400
please don't park here.

1079
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:01,020
But there are no tickets.

1080
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:04,320
Well people are going to park
cause that's not really a rule.

1081
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:08,670
So if you have a rule in the human
rights code and if you breach it,

1082
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,050
if that's discrimination,

1083
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,880
well then true.

1084
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,480
The first thing that happens to you
is not going to be thrown in jail.

1085
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,730
But there's a process,

1086
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:19,050
a series of steps,

1087
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:19,741
right?

1088
00:47:19,741 --> 00:47:23,850
The first one might be a mediation or an
investigation and then there might be a

1089
00:47:23,851 --> 00:47:24,684
fine.

1090
00:47:24,870 --> 00:47:26,250
And then if you don't pay the fine,

1091
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:29,530
then your wages might be garnished
or you might be ordered to fix it.

1092
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:30,850
But believe me,

1093
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:34,000
if you refuse and refuse
and refuse and refuse,

1094
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,400
that order will become a court order.

1095
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:39,220
And then if you don't
obey the court order,

1096
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:40,780
you'll be in contempt of court.

1097
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,720
And then that will lead to
arrest and imprisonment.

1098
00:47:43,721 --> 00:47:46,510
So every single rule in
the human rights code

1099
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:53,190
is effectively enforced with the
most severe violence the state has,

1100
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,010
even though it's not actually
practiced most of the time.

1101
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:58,840
Because most people obey

1102
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,260
when we,

1103
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,280
we also don't want to underestimate,

1104
00:48:02,830 --> 00:48:06,480
I don't know how many of you have had
the pleasure of being dragged before a

1105
00:48:06,481 --> 00:48:08,640
board that investigates your behavior,

1106
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:12,900
but I would tell you that even if you
don't end up paying a fine or in jail,

1107
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:16,560
there's nothing particularly
pleasant about the process itself.

1108
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,431
It's enough.

1109
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:20,700
You know you wonder why people don't
speak up and I can tell you one of the

1110
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:24,660
reasons they don't speak up is because
merely being dragged in front of a board

1111
00:48:24,661 --> 00:48:25,494
of inquiry,

1112
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:30,630
innocent or guilty is enough to pretty
much do you in for a whole year.

1113
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:35,640
Like if you're a sensible person and
you're concerned with propriety and you

1114
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:39,450
want to maintain the stability of your
life and your reputation is important to

1115
00:48:39,451 --> 00:48:40,110
you,

1116
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:45,110
perhaps because of the stability of your
family depends on it to be investigated

1117
00:48:45,151 --> 00:48:46,710
for such things as a punishment.

1118
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:47,760
All of its own.

1119
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:48,630
It's no,

1120
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,750
it's no pleasant business and
many of you will you're and stuff.

1121
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:52,390
I would,

1122
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:57,130
I would equate being investigated
by a non punitive court,

1123
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:00,670
let's say with these punishments that
Bruce described quite far down the

1124
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,031
distance.

1125
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:03,150
I would equate that to having a,

1126
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:06,670
a fairly serious disease in terms of its,

1127
00:49:07,090 --> 00:49:09,520
in terms of it's psychological
and physical impact.

1128
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,080
I would also say

1129
00:49:12,610 --> 00:49:13,443
no I won't,

1130
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:14,710
I won't say it.

1131
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,650
Let's go with the next project
that's across the place.

1132
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,493
Thank you.

1133
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,091
First of all,

1134
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:19,924
they can vote

1135
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,480
as embarrassing as what's happening
out there is easy university.

1136
00:49:25,481 --> 00:49:28,060
I think what it does when I could
show how what we're doing here,

1137
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:28,691
is it how we can,

1138
00:49:28,691 --> 00:49:29,710
those people are so thank you.

1139
00:49:29,711 --> 00:49:30,544
First of all,

1140
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:35,620
[inaudible] of my questions,

1141
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,660
your belief that it's extremely important.

1142
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:44,910
Everything that we're doing to
speak our mind speaking freely.

1143
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,691
That's why we're here.

1144
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:47,820
But in terms of practicality,

1145
00:49:47,821 --> 00:49:49,110
there's a lot of things that get,

1146
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:50,680
are in the way of her license.

1147
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:51,071
Students,

1148
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:51,211
you know,

1149
00:49:51,211 --> 00:49:54,320
we have our prospective soap.

1150
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:54,720
Um,

1151
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:56,070
in terms of practicality,

1152
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,760
what are kind of maybe your tips and your
perspective on the steps that students

1153
00:49:59,761 --> 00:50:04,761
can take to kind of speak their mind
while not sacrificing their future back?

1154
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:06,890
Well,

1155
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:10,110
I can tell you a couple of
things that are very practical.

1156
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,730
Don't break in your essence what you
think the professor wants to hear.

1157
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:19,650
There's absolutely no excuse
whatsoever for doing that.

1158
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:20,191
Now,

1159
00:50:20,191 --> 00:50:21,150
first of all,

1160
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:22,380
most professors,

1161
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:27,060
even those who have descended into
a state of ideological possession,

1162
00:50:27,080 --> 00:50:28,280
let's say most

1163
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,280
of them still have enough character
to breed an essay that's well written.

1164
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:37,640
So you're actually taking less of a risk
than you would think by stating what

1165
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:38,750
you have to stay.

1166
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:39,700
But look,

1167
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:43,020
if you start practicing when you
were in University of mistakes,

1168
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:46,550
you're rather low
pandering to the audience,

1169
00:50:46,551 --> 00:50:50,030
let's say and say what you
think will get you buy.

1170
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,430
You're going to train yourself to do that.

1171
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:55,940
And what that means is you're going to
train yourself in the false suffocation

1172
00:50:55,941 --> 00:50:59,690
of your character and your character
is the only thing you have to guide you

1173
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:00,524
through life.

1174
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:02,120
No people dream of riches.

1175
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:03,800
And they dream of luxury and all of that.

1176
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:07,850
But that's a thin defense against
the harsh realities of the world.

1177
00:51:07,910 --> 00:51:09,290
You have your character.

1178
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:13,160
And so what you do when
you go to university is you
learn to say what you think

1179
00:51:13,161 --> 00:51:16,730
is clearly as you can and to take the
slings and arrows that come along with

1180
00:51:16,731 --> 00:51:17,040
that.

1181
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:17,160
No,

1182
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:17,440
I didn't.

1183
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,310
An hitting manner,

1184
00:51:18,311 --> 00:51:18,531
right?

1185
00:51:18,531 --> 00:51:20,150
Because like what the hell do you know?

1186
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:20,961
You know,

1187
00:51:20,961 --> 00:51:22,220
so you've got plenty to learn,

1188
00:51:22,221 --> 00:51:23,990
but you want to formulate
your thoughts carefully.

1189
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:25,940
You want to write what you think.

1190
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,181
Well,

1191
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:26,840
why?

1192
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,280
Because when you're writing,

1193
00:51:28,370 --> 00:51:29,510
you're thinking,

1194
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,700
you're laying out the arguments that
you're going to use to structure your

1195
00:51:34,701 --> 00:51:37,190
existence in the world
throughout your entire life.

1196
00:51:37,191 --> 00:51:40,700
And if you start to twist and
bend those for expedient reasons,

1197
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,680
you're going to warp your soul.

1198
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:43,491
And I mean,

1199
00:51:43,491 --> 00:51:46,460
I could talk about that
neurophysiologically if you want to,

1200
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:47,000
you know,

1201
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,550
you become what you practice,

1202
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,920
you automate what you practice.

1203
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,780
So if you automate expedient speech
for the sake of short term gain,

1204
00:51:56,930 --> 00:51:58,400
then that's what you're going to produce.

1205
00:51:58,401 --> 00:52:00,980
You're going to produce expedient
speech for short term gain.

1206
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:02,870
Well God help you if you do that,

1207
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:08,230
like there is nothing that you will
possibly do in your entire life that will

1208
00:52:09,171 --> 00:52:13,790
serve you better than to get
control of your voice in university.

1209
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:16,160
I remember seeing you do that by reading,

1210
00:52:16,190 --> 00:52:16,790
right?

1211
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,260
You read great people.

1212
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:20,780
You do that by writing what you think.

1213
00:52:20,781 --> 00:52:24,200
You stay true to yourself while you write
what you think and you take the risks

1214
00:52:24,201 --> 00:52:26,180
and you gain the benefits
that go along with that.

1215
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:31,070
You learn to stand up and speak and to
listen carefully and that makes you a

1216
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:33,620
negotiator of unparalleled power.

1217
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,050
And if you're a negotiator
of unparalleled power,

1218
00:52:36,051 --> 00:52:39,170
there's nothing in the world
that won't open itself up to you.

1219
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,750
So that's what you're doing in university.

1220
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,550
And if you find professors who,

1221
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:48,050
who reject that and there's fewer
of them than you might think,

1222
00:52:48,470 --> 00:52:53,470
then it's your sacred obligation to stand
up for yourself against that because

1223
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:56,690
it's going to happen to you
throughout your whole life.

1224
00:52:56,691 --> 00:52:59,930
And you might as well start
practicing how to do it right now.

1225
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,630
So that's how it looks to me.

1226
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:02,811
Yeah.

1227
00:53:02,811 --> 00:53:04,860
There's an old saying that I write

1228
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:12,060
[inaudible]

1229
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:16,640
I write in order to know what I think.

1230
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:21,920
And you'll note how compelled
speech interferes in that process.

1231
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:22,600
Yes.

1232
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,150
So the idea that you have to write what
professor wants is a form of compelled

1233
00:53:27,151 --> 00:53:27,541
speech.

1234
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:28,580
It's like it.

1235
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,050
I really do believe that
this is a fundamental issue.

1236
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,490
As a therapist,

1237
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:36,270
say when I'm trying to help
someone set their life straight,

1238
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,940
I do my best not to compel their speech.

1239
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:40,470
And the reason for that is quite clear.

1240
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:45,471
It's like you have your destiny with
all its attended triumphs and sufferings

1241
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,330
and it's on your shoulders.

1242
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,460
I don't want to tell you how to think.

1243
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,090
I don't want to tell you how to think
because I do not know how you should

1244
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:54,810
think.

1245
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:57,170
You have to figure that
out for yourself and,

1246
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,790
and then you have to bear
the responsibility for that.

1247
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:01,150
And you,

1248
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:03,390
you were a terribly arrogant fool.

1249
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:08,340
If you dare to tell someone else how it
is that they should conduct themselves

1250
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:09,174
through life.

1251
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,481
Now.

1252
00:54:09,481 --> 00:54:10,314
I mean,

1253
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,340
having said that,

1254
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:12,510
while obviously I say,

1255
00:54:12,511 --> 00:54:12,721
well,

1256
00:54:12,721 --> 00:54:14,910
you should tell the truth or
at least you shouldn't lie,

1257
00:54:14,911 --> 00:54:17,220
but that's not a dictate of,

1258
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:18,120
of,

1259
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:18,953
of,

1260
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:19,590
of,

1261
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:20,880
of actions so to speak.

1262
00:54:20,881 --> 00:54:22,530
It's a dictate of process.

1263
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,191
It's like,

1264
00:54:23,191 --> 00:54:23,371
well,

1265
00:54:23,371 --> 00:54:23,791
you can't,

1266
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,270
you shouldn't interfere with the
mechanism that allows you to solve all the

1267
00:54:27,271 --> 00:54:31,830
problems that you will face in your
life and you come to university maybe to

1268
00:54:31,831 --> 00:54:32,450
prepare for,

1269
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:32,780
uh,

1270
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,210
for a,

1271
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,110
for a profession,

1272
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:34,680
no,

1273
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:36,510
and to set yourself up economically,

1274
00:54:36,511 --> 00:54:39,390
but to set yourself economic economically,

1275
00:54:39,391 --> 00:54:40,110
properly.

1276
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:42,150
I don't care what your
profession is going to be.

1277
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:46,260
There is no one who is more powerful
than someone who can communicate.

1278
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:48,090
It doesn't matter what the field,

1279
00:54:48,091 --> 00:54:50,580
it doesn't matter if you're
a plumber or a politician.

1280
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:53,130
If you can formulate
your thoughts clearly.

1281
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:57,570
If you can conduct yourself honorably
in your action and your speech,

1282
00:54:57,630 --> 00:54:59,880
if you're articulate and careful,

1283
00:54:59,881 --> 00:55:02,760
then the world opens itself up to you.

1284
00:55:02,770 --> 00:55:05,190
You have an unlimited
horizon of possibility.

1285
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:06,930
So thank you very much.

1286
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,093
Yup.

1287
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:13,310
[inaudible]

1288
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:16,691
oh,

1289
00:55:16,691 --> 00:55:17,860
thank you both for coming with,

1290
00:55:17,861 --> 00:55:18,281
firstly,

1291
00:55:18,281 --> 00:55:22,390
I'd like to thank everyone in the room
who is not devolved into the hysteria we

1292
00:55:22,391 --> 00:55:23,320
see outside.

1293
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:28,510
They would prefer that we lost our sanity
and that our society would fracture

1294
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,950
into the nonsense we see.

1295
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,330
So by sitting here,

1296
00:55:31,331 --> 00:55:32,740
being as patient as you are,

1297
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,930
this is how we keep our academy.

1298
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,730
This is how we keep our society.

1299
00:55:36,731 --> 00:55:37,564
Thank you.

1300
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:42,570
[inaudible]

1301
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:48,580
my question is a simple one.

1302
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:48,970
Uh,

1303
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,240
we see more and more of this
new language I call of leftism,

1304
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,410
intersectionality,

1305
00:55:53,411 --> 00:55:53,861
equity,

1306
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:54,611
diversity,

1307
00:55:54,611 --> 00:55:55,444
inclusion,

1308
00:55:55,510 --> 00:56:00,430
and we see people from all political and
philosophical straights adopting this

1309
00:56:00,431 --> 00:56:01,360
new vernacular.

1310
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:05,110
Is this in any way dignifying
that as a position,

1311
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:09,640
is this dignifying the
philosophical bases of these words?

1312
00:56:09,641 --> 00:56:11,880
Do people recognize that
when they use these,

1313
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:12,230
uh,

1314
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:16,810
these words that they making that
somehow a truth that we all ought to,

1315
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,250
except I don't,

1316
00:56:18,251 --> 00:56:19,120
should we or should we not?

1317
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:19,983
I don't think people,

1318
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,120
you recognize that.

1319
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,100
Again,

1320
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,290
you know what I'd like reiterate with
the reason I made those videos to begin

1321
00:56:26,291 --> 00:56:27,340
with was because I don't,

1322
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:32,250
I was unwilling to see the linguistic
territory as soon as you think it's

1323
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,670
already happening to some degree.

1324
00:56:33,671 --> 00:56:38,230
So imagine that we just did define the
sociopolitical landscape in terms of

1325
00:56:38,231 --> 00:56:39,280
identity politics,

1326
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:40,540
which is happening very rapidly.

1327
00:56:40,541 --> 00:56:40,931
In fact,

1328
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:42,160
we're compelled to do so.

1329
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,023
Right?

1330
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:43,863
So,

1331
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,033
um,

1332
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:45,521
well then,

1333
00:56:45,521 --> 00:56:50,020
then what happens is you get activity on
the identity politics front on the left

1334
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,720
and on the right the left says,

1335
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:53,590
well,

1336
00:56:53,590 --> 00:56:56,440
the oppressed shall rise and
take their rightful place.

1337
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,580
And the right says,

1338
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,000
yeah,

1339
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,610
over my dead body and probably yours too.

1340
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,450
So as soon as we played
the identity politics game,

1341
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,100
that's where we're at.

1342
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:08,890
And we start playing it by
accepting the terminology.

1343
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:09,671
You know,

1344
00:57:09,671 --> 00:57:13,930
already I find myself stumbling when
I used the word sex instead of gender.

1345
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:15,461
And that's not good.

1346
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:20,461
Like I have to consciously overcome a
resistance to use the word sex instead of

1347
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,760
gender because you know,

1348
00:57:21,761 --> 00:57:26,320
I'm actually quite an agreeable
person and it actually pains me to,

1349
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,420
to go against the crowd.

1350
00:57:28,421 --> 00:57:29,110
Let's say,

1351
00:57:29,110 --> 00:57:29,381
you know,

1352
00:57:29,381 --> 00:57:31,660
I'm not temperamentally
suited for it precisely,

1353
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:32,860
strangely enough.

1354
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:37,960
And so I feel the compulsion to use this
kind of language welling up inside of

1355
00:57:37,961 --> 00:57:39,220
me just to be,

1356
00:57:40,450 --> 00:57:41,261
to be nice,

1357
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:42,190
I suppose,

1358
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,000
you know,

1359
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:46,420
but I know where identity politics leads.

1360
00:57:46,990 --> 00:57:48,490
It leads to the Ghoulag,

1361
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,740
it leads to the concentration camps.

1362
00:57:50,741 --> 00:57:52,420
It leads to blood in the streets.

1363
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,310
We don't need that here.

1364
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:55,900
We're doing pretty well.

1365
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:57,760
So we could leave it.

1366
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:07,981
Hi,

1367
00:58:07,981 --> 00:58:08,814
Professor Peterson.

1368
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,150
Uh,

1369
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:13,180
I studied history for the duration
of my degree and I think it's just a

1370
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:17,760
sickeningly ironic that the people
who are using their free speech,

1371
00:58:17,761 --> 00:58:22,440
one to take away your free speech and
furthermore that they can't see the irony

1372
00:58:22,441 --> 00:58:25,260
of this situation of how
tyrannical there being a,

1373
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:26,011
my question is,

1374
00:58:26,011 --> 00:58:26,470
however,

1375
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:27,210
um,

1376
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:30,240
I've noticed from a lot of what you've
talked about and I've been watching you

1377
00:58:30,241 --> 00:58:31,700
since your rise in 2060,

1378
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:32,843
2016,

1379
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:33,863
um,

1380
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,330
and I know that you're a Christian
and I don't want to divulge into that,

1381
00:58:36,331 --> 00:58:41,310
but I noticed a lot of the sort of
North American Protestant work ethic in,

1382
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:41,880
in,

1383
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:42,240
uh,

1384
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,050
in your lessons.

1385
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:43,261
Like,

1386
00:58:43,261 --> 00:58:43,740
you know,

1387
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:43,980
uh,

1388
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,930
self redemption and to be your own person.

1389
00:58:45,931 --> 00:58:48,600
Like we've been talking about that
last like hour and a half I suppose.

1390
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,220
And um,

1391
00:58:50,670 --> 00:58:53,490
in a ever rising tide where people are,

1392
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:57,390
or rather in the western world where
it's becoming increasingly rather

1393
00:58:57,391 --> 00:58:59,220
decreasingly Christian and specifically,

1394
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:00,160
yeah.

1395
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:03,240
Decreasingly religious nuns
specifically decreasingly Christian.

1396
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:04,373
How can you,

1397
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:08,700
what do you think is the best suggestion
in order to be able to uphold those

1398
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:11,780
such important values that
have been across the world,

1399
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:12,180
uh,

1400
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:14,700
from American cultural influence
since the end of the Second World War?

1401
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,960
I apologize for the long question.

1402
00:59:16,110 --> 00:59:16,180
No,

1403
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:16,800
no,

1404
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,633
it's fine.

1405
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:19,443
You know,

1406
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:24,620
people have asked me
repeatedly my religious views
and I've answered them in a

1407
00:59:25,431 --> 00:59:26,420
variety of different ways,

1408
00:59:26,421 --> 00:59:28,190
but they say,

1409
00:59:28,191 --> 00:59:29,240
do you believe in God?

1410
00:59:29,241 --> 00:59:32,180
Let's say my response to that always is,

1411
00:59:32,181 --> 00:59:32,361
well,

1412
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:35,180
I don't know what you mean
when you ask me that question.

1413
00:59:35,181 --> 00:59:36,470
So I don't know how to answer it.

1414
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:38,210
I don't know what you mean by belief,

1415
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:42,800
but I can tell you something that I
believe and I would say this is a way of

1416
00:59:42,801 --> 00:59:44,120
speaking symbolically.

1417
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,340
I do believe so.

1418
00:59:46,341 --> 00:59:49,820
I was thinking the other day and week
ago I was thinking about this I this

1419
00:59:49,821 --> 00:59:51,530
little fantasy that entered my mind.

1420
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:56,600
I was thinking about Saint Joseph's
oratorial in Montreal and Saint Joseph's

1421
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:57,021
oratory.

1422
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,580
It was a very large religious building.

1423
00:59:58,581 --> 01:00:01,400
It's one of the biggest cathedral
light structures in the world,

1424
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:04,910
and it's set on the hill and mount royal
and it's set up where it can catch the

1425
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:05,744
sun,

1426
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:05,960
you know?

1427
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:08,510
So it's an image of the
heavenly city on the hill,

1428
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:09,050
right?

1429
01:00:09,050 --> 01:00:12,830
It's an image of the structures
that we strive to create.

1430
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,910
That's what it is in independent of
its specifically Christian or religious

1431
01:00:16,911 --> 01:00:17,600
function.

1432
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,280
That's what it stands for symbolically.

1433
01:00:19,281 --> 01:00:19,551
Okay,

1434
01:00:19,551 --> 01:00:20,660
so it's the city on the hill.

1435
01:00:20,661 --> 01:00:21,050
It's,

1436
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:25,250
it's what we're striving towards
when we walk up hill in life.

1437
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:25,911
Okay?

1438
01:00:25,911 --> 01:00:27,010
Now the way the,

1439
01:00:27,011 --> 01:00:27,340
the,

1440
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:27,951
the oratory,

1441
01:00:27,951 --> 01:00:28,641
it was structured,

1442
01:00:28,641 --> 01:00:31,220
there's hundreds of steps
leading to it up front.

1443
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,350
And in the early part of the 20th century,

1444
01:00:33,351 --> 01:00:36,830
a lot of people who had
physical disabilities came
there and they struggled up

1445
01:00:36,831 --> 01:00:39,980
the step on their crutches and many
of them left their crutches in the

1446
01:00:39,981 --> 01:00:40,611
oratorial.

1447
01:00:40,611 --> 01:00:42,410
You can see hundreds of
them if you go there.

1448
01:00:42,411 --> 01:00:43,760
It's quite an interesting site.

1449
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,870
And I was thinking about that and I was
thinking about what that meant and this

1450
01:00:47,871 --> 01:00:48,830
is what it means.

1451
01:00:48,860 --> 01:00:51,050
It means that you know,

1452
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,090
everyone has their disabilities,

1453
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:53,511
let's say,

1454
01:00:53,511 --> 01:00:57,680
and I know that some people are far more
terribly effected than other people.

1455
01:00:57,681 --> 01:00:58,880
I'm perfectly aware of that.

1456
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:01,340
But the question is what
do you do about that?

1457
01:01:01,341 --> 01:01:06,341
And what you do is you set yourself up
on your damn crutches and you struggle up

1458
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:07,700
the bloody hill.

1459
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:08,780
That's what you do.

1460
01:01:08,930 --> 01:01:11,840
And you struggle up the hill
towards the Kingdom of God.

1461
01:01:11,870 --> 01:01:16,220
That's what you do because the
alternative is to descend into the abyss.

1462
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:17,840
That's the alternative.

1463
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,190
And then so to say,

1464
01:01:19,191 --> 01:01:19,401
well,

1465
01:01:19,401 --> 01:01:23,210
do you believe it's like I believe that
you should struggle uphill towards the

1466
01:01:23,211 --> 01:01:25,130
city of God on your crutches.

1467
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,410
That's what you should do.

1468
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:30,590
That's the opposite of the
descent into the abyss.

1469
01:01:31,340 --> 01:01:32,600
And so that's,

1470
01:01:32,810 --> 01:01:35,540
that's at the foundation
of our civilization.

1471
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:36,374
That idea.

1472
01:01:36,590 --> 01:01:37,423
Well,

1473
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:38,241
argue with it.

1474
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:39,074
If you will,

1475
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:42,020
see if you can figure out why
that's not an acceptable idea.

1476
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:44,270
Maybe you should help
someone's struggle up the hill.

1477
01:01:44,271 --> 01:01:45,290
Perhaps you should,

1478
01:01:45,650 --> 01:01:45,891
you know,

1479
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:49,340
you can lend a hand to someone or you
don't want to take the burden away from

1480
01:01:49,341 --> 01:01:53,630
them entirely because there's something
noble about struggling up the Damn Hill,

1481
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:53,901
right?

1482
01:01:53,901 --> 01:01:55,430
There's something that's adventure.

1483
01:01:55,431 --> 01:01:57,830
That's the call to proper being.

1484
01:01:58,270 --> 01:01:58,581
It's like,

1485
01:01:58,581 --> 01:01:59,120
well,

1486
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:00,950
we don't need to forget this.

1487
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:02,000
No,

1488
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,230
we don't need to forget it.

1489
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:08,410
The universities have been there since
time in memorial to try to push that idea

1490
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:10,070
forward through the generations,

1491
01:02:10,190 --> 01:02:11,930
and everyone needs to know that idea.

1492
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:13,130
That's what gives you life,

1493
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:14,630
not happiness.

1494
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:15,860
Forget about that.

1495
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,091
If it comes,

1496
01:02:17,091 --> 01:02:17,391
well,

1497
01:02:17,391 --> 01:02:17,960
great.

1498
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:19,820
Except it dignity,

1499
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:20,790
nobility,

1500
01:02:21,390 --> 01:02:22,200
character,

1501
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:22,771
truth,

1502
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:23,910
responsibility,

1503
01:02:23,911 --> 01:02:24,744
beauty.

1504
01:02:25,050 --> 01:02:27,010
Those are the things to aim for honor too.

1505
01:02:27,011 --> 01:02:28,350
I'd say honor.

1506
01:02:29,090 --> 01:02:32,010
Thank you very much and I
hope when all this is done,

1507
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:32,970
I hope you take a nice long,

1508
01:02:32,971 --> 01:02:34,500
big vacation cause I think
you really deserve it.

1509
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:40,413
Hello.

1510
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:42,230
Okay,

1511
01:02:42,230 --> 01:02:43,340
Peterson first.

1512
01:02:43,341 --> 01:02:44,174
Thank you for coming.

1513
01:02:44,690 --> 01:02:46,400
And I'm so,

1514
01:02:46,490 --> 01:02:47,380
I'm Chinese.

1515
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,680
My parents grew up in the
cultural revolution of China,

1516
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:56,900
so I took particular attention when
you mentioned the multiple occasions

1517
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,960
comparing what's happening
in the West right now,

1518
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:00,651
two miles,

1519
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:02,090
China and I,

1520
01:03:02,330 --> 01:03:05,780
I agree and it's pretty obvious the
connection between their radiology,

1521
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:10,400
the identity politics and the
oppression versus oppressed viewpoints.

1522
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:15,670
But my question is mostly about how
they're promoting the political agenda.

1523
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:16,251
I mean,

1524
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:18,380
I see that the political agenda,

1525
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:21,200
the philosophy behind the
political agenda are very similar,

1526
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,000
but at the same time,

1527
01:03:23,001 --> 01:03:27,050
I see a shocking similarity in the
way that they promoting that political

1528
01:03:27,051 --> 01:03:27,680
agenda.

1529
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,310
Specifically backing back
in the culture revolution.

1530
01:03:31,460 --> 01:03:36,460
Anyone who dare to say anything that
it's not fully for the movement was

1531
01:03:36,651 --> 01:03:38,840
classified as Nq revolutionary.

1532
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:43,880
Just as now who anyone who dare to
say anything that goes remotely,

1533
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:49,000
not fully aligned with whatever they
want to promote is classified as hate

1534
01:03:49,791 --> 01:03:50,624
speech.

1535
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:53,480
Although it has nothing to
do with hate hating anybody.

1536
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:58,010
So since the same thing is
happening here and a Mao's China,

1537
01:03:58,610 --> 01:03:59,750
what would you say?

1538
01:03:59,751 --> 01:03:59,871
Well,

1539
01:03:59,871 --> 01:03:59,991
what,

1540
01:03:59,991 --> 01:04:04,991
what do you think is the connection
between the philosophy and they're idiotic

1541
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,390
oversimplifying and tyrannical way of him,

1542
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:09,830
of trying to promoting it?

1543
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:11,920
Well,

1544
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:12,753
the first thing,

1545
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:17,770
the first thing we should make clear
is that there is such a thing as hate

1546
01:04:17,771 --> 01:04:18,604
speech,

1547
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:19,810
right?

1548
01:04:19,810 --> 01:04:24,790
Like let's not be naive about this and
you can use words to inflame and words

1549
01:04:24,791 --> 01:04:26,560
can be very dangerous tools.

1550
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,320
People use them and hateful
matters all the time.

1551
01:04:29,830 --> 01:04:30,850
That's not the issue.

1552
01:04:31,120 --> 01:04:32,110
That's obvious.

1553
01:04:32,770 --> 01:04:37,420
The issue is whether or not you should
regulate out and even more importantly,

1554
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:38,860
whether the state should regulate it.

1555
01:04:38,861 --> 01:04:42,340
And the reason that's an issue is
because who's going to define it?

1556
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,890
I'll tell you who's going
to define hate speech.

1557
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:48,100
It's the people who are doing that
that are going to define hate speech.

1558
01:04:48,310 --> 01:04:51,940
And right now they're defining you
sitting in here as hate speech.

1559
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:52,541
I mean,

1560
01:04:52,541 --> 01:04:54,760
that's exactly what's
going on while we sit here.

1561
01:04:54,761 --> 01:04:59,350
It's like who would be interested in
defining the parameters of hate speech?

1562
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,460
Here's the answer.

1563
01:05:00,790 --> 01:05:05,790
The people that you would least want to
have adopt that responsibility and and

1564
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:06,971
hate speech.

1565
01:05:06,971 --> 01:05:07,700
It's like,

1566
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:12,160
let's say I was interviewed a while
back and the journalist asked me,

1567
01:05:12,580 --> 01:05:12,731
well,

1568
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:14,630
why should your right to a family Trump,

1569
01:05:14,631 --> 01:05:16,390
someone's right to be secure?

1570
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:17,253
It's like,

1571
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:18,123
okay,

1572
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:22,330
well let's say I'm talking to
one person and you might say,

1573
01:05:22,331 --> 01:05:23,890
well I don't have the
right to offend them.

1574
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:24,251
It's like,

1575
01:05:24,251 --> 01:05:25,084
all right,

1576
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:26,770
what if I'm talking to 10 people?

1577
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:30,720
Do I have the right to offend one of
those people when I speak to the mortar,

1578
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:31,870
if it's a thousand people,

1579
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:33,540
what you're saying

1580
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:43,450
[inaudible]

1581
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:46,553
you can't,

1582
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:51,120
you can't have a conversation about
something serious without offense.

1583
01:05:51,540 --> 01:05:53,760
Like if I'm thinking
about something serious,

1584
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,680
like I often myself,

1585
01:05:56,190 --> 01:05:56,401
you know,

1586
01:05:56,401 --> 01:05:57,810
and I seriously mean that.

1587
01:05:57,811 --> 01:05:58,650
I really mean that.

1588
01:05:58,651 --> 01:06:01,530
So like if I'm laying
out a set of hypotheses,

1589
01:06:01,531 --> 01:06:02,161
for example,

1590
01:06:02,161 --> 01:06:03,630
about a complex social,

1591
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,920
a social problem,

1592
01:06:05,340 --> 01:06:08,010
I might lay out 20 hypothesis
and maybe two of them.

1593
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:08,910
I thank God,

1594
01:06:08,911 --> 01:06:10,140
I hope that's not true.

1595
01:06:10,560 --> 01:06:11,880
But like maybe it is true.

1596
01:06:11,881 --> 01:06:12,510
You know,

1597
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:16,260
sometimes you discover things as a social
scientist that you wish were true and

1598
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:19,380
those are usually the things that you've
discovered that are actually true,

1599
01:06:19,381 --> 01:06:19,651
right?

1600
01:06:19,651 --> 01:06:21,180
Cause they violate your assumptions.

1601
01:06:21,510 --> 01:06:26,510
So you can't even think if you're
not willing to offend yourself.

1602
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,380
That's what thinking does.

1603
01:06:28,381 --> 01:06:32,130
If you're ever talking about something
wouldn't be serious if it didn't have the

1604
01:06:32,131 --> 01:06:34,830
possibility of frightening
and offending people.

1605
01:06:34,980 --> 01:06:35,780
That's kind of how the,

1606
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:38,310
that's kind of like the
definition of seriousness.

1607
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:38,671
It's like,

1608
01:06:38,671 --> 01:06:38,821
well,

1609
01:06:38,821 --> 01:06:42,720
we can only talk about things
that no one ever gets upset about.

1610
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:43,291
It's like,

1611
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,124
well

1612
01:06:45,810 --> 01:06:48,240
then it's like you're
trapped in an elevator for,

1613
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:52,920
for the rest of infinity listening
to nothing but Muzak you're,

1614
01:06:52,921 --> 01:06:53,670
that's an,

1615
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:55,080
that's a kind of hell man.

1616
01:06:55,260 --> 01:06:56,460
If you're going to think,

1617
01:06:56,520 --> 01:06:58,080
and also if you're going to speak,

1618
01:06:58,350 --> 01:06:59,183
you're going to,

1619
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:00,660
you're going to offend people.

1620
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:04,530
You're going to go after their deepest
presuppositions and end your own as well.

1621
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,240
You're going to shatter them at times.

1622
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:07,560
It's going to be brutal.

1623
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:08,760
Absolutely brutal.

1624
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:12,240
And you all know that because every
single one of you has had a serious

1625
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:16,110
conversation with someone that you love
and the probability that that was an

1626
01:07:16,140 --> 01:07:20,820
easy conversation and that either of you
escaped without offense and terror is

1627
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:21,840
zero.

1628
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:23,940
If you haven't had a
conversation like that,

1629
01:07:23,941 --> 01:07:24,480
well,

1630
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:25,313
well

1631
01:07:28,290 --> 01:07:29,220
you're not human,

1632
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:29,630
right?

1633
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,170
I mean right.

1634
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:35,280
Cause everyone has conversations like
that all the time except when they run

1635
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:36,000
from them,

1636
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,970
which is most of the time
and no bloody wonder,

1637
01:07:39,540 --> 01:07:39,901
you know,

1638
01:07:39,901 --> 01:07:44,610
real conversations or there's nothing
worse than a real conversation except the

1639
01:07:44,611 --> 01:07:47,370
war that you have if you
don't have the conversation.

1640
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,290
That's basically how it goes.

1641
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:50,490
I just want to underline,

1642
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,300
I just want to underline
Jordan's first point,

1643
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:04,130
which is really that it's
a very dangerous thing.

1644
01:08:05,030 --> 01:08:10,030
Any legal rule that relies on some kind
of reasonableness because reasonableness

1645
01:08:11,211 --> 01:08:13,580
lies in the eyes of the beholder.

1646
01:08:13,820 --> 01:08:14,600
I mean,

1647
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,250
those out there

1648
01:08:16,310 --> 01:08:19,910
think that you guys are
uttering hate speech.

1649
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:25,180
They think that you guys should be the
one who are arrested and just imagine if

1650
01:08:25,221 --> 01:08:28,850
they were the ones who had
the reins of government power.

1651
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:33,650
Just all very well hate
speech as a reasonable idea.

1652
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:36,980
But as soon as you give up the
control about what that means,

1653
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,710
you're liable to run into real trouble.

1654
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:42,403
Yup.

1655
01:08:42,780 --> 01:08:42,990
Hello,

1656
01:08:42,990 --> 01:08:44,050
Mr. Rowe.

1657
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:44,401
Well,

1658
01:08:44,401 --> 01:08:45,390
Mr. Peterson,

1659
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:46,920
my name is Zachary Milligan.

1660
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:47,911
Uh,

1661
01:08:47,911 --> 01:08:48,451
first off,

1662
01:08:48,451 --> 01:08:53,010
I'd just like to start to actually thank
you for all the hardship and troubles

1663
01:08:53,011 --> 01:08:57,570
even dirt for standing up for our
rights and being a part of this debate.

1664
01:08:58,580 --> 01:08:59,413
Um,

1665
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:03,720
I come from a dairy farm and math
need rural res conservatively.

1666
01:09:03,721 --> 01:09:07,960
And my question is in the face of
when we have a social situation,

1667
01:09:07,961 --> 01:09:08,970
so divisive,

1668
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:12,480
when you genuinely believe what
you're doing is the right thing.

1669
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:14,040
In this particular instance,

1670
01:09:14,041 --> 01:09:15,390
since you have experience with it,

1671
01:09:15,720 --> 01:09:16,950
what would you say?

1672
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:19,350
Is there a more effective,

1673
01:09:19,351 --> 01:09:21,990
I don't want to say an easy
way to reach out for them,

1674
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:25,980
but what do you think's the best way to
try and talk some sense into those folks

1675
01:09:25,981 --> 01:09:27,720
outside and the one on one setting?

1676
01:09:28,190 --> 01:09:33,190
So the first thing is is I
don't necessarily the day
I don't necessarily think

1677
01:09:33,351 --> 01:09:36,500
that what I'm doing is the
right thing because you know,

1678
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,930
you have to be careful when
you make a claim like that.

1679
01:09:38,931 --> 01:09:40,190
But I can tell you one thing,

1680
01:09:40,790 --> 01:09:45,790
I'm not going to let anyone stand in the
way of me trying to figure out what the

1681
01:09:45,801 --> 01:09:46,910
right thing is.

1682
01:09:47,360 --> 01:09:48,290
That's the thing.

1683
01:09:57,090 --> 01:10:02,090
And then I would say we're doing exactly
what we should be doing right now in

1684
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:02,940
this discussion.

1685
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:03,200
It's,

1686
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:04,620
it's just exactly right,

1687
01:10:05,130 --> 01:10:05,490
right?

1688
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:06,323
I mean,

1689
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:09,840
admittedly we have to talk over the noise,

1690
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:14,100
but that's really not that big a
catastrophe and everybody's in here is

1691
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:16,110
comporting themselves
in a reasonable manner.

1692
01:10:16,111 --> 01:10:19,410
And we're trying to struggle our
way through the topics and we're,

1693
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,020
we're asking questions and we're,

1694
01:10:21,150 --> 01:10:23,340
we're trying to have a
genuine dialogue about them.

1695
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:24,960
And that's what we've got.

1696
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:25,823
We've got,

1697
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:27,840
we've got three things.

1698
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,300
We've got negotiation,

1699
01:10:31,530 --> 01:10:32,700
we've got slavery,

1700
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,350
and we've got tyranny.

1701
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,240
And those are your choices.

1702
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:38,640
And so this is negotiation,

1703
01:10:38,641 --> 01:10:38,881
right?

1704
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:40,050
That's public discourse.

1705
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:43,620
And the reason that freedom of speech
thought is obviously important.

1706
01:10:43,621 --> 01:10:44,820
And everyone can understand that.

1707
01:10:44,821 --> 01:10:45,241
You might say,

1708
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:45,391
well,

1709
01:10:45,391 --> 01:10:48,990
you don't need to speak freely because
you can think who's going to get inside

1710
01:10:48,991 --> 01:10:49,800
your head.

1711
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,320
But the problem with that
is that that's not it.

1712
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,490
You can't think very well because
there you are and your little world,

1713
01:10:56,491 --> 01:10:56,761
you know,

1714
01:10:56,761 --> 01:10:58,980
with all your biases and your ignorance,

1715
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,520
you're wrong about so many things and
you're going to learn it really painfully.

1716
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:03,270
And,

1717
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:07,230
and then maybe you can trot out some
of the things you think erroneously and

1718
01:11:07,231 --> 01:11:10,710
ignorantly and other people will give
you a tap on the side of the head instead

1719
01:11:10,711 --> 01:11:12,570
of running you over with a freight train,

1720
01:11:12,571 --> 01:11:13,050
right?

1721
01:11:13,050 --> 01:11:15,660
They'll give you a little tap on the side
of the head and maybe you'll walk away

1722
01:11:15,661 --> 01:11:16,620
a little smarter.

1723
01:11:16,830 --> 01:11:19,000
And that's why freedom of
speech is so important,

1724
01:11:19,001 --> 01:11:20,700
just because a lot of thinking,

1725
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:24,270
especially about things that are
beyond you for whatever reason,

1726
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:29,271
have to take place publicly as we stumble
around towards an adequate formulation

1727
01:11:29,461 --> 01:11:31,170
of the problems that beset us.

1728
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:32,611
So I would say,

1729
01:11:32,611 --> 01:11:34,890
well in this book I wrote,

1730
01:11:35,070 --> 01:11:35,910
I have a rule.

1731
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:36,890
It's,

1732
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:41,040
I think it's rule eight which is
tell the truth or at least don't lie.

1733
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:41,701
I would say,

1734
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:41,851
well,

1735
01:11:41,851 --> 01:11:43,470
that's another reasonable,

1736
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:48,480
a reasonable way to start approaching
the situation is it's not so easy to tell

1737
01:11:48,481 --> 01:11:49,560
the truth because like,

1738
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:50,453
what do you know?

1739
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:51,240
You know,

1740
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:52,230
you can't come out and say,

1741
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:52,351
well,

1742
01:11:52,351 --> 01:11:53,184
here's the truth,

1743
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:55,200
but I know what one thing you can do,

1744
01:11:55,201 --> 01:11:59,640
which is when you know that what you're
saying is a lie by your own standards,

1745
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:04,350
you can not say it and you can have a
consultation with yourself and you can try

1746
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:07,620
to learn to say those
things that make you strong.

1747
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:11,120
Instead of saying those things
that make you weak and you,

1748
01:12:11,121 --> 01:12:15,810
you contribute to the health of the
public dialogue in an incalculable manner

1749
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:16,710
that way.

1750
01:12:16,710 --> 01:12:20,550
And this is another issue that pertains
to the dignity and importance of the

1751
01:12:20,551 --> 01:12:21,300
individual.

1752
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:25,140
How you conduct yourself in your life
is way more important than you think.

1753
01:12:25,890 --> 01:12:26,130
And,

1754
01:12:26,130 --> 01:12:29,570
and I mean I think that that's a
daunting idea because you know,

1755
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:32,020
let's say you're nihilistic
and life is meaningless.

1756
01:12:32,021 --> 01:12:32,191
It's,

1757
01:12:32,191 --> 01:12:32,311
well,

1758
01:12:32,311 --> 01:12:33,660
what's the payoff for that?

1759
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:34,441
I think,

1760
01:12:34,441 --> 01:12:34,591
well,

1761
01:12:34,591 --> 01:12:35,470
there's no payoff.

1762
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:35,821
It's like,

1763
01:12:35,821 --> 01:12:35,971
well,

1764
01:12:35,971 --> 01:12:36,241
yeah,

1765
01:12:36,241 --> 01:12:36,661
there is,

1766
01:12:36,661 --> 01:12:38,070
you have no responsibility.

1767
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:39,930
That's a pretty decent pay off.

1768
01:12:39,931 --> 01:12:40,111
I mean,

1769
01:12:40,111 --> 01:12:41,850
you have to pay the
price of meaninglessness,

1770
01:12:41,851 --> 01:12:43,620
but it doesn't matter what you do.

1771
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:44,071
Well,

1772
01:12:44,071 --> 01:12:45,230
we'll flip that over and said,

1773
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:45,421
no,

1774
01:12:45,421 --> 01:12:46,140
no,

1775
01:12:46,140 --> 01:12:46,973
sorry,

1776
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:48,030
you're wrong.

1777
01:12:48,240 --> 01:12:49,620
Your life is meaningful.

1778
01:12:49,650 --> 01:12:51,270
It's way more meaningful than you think,

1779
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:55,260
but you have to bear responsibility
for your thoughts and your actions.

1780
01:12:55,910 --> 01:12:56,401
It's like you'll,

1781
01:12:56,401 --> 01:13:00,270
there'll be plenty of meaning and not
well that if you understand that property,

1782
01:13:00,271 --> 01:13:00,810
that will,

1783
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:05,520
that will cleave you to the depths of
your soul and maybe you learn to speak

1784
01:13:05,521 --> 01:13:09,180
carefully at the act carefully and
that will have a beneficial effect on

1785
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:11,610
everyone around you if far more.

1786
01:13:11,610 --> 01:13:15,660
You're far more powerful in the place
you stand in the place you sit and stand

1787
01:13:15,661 --> 01:13:16,440
than you think.

1788
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:18,600
And I think everyone has
an intimation of that.

1789
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,430
And if you don't think that's true,

1790
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:24,390
then try treating people
around you as if it's not true.

1791
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:29,100
Tried treating people that you know in
your life as if they don't matter and

1792
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:31,170
just see what kind of response you get.

1793
01:13:31,590 --> 01:13:33,450
People are not going to be happy with you,

1794
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,040
not in any sense whatsoever.

1795
01:13:35,041 --> 01:13:35,490
You'll,

1796
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:37,200
you'll ruin all your relationships.

1797
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,540
You have to treat people
as if they matter.

1798
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:43,440
And maybe you have to treat them as
if they matter because maybe they do.

1799
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:45,450
And that goes for you too.

1800
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:47,410
And so if you matter,

1801
01:13:47,411 --> 01:13:49,070
then you should act like you matter.

1802
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:50,453
And that's a very,

1803
01:13:51,210 --> 01:13:53,040
that's a very daunting proposition.

1804
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,053
That's for sure.

1805
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:55,470
As a foot.

1806
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:56,303
Go ahead.

1807
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:57,163
As a,

1808
01:14:04,150 --> 01:14:05,590
it's just a footnote to that.

1809
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:08,050
Let's just observe this in legal terms.

1810
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:12,370
There are only two categories of actions,

1811
01:14:13,030 --> 01:14:15,030
voluntary and involuntary.

1812
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,170
Don't let anybody tell you otherwise,

1813
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,330
either you're choosing on your own and,

1814
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:24,040
and handling the consequences or the
government is telling you what to do.

1815
01:14:24,730 --> 01:14:26,170
Those are the only two possibilities.

1816
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:28,071
Thank you,

1817
01:14:28,071 --> 01:14:28,904
sir.

1818
01:14:35,290 --> 01:14:35,690
At the back.

1819
01:14:35,690 --> 01:14:36,523
Go ahead.

1820
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:37,983
Oh Duh.

1821
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:38,231
Hello,

1822
01:14:38,231 --> 01:14:39,130
Dr. Peterson.

1823
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:45,040
I would like to recall the part in your
conversation in which you mentioned how

1824
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:50,041
the radical left switched from the 1960s
and seventies to being pro back when

1825
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:54,250
they were a pro free
speech and their recent,

1826
01:14:55,210 --> 01:14:55,690
um,

1827
01:14:55,690 --> 01:14:56,770
opposition to it.

1828
01:14:58,060 --> 01:14:58,893
I know,

1829
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:02,080
I know that you often mentioned
their obsession with power,

1830
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:03,250
at least among them.

1831
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:05,373
Yes.

1832
01:15:05,490 --> 01:15:07,630
At least among their more Marxists types.

1833
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,340
I was one,

1834
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:09,500
no,

1835
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:09,851
I'm doing,

1836
01:15:09,851 --> 01:15:11,920
if perhaps they think that now,

1837
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:16,570
now is the opportunity where they can
consolidate their power and if they do so

1838
01:15:16,571 --> 01:15:21,571
successfully that it will become the
mortality of our civilization for the next

1839
01:15:23,030 --> 01:15:23,050
thousand years.

1840
01:15:23,050 --> 01:15:25,400
Like Christianity was when Rome adopted.

1841
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,690
Is that from what you've seen,

1842
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,710
would you say that that's about it,

1843
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:36,340
that that's close to the way there
that's close to their strategy?

1844
01:15:39,110 --> 01:15:39,291
Well,

1845
01:15:39,291 --> 01:15:44,291
it's hard to exactly understand
the strategy of an ideology,

1846
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:45,291
you know,

1847
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:48,890
because well all the people
who were outside were,

1848
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:53,980
were United in some sense under the
umbrella of an idea and on an idea is a

1849
01:15:54,351 --> 01:15:55,184
living thing.

1850
01:15:55,970 --> 01:16:00,800
I mean it's embedded in living tissue
and it's distributed in the fragmentary

1851
01:16:00,801 --> 01:16:02,210
manner across the mob,

1852
01:16:02,211 --> 01:16:03,044
let's say.

1853
01:16:03,290 --> 01:16:08,290
And each person in the mob always
only only possess is a fragment of the

1854
01:16:09,171 --> 01:16:12,200
ideology because the full neo Marxist,

1855
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:16,520
let's say the full neo Marxist
postmodernist doctrine is quite complex.

1856
01:16:16,521 --> 01:16:17,270
And,

1857
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:17,900
and,

1858
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,400
but when you get the mob together,

1859
01:16:19,401 --> 01:16:22,340
then it acts under the
dictate of the ideology.

1860
01:16:23,240 --> 01:16:24,260
And the question then is,

1861
01:16:24,261 --> 01:16:24,411
well,

1862
01:16:24,411 --> 01:16:26,030
what does the ideology want?

1863
01:16:26,570 --> 01:16:27,231
And I would say,

1864
01:16:27,231 --> 01:16:27,441
well,

1865
01:16:27,441 --> 01:16:30,560
it wants what it's
formulators says it wants.

1866
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:32,480
And D Derrida for example,

1867
01:16:32,481 --> 01:16:37,400
who's head trickster of the postmodernists
regarded the western society as

1868
01:16:37,401 --> 01:16:38,690
fellow go centric.

1869
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,460
Right?

1870
01:16:39,460 --> 01:16:41,330
And North that meant was male dominant,

1871
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:42,410
male dominated.

1872
01:16:42,411 --> 01:16:44,180
That's the fellow fellas part.

1873
01:16:44,450 --> 01:16:45,680
And then logo centric.

1874
01:16:45,681 --> 01:16:47,420
While that refers to the word logos,

1875
01:16:47,421 --> 01:16:49,040
which means it's the root word of logic,

1876
01:16:49,041 --> 01:16:50,390
but there's also the,

1877
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,513
it's also the,

1878
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,450
the person of Christ,

1879
01:16:53,451 --> 01:16:54,770
essentially the logos.

1880
01:16:55,190 --> 01:17:00,190
And so the purpose of the postmodern
critique was to demolish that wealth.

1881
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:02,151
Fair enough.

1882
01:17:02,151 --> 01:17:03,530
My sense with people is,

1883
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:04,640
especially if they're,

1884
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:08,720
if they've written things down and
thought them through that they're actually

1885
01:17:08,721 --> 01:17:10,280
aiming for what they say

1886
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,300
they're aiming for.

1887
01:17:12,110 --> 01:17:12,381
Well,

1888
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:12,860
if you,

1889
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:17,860
if you buy the idea that the
west is a male dominated tyranny,

1890
01:17:18,651 --> 01:17:20,450
essentially a patriarchal tyranny,

1891
01:17:20,870 --> 01:17:23,360
and that your moral
duty is to tear it down,

1892
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:25,520
well then that's what you're doing.

1893
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,141
And then you might say,

1894
01:17:27,141 --> 01:17:27,291
well,

1895
01:17:27,291 --> 01:17:27,980
what's going to,

1896
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,440
what is going to be erected on its ashes?

1897
01:17:30,470 --> 01:17:31,160
Well,

1898
01:17:31,160 --> 01:17:32,930
that's where things get complicated.

1899
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:34,430
You know,

1900
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:36,080
the first question might be,

1901
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,510
are the people who wish to tear it down?

1902
01:17:38,511 --> 01:17:39,150
Builders,

1903
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:41,210
or are they just destroyers?

1904
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:45,260
And my strong sentiment is that
they're primarily destroyers.

1905
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:47,421
Now you might say,

1906
01:17:47,421 --> 01:17:47,601
well,

1907
01:17:47,601 --> 01:17:49,400
why do people wish to destroy?

1908
01:17:50,150 --> 01:17:50,301
Well,

1909
01:17:50,301 --> 01:17:52,790
it's because they're hurt by
life and they're resentful

1910
01:17:54,310 --> 01:17:55,031
and resentful.

1911
01:17:55,031 --> 01:17:58,390
People become vengeful and vengeful.

1912
01:17:58,391 --> 01:17:59,980
People become dangerous.

1913
01:18:00,610 --> 01:18:03,850
And there's no shortage of
motivation to make things worse.

1914
01:18:05,230 --> 01:18:07,480
Now that the school
shooters make things worse,

1915
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:09,850
people make things worse.

1916
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:11,141
Now,

1917
01:18:11,141 --> 01:18:11,381
you know,

1918
01:18:11,381 --> 01:18:15,760
maybe lurking in the rhetoric is this
appealed to an egalitarian utopia,

1919
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:20,440
but we've tried utilitarian
utopia is already,

1920
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:25,690
we sacrificed 100 million people
to [inaudible] Galitary in utopias,

1921
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:27,670
and we have yet to produce one.

1922
01:18:28,390 --> 01:18:33,040
And so my sense is the corpse is stacked
up high enough to constitute proof.

1923
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:35,523
So

1924
01:18:36,390 --> 01:18:39,720
it's destruction mostly that
motivates it as far as I can tell,

1925
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:41,310
masquerading as compassion.

1926
01:18:44,750 --> 01:18:49,750
[inaudible]

1927
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:54,280
thank you for that question.

1928
01:18:54,340 --> 01:18:55,173
Next place.

1929
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:56,350
Dr. Peterson.

1930
01:18:56,500 --> 01:18:57,101
I said party.

1931
01:18:57,101 --> 01:18:58,540
Thank you both for being here today.

1932
01:18:59,310 --> 01:18:59,800
Um,

1933
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:03,370
I'm a political scientist and what
I've studied is totalitarian regimes.

1934
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:03,641
I'm sorry,

1935
01:19:03,641 --> 01:19:04,480
I'm gonna move this a little bit.

1936
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:05,413
To feel weird.

1937
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:06,551
Totalitarian regimes.

1938
01:19:06,551 --> 01:19:06,971
I've studied,

1939
01:19:06,971 --> 01:19:10,630
I've tried to look at the Iranian
revolution and the Islamic Republican,

1940
01:19:10,631 --> 01:19:11,200
Iran,

1941
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:15,580
and I've argued how the Shia Islam that
is teached in Islamic public is very

1942
01:19:15,581 --> 01:19:17,080
close to a totalitarian regime.

1943
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:21,250
But now I live in a country where my
ideas are considered controversial.

1944
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:23,140
If you believe in God,

1945
01:19:23,200 --> 01:19:24,250
if you believe in family,

1946
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,280
if you believe in having
responsibility and traditional values,

1947
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:29,560
I feel ostracized by the community here.

1948
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:30,880
I came from UFC,

1949
01:19:30,881 --> 01:19:31,960
university of Calgary over there,

1950
01:19:31,961 --> 01:19:32,830
I didn't feel this way.

1951
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:33,970
There was more welcoming.

1952
01:19:33,971 --> 01:19:37,120
Here I feel marginalized
and I do feel alone.

1953
01:19:37,540 --> 01:19:38,470
And when I see this,

1954
01:19:38,471 --> 01:19:40,570
it disgusts me that here they can do this.

1955
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:42,580
But I couldn't go to their
events and do anything.

1956
01:19:42,940 --> 01:19:43,631
I'd have to shut up,

1957
01:19:43,631 --> 01:19:45,310
there'd be disciplinary committee for me.

1958
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,000
But for them they can break windows
to God knows how old this building is.

1959
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:50,380
And it's okay for them to do that.

1960
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:52,970
So my question to you is now being sheer,

1961
01:19:52,971 --> 01:19:53,950
experiencing this,

1962
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:58,570
I'm starting to second guess that maybe
the totalitarian Islamic regime that I

1963
01:19:58,571 --> 01:19:59,320
was so,

1964
01:19:59,320 --> 01:19:59,650
you know,

1965
01:19:59,650 --> 01:20:03,220
talking about and critical
of back in Iran isn't so bad.

1966
01:20:03,221 --> 01:20:07,080
When I have a choice between having to
be here and be depressed and be there and

1967
01:20:07,081 --> 01:20:09,600
at least have my ideas
be okay with Lou regime.

1968
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:14,430
So my argument is if this free speech
and the arguments you're guys are making

1969
01:20:14,431 --> 01:20:15,020
here,

1970
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,020
it doesn't work.

1971
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:19,590
Would that not be the next step for
people to go towards totalitarianism?

1972
01:20:19,770 --> 01:20:22,950
If dialogue fails and isn't force
of arms the only thing left?

1973
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,650
How can people compromise
when they don't want to talk,

1974
01:20:25,710 --> 01:20:26,670
when they want to yell?

1975
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,673
Thank you.

1976
01:20:35,330 --> 01:20:36,163
Okay.

1977
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,190
I think you make it very good point.

1978
01:20:39,220 --> 01:20:41,560
I don't think we should fool ourselves.

1979
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:46,560
This is about force and it is a,

1980
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:51,570
it's almost a dare to suggest that that
certain elements are not allowed to

1981
01:20:54,341 --> 01:20:58,780
enforce their view of the world
and that speaking contrary to it,

1982
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,620
isn't that a front to those values
and they won't shut you down.

1983
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:02,190
I mean that,

1984
01:21:02,190 --> 01:21:03,820
that that is what is at stake.

1985
01:21:04,070 --> 01:21:04,390
We,

1986
01:21:04,390 --> 01:21:04,631
we,

1987
01:21:04,631 --> 01:21:05,400
we are,

1988
01:21:05,400 --> 01:21:05,860
we are.

1989
01:21:05,860 --> 01:21:10,860
We are no longer really in a situation
where this will all be resolved through

1990
01:21:12,340 --> 01:21:13,780
sort of gentle,

1991
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,610
reasonable civil dialogue

1992
01:21:17,490 --> 01:21:18,760
that happens on the side,

1993
01:21:18,761 --> 01:21:20,260
but it's not real anymore.

1994
01:21:20,261 --> 01:21:21,970
It's not really where
the fight is happening.

1995
01:21:22,270 --> 01:21:22,910
This is a,

1996
01:21:22,910 --> 01:21:27,400
an imposition of the force of
the state and it is skewed.

1997
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:31,690
It's skewed a certain way
and we're getting to the
point where a certain kind of

1998
01:21:32,020 --> 01:21:32,621
language,

1999
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:32,990
a curtain,

2000
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,460
certain kind of dialogue is,

2001
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:37,090
is approved and all
right and a certain kind.

2002
01:21:37,091 --> 01:21:37,811
It is not.

2003
01:21:37,811 --> 01:21:40,990
And that is the campaign that is
going on that this is all part of.

2004
01:21:41,980 --> 01:21:43,990
And I have to say that,

2005
01:21:43,991 --> 01:21:46,150
that your presence here and,

2006
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:51,180
and your endorsement of this kind of
event is the kind of thing that has the

2007
01:21:51,581 --> 01:21:54,460
major pushback to that trend.

2008
01:21:54,490 --> 01:21:57,580
But the trend is continuing
and is a very dangerous one.

2009
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,250
And uh,

2010
01:21:59,590 --> 01:21:59,951
this is,

2011
01:21:59,951 --> 01:22:00,440
uh,

2012
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:04,030
a difficult moment in
the life of this country.

2013
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:04,510
Would you,

2014
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:05,343
would you say

2015
01:22:05,370 --> 01:22:06,220
Jordan Peele?

2016
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:07,140
So,

2017
01:22:07,140 --> 01:22:07,973
so some,

2018
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:09,240
some comments about,

2019
01:22:09,270 --> 01:22:10,230
about your career,

2020
01:22:10,231 --> 01:22:10,651
let's say.

2021
01:22:10,651 --> 01:22:10,921
Okay,

2022
01:22:10,921 --> 01:22:13,560
so you're a young mountain and you've
got lots of years ahead of you.

2023
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:14,394
So you know,

2024
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:17,010
you want to prepare for the
war and not for the battle,

2025
01:22:17,550 --> 01:22:18,383
right?

2026
01:22:18,510 --> 01:22:18,751
Okay.

2027
01:22:18,751 --> 01:22:22,050
Cause there's going to be many
battles for you personally and perhaps

2028
01:22:22,051 --> 01:22:23,130
politically and all of that.

2029
01:22:23,131 --> 01:22:26,550
And so you want to make yourself as
articulate and educated as you can and you

2030
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:27,540
want to have patients.

2031
01:22:27,900 --> 01:22:30,720
I wouldn't say that there
is no cause for despair,

2032
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:31,651
you know?

2033
01:22:31,651 --> 01:22:36,240
I believe that the people
who are attempting to
radicalize our society and to

2034
01:22:36,241 --> 01:22:39,930
transform it into a battleground of
identity politics are in a distinct

2035
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:40,793
minority,

2036
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:42,990
and I think that,

2037
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,960
I think that there's no reason to assume
that we can't push the devil back into

2038
01:22:46,961 --> 01:22:47,460
the,

2039
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,480
into the bottle,

2040
01:22:48,540 --> 01:22:49,171
so to speak,

2041
01:22:49,171 --> 01:22:51,210
to push the genie back into the bottle,

2042
01:22:51,690 --> 01:22:53,430
and so don't despair.

2043
01:22:53,910 --> 01:22:55,740
Now from a personal perspective,

2044
01:22:55,741 --> 01:22:59,880
it's like we've got lots of things to
learn and you've got lots of things to say

2045
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:04,200
and to write and you're going to find now
and then that you were imposed upon in

2046
01:23:04,201 --> 01:23:06,190
a manner that you don't find tolerable.

2047
01:23:06,340 --> 01:23:06,611
Right?

2048
01:23:06,611 --> 01:23:06,971
You think,

2049
01:23:06,971 --> 01:23:08,140
I can't live like this,

2050
01:23:08,141 --> 01:23:08,351
right?

2051
01:23:08,351 --> 01:23:10,450
It's going to distress you and well then,

2052
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:13,120
then you've come across
your moral conundrum,

2053
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:13,841
right?

2054
01:23:13,841 --> 01:23:16,360
It's specific to you and then you have to,

2055
01:23:16,510 --> 01:23:20,140
that's when you have to grow
up and think strategically.

2056
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:24,160
It's like you decide are you willing
to live under those conditions?

2057
01:23:24,310 --> 01:23:25,150
If you're not,

2058
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:27,340
then you develop a strategy.

2059
01:23:27,550 --> 01:23:27,910
It's like,

2060
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:28,660
okay,

2061
01:23:28,660 --> 01:23:29,493
I'm going to,

2062
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:31,600
I'm going to fight this.

2063
01:23:32,290 --> 01:23:34,150
I'm going to fight it carefully,

2064
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:35,800
intelligently,

2065
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:40,240
thoughtfully on multiple fronts
and I'm not going to back down.

2066
01:23:40,500 --> 01:23:42,310
You don't make that decision lightly.

2067
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:46,570
You know most things you should let blow
by you because there's not that much of

2068
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:48,070
you and there's lots of things,

2069
01:23:48,310 --> 01:23:51,390
but now and then you'll find a stumbling
block that you can't get over it

2070
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,420
because it hurts you.

2071
01:23:53,030 --> 01:23:54,580
It damages your soul.

2072
01:23:54,581 --> 01:23:55,930
That's the right way to think about it.

2073
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:59,560
Well then that's the time for
you to put your education to use.

2074
01:23:59,810 --> 01:24:00,201
You know,

2075
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,510
and you'll be able to do that.

2076
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:02,110
I mean,

2077
01:24:02,110 --> 01:24:05,890
you don't want to underestimate
the utility of of deep,

2078
01:24:05,891 --> 01:24:07,330
forthright speech.

2079
01:24:07,510 --> 01:24:10,180
I don't believe that anything
can stand in its way.

2080
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:12,040
You have the courage of your convictions,

2081
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:13,840
but don't give way to despair.

2082
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:16,600
Like this battle is by no means over.

2083
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:17,230
Nope.

2084
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:20,560
I know meat and it isn't even obvious
that the bad guys are winning,

2085
01:24:20,561 --> 01:24:21,400
so to speak.

2086
01:24:21,820 --> 01:24:22,420
You know?

2087
01:24:22,420 --> 01:24:22,661
I mean,

2088
01:24:22,661 --> 01:24:23,860
here we are,

2089
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:25,390
we're having this talk.

2090
01:24:25,660 --> 01:24:29,440
The university came out forthrightly
in favor of free speech.

2091
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:30,670
Hooray for that

2092
01:24:30,750 --> 01:24:35,750
[inaudible]

2093
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:50,630
no one and so far all the questions today
have been thoughtful and intelligent.

2094
01:24:50,660 --> 01:24:52,340
You seem like informed people.

2095
01:24:52,580 --> 01:24:54,740
It's like don't
underestimate your strength.

2096
01:24:55,250 --> 01:24:56,083
And so,

2097
01:24:56,090 --> 01:25:01,090
and McMaster just published a set of
guidelines governing this sort of behavior

2098
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:06,160
so that will no longer be acceptable to
disrupt perfectly reasonable proceedings

2099
01:25:07,431 --> 01:25:08,930
on university campuses.

2100
01:25:11,050 --> 01:25:12,210
And so that,

2101
01:25:12,380 --> 01:25:15,320
so the discussions like
this can continue properly.

2102
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:20,530
I mean there's definitely a place for
give and take and for informed opposition,

2103
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:21,793
let's say.

2104
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:26,450
But there's a difference between informed
opposition and child childish grand

2105
01:25:26,451 --> 01:25:27,050
standing.

2106
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,940
And I think people know the
difference between that.

2107
01:25:28,941 --> 01:25:30,230
So don't,

2108
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:33,470
don't be desperate about it
by not pick your battles.

2109
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:35,900
A little courage goes a long way,

2110
01:25:35,901 --> 01:25:36,171
right?

2111
01:25:36,171 --> 01:25:38,630
Because other people
see it and there's that,

2112
01:25:38,631 --> 01:25:39,464
there is,

2113
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:45,130
I think a silent majority out
there that is silent and is scared.

2114
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:50,180
But if they see courage from somebody,

2115
01:25:50,210 --> 01:25:51,630
they responded to it.

2116
01:25:51,710 --> 01:25:52,340
Well,

2117
01:25:52,340 --> 01:25:56,000
I think you described lawyers in
a way that appealed to me once.

2118
01:25:56,240 --> 01:25:56,631
He said,

2119
01:25:56,631 --> 01:25:57,464
I think,

2120
01:25:57,590 --> 01:25:58,430
I know that's rare,

2121
01:25:58,431 --> 01:25:59,264
but

2122
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:02,000
you said lawyers,

2123
01:26:02,030 --> 01:26:03,350
I think these are the words you said.

2124
01:26:03,351 --> 01:26:04,550
Lawyers are

2125
01:26:04,610 --> 01:26:07,400
difficult and emotionally stable.

2126
01:26:08,510 --> 01:26:10,580
And it was the combination
of those two things,

2127
01:26:10,581 --> 01:26:12,050
the willingness to be difficult,

2128
01:26:12,410 --> 01:26:14,900
but not to be emotional about it.

2129
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:15,261
So don't,

2130
01:26:15,261 --> 01:26:15,621
don't,

2131
01:26:15,621 --> 01:26:16,041
don't,

2132
01:26:16,041 --> 01:26:17,930
where'd your emotions to the fight?

2133
01:26:18,350 --> 01:26:19,370
Take a step back,

2134
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,480
engage in it,

2135
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:21,530
see what you think.

2136
01:26:21,710 --> 01:26:22,700
Be Courageous,

2137
01:26:22,730 --> 01:26:24,200
but don't get wrapped up in it.

2138
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:25,730
Don't be emotional about it,

2139
01:26:26,080 --> 01:26:26,913
but you know,

2140
01:26:27,430 --> 01:26:30,380
retain your strength for the long haul.

2141
01:26:30,410 --> 01:26:31,220
Yup.

2142
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:31,640
Well,

2143
01:26:31,640 --> 01:26:31,911
you know,

2144
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:33,710
one of the things I've
learned strategically,

2145
01:26:33,711 --> 01:26:35,420
and this is really we're
thinking about too,

2146
01:26:35,421 --> 01:26:39,860
is that when you're engaged
in a public dispute like this,

2147
01:26:39,950 --> 01:26:42,440
it's not obvious when
things are going your way.

2148
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:43,851
You know,

2149
01:26:43,851 --> 01:26:44,241
you think,

2150
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:44,511
well,

2151
01:26:44,511 --> 01:26:46,310
this protest is not such a good thing.

2152
01:26:46,311 --> 01:26:46,940
It's like,

2153
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,590
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

2154
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:53,600
You know what's happened to me in the
last 18 months is that virtually every

2155
01:26:53,601 --> 01:26:57,440
time that I been attacked and some
of the attacks have been quite well,

2156
01:26:57,441 --> 01:27:00,410
I wouldn't say brutal because we
haven't got to that thank God,

2157
01:27:00,650 --> 01:27:02,090
but they've certainly been,

2158
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,193
um,

2159
01:27:04,340 --> 01:27:05,660
they've taken me aback.

2160
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:05,931
You know,

2161
01:27:05,931 --> 01:27:06,764
it's not,

2162
01:27:07,010 --> 01:27:09,470
it's not a straight forward
thing to be in a hall with.

2163
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,360
And this happened at McMaster with a
hundred people yelling at you and Larry

2164
01:27:14,361 --> 01:27:15,710
near horns and all of that.

2165
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:21,040
But that wasn't a bad thing as it turned
out because it was filmed and it was

2166
01:27:22,041 --> 01:27:26,630
put on Youtube and it was terrible
for the people who protested,

2167
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:27,590
you know,

2168
01:27:27,590 --> 01:27:28,730
it wasn't good.

2169
01:27:28,970 --> 01:27:31,790
And so you got to detach yourself to,

2170
01:27:31,820 --> 01:27:32,350
you know,

2171
01:27:32,350 --> 01:27:32,530
if,

2172
01:27:32,530 --> 01:27:34,730
if you say what you think
and you're careful about it,

2173
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:37,850
it's going to have some short term
effects and it's going to have some medium

2174
01:27:37,851 --> 01:27:38,511
term with exit.

2175
01:27:38,511 --> 01:27:39,980
It's going to have some long term effects.

2176
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:42,200
And one of the things that you need to do,

2177
01:27:42,201 --> 01:27:42,741
I would say,

2178
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:44,090
and this is an element of courage,

2179
01:27:44,091 --> 01:27:49,091
is you have to have faith that the medium
to longterm consequences of you saying

2180
01:27:50,121 --> 01:27:52,310
what you have to say
as clearly as possible.

2181
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:56,480
It's going to be positive and you
have to act on that supposition.

2182
01:27:56,690 --> 01:27:57,381
You don't know,

2183
01:27:57,381 --> 01:27:57,770
right?

2184
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:02,150
You can't know that that's the
existential leap of faith is you.

2185
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:02,901
You can't know,

2186
01:28:02,901 --> 01:28:04,190
but you act anyway.

2187
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:08,330
And my experience has been
that you don't want to,

2188
01:28:08,750 --> 01:28:11,810
you don't want to make judgment too
quickly because it's not always clear when

2189
01:28:11,811 --> 01:28:12,950
things are going your way.

2190
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:14,623
So when you know,

2191
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:18,470
you might stand up into class and say
something that people react negatively to

2192
01:28:18,471 --> 01:28:20,690
eat and you might get pilloried
for that by some people,

2193
01:28:20,691 --> 01:28:24,530
but you never know who you're touching
in the crowd and you don't know how

2194
01:28:24,531 --> 01:28:26,120
that's going to unfold across time.

2195
01:28:26,570 --> 01:28:29,780
Now you who that might be a defining
moment in someone else's life to watch you

2196
01:28:29,781 --> 01:28:31,460
stand up and say what you have to say.

2197
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:36,830
So don't underestimate the power
of truth and courage really.

2198
01:28:37,410 --> 01:28:38,243
So

2199
01:28:38,790 --> 01:28:43,790
[inaudible]

2200
01:28:46,460 --> 01:28:47,240
honestly,

2201
01:28:47,240 --> 01:28:48,380
they should be thankful.

2202
01:28:48,381 --> 01:28:51,110
And how civil and how
peaceful you guys are.

2203
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:52,010
They should be thankful.

2204
01:28:52,011 --> 01:28:52,844
They shouldn't be angry.

2205
01:28:58,420 --> 01:29:02,070
I regret to say we probably
have time for probably

2206
01:29:02,070 --> 01:29:03,600
just a couple more questions.

2207
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:04,650
So let's

2208
01:29:05,030 --> 01:29:05,930
go to the back.

2209
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:09,073
Hi.

2210
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:09,913
Um,

2211
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:13,130
so my question is
directed at Dr. Peterson.

2212
01:29:13,460 --> 01:29:14,293
Um,

2213
01:29:15,380 --> 01:29:19,820
I've been watching your lectures
online for a while and um,

2214
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:20,673
you talk a lot,

2215
01:29:21,150 --> 01:29:22,090
come a little closer to the bank,

2216
01:29:23,800 --> 01:29:25,430
you speak a lot about that's better.

2217
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:30,710
You speak a lot about character arc types
and a narrative and the importance of

2218
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,760
the young Ian idea of the

2219
01:29:36,260 --> 01:29:37,460
personal narrative.

2220
01:29:37,680 --> 01:29:39,110
Um,

2221
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:40,753
I

2222
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,570
am having trouble formulating
this into a question,

2223
01:29:45,320 --> 01:29:49,370
but I guess with the idea
of art types in mind,

2224
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:49,880
um,

2225
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:51,890
are you familiar with,

2226
01:29:51,910 --> 01:29:52,220
uh,

2227
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:55,640
been neue Mandel broads
idea of fractal patterns?

2228
01:29:56,590 --> 01:29:57,290
Um,

2229
01:29:57,290 --> 01:29:58,130
and if so,

2230
01:29:58,131 --> 01:29:59,420
what do you think and if,

2231
01:29:59,421 --> 01:30:01,430
is there a connection
there maybe to be found?

2232
01:30:03,470 --> 01:30:03,621
Well,

2233
01:30:03,621 --> 01:30:08,621
there seems to be a metaphorical
connection in that the great is,

2234
01:30:09,710 --> 01:30:11,930
is reproduced in the small,

2235
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:15,080
and that's certainly
an idea that permeates,

2236
01:30:15,470 --> 01:30:18,230
let's say religious and
theological speculation.

2237
01:30:18,890 --> 01:30:19,131
You know,

2238
01:30:19,131 --> 01:30:24,131
there's an idea that here's an idea
that it's like the idea of the genie,

2239
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:29,990
which is the re same root word as genius,

2240
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,280
the genius,

2241
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:35,390
something of unimaginable power that's
constrained in a very small space.

2242
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:37,760
And that's kind of what a person is like.

2243
01:30:38,780 --> 01:30:39,350
You know,

2244
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,390
we have this affinity,

2245
01:30:41,780 --> 01:30:43,790
we have this connection to the infinite,

2246
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,980
we have this connection to the divine,

2247
01:30:46,490 --> 01:30:47,030
but we're,

2248
01:30:47,030 --> 01:30:49,530
but it's constrained
within within our frames,

2249
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:50,210
right?

2250
01:30:50,210 --> 01:30:55,210
And we have to act out that the divine
narrative in the confines of our own

2251
01:30:55,581 --> 01:30:56,414
life.

2252
01:30:56,480 --> 01:30:58,430
And so there is this overarching reality,

2253
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:03,460
which is something like the fo
the forthright confrontation
with the catastrophe

2254
01:31:04,191 --> 01:31:04,760
of life,

2255
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:05,420
right?

2256
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:05,780
And,

2257
01:31:05,780 --> 01:31:07,460
but that has to be made personal,

2258
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:07,821
you know,

2259
01:31:07,821 --> 01:31:08,271
so that,

2260
01:31:08,271 --> 01:31:09,104
that's one of yoga,

2261
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:09,801
I would say,

2262
01:31:09,801 --> 01:31:10,760
deepest ideas,

2263
01:31:10,761 --> 01:31:14,150
is that the archetipal has to be
made personally in your own life.

2264
01:31:14,390 --> 01:31:18,020
And so you take the generic
pattern and you personalize it,

2265
01:31:18,021 --> 01:31:20,450
and then the infinite and the finite meat.

2266
01:31:20,510 --> 01:31:22,130
And that's the perfect combination.

2267
01:31:22,640 --> 01:31:24,230
And there's something about that that's,

2268
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:25,060
well,

2269
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:27,260
honorably profound I would say.

2270
01:31:27,620 --> 01:31:27,900
And,

2271
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:28,310
and,

2272
01:31:28,310 --> 01:31:30,980
and as true as anything can be,

2273
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:36,080
and I think people know this at the
very deep level because you do know when

2274
01:31:36,081 --> 01:31:39,200
you're struggling to go to sleep at night
and your conscience is bothering you

2275
01:31:39,890 --> 01:31:41,840
and you think through the
things that you did in the day,

2276
01:31:41,841 --> 01:31:42,291
in the week,

2277
01:31:42,291 --> 01:31:46,400
you'll take solace in the things that
you did that were noble and true and you,

2278
01:31:46,401 --> 01:31:47,090
and you can,

2279
01:31:47,090 --> 01:31:51,740
you can breathe a sigh of relief that
you're not completely corrupt and lost and

2280
01:31:51,741 --> 01:31:52,850
then you can sleep.

2281
01:31:53,510 --> 01:31:55,220
It's like everyone knows this.

2282
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:55,521
Well,

2283
01:31:55,521 --> 01:31:57,080
we need to know it consciously,

2284
01:31:57,140 --> 01:31:57,710
right?

2285
01:31:57,710 --> 01:31:58,970
And that's part of the process,

2286
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:01,420
making the archetypal personal and that,

2287
01:32:01,421 --> 01:32:04,450
that's part of what the religious
process is supposed to be about,

2288
01:32:04,451 --> 01:32:06,130
is to outline the,

2289
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:08,170
the archetipal pattern and then to say,

2290
01:32:08,171 --> 01:32:08,441
look,

2291
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:09,730
you have to meditate on this.

2292
01:32:09,730 --> 01:32:13,660
And you have to figure out how to make
it true in the confines of your own life.

2293
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:15,360
And that gives,

2294
01:32:15,430 --> 01:32:19,360
see the reason that works I think is
because there's no doubt that your life is

2295
01:32:19,361 --> 01:32:23,260
tragic and there's no doubt that you have
a bilevel and element and that you'll

2296
01:32:23,261 --> 01:32:25,900
be touched by betrayal and
all those terrible things.

2297
01:32:26,590 --> 01:32:30,400
But there's a nobility about youtue and
that nobility might be sufficient to

2298
01:32:30,401 --> 01:32:32,260
transcend your limitations.

2299
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:36,130
And I would say that your life is a
struggle to determine if that might be the

2300
01:32:36,131 --> 01:32:36,820
case.

2301
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:38,380
And that's the act of faith.

2302
01:32:38,930 --> 01:32:43,540
And I also do believe I was asked today
by South African journalist if I'm the

2303
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:46,210
ultimate pessimist or
the ultimate optimist,

2304
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:46,900
no one.

2305
01:32:46,900 --> 01:32:49,360
I would say in some ways I
am the ultimate pessimist.

2306
01:32:49,361 --> 01:32:54,160
I know I think as much as I can
tolerate how terrible life can be,

2307
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:58,510
but I do believe that the human spirit
can overcome that catastrophe and can

2308
01:32:58,511 --> 01:33:00,310
rise out of it.

2309
01:33:01,540 --> 01:33:06,540
And I think the universities are that
that idea expressed in stone and tradition

2310
01:33:09,140 --> 01:33:10,330
and it's a great idea.

2311
01:33:10,331 --> 01:33:11,740
Everyone needs the idea,

2312
01:33:12,130 --> 01:33:13,450
especially people who are young,

2313
01:33:13,451 --> 01:33:14,380
you know your life is,

2314
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:16,690
you know that your life
is going to be difficult.

2315
01:33:17,050 --> 01:33:18,730
It's like no one can say,

2316
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:18,941
well,

2317
01:33:18,941 --> 01:33:19,900
it's going to be easy.

2318
01:33:19,901 --> 01:33:20,621
But you might say,

2319
01:33:20,621 --> 01:33:20,801
well,

2320
01:33:20,801 --> 01:33:22,210
do you want it to be easy?

2321
01:33:22,910 --> 01:33:24,100
What's in it for you?

2322
01:33:24,101 --> 01:33:25,150
If it's easy,

2323
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:25,901
well,

2324
01:33:25,901 --> 01:33:26,261
no,

2325
01:33:26,261 --> 01:33:30,280
you want it to be difficult and worthwhile
and you want to be the sort of person

2326
01:33:30,281 --> 01:33:33,250
that can manage that and
that's what you should be.

2327
01:33:33,460 --> 01:33:36,310
That's what you should be
encouraged to be at university.

2328
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:37,250
And,

2329
01:33:37,250 --> 01:33:39,820
and that's what the universities are for.

2330
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:41,043
So,

2331
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:44,160
well that's the archetipal
and the personal,

2332
01:33:44,200 --> 01:33:45,033
I would say.

2333
01:33:45,100 --> 01:33:45,933
Yeah.

2334
01:33:45,940 --> 01:33:46,773
Thank you very much.

2335
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:52,190
[inaudible]

2336
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:53,981
this will,

2337
01:33:53,981 --> 01:33:54,290
uh,

2338
01:33:54,290 --> 01:33:55,650
this will have to be our last question.

2339
01:33:55,651 --> 01:33:55,921
Go ahead,

2340
01:33:55,921 --> 01:33:56,754
sir.

2341
01:33:56,910 --> 01:33:58,620
In recent time,

2342
01:33:58,950 --> 01:33:59,460
uh,

2343
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:03,030
I would probably identify the most recent
us election is the turning point for

2344
01:34:03,031 --> 01:34:03,864
this.

2345
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:04,600
And that's,

2346
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:06,120
I've seen that as an American citizen,

2347
01:34:06,121 --> 01:34:07,590
this is my first time living in Canada.

2348
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:08,483
Um,

2349
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:13,680
I've noticed that public discourse has
taken to elevate fascism as the ultimate

2350
01:34:13,681 --> 01:34:15,690
evil and maybe rightfully so.

2351
01:34:15,691 --> 01:34:15,901
You know,

2352
01:34:15,901 --> 01:34:19,980
there were many horrific things commit
by fascist states in the 20th century and

2353
01:34:19,981 --> 01:34:20,671
you see people,

2354
01:34:20,671 --> 01:34:20,971
you know,

2355
01:34:20,971 --> 01:34:23,520
like Facebook cover
photos like bash the past,

2356
01:34:23,521 --> 01:34:23,821
you see,

2357
01:34:23,821 --> 01:34:25,200
you let stickers on laptops,

2358
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:26,850
this machine kills fascists.

2359
01:34:27,120 --> 01:34:27,631
It is,

2360
01:34:27,631 --> 01:34:27,841
you know,

2361
01:34:27,841 --> 01:34:31,770
there's this big backlash against
fascism and the horrors that it caused,

2362
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,510
but in spite of that,

2363
01:34:33,511 --> 01:34:38,511
you don't see the same reaction to the
horrors and the genocide that were caused

2364
01:34:38,521 --> 01:34:41,850
by socialist and Communist
states in the 20th century.

2365
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:43,593
Do not.

2366
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:53,530
You see people who virtue signal endlessly
about how horrible the Holocaust was,

2367
01:34:54,111 --> 01:34:55,850
about how awful these things were.

2368
01:34:55,910 --> 01:34:58,100
And then just hand away the famine,

2369
01:34:58,101 --> 01:34:59,270
genocide of the Ukraine,

2370
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,260
the great leap forward.

2371
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:05,261
They think these things
are inconsequential or even
necessary sacrifices for the

2372
01:35:05,841 --> 01:35:08,720
rise of the greater good
of socialism or communism.

2373
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:13,730
And I personally find that morally
reprehensible and I can't understand where

2374
01:35:13,731 --> 01:35:14,564
that,

2375
01:35:14,810 --> 01:35:15,710
where that comes in,

2376
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:19,460
how you can stand there and be
so opposed to this genocide.

2377
01:35:19,520 --> 01:35:22,880
What say that this
genocide is somehow just,

2378
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:23,121
oh,

2379
01:35:23,121 --> 01:35:24,080
it's not a problem.

2380
01:35:24,470 --> 01:35:25,640
And why do you think that?

2381
01:35:25,641 --> 01:35:27,500
How do you think that disconnect happens?

2382
01:35:27,501 --> 01:35:31,640
How do you think people can convince
themselves of that and why do you think

2383
01:35:31,641 --> 01:35:32,480
that happens?

2384
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:34,350
It's a great question.

2385
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:35,813
Um,

2386
01:35:36,240 --> 01:35:36,960
you know,

2387
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,351
I have,

2388
01:35:37,351 --> 01:35:38,730
my house is covered with,

2389
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:44,150
with art from the Soviet era and
I have a road of reasons for that.

2390
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:46,590
Part of it is to remind
me of what happened.

2391
01:35:46,591 --> 01:35:50,400
Part of it is to watch the struggle
between the art and the propaganda on the

2392
01:35:50,401 --> 01:35:52,020
canvasses sort of in real time.

2393
01:35:52,021 --> 01:35:52,261
You know,

2394
01:35:52,261 --> 01:35:53,370
I'm very interested in that,

2395
01:35:53,940 --> 01:35:57,840
but I would never decorate
my house with Nazi Regalia,

2396
01:35:58,380 --> 01:35:59,213
you know,

2397
01:35:59,390 --> 01:36:00,040
and,

2398
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:00,691
and you think,

2399
01:36:00,691 --> 01:36:00,811
well,

2400
01:36:00,811 --> 01:36:01,980
why is that exactly?

2401
01:36:01,981 --> 01:36:02,491
It's not like,

2402
01:36:02,491 --> 01:36:05,640
I don't know that that what happened
in the communist regimes was utterly

2403
01:36:05,641 --> 01:36:06,391
reprehensible.

2404
01:36:06,391 --> 01:36:06,930
Why is it,

2405
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:08,850
and perhaps it's not acceptable to have,

2406
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:09,211
you know,

2407
01:36:09,211 --> 01:36:11,220
socialist realist paintings in your house,

2408
01:36:11,280 --> 01:36:15,120
but it's certainly more acceptable or
it seems that way than to have paintings

2409
01:36:15,240 --> 01:36:16,290
from the Nazi era,

2410
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:17,153
let's say.

2411
01:36:17,370 --> 01:36:18,031
So then you think,

2412
01:36:18,031 --> 01:36:18,151
well,

2413
01:36:18,151 --> 01:36:19,380
why is that exactly?

2414
01:36:19,380 --> 01:36:20,213
And I think,

2415
01:36:21,540 --> 01:36:21,931
you know,

2416
01:36:21,931 --> 01:36:24,870
back in 1918 at the door
and the Russian revolution,

2417
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:28,770
when Europe was inflamed and in ruins
and the monarchical societies were

2418
01:36:28,771 --> 01:36:32,550
collapsing and the industrial revolution
was in full force and there were

2419
01:36:32,551 --> 01:36:33,060
terrible,

2420
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:35,430
there was terrible poverty
and terrible inequality.

2421
01:36:35,850 --> 01:36:39,480
The dream of Universal Brotherhood
was a compelling dream.

2422
01:36:39,660 --> 01:36:41,440
The dream of egalitarianism and,

2423
01:36:41,760 --> 01:36:42,410
and,

2424
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:42,960
and,

2425
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:43,770
and maybe,

2426
01:36:43,770 --> 01:36:47,640
maybe who knows how much of it was
motivated by genuine benevolence.

2427
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:49,380
Some Middle East.

2428
01:36:49,710 --> 01:36:51,840
It's very difficult to see that the Nazi,

2429
01:36:52,410 --> 01:36:56,610
the Nazi phenomenon was ever
generated by any genuine benevolence.

2430
01:36:56,640 --> 01:36:57,750
That's very difficult to,

2431
01:36:57,890 --> 01:36:58,860
to make a case for.

2432
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:00,360
Um,

2433
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:01,970
so maybe you can forgive the,

2434
01:37:02,210 --> 01:37:03,170
the socialists,

2435
01:37:03,210 --> 01:37:06,480
the communists utopians a hundred years
ago because they didn't know what they

2436
01:37:06,481 --> 01:37:07,314
were getting in for.

2437
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:08,280
People had warned them.

2438
01:37:08,281 --> 01:37:10,090
Dostoevsky warn the Nitro,

2439
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:10,550
warn them.

2440
01:37:10,550 --> 01:37:11,190
But,

2441
01:37:11,190 --> 01:37:12,023
but still,

2442
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,850
and then the other thing too
is the problem of inequality.

2443
01:37:15,420 --> 01:37:18,870
It's like the problem of inequality is
a real problem and it doesn't go away.

2444
01:37:18,871 --> 01:37:21,780
Like it's very difficult when you
walk down Bluer Street for example,

2445
01:37:21,781 --> 01:37:23,640
in Toronto and you see homeless people,

2446
01:37:23,641 --> 01:37:25,800
alcoholics and drug
addicts who are struggling.

2447
01:37:25,801 --> 01:37:29,220
And the mentally ill who are on the street
and they're in their little domain of

2448
01:37:29,221 --> 01:37:29,581
hell.

2449
01:37:29,581 --> 01:37:29,970
It's,

2450
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:33,120
it's really difficult for that to not
tear at your heart strings and say,

2451
01:37:33,121 --> 01:37:33,271
well,

2452
01:37:33,271 --> 01:37:35,790
isn't the world and unjust
place or an unfair place,

2453
01:37:35,791 --> 01:37:36,361
which it is.

2454
01:37:36,361 --> 01:37:41,361
And so you can see the never ending
wellsprings of motivation to support the

2455
01:37:42,301 --> 01:37:43,134
oppressed.

2456
01:37:43,410 --> 01:37:46,650
And I think the fact that the Communists,

2457
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:48,480
the communist dogma,

2458
01:37:48,481 --> 01:37:53,481
at least had that as part
of its initiating ethos is
partly what seems to make

2459
01:37:53,941 --> 01:37:54,900
it forgivable.

2460
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:55,980
I also think it's

2461
01:37:55,980 --> 01:38:00,000
easier for people to identify
why fascism is wrong.

2462
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:00,901
We can say,

2463
01:38:00,901 --> 01:38:01,530
look,

2464
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:02,910
racial superiority,

2465
01:38:03,360 --> 01:38:04,300
nope.

2466
01:38:04,710 --> 01:38:04,981
Okay.

2467
01:38:04,981 --> 01:38:05,820
It's pretty simple,

2468
01:38:05,821 --> 01:38:06,121
right?

2469
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:07,050
It's three words.

2470
01:38:07,051 --> 01:38:08,070
You can really get it,

2471
01:38:08,490 --> 01:38:09,323
but,

2472
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:13,313
but,

2473
01:38:13,380 --> 01:38:15,210
but equality of outcome,

2474
01:38:16,770 --> 01:38:18,330
it's like that's really wrong.

2475
01:38:18,540 --> 01:38:19,650
It's really wrong.

2476
01:38:19,830 --> 01:38:21,510
But it's not so obvious why,

2477
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,111
right?

2478
01:38:22,111 --> 01:38:22,530
It isn't,

2479
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:24,960
you can't just say equality of outcome,

2480
01:38:24,961 --> 01:38:28,830
know and have everyone clap
because it isn't as well.

2481
01:38:28,890 --> 01:38:29,701
And that's the thing.

2482
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:31,020
It's really difficult to,

2483
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:36,170
it's difficult to isolate the pathological
elements in radical left wing thought

2484
01:38:36,630 --> 01:38:38,970
because they're not self
evidently pathological.

2485
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:41,340
Like there's this old cliche,

2486
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:42,150
um,

2487
01:38:42,150 --> 01:38:42,661
from each,

2488
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:45,300
according to his ability to
each according to his need.

2489
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:45,930
It's like,

2490
01:38:45,930 --> 01:38:46,591
yeah,

2491
01:38:46,591 --> 01:38:47,640
that sounds pretty good.

2492
01:38:47,641 --> 01:38:48,421
We have needs.

2493
01:38:48,421 --> 01:38:49,110
It's like,

2494
01:38:49,110 --> 01:38:51,600
let's have them fulfilled
and well you have an ability,

2495
01:38:51,601 --> 01:38:53,130
well like manifested.

2496
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:54,270
It's like,

2497
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:58,710
well it doesn't work in practice in in
fact it's murderous in practice and it's

2498
01:38:58,711 --> 01:39:01,860
a great catastrophe in some sense
that it's murderous in practice.

2499
01:39:02,010 --> 01:39:03,990
So I just think it's maybe part of it is,

2500
01:39:03,991 --> 01:39:07,170
is just a hell of a lot harder
to learn why it's wrong.

2501
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:08,370
That combined with,

2502
01:39:08,371 --> 01:39:08,730
you know,

2503
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:13,680
the genuine outpouring of compassion for
the oppressed and [inaudible] which is

2504
01:39:14,130 --> 01:39:15,630
like who's for poverty?

2505
01:39:16,290 --> 01:39:16,861
No one.

2506
01:39:16,861 --> 01:39:17,111
Right.

2507
01:39:17,111 --> 01:39:17,281
And,

2508
01:39:17,281 --> 01:39:19,650
and inequality is a painful reality.

2509
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:21,240
It's painful for everyone.

2510
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:22,260
You know,

2511
01:39:22,260 --> 01:39:24,510
even people who are self
righteous about their,

2512
01:39:24,540 --> 01:39:25,321
their status,

2513
01:39:25,321 --> 01:39:25,990
let's say,

2514
01:39:25,990 --> 01:39:26,190
in,

2515
01:39:26,190 --> 01:39:27,720
in the depths of their soul.

2516
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:32,430
The struggling of the fact of the
struggling still rips at them.

2517
01:39:33,690 --> 01:39:34,620
And so

2518
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:38,120
it's a more difficult
lesson for us to learn.

2519
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:40,130
So yeah.

2520
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:46,360
[inaudible]

2521
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,120
do those people lined up at the mics?

2522
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:56,070
I sorry for leaving you hanging.

2523
01:39:56,880 --> 01:39:59,760
I'm sure we could go on all
night if we had the time.

2524
01:39:59,940 --> 01:40:00,540
Um,

2525
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:02,430
but we must call this to a close.

2526
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,290
I would like to

2527
01:40:04,940 --> 01:40:05,773
salute you

2528
01:40:06,810 --> 01:40:11,810
for your patients and your dedication
in the face of the noise from outside.

2529
01:40:12,961 --> 01:40:13,830
Very nicely done.

2530
01:40:14,070 --> 01:40:14,903
Hold on.

2531
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:19,920
[inaudible]

2532
01:40:22,550 --> 01:40:23,121
as you,

2533
01:40:23,121 --> 01:40:23,500
uh,

2534
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:25,250
as you no doubt are aware,

2535
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:28,550
Professor Peterson has written
an international best seller.

2536
01:40:28,551 --> 01:40:30,080
It's called 12 rules for life.

2537
01:40:30,081 --> 01:40:32,960
There are some presale in
the hall now before you go,

2538
01:40:33,770 --> 01:40:34,790
let me just say this,

2539
01:40:38,340 --> 01:40:43,340
you have participated in what I would
consider to be an important step in the

2540
01:40:44,131 --> 01:40:48,600
life of this university and
for that we should thank you.

2541
01:40:48,720 --> 01:40:50,910
So thank you for coming and
thank you for your support.

2542
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:53,280
[inaudible]

2543
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:03,680
professor Peterson,

2544
01:41:04,110 --> 01:41:04,400
uh,

2545
01:41:04,400 --> 01:41:06,660
maybe the most important intellectual,

2546
01:41:06,661 --> 01:41:10,760
a voice in this country today and I
would like to thank him very much for

2547
01:41:10,761 --> 01:41:11,530
coming.

2548
01:41:11,530 --> 01:41:16,530
[inaudible]

2549
01:41:35,970 --> 01:41:36,420
great night.

2550
01:41:36,420 --> 01:41:37,253
Be Safe.

2551
01:41:37,530 --> 01:41:38,070
I just have,

2552
01:41:38,070 --> 01:41:38,401
sorry,

2553
01:41:38,401 --> 01:41:39,900
I just have one small thing to say.

2554
01:41:40,020 --> 01:41:40,410
Hold on.

2555
01:41:40,410 --> 01:41:41,010
I would,

2556
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:45,930
I would very much like to stay and talk
with a bunch of you and I generally do

2557
01:41:45,931 --> 01:41:46,171
that,

2558
01:41:46,171 --> 01:41:50,220
but I can't do it today because I have
to go back to Toronto when I'm going to

2559
01:41:50,221 --> 01:41:51,270
Australia tomorrow.

2560
01:41:51,271 --> 01:41:52,380
So I don't,

2561
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:54,510
I can't do that even
though I would like to,

2562
01:41:54,511 --> 01:41:58,630
so I have to run off and then I
have to drive back to Toronto and,

2563
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,420
but despite that,

2564
01:42:00,450 --> 01:42:03,720
thank you very much for coming and
for being patient and all of that.

2565
01:42:04,150 --> 01:42:04,983
Yup.

2566
01:43:10,230 --> 01:43:11,063
Okay.

2567
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:17,893
Why is

2568
01:43:21,660 --> 01:43:22,493
it

2569
01:43:38,700 --> 01:43:39,533
great

2570
01:43:53,870 --> 01:43:55,610
shame on Queens?

2571
01:43:57,110 --> 01:43:58,910
No freedom for hate speech.

2572
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:00,650
He says he really,

2573
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:07,220
really chosen where I'm at with him.

2574
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:09,650
I've been looking at his voice that
we're looking at the protest points.

2575
01:44:09,670 --> 01:44:10,503
I'm not really sure.

2576
01:44:10,730 --> 01:44:11,300
Um,

2577
01:44:11,300 --> 01:44:13,880
I just think it's interesting that he's
drawing the sort of crowd and that,

2578
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:14,420
you know,

2579
01:44:14,420 --> 01:44:15,830
what's happening here is happening.

2580
01:44:15,831 --> 01:44:17,990
I think that really says something
about participation at Queens.

2581
01:44:18,590 --> 01:44:21,200
We're here to protest
a Jordan Peterson Dean.

2582
01:44:21,260 --> 01:44:23,230
You give him the platform
at Cuny University.

2583
01:44:23,730 --> 01:44:24,320
Um,

2584
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,153
Jordan Peterson,

2585
01:44:25,190 --> 01:44:27,320
aside from not knowing
what he's talking about,

2586
01:44:27,321 --> 01:44:28,040
these are a lot,

2587
01:44:28,040 --> 01:44:28,710
uh,

2588
01:44:28,710 --> 01:44:29,770
Pearson pension type.

2589
01:44:31,430 --> 01:44:34,670
It's not a discussion about which
topics do you like on pizza.

2590
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:37,620
It's a discussion about which
people should be considered funeral,

2591
01:44:37,880 --> 01:44:38,930
which you lose your respect.

2592
01:44:39,200 --> 01:44:41,060
And that's not a debate
that can happen anywhere.

2593
01:44:47,990 --> 01:44:49,040
I love that they are here.

2594
01:44:49,041 --> 01:44:49,551
How did this,

2595
01:44:49,551 --> 01:44:50,384
this course he does.

2596
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:52,760
They don't agree with what he
has to say so they're showing it.

2597
01:44:53,090 --> 01:44:53,690
But uh,

2598
01:44:53,690 --> 01:44:57,560
I have seen a lot of
people call to cancel.

2599
01:44:57,890 --> 01:45:01,340
They are showing the Daniel Walsh should
be ashamed of himself for allowing this

2600
01:45:01,341 --> 01:45:01,791
to happen.

2601
01:45:01,791 --> 01:45:03,500
And that I just think is wrong.

2602
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,010
I don't know if it seems like we have a
lot of very angry people in here because

2603
01:45:07,011 --> 01:45:11,210
someone's expressing an idea different
than their own and here at a university,

2604
01:45:11,211 --> 01:45:12,280
I kind of thought that was.

2605
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:22,241
Thank you.

2606
01:45:22,241 --> 01:45:24,940
Would you like one more Pepsi Cola?

2607
01:45:25,050 --> 01:45:25,630
I'm good.

2608
01:45:25,630 --> 01:45:26,370
Okay.

2609
01:45:26,370 --> 01:45:26,671
Same.

2610
01:45:26,671 --> 01:45:27,504
Those groups

2611
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,330
sell

2612
01:45:44,910 --> 01:45:45,743
fresh

2613
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:50,943
eggs.

2614
01:45:51,770 --> 01:45:53,210
It takes bravery to say of that.

2615
01:45:53,670 --> 01:45:54,770
It was only stuff to what guys?

2616
01:45:54,800 --> 01:45:55,633
Yeah,

2617
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:06,600
they broke the fucking window.

2618
01:46:06,601 --> 01:46:08,030
I'll run in there.

2619
01:46:08,220 --> 01:46:09,053
Jesus Christ.

2620
01:46:12,390 --> 01:46:12,960
Crazy,

2621
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:13,290
crazy.
