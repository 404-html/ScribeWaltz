1
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:12,783
It fills you with,

2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:18,070
see the scene when you look at the sun
and the moon is that which is beyond,

3
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:19,303
you

4
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:31,530
communicate with what's a small rise and
so you offer something to the absolute

5
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,510
and it get a sense of the quality
of your offering as a consequence of

6
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:38,803
[inaudible].

7
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:40,451
Like I said,

8
00:00:40,451 --> 00:00:42,830
it's an archaic idea you can run as child,

9
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,463
child,

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,313
child life.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,970
So you communicate with
you talking sacrifice.

12
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,440
Katie sacrifices his offerings.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,240
He will sacrifice his kids

14
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,980
then because we're taking
these three series,

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:00:59,520
okay,

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,353
what's going on?

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,750
Well here's what's going on and this is
how finding 12 rules for like as well.

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:06,700
It's all about 20 years to figure out.

19
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,010
What about this idea of sacrifice?

20
00:01:09,011 --> 00:01:10,300
What the Hell's behind that?

21
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:11,860
Cause it's a human universal right here.

22
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,450
I'm sacrificial bone tt.

23
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:13,871
Everyone.

24
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:14,704
We were,

25
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:16,660
well you can think,

26
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:17,410
you can think it through.

27
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,990
If you think about how people use
the word sacrifice in Monday morning,

28
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:23,291
who I teach,

29
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:26,650
my students have university
with Royal Children's,

30
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:27,790
first generation immigrants.

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,870
So they're,

32
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:29,081
you know,

33
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:34,081
their parents sacrificed the law in
order to give them an opportunity.

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,410
So what did they sacrifice?

35
00:01:35,411 --> 00:01:37,420
But they offer the sacrifice
to their home country.

36
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:41,320
Sometimes they sacrifice a prevention
because maybe they were doctors where they

37
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:41,711
came from.

38
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:43,150
The couldn't get licensed in Canada,

39
00:01:43,151 --> 00:01:45,490
so they ended up running
a convenience store,

40
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,780
laundry or something like that.

41
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:47,560
Working,

42
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,393
you know,

43
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,220
publishing house of their
kids have an opportunity.

44
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,830
So if you ask the kids,

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,480
well what did your parents sacrificing
that you could go to university?

46
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:56,920
It's like their hands are not going away.

47
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,150
I understand that language.

48
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,490
And then you can ask them too.

49
00:01:59,491 --> 00:01:59,571
Well,

50
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:01,900
what do you sacrifice for your grades?

51
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:02,500
Well,

52
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,350
I don't party every night
before go ratification.

53
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,930
So what does it mean?

54
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:12,550
I sacrificed something that though
you'd need to make the future better.

55
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:17,610
I'm acting out the proposition that I can
borrow phage by giving them something.

56
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,080
Now I can make something
better in the future.

57
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:24,000
Think that is an absolutely
overwhelming discovery.

58
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:29,290
That's what human beings discovered
is it's so strange because it works.

59
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:33,940
You can read if I'm putting through the
value in the present and it does pay off

60
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:34,774
in the future.

61
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,830
Now that's partly because
you're bargaining with
future people and they're not

62
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:42,460
going to encourage you that you can read
more about how the 12 rules for life if

63
00:02:42,461 --> 00:02:43,294
you want.

64
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,630
The point is that it wasn't archaic at
the ritual was Sikh people were acting up

65
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,910
something they didn't understand.

66
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,080
They've watched how people
that were successful were
successful and they watched

67
00:02:56,081 --> 00:03:00,850
people how people who weren't
successful one and they extract it out.

68
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,150
This idea that the people who were
successful were doing something that made

69
00:03:04,151 --> 00:03:07,150
them successful and it was like sacrifice.

70
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,350
And so they ritualizing sacrifices
have you understand what it was.

71
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,930
And eventually that became
a psychological concept,

72
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:14,380
which was,

73
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,640
well,

74
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,370
you can give,

75
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,203
you know,

76
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,760
you do have,

77
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,820
you have to renew yourself
and the new year's fest,

78
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:19,451
by the way,

79
00:03:19,451 --> 00:03:21,790
which is an unbelievably old idea,

80
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,900
you give up your pathological
past self and you make some,

81
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,560
um,

82
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,520
when you call goals resolution,

83
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,170
a real issue,

84
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,960
it's about how you can
be new in the future.

85
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,860
And that was a sacrificial act.

86
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,790
And it's based on a very
old ritual that has roots,

87
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,250
at least in Mesopotamia at least
5,000 years ago where the king handed.

88
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:47,590
I do that every new year so that he can
be a good king for the upcoming year,

89
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:49,630
which you can also read about that.

90
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,070
It maps.

91
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,400
Maybe you want to read about that.

92
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,773
Interesting.

93
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:53,230
Anyways,

94
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,290
the whole idea is that
this whole sacrifice thing,

95
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,180
this actually works and they're not.

96
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,670
That brings up a whole realm of Preston.

97
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,430
It's like,

98
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:00,551
well,

99
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,870
the sacrifices works.

100
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,900
What's the best possible sacrifice,

101
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:05,441
right?

102
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:09,760
Because that's obviously when you figured
out that at work you want to figure

103
00:04:09,761 --> 00:04:13,450
out what would optimize it and part of
that is you have to sacrifice that what

104
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:16,500
you love and that's part
of the active labor.

105
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,790
When Abraham is called on to sacrifice,

106
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,091
I say,

107
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:20,550
I can see versions of that idea.

108
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:23,830
Maybe what you love most as a person
you love the most and you think,

109
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:24,730
what does that mean?

110
00:04:24,731 --> 00:04:27,460
You said you offer your son up to God.

111
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,360
What you mean when you ask the
question because the answer,

112
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:32,290
that kind of stuff is actually yes.

113
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,861
In fact,

114
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:37,140
that's exactly what you do if you're an
ideal parent because you want your son

115
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,410
or your daughter to be as
good as they can possibly be,

116
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,180
let's say,

117
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,330
making the sacrifices that are necessary
in order to carry them through life.

118
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,070
So even though the idea again is part
Berrington are archaic and its ritual

119
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,670
form,

120
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,730
there's the siege in that
manner of incalculable.

121
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:55,510
Brilliant.

122
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,560
In any case,

123
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,120
God's happy with able to sacrifices and
he's not happy with Katie suffices and

124
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,910
there's reality and there's not
exactly what the swipe of the story,

125
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,060
it's kind of thing.

126
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,190
Not Exactly.

127
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,741
It's huge,

128
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:14,470
but it's big and that's good
because you know you don't look,

129
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,980
life is like you're doing
everything you can to sick yourself.

130
00:05:17,981 --> 00:05:18,250
Right?

131
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,220
I could put the world in order
around and it isn't working.

132
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,730
There's sacrifices are being rejected.

133
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,660
What's the consequences of that?

134
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,191
Well,

135
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,270
if you're not trying,

136
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,470
when you fail,

137
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,710
well it sucks because it's not very
exciting not to try and who the hell wants

138
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:36,101
to fail,

139
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,390
but at least you're not punish
you for your best efforts.

140
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,720
But if you made your sacrifices
and they're rejected,

141
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:49,050
then what's the right attitude towards
up volcanoes out is to get bigger.

142
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,970
He gets fitter because April is,

143
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,170
you're taking these sacrifices.

144
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:58,490
It works like mad now thrilled about Amy.

145
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,520
He's popular with forks increase,

146
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,000
everybody likes him worse.

147
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:04,760
He's the sort of guy who deserves it.

148
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:06,020
And that's super annoying,

149
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:06,291
right?

150
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:10,100
Because there's nothing more annoying
and coming to meet someone hyper

151
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:13,130
successful and then also
realizing that they deserve it.

152
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,790
You think that person would have to have
good graces to be contemptible so you

153
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:19,850
wouldn't have to be envious about the
fact that everything is going well for

154
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:20,360
them.

155
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,580
But often that doesn't work out.

156
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,210
So [inaudible] you raged by nick spice,

157
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,300
continual failure and he's outraged at
April because April's successes casting

158
00:06:32,331 --> 00:06:36,200
to stay there and even a more dim
light and he's burning about the,

159
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:36,870
um,

160
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:37,560
the justice,

161
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,950
the injustice in the world.

162
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:44,300
And so he decides to call out
God because how to get it,

163
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,530
why not chain?

164
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,790
And so he has the little chocolates
God and says something along the lines.

165
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,730
I've cried a lot of different
translations of this interchange.

166
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,950
Just good to what was at the bottom of it.

167
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,600
It's quite complicated,

168
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,190
but basically what happens is Katie
calls out God the creator of reality.

169
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,540
He says something like,

170
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,520
what the hell is up here?

171
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:10,610
I'm breaking myself in half
trying to have a half decent life.

172
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,340
Everything I do,

173
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,400
just it's turns to ash and then there's
my brother whose doesn't seem to be

174
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:23,690
making sacrifices or any
more heartfelt than me.

175
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:25,430
He's a spectacular success.

176
00:07:25,431 --> 00:07:26,000
It's like,

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,230
what the hell is going on?

178
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,230
Kinda crazy planet is this anyway,

179
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:32,980
so that you've created where this
sort of thing is so likely to happen,

180
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,640
but you know you might first of all
told to that the probability that you

181
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:42,770
thought that way in your life
from time to time is 100% in fact,

182
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,970
I suspect that there's a substantial
number of you in the room who think like

183
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:48,560
that almost all the time.

184
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,540
It's extraordinary tempting because
when things fall apart for you,

185
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,140
which they do from time to time,

186
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:54,680
it's like,

187
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:54,951
well,

188
00:07:54,951 --> 00:07:58,940
who doesn't want to go onsite and shake
his fist at the sky and rail against the

189
00:07:58,941 --> 00:08:00,740
horror of running fig?

190
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,071
Right?

191
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:04,850
The question arises like how can the
rule be constituted in such an unjust

192
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,770
manner and who's to blame?

193
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,251
You might say,

194
00:08:07,251 --> 00:08:07,401
well,

195
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,490
I don't believe in God,

196
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,340
it's him.

197
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,280
It's irrelevant.

198
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,540
It doesn't matter from the psychological
perspective it happens anyways.

199
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,280
You act it out anyways.

200
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,490
Also God listens but he's not,

201
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,180
you know,

202
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,830
taking responsibility because,

203
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:28,430
because he thinks it's king fall and so
this is what he tells cake essentially.

204
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:31,340
He says it's a very
interesting use of language.

205
00:08:31,341 --> 00:08:35,150
He says sin coaches since by the way,

206
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:39,290
that we're needs to draw your
Arrow back and to miss the target.

207
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,950
It's a very particular kind of word.

208
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:45,440
It needs to miss what you're in
rehab or perhaps not aiming at all.

209
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,430
So it applies that perhaps Ramey,

210
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:52,000
Amy wrong if you don't get the target
right and you specify the targets.

211
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,620
And that's an interesting
part of that as well.

212
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,320
So is it the case sin
crouches at your door?

213
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,400
Like that predatory sexually aroused cap,

214
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,970
you have been invited into your life,

215
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:11,420
you've opened the door to it and you
voluntarily had your way with it.

216
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,460
And it being that in a sexual manner,

217
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:17,100
sort of like the old idea that a vampire
can't come into your house on us,

218
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:18,210
you would find it in.

219
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:19,201
So first of all,

220
00:09:19,201 --> 00:09:20,400
he tells Kane,

221
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,470
don't be so sure that it's the structure
of reality that's at fault here.

222
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,850
Maybe it's something that you're either
doing or not doing and he accuses of

223
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,910
directing says not only
are you not giving it,

224
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,930
you're also doing it.

225
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,870
There's something there
that tiller king gets.

226
00:09:35,871 --> 00:09:36,041
No,

227
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:36,874
I'm good.

228
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,520
You've asked him to come in.

229
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,280
No way have you asked him to command.

230
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,350
You've made it with it in a creative
manner and you've given birth to something

231
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:48,690
horrible as a consequence
and have know it.

232
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,860
And so that's what happens
with the mess with God.

233
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,140
You find out things that
you don't want to find out.

234
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,280
And so painting was not very happy
when he started this discussion.

235
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,500
And when he's done with the discussion,

236
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,270
he's seriously not happy.

237
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:05,630
And the story says his countenance fail,

238
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,140
which means that he was
enraged by that answer.

239
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,290
And no wonder because he's got
the problem that he had before,

240
00:10:13,291 --> 00:10:15,270
which is that everything's
going to hell around him.

241
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,860
And his brother was a
thriving plus go on himself,

242
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,440
just told him that it's completely his
fault and that he knows he's doing it.

243
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:23,670
And then he chose to do it.

244
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,043
Well,

245
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,280
what's,

246
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:28,980
what are you going to do
in a situation like that?

247
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:29,820
Well,

248
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:31,110
you do what people do.

249
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,220
You take a rock and you
killed your brother,

250
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,013
right?

251
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,370
And that's what happens.

252
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,260
And that's,

253
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,090
and it's a horrifying story because
it's really the first story about the,

254
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,420
and it's a story of an annuity
and hatred and murder and worse,

255
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:54,470
because what happens then is Katie is
spared by God for complex reasons that we

256
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,614
won't get into.

257
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,770
And then he goes out and has a
family and he has his descendants.

258
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,620
And what is the sentence is tubal cave.

259
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,890
And [inaudible] is the first
person who makes weapons of war.

260
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,500
So there's this idea that the corruption
of the individual that was represented

261
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,760
by Kane is part of the process.

262
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,550
So there's more to that.

263
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:15,983
So if you,

264
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,513
if you,

265
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,450
it's so pain,

266
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:23,451
let's say kills you if you and so child
and [inaudible] child til seven of you

267
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:26,580
and if you insult Keynes,

268
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,480
Graham Charlatan,

269
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,680
he kills 49 to two.

270
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:33,910
So there's this idea that this corrupt
process that came part took him,

271
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,430
expands exponentially.

272
00:11:35,431 --> 00:11:37,620
I'll do to the community page.

273
00:11:37,621 --> 00:11:41,000
Potential descendant is to
locate who makes weapons war,

274
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:42,181
right?

275
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:47,181
So does this direct blind Henry story
between the Pauling vengeful nature of

276
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:53,331
cane and his jealousy and spite and
refusal to take responsibility for the of

277
00:11:53,501 --> 00:11:58,390
his actions and inactions murder and
genocide and it's all in like one

278
00:11:58,391 --> 00:11:59,224
paragraph.

279
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,820
It's absolutely overwhelming.

280
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,440
Back to the high school she would use,

281
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:08,950
they're just acting out
exactly the same old story.

282
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,610
It's the same thing over and over.

283
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,380
That's why these stories are typical.

284
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:18,220
It's why we can never forget them and
they always happen and hopefully we can

285
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:19,590
come to understanding.

286
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,710
I'm just going to have some possibility
of avoiding the worst of the

287
00:12:23,711 --> 00:12:24,580
catastrophes.

288
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,770
High school shooters,

289
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,690
people like to call them my kids.

290
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:33,460
They wrote down what they did know
as far as they were concerned.

291
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,130
They were rejected at least in part.

292
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:36,731
And you know,

293
00:12:36,731 --> 00:12:39,880
people make much of that same well the
poor kids who were bullied and that's

294
00:12:39,881 --> 00:12:40,870
what they do for vantage.

295
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,930
It's like first of all and
working stuff that kids,

296
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,160
second of all,

297
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:50,020
most people are voting and they don't
feel want to blog to high school and it

298
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:51,070
wasn't just that they call them.

299
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,740
My kids wanted to go in there and kill.

300
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:57,370
That was only a tiny fraction of what
they were planning in their fantasies.

301
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:59,230
They wanted to take out the whole city,

302
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,250
the entire city.

303
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,320
They have propane bones plans.

304
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,430
They wanted to make a media spectacle
it management quick attractively.

305
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,270
They wanted to produce as much mayhem
as they possibly could in the shortest

306
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:15,271
possible period of time and cap it off
their own suicide just to demonstrate how

307
00:13:15,491 --> 00:13:17,470
little they character the damn world.

308
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,710
And that's the motivation
behind that sort of thing.

309
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,080
It's a deep and dark motivation.
