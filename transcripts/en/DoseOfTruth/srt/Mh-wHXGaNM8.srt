1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,960
Supporting evidence for that kind of
thing.

2
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:10,810
From a,
from psycho linguistics,

3
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:13,500
there,
there is a level of,

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:18,730
of categorization that we seem to
manifest more or less automatically or

5
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:20,710
implicitly.
So for example,

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,920
when children perceive animals,
they,

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,100
they,
they perceive at the level of cat or

8
00:00:27,101 --> 00:00:28,300
dog.
They don't,

9
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,560
they don't perceive that the level of
subspecies like cat or,

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:33,753
or,
uh,

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,780
or,
or uh,

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,460
let's say Sam Lloyd,
you know,

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,660
there's,
there's this,

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,970
there's a natural,
I can't remember what they call that

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,470
base category,
something like that.

16
00:00:41,471 --> 00:00:44,590
It's usually specified by very short
words that are easily learnable.

17
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:47,620
And so the linguistic system seems to
map right onto the,

18
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,930
to the object recognition
characteristics of the sensory systems

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:54,770
that are built right into it.
And,

20
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:57,760
and if they weren't built into it,
we couldn't communicate easily because

21
00:00:57,761 --> 00:00:59,500
our natural categories,
I think that's it,

22
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,960
but it's probably wrong or natural
categories.

23
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,860
They have to be the same for everyone or
it would be very difficult for us to

24
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:07,180
communicate.
Okay.

25
00:01:07,181 --> 00:01:09,970
So having said all that,
then the question is,

26
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:11,920
well,
what are the most,

27
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,190
what are the most real categories?
And I think there's,

28
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:20,920
there's a real division in ways to think
about this because there's a scientific

29
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:22,670
way of thinking about it.
And,

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,320
and in that case,
the most real categories are,

31
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:31,160
well mathematical equations certainly
seem to be in the top category there,

32
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,120
the equations that describe the physical
universe,

33
00:01:34,121 --> 00:01:38,890
but then then the,
the hypothesis of the existence of such

34
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:42,340
things as protons and electrons and you
know,

35
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:42,880
the,
the,

36
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,130
the,
the material elements that make up

37
00:01:45,131 --> 00:01:48,670
everything,
that's every element of being with the

38
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,160
possible exception of empty space.
Um,

39
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:55,090
but in the,
in the mythological world,

40
00:01:55,091 --> 00:02:00,091
the categories I think are more derived
from Darwinian by the effect of

41
00:02:01,301 --> 00:02:04,270
Darwinian processes on cognitive and
perceptual function.

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,550
So which is to say that we have learned
to perceive and then to infer those

43
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:13,240
things that are most necessary for us in
order to continue our existence,

44
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,700
propagate live well.
All of those things.

45
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:18,580
And that would be true at the level of
individual survival.

46
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:20,620
And maybe it's also true at the level of
group survival.

47
00:02:20,621 --> 00:02:21,940
Although you know,
the,

48
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:25,480
there's a tremendous debate among
evolutionary biologists about whether or

49
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:28,180
not selection can take place.
At the level of the group

50
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:32,650
anyways,
there are these basic level categories

51
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:36,070
that manifest themselves to you and then
there's categories of the imagination

52
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:39,310
that you have to infer up from the
sensory domain,

53
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:44,311
and we do that partly in science by
comparing our sensory representations

54
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:47,260
across people,
but we also do it by thinking

55
00:02:47,261 --> 00:02:50,590
abstractly,
conceptualizing abstractly and no.

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,200
One of the things that's interesting
about abstractions,

57
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:56,260
it's not clear whether they're more or
less real than the things they're

58
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:58,120
obstructed from,
you know,

59
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,930
this is a perennial among,
let's call them ontologists,

60
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,460
who were interested in the fundamental,
fundamental nature of reality itself.

61
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,610
In some sense,
independent of conceptual structures.

62
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,610
Our numbers more or less real than the
things they represent.

63
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,330
It's a really hard question to answer
because knowing like using numbers as a

64
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,230
representational system gives you
unbelievable power and there are

65
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:25,780
mathematicians that believed that there
isn't anything more real than

66
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:27,400
mathematical representations.
Now.

67
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:30,580
It depends to some degree of course on
how you classify reality.

68
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,730
That's the problem with a question like
is a a equivalent to be.

69
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,570
The answer to that always is.
Well,

70
00:03:37,571 --> 00:03:40,390
it depends on how you define a and it
depends on how you define be,

71
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:42,730
so generally it's not a very useful
question,

72
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:46,330
but you can still get the point that
there's something very real about

73
00:03:46,331 --> 00:03:49,840
abstractions,
incredibly real because otherwise why

74
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,060
would you bother with them?
They wouldn't give you any handle on the

75
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:53,560
world.
So what's the,

76
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,500
what's the most useful or what's the
most,

77
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:01,860
what's the broadest possible level of
abstraction and is there any use of any

78
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:03,820
utility in thinking in that manner.

79
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,820
And I tried to make the case last time
that that in the mythological world

80
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,680
there are three categories or four
depending on what you do with the

81
00:04:12,681 --> 00:04:15,850
strange fourth category,
because the fourth category is sort of

82
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,970
the category of uncategorizable entities
and so it's sort of the category of

83
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:23,440
everything that not only do you not
know,

84
00:04:23,441 --> 00:04:24,980
but you don't know,
you don't know what it's.

85
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,800
It's.
Or you can think about it as the

86
00:04:26,801 --> 00:04:29,920
category of potential.
I actually think that's the best way to

87
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:34,480
think about it is that it's the dragon
of chaos is the category of potential.

88
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:38,890
And I do believe that we're,
our materialist view is essentially

89
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:41,020
wrong.
I think that the proper way of looking

90
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:45,730
at the at being is that being his
potential and from that potential,

91
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:49,780
whatever consciousness is,
extracts out the reality that we inhabit

92
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,940
anyways.
That's certainly the mythological

93
00:04:51,941 --> 00:04:52,500
viewpoint.

94
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,440
And,
and,

95
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,450
but it's not just a mythological
viewpoint,

96
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,310
it's,
it's a,

97
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:58,870
it's a sequence of ideas,
for example,

98
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:02,950
that deeply underlies the thinking of
John Piaget and Piaget by the way.

99
00:05:02,951 --> 00:05:06,640
It was very interested in reconciling
the gap between religion and science.

100
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:08,610
That's really what he devoted his life
to doing.

101
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,570
And so,
and there are other streams of

102
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:14,140
philosophy and I would say heidegger,
that's phenomenologists are,

103
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:17,920
are thinking along the lines that are
similar to this as well because

104
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:20,620
heidegger was concerned not with the
nature of material reality,

105
00:05:20,621 --> 00:05:23,470
but with being as such and,
and,

106
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,510
and so you can extract out the viewpoint
that I just described from,

107
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,290
from mythology.
But it isn't the only source of such a,

108
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,840
what would you call it?
A high

109
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,730
hypotheses is probably the right idea.
So,

110
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:42,010
so the idea,
you can think about this as a

111
00:05:42,011 --> 00:05:46,120
bootstrapping process in some senses,
in order for anything to get going,

112
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,410
it has to bootstrap itself up and become
more and more complex as it does that.

113
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:52,480
So it's,
it's like this is the answer to the

114
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,130
chicken and egg problem,
right?

115
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,260
Which was first the chicken or the egg.
Well,

116
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:58,550
neither.
Something from which both the chicken

117
00:05:58,551 --> 00:05:59,780
and egg were derived,
right?

118
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:00,920
Because the,
the ultimate,

119
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,250
the ultimate answer to that is the
answer to how there are things at all,

120
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,590
who knows?
But at some point there were neither

121
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,900
chickens nor eggs,
but there were the things that were the

122
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:13,901
precursors to those things and so they
spiraled upwards in some sense.

123
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:18,770
And those in the initial protocol
entities,

124
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:22,490
single celled animals for me,
need to go back farther than that.

125
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:23,211
But we could say,
well,

126
00:06:23,211 --> 00:06:26,060
single cell animals differentiated over
time.

127
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,820
Right?
And there's this looping process that,

128
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,690
that differentiates out into both the
chicken and the egg.

129
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,240
So,
but what the question is,

130
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:37,490
what do you need in order for that
process to begin?

131
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:41,570
And that's really the question of what
the fundamental constituent elements of

132
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:44,810
reality are,
and the mythological hypothesis is that

133
00:06:44,811 --> 00:06:48,620
there's three or four.
One is the fact that there has to be

134
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:50,240
something that,
that,

135
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,210
that,
that manifests itself as an observer.

136
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,140
It's something like that,
some kind of observer now where that

137
00:06:57,141 --> 00:07:00,950
process of observation starts in the
phylogenetic chain is very,

138
00:07:00,951 --> 00:07:03,300
very difficult to tell you.
No,

139
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,041
we might say,
well,

140
00:07:04,041 --> 00:07:07,460
there's certainly no possibility of a
conscious observer until there's a

141
00:07:07,461 --> 00:07:08,360
differentiated nervous.
