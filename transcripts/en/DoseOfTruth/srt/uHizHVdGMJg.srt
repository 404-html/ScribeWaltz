1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,860
And so not only do you need the value
structure so that you don't just

2
00:00:09,861 --> 00:00:12,710
deteriorate and die.
You need the value structure so that

3
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:16,250
when the flood comes in your life as it
certainly will,

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:21,430
that you have built a vessel that will
sustain you through the catastrophe and

5
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:26,360
that's not this pursuit of happiness.
It's not even the pursuit of security.

6
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:31,370
It's none of that.
It's the orientation that you've managed

7
00:00:31,371 --> 00:00:35,690
to produce in your own life towards a
higher good that's so high that it's

8
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:38,930
worth bearing the burden of being to
produce.

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,800
You implement that in the world.
You produce a hierarchy.

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,930
Now you might say,
well,

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,890
and then you have the problem of
hierarchy in the problem of hierarchy is

12
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,270
a very few people are going to be very
good at whatever that hierarchy does and

13
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,490
then you have the second problem with
hierarchy,

14
00:00:55,491 --> 00:00:59,570
which is the problem I just laid out
when I asked you about your spectacular

15
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:02,960
levels of attainment and found out that
they were very,

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,850
it was very unlikely.

17
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,460
I'm not saying that you haven't detained
worthwhile things.

18
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,440
That's not my point.
My point is,

19
00:01:09,441 --> 00:01:13,220
is that very high levels of attainment
are extraordinarily rare.

20
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,850
And that's an inevitability.
As soon as you decide that something's

21
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:21,620
worth doing to inevitabilities,
people stack up at the top minority of

22
00:01:21,621 --> 00:01:24,740
people stack up at the top and take most
of the proceeds,

23
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,620
whatever they happen to be or deserve
them or earn them,

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:28,701
whatever.
However,

25
00:01:28,701 --> 00:01:32,540
I don't care how you conceptualize it
and almost everybody else stacks up at

26
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:35,960
the bottom.
And so the problem with hierarchies is

27
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:39,350
that even though they're necessary,
they tend to produce a situation where

28
00:01:39,351 --> 00:01:43,640
most people stack up at the bottom.
And so that's the next thing that we

29
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,610
have to contend with.
You can't get rid of the hierarchies

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,350
because if you get rid of the
hierarchies,

31
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:50,960
there's no value structure.
And if there's no value structure,

32
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:55,280
not only do you deteriorate and die,
you want to deteriorate and die,

33
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,740
and that's not a good solution.

34
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,520
But if you do generate a hierarchy,
then you have the problem of the

35
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,610
hierarchy.
And the problem is the hierarchy is that

36
00:02:04,611 --> 00:02:09,290
it will dispossess most people now to
the degree that the postmodernists have

37
00:02:09,291 --> 00:02:12,980
something to say,
that's what they say is hierarchies.

38
00:02:12,981 --> 00:02:16,970
Dispossess okay.
And then we can look at that clearly and

39
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:21,110
carefully.
And we can say that doesn't mean a,

40
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,670
that hierarchies themselves are corrupt
or that we can dispense with them.

41
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,500
But it also doesn't mean that we have no
moral obligation to the dispossessed.

42
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,761
And we say,
well,

43
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:35,480
how do we deal with that politically,
conceptually.

44
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,370
And the way we deal with that,
at least in part,

45
00:02:37,371 --> 00:02:41,990
is to produce a political spectrum that
ranges from left to right that deals

46
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:45,500
with hierarchy and the problems that
hierarchies because so one of the things

47
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:50,501
that you can reliably assume about
someone who's on the right is that they

48
00:02:50,991 --> 00:02:55,991
will be patriotically in favor of the
current hierarchy or even more

49
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:59,180
abstractly,
they're in favor.

50
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,710
The idea of hierarchy itself.
And you say,

51
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,390
well,
more power to the people on the right

52
00:03:04,391 --> 00:03:08,860
because you need hierarchies.
So they should support them.

53
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:11,170
But then you have to take the people on
the left who say,

54
00:03:11,171 --> 00:03:13,390
yeah,
but what about the people who are

55
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:16,690
dispossessed by the hierarchy?
And what you have to say to them is,

56
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,630
yeah,
we actually have to do something about

57
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:20,800
that.
And you think,

58
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,390
well,
how did we do something about that?

59
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:27,391
And the answer is we don't actually know
because there's no permanent solution to

60
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,310
the problem of dispossession by the
hierarchy.

61
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,090
We don't know how to fix it.
You say,

62
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:35,440
well,
we could flatten the hierarchies.

63
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,290
It's like not without disrupting the
value structure.

64
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,440
That's a price you don't want to pay.
Well,

65
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,600
we could take from the top and put it at
the bottom.

66
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,780
It's like,
yes,

67
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,180
hypothetically we could.

68
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:52,180
But it turns out that when you try that
in practice,

69
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:56,050
it's very,
very easy to rapidly go too far.

70
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,370
And then what you end up with not is
less dispossessed.

71
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,730
You end up with no one who has anything.
And that's not a good solution to the

72
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:09,250
problem of scarcity,
right?

73
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,870
To make everyone equally dead or equally
starving,

74
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:18,220
which is essentially what the communists
states did across the entirety of the

75
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:23,221
20th century is not the proper way to
address the problem of hierarchy.

76
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:27,400
Now it has to be addressed even if
you're on the right because here's one

77
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:30,910
thing that happens.
Hierarchies tend to Ossify,

78
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,250
you know,
because what happens is that the people

79
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:35,500
at the top,
maybe they got there by merit,

80
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:39,580
but it's easy for them to Gerrymander
the system so they can stay there

81
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:42,730
without merit.
Or perhaps their children can stay there

82
00:04:42,731 --> 00:04:47,140
without merit or they can,
or the hierarchy becomes corrupt so that

83
00:04:47,141 --> 00:04:50,080
people who only use tyranny and power
can climate,

84
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,380
and so you don't have a hierarchy of
competence and value anymore.

85
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,890
You have a hierarchy of brute power,
which looks like a tyranny,

86
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,520
and so there's all sorts of ways that
hierarchies can deteriorate and we have

87
00:05:00,521 --> 00:05:03,370
to be awake to ensure that that doesn't
occur.

88
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:07,930
Also,
if the hierarchy gets so steep that

89
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:10,810
everybody stacks up at zero and no one
can climb it,

90
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,980
which is basically the definition of a
malfunctioning tyranny than all the

91
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,740
people at the bottom rightly think,
well,

92
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:21,730
why don't we just destroyed the game
because we're already at zero?

93
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,630
So what the hell do we have to lose?
And so one of the things that you want

94
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,620
to do if you're a sensible conservative,
is make sure that the hierarchy

95
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,480
maintains its rooting in competence,
that it's transparent and that it's

96
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:38,260
climate bowl.
Because otherwise it will also Phi and

97
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:43,261
steepen and then it will destroy itself.
And if you're a conservative and you

98
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:47,560
value stability and the hierarchy,
then you don't want to set up a

99
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:51,520
situation where the most likely outcome
is that the hierarchy destroys itself.

100
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,940
So,
so we can be intelligent about this.

101
00:05:54,941 --> 00:05:55,780
We could say,
look,

102
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,780
don't be thinking can get rid of
hierarchies they've been around.

103
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:02,390
This is why I wrote chapter one I talked
about lobsters.

104
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:08,230
The reason I talked about them is
because not only is the hierarchical

105
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:12,260
structure itself as a permanent feature
of existence,

106
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:17,410
at least a third of a billion years old,
which by the way means that you cannot

107
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:22,520
attribute it to capitalism,
the free market or the corrupt

108
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:25,670
patriarchal west,
unless you're willing to make the case

109
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:29,690
that all three of those elements
contributed to the existence of

110
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:33,980
dominance hierarchies among crustaceans,
which seems highly unlikely.

111
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:34,970
So,
and,

112
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,900
and this is actually something that's,
that you can think about it as an idea

113
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:42,410
that's actually directed towards the
productive left.

114
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,100
If you want to help the dispossessed,
don't blame the existence of hierarchies

115
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:51,380
on capitalism because it's wrong.

116
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,160
It's wrong that the problem is way
deeper than that.

117
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:58,070
And here's something else that's very
interesting about capitalism.

118
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,220
Couple of things you might consider,
you know,

119
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:05,300
we have become spectacularly wealthy
since 1895 right?

120
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:08,690
First in the West Icelands at classic
example.

121
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,870
I mean you guys are so much more wealthy
than you were a hundred years ago that

122
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:15,860
it's absolutely impossible to believe.
And so that's first happened in the west

123
00:07:15,861 --> 00:07:20,030
to exponential economic growth starting
in about 1895 there's a long tail.

124
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,650
I mean,
people were improving before that,

125
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:25,730
but it really kicked in around 1895 and
first happened in the west and now it's

126
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:28,250
happening everywhere in the world.
I don't know if you know this,

127
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:30,050
but you know,
um,

128
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,240
the UN set a goal in 2000 to have the
level of absolute poverty in the world

129
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:40,241
by 2015 which is the fastest rate of
economic growth ever recorded.

130
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:45,020
We attained it in 2012,
three years ahead of the most optimistic

131
00:07:45,021 --> 00:07:45,854
projections.

132
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,350
Right?
And so people are being lifted out of

133
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:52,700
poverty at a rate that has never been
seen in the history of the world hooked

134
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:56,840
to the power grids provided with cell
phones provided with free,

135
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,370
with access to fresh water provided with
access to medications that decrease

136
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:04,490
child mortality.
Like if you look at the statistics,

137
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,910
there are so many things getting better
so fast you cannot even believe it.

138
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,090
And that's,
and here's that's a consequences as far

139
00:08:11,091 --> 00:08:14,090
as,
as far as the data indicate of the

140
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:17,930
operation of the free market system,
which does produce inequality.

141
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,750
That's the thing.
But as far as I can tell,

142
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:25,751
the only system that has ever produced
wealth and as law or has every system

143
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:30,710
produces inequality,
but the only system we know of that

144
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,610
produces,
produces wealth and inequality is the

145
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:38,210
free market.
So here's a question for everyone left

146
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:38,750
and right.

147
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,290
How many units of inequality will you
tolerate to produce one unit of wealth?

148
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:47,570
And if the answer is zero,
then you've gone too far.

149
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,110
You're outside the appropriate political
debate.

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,620
That's the wrong answer.
And if you try to impose all there will

151
00:08:55,621 --> 00:09:00,621
be as mayhem because the price we pay
for wealth is inequality.

152
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,600
Now that doesn't mean that you can let
inequality run to its ultimate extreme

153
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,340
because then you run into the other
problem,

154
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,950
which is the monopoly problem.
You've all played monopoly.

155
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,590
I presume what happens in every monopoly
game,

156
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:18,270
if you lay it out,
everyone's stacks out at zero,

157
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,750
zero except one person.
Now if you play it 50 times,

158
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:25,050
you'll find that it's hardly ever the
same person because it's basically a

159
00:09:25,051 --> 00:09:27,540
game of chance and there's a fair bit of
chance,

160
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,520
by the way,
operating in the distribution of money

161
00:09:29,521 --> 00:09:30,150
in the world.

162
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,310
It's not all chance,
but there's a fair bit of chance.

163
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,180
But the logical conclusion to a
hierarchy that can play itself out

164
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:39,420
totally is that one person has
everything and everyone else has

165
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,660
nothing.
Obviously that's not a useful outcome.

166
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,380
So,
so you know,

167
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,570
the way there are ways that we fix that
in our society,

168
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,070
we have progressive tax policies and you
can argue about their utility,

169
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:57,060
but that's one way of rectifying it
potentially.

170
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:01,170
Another way of rectifying is that we
don't have one game right?

171
00:10:01,171 --> 00:10:03,330
In a pluralistic society,
we have many,

172
00:10:03,331 --> 00:10:06,750
many games that people can play.
And so if you can't be a successful

173
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:08,820
lawyer,
then maybe you could be a successful

174
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:10,380
plumber.
And if you can't be a successful

175
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:12,450
plumber,
maybe you can run this small restaurant

176
00:10:12,451 --> 00:10:14,430
or you know,
there's a diversity of games.

177
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:18,060
And so that's a good way of,
of allowing,

178
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,640
of,
of increasing the robustness of the

179
00:10:20,641 --> 00:10:24,070
system so that you don't get hierarchies
that are so steep that they collapse in

180
00:10:24,071 --> 00:10:24,480
and,
um,

181
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,450
in an,
in an,

182
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,640
in upon themselves.

183
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,120
And so those are sophisticated
approaches and perhaps your other

184
00:10:30,121 --> 00:10:32,280
approach is to,
but it's an intractable problem.

185
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,160
It says in the New Testament,
it's one of the things you'd swear would

186
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:37,860
be edited out because it's such a harsh
statement.

187
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,190
The poor will be with us always.
Well,

188
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:44,010
what's that in reference to?
It's also in reference to the Matthew

189
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,380
principle,
which is another new testament statement

190
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:51,500
and happens to be an economic axiom to
those who have everything more will be

191
00:10:51,631 --> 00:10:54,990
given from those who have nothing.
Everything will be taken.

192
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:59,190
That's the structure of the world and
you can't lay it at the feet of the

193
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:02,070
West.
It's the structure of the world now.

194
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:05,370
That means we have to contend with it.
And it's not an easy thing to contend

195
00:11:05,371 --> 00:11:07,020
with.
And part of the reason that we have a

196
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:11,430
continual political dialogue and that we
need to have a continual political

197
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:14,370
dialogue,
is to make sure that our hierarchies

198
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,810
exist and remain intact,
but don't become so steep and corrupt

199
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,140
that they destroy themselves.
And you need a left and a right for

200
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:24,080
that.
And if and,

201
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,350
but that means the left half has to
admit that hierarchies are not only

202
00:11:28,351 --> 00:11:32,460
necessary but valuable.
And the right has to admit that despite

203
00:11:32,461 --> 00:11:35,790
their necessity in value,
they tend to stack people up at the

204
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,890
bottom.
And that actually constitutes a

205
00:11:37,891 --> 00:11:38,850
continual problem.
