1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:03,770
You really can't tell the meaning
of someone's life till the very end.

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:05,030
It's for the same reason,

3
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:05,241
right?

4
00:00:05,241 --> 00:00:06,074
Is that

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,390
how all the pieces fit together in the
story or in the life is not necessarily

6
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:13,070
determined until the final moment.

7
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:14,630
And I think that's part of the reason too.

8
00:00:14,631 --> 00:00:16,490
Why among Catholics,

9
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:17,170
for example,

10
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:18,920
in Christians in general,

11
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:22,250
there's an idea that salvation
can always be attained,

12
00:00:22,251 --> 00:00:22,461
right?

13
00:00:22,461 --> 00:00:23,540
Right up til the last moment,

14
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,280
no matter what your life
was like and you think,

15
00:00:25,281 --> 00:00:26,600
well that's a pretty cheap trick.

16
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,690
You don't because you can run around and
doing terrible things their whole life.

17
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:31,700
But as long as you get it
together the last second,

18
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,570
then you're Scott free.

19
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:34,790
But if you think about
it in terms of a story,

20
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:38,510
then you can understand how that
could conceivably be the case.

21
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,370
And it's for this reason,

22
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:40,791
of course,

23
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:44,690
that this lecture in particular makes me
nervous more than any of the other ones

24
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:48,650
I do because I've been telling you a
story that's basically 40 hours long,

25
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:48,890
right?

26
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,060
And it's spoken for them.

27
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:55,061
And then who knows how long and
it's written for him and it's,

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
it's complicated to pull
it together properly.

29
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:00,620
And that's partly because as
far as I've been concerned,

30
00:01:00,621 --> 00:01:04,850
we've been talking about
issues in psychology that
are more difficult than any

31
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:05,630
other,

32
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,111
first of all,

33
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:06,950
conceptually,

34
00:01:06,951 --> 00:01:09,020
even from a neuropsychological
perspective,

35
00:01:09,021 --> 00:01:12,650
because I've been offering you a model
of the way the brain processes the

36
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:15,230
environment that I think
is really novel and,

37
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:18,350
and I think it reflects the
current state of neuroscience.

38
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,570
But more than that,

39
00:01:20,571 --> 00:01:23,750
there's the problem that we've been
dealing with issues all the way along of

40
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:28,610
life and death and of war and destruction
and of the possibility for all

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,110
clearheaded optimism,

42
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,411
right?

43
00:01:30,411 --> 00:01:30,750
Uh,

44
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:31,640
a possibility,

45
00:01:31,641 --> 00:01:33,500
which as we've discussed,

46
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,040
more or less escape toll stories
say for most of his life,

47
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:37,251
right?

48
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:40,340
Because when Tolstoy woke
up from his delusions,

49
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:41,900
he looked at the world and he said,

50
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:42,680
well,

51
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,680
clearly it's such a terrible place that
as if you're not looking at it through

52
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:49,430
the veils of illusion,

53
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:53,450
there was no way that you can do
anything but stand in opposition to it.

54
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:55,550
Once you understand its basic structure,

55
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:55,821
right?

56
00:01:55,821 --> 00:02:00,821
Suffering and innocent suffering and
complete vulnerability and the whole

57
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,560
existential mass that makes up life.

58
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,480
How it turns out that Tolstoy overcame his

59
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,000
okay,

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,810
rationally induced cynicism
and it kind of mystical way.

61
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:20,830
He had a dream that he was suspended
from some transcendent space by a belt

62
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:21,940
around the middle of his waist,

63
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,430
which hung them over a pit of chaos.

64
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:28,210
And in that image he found
comfort and fair enough,

65
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,290
it's a powerful image,

66
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,150
but it's not well delineated,

67
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:31,810
right?

68
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,290
And it worked well for Tolstoy and
you can see that the image has power,

69
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:36,124
but you can't,

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,680
you can't grab it with your rational mind.

71
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:41,500
You can't take it into pieces
and analyze it as an argument.

72
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:44,470
And that's what we do
if we're intellectuals,

73
00:02:44,471 --> 00:02:44,651
right?

74
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:48,850
We try to understand the
detailed structure of something.

75
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,420
And I think the detailed structure of
what Tolstoy apprehended as optimistic is

76
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:56,590
actually comprehensible.

77
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:01,650
And we've been working that and circling
around the entire course of this

78
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,750
lecture series.

79
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:09,490
But I found with this material that
with each circling around the target,

80
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,440
it gets clearer and clearer.

81
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,191
It's a funny thing.

82
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:16,690
It's like you're looking at something
that's too complicated to see all at once.

83
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,930
So you have to look at it from multiple
different perspectives and again and

84
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:20,231
again.

85
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,340
And each time you look at it,

86
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,210
it becomes clearer and clearer.

87
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,720
That still the case for me when
I go through this material,

88
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:26,680
every time I go through it,

89
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:26,981
I think,

90
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:27,311
oh yeah,

91
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:29,350
that piece fits there and
that piece fits there.

92
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:31,540
And that's how that makes sense.

93
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:32,141
And Oh,

94
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:35,110
that's a lot more remarkable than I
thought it was to begin with and so on.

95
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:38,170
And it seems fundamentally in exhaustible
and of course that's what you'd expect

96
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,070
from deep,

97
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:39,970
deep stories,

98
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:40,570
right?

99
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,840
Stories that have been around
for thousands and thousands
of years wouldn't have

100
00:03:43,841 --> 00:03:48,190
been around for thousands and thousands
of years unless they were in some sense

101
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:49,120
inexhaustible.

102
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,420
And we've talked about some of the
processes that might contribute to that in

103
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:53,470
exhaust stability.

104
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,400
So at the beginning of the lecture series,

105
00:03:57,401 --> 00:04:01,750
I told you to consider the assumption
that there was more than one way of

106
00:04:01,751 --> 00:04:02,710
looking at the world,

107
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:03,580
right?

108
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,990
There was the standard materialists
sort of scientific viewpoint,

109
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,830
which was that the world was made up of
objects independently existent us among

110
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,664
them,

111
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:17,940
the objects have no intrinsic value one
way or another and the issue of meaning

112
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:22,120
per se wasn't included in that account.

113
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,721
And then I said,

114
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,201
well wait,

115
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,780
there's another way of looking at the
world that we spent just as much time

116
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:28,330
developing that we utilize even more.

117
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:29,530
And that's a narrative.

118
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:34,720
That's the narrative way of looking
at the world to consider the nature of

119
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:39,721
experience rather than the
nature of objects as real
to consider your experience

120
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:40,601
as real,

121
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,680
even though it includes things that
can't be easily and tangibly identified.

122
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,940
Things like emotions,

123
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:49,810
which of course you find compelling
sometimes even beyond your will.

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,910
Things like motivational states,

125
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,170
fantasies,

126
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:54,130
ideals,

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,750
all the things that compel your behavior
and give you some sense that there's a

128
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:03,550
direction to life and people who study
emotion and perception have come to

129
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:08,551
understand that the act of transforming
the world into something simply made out

130
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:11,230
of objects is incredibly difficult.

131
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,620
It's so difficult that we haven't been
able to design machines that can do it at

132
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:15,400
all.

133
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,290
It turns out also that
when we look at the world,

134
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,540
we're not just looking at
it with our visual systems,

135
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,170
but we're looking at it with our motor
output systems and our emotions so that

136
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,640
when you look at something like a
chair which just stands there for you,

137
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:28,540
like an object,

138
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,870
it turns out that the mechanical systems,

139
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:36,370
the motor systems that you would use to
use the chair to sit on it are activated

140
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:37,660
during the act of perception.

141
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,060
It also turns out sometimes
that when you look at something,

142
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:43,150
especially if it's something you've done
to understand and that it's and that

143
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:43,984
scares you,

144
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,470
you actually react to it,

145
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,000
conceptualize it with your body and with
your emotions before you have any idea

146
00:05:52,001 --> 00:05:54,100
what it is from the
perspective of an object.

147
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,440
When you look at the world and when you
think about the world you have do it

148
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,490
from a motivation,

149
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,870
a motivated perspective,

150
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:02,090
and an emotionally ridden perspective.

151
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,160
You can't even see the world without
being gripped by your motivation and

152
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,130
emotional states.

153
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:12,131
And so the idea that rationality or
perception is somehow separate from or,

154
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,630
or super ordinate to,

155
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,453
um,

156
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,950
perception and emotion is just wrong.

157
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:22,910
We understand now that you can't
even think without being motivated.

158
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:24,890
You can't see the world
without being motivated.

159
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:28,550
And that means you always look at the
world through a kind of Lens and the Lens

160
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:32,240
is a narrowing lands and it has to be
because the world is so complicated,

161
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:33,470
you can't see it all at once.

162
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,060
You're only seeing tiny slices of it
in time and tiny slices of it in space.

163
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,460
And,

164
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,500
and even then you have to narrow it to
only those things that are relevant to

165
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:43,400
you at that moment.

166
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,320
And we don't know exactly how you do that.

167
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:50,470
We know that it takes years and years of
perceptual work in infancy say so that

168
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:55,280
you managed to build up an
object conception of the world.

169
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,640
That's probably all you're doing in
the first two or three years of life.

170
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,900
And you're doing it constantly and it's
just as complicated as learning language

171
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:04,400
say are even more complicated.

172
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:08,000
Most of it's invisible and we
don't know how children do that.

173
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,260
And by the time they can talk,

174
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:10,041
they've already done it.

175
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,680
So they can't even tell
us what they're doing.

176
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,290
It takes a long time to
build up an object world.

177
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,300
And when you look at the world,

178
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:19,220
when you go from point a to point B,

179
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:22,520
even when you're doing something as
simple as looking for food and in the

180
00:07:22,521 --> 00:07:27,521
kitchen you ignore everything about
the world that isn't relevant to making

181
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:29,060
yourself a peanut butter sandwich.

182
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:32,090
And you focus in on those few
things that are the refrigerator,

183
00:07:32,091 --> 00:07:33,050
the food,

184
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:33,531
the knives,

185
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,640
the cutlery and so on.

186
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:39,560
And everything else is screened out and
you can't help but look at the world

187
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,510
through that kind of lance
and the Lens is change.

188
00:07:42,511 --> 00:07:46,370
And you can be in different motivational
states and they can change because of

189
00:07:46,371 --> 00:07:47,660
internal transformations.

190
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:48,800
You're not hungry,

191
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,300
you're thirsty or you're not thirsty.

192
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:53,360
You're interested in someone or
somebody who's telling you a story.

193
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:57,440
And then you adopt their motivational
framework and you can see the world

194
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,071
through their eyes.

195
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:00,030
And now we know what the
neural machinery for that,

196
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:03,740
and we already talked about that
so we can toss back and forth these

197
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:04,760
motivational rains,

198
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:08,420
it frames of reference and that gives
us insight into someone else's world.

199
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:13,280
You can look at the world endless numbers
of ways and what you're trying to do

200
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:16,310
is out of its infinite richness,

201
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,420
so to speak,

202
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,200
is to pull out parts of it that are
useful for you while you're moving from

203
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,250
point a to point B.

204
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,980
And this can be a chair
if you want to sit down,

205
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:26,830
but if you want to take the
light bulb out of the ceiling,

206
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,030
then it's then it's a stool or a table.

207
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:33,950
And whether or not it's a chair or a
stool or a table depends just as much on

208
00:08:33,951 --> 00:08:37,250
what you're doing as
it does on what it is.
