1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:07,250
We also have

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,170
discount by the way,

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,750
my partners and I decided to,

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,163
mmm.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,920
Encourage everybody to

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,720
make a,

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:24,750
their new year's resolutions in a
sophisticated and comprehensive way.

8
00:00:24,751 --> 00:00:26,400
And so we have this program.

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:31,401
Some of you have heard
about this@selfauthoring.com
called future authoring.

10
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,990
And the future authoring program helps
you write out a vision for the future to

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,430
think through what you'd like your life
to be like if you were taking care of

12
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:42,510
yourself properly,

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:47,070
to consider your friends and your family
and your career and your education and

14
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:51,660
your use of time outside of work and
your ability to resist temptation,

15
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,350
the kind of temptation that
might drag you down and,

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,213
uh,

17
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,890
and how you might take care of
yourself mentally and physically.

18
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:02,410
And to write about that and
then to write a counter,

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,530
uh,

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,041
story,

21
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:07,250
which was where you might be three to
five years down the road if you let all

22
00:01:07,251 --> 00:01:11,450
your bad habits get out of control
and then to write a strategic plan.

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,280
It's a very useful program.

24
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:16,040
We've used it with lots of
university students in particular,

25
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:16,820
although it's for,

26
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,350
for adults of all ages.

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:19,640
Um,

28
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,640
and if you're a university student
and you complete the program,

29
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:27,290
it seems to increase the probability that
you'll stay in university by about 25%

30
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:28,220
something like that.

31
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,210
Um,

32
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,100
it seems particularly useful by the way,

33
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:31,701
for men,

34
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:34,400
for reasons that we
don't exactly understand,

35
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:39,080
maybe because they're underperforming
women academically and it also improves

36
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:39,891
people's grades.

37
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:44,090
But there's a large literature in the
industrial organizational area also

38
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:47,300
indicating that if you're like,

39
00:01:47,301 --> 00:01:51,890
if you're working and you make
a personal plan of this sort,

40
00:01:51,891 --> 00:01:56,690
then your overall productivity
increases by about 10% which is a lot.

41
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:57,950
And you're,

42
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,650
you're more likely to be
physically and mentally healthy.

43
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,890
And so I would really
recommend trying this.

44
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:05,600
Even you can try the program,

45
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:07,220
you don't have to do a perfect job at it.

46
00:02:07,221 --> 00:02:10,610
It doesn't really matter because it
turned to set out a bit of a vision and a

47
00:02:10,611 --> 00:02:11,570
plan for your life.

48
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:15,920
And you need that because
you need direction and you
need purpose and you need

49
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,790
the constraints of a vision to help
you be less anxious and uncertain.

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,751
And,

51
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:21,830
and you,

52
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:26,831
you have that anxiety and uncertainty
reduction does occur if you have a decent

53
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:28,910
map of where it is that you're headed.

54
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,270
The coupon code is n y 2019 New Year's
2019 and why 2019 and if you go to the

55
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:41,960
self authoring site and
click on the products menu,

56
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,250
uh,

57
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,083
item

58
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:47,380
and go to a future author and you could
just enter in that coupon code and it's

59
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:48,340
50% off.

60
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:51,550
So I think the total
price is $7 and 45 cents,

61
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:54,130
which is actually pretty damn cheap.

62
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,430
If what it does is help
structure your future.

63
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:59,110
And I really do think this is a helpful,

64
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,590
we've worked on it a lot and tested a
lot and it's based on solid behavioral

65
00:03:04,661 --> 00:03:06,040
psychological principles,

66
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:06,874
Lli with,

67
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,620
I would say a certain degree of,

68
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,100
of optimistic philosophy and um,

69
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,413
it's,

70
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:14,643
well,

71
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,950
it's a good thing to do

72
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,460
and um,

73
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:21,970
this is a good time to do it.

74
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,930
So if you're interested,

75
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,870
all that information will be in the
description of the video as well.
