1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,340
Plays a circuit.

2
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:12,630
So there's a guy named Jaak,

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:12,630
Panksepp,

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:12,631
Panksepp,

5
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:12,931
p,

6
00:00:12,931 --> 00:00:13,081
a,

7
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:13,261
n,

8
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:13,591
k,

9
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:13,861
s,

10
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:14,011
e,

11
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:14,221
p.

12
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:14,521
P,

13
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:19,521
who I would roundly recommend that
you read if you're interested in in

14
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,240
behavioral neuroscience.

15
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,260
I think he's a genius.

16
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:24,870
He's sort of on par with
gray as far as I'm concerned.

17
00:00:24,871 --> 00:00:26,870
And on par with Swanson and peg,

18
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,880
except I believe discovered
the play circuit in mammals.

19
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,211
And so,

20
00:00:30,211 --> 00:00:30,480
you know,

21
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,590
two thumbs up for him.

22
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,431
That's a big deal.

23
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:36,270
That's kind of like discovering
a continent from the
psychological perspective.

24
00:00:36,271 --> 00:00:37,350
And it's a search,

25
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,660
it's a circuit that
separate from exploration,

26
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,290
which is kind of interesting cause you
think about play as a form of exploratory

27
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,124
behavior,

28
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,110
but it's sufficiently different from,

29
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,400
from standard exploratory behavior that
it has a circuit that's devoted to it.

30
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:52,770
And there's a lot of primary circuits,

31
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,430
you know,

32
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,560
and they're networked in
with the rest of the brain.

33
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,420
And obviously circuit is a,

34
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:57,871
you know,

35
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:58,704
a metaphor.

36
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,500
So I could say there's a lot
of primary subpersonalities,

37
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,320
they're like one eyed monster.

38
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,880
There's only one thing thereafter,

39
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:06,450
you know,

40
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,530
and there's a whole bunch of them.

41
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:09,510
And so roughly speaking,

42
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,670
they regulate the things I already
mentioned that the hypothalamus regulates

43
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,200
defensive aggression,

44
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,730
sexual behavior,

45
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,211
temperature,

46
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,080
regulation,

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,580
food and water intake,

48
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,840
excretion,

49
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,520
while then there's one for breathing,

50
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,350
then there's another for pain,

51
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,360
then there's another for anxiety.

52
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,653
Um,

53
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,770
and there's another for
exploration and there's others.

54
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,020
There's sensory modules as well.

55
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,351
You know,

56
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:37,800
there's a visual circuit and an auditory
circuit and the olfactory circuit and

57
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:40,200
the circuit that's devoted to taste and,

58
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:45,201
and there's a circuit that keeps track
of how your body is localized in space.

59
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,830
That's a parietal circuit.

60
00:01:46,831 --> 00:01:48,030
And um,

61
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,040
what else is important?

62
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:50,671
Oh yeah.

63
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:55,671
There's a circuit that you can use to
abstractly model perceptual structures and

64
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,920
patterns of behavior before you
implement them in the world.

65
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,310
And that seems to be a higher
cortical function fundamentally.

66
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:05,490
And you'd associate that with the
contents of your consciousness.

67
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,140
There's a language circuit,

68
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,593
um,

69
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:08,830
though.

70
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,211
Oh yeah.

71
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:12,180
There's an empathy circuit that
mediates maternal behavior.

72
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,390
There's a hunting circuit that
mediates predatory behavior.

73
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,920
There's a circuit to check dominance
and subordinate subordination.

74
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,573
MMM.

75
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,010
There's a circuit that mediates
creativity and human beings.

76
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:32,160
There's a circuit that
mediates social activity.

77
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:32,460
So,

78
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:32,601
and,

79
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:33,271
and the,

80
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:35,820
the positive reinforcing
nature of social activity.

81
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:39,690
And that's quite tightly expo x
associated with the exploratory circuit.

82
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,960
Um,

83
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,663
let's see.

84
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,271
Well that's,

85
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:44,511
you know,

86
00:02:44,511 --> 00:02:45,920
that's not too bad for the beginning.

87
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:47,720
I'm sure I've missed some
and I'll remember them.

88
00:02:47,721 --> 00:02:48,310
But,

89
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:51,890
and each of those subsystems is
important enough so that there's a neuro

90
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:53,330
architecture devoted to it.

91
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:58,580
Now some of those neural architectures
are flexible enough so that if they don't

92
00:02:58,581 --> 00:02:59,950
develop one brain area,

93
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,060
they'll develop an another.

94
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:01,610
So it's,

95
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,040
it's not exactly as if the location
of these functions is specifically

96
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:09,130
determined in advance before development.

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,990
So for example,

98
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,120
if you have a baby and it has,

99
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:13,421
you know,

100
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,490
epilepsy and the epilepsy is really bad,

101
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:18,190
sometimes they'll take out the
whole left or right hemisphere.

102
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,270
And if they do that early enough doesn't
really seem to have much consequence

103
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:23,104
for the baby,

104
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,441
you know,

105
00:03:23,441 --> 00:03:24,340
which is pretty weird.

106
00:03:24,341 --> 00:03:24,671
You think?

107
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:24,851
Well,

108
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:26,920
half the brain that problem fairly useful.

109
00:03:26,921 --> 00:03:31,921
But in some sense it's as if the cortical
elements of the brain are territory

110
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,180
that can be inhabited in colonized
by the lower levels of the brain.

111
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:41,440
And so you could say that the
lower levels of the brain,

112
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:43,090
including the visual input systems,

113
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:45,140
would just as soon call a nice,

114
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,960
what we call the visual cortex.

115
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,900
But if there's no visual cortex
because it's being removed,

116
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,810
then they'll just go call tonight
as part of the auditory cortex.

117
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,351
You know,

118
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:57,840
and what you see in other situations
sometimes is that people have high,

119
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,080
high hydrocephaly.

120
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:02,680
And what that means is that their
cerebral spinal fluid builds up in their

121
00:04:02,681 --> 00:04:03,514
brain.

122
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,890
And so the ventricles get very enlarged.

123
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:09,700
And so if you take an x ray or
an MRI or other sort of scan,

124
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:10,301
if these people,

125
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:15,301
you'll find that their entire skull is
full of water except for like a half inch

126
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,420
thin slice of cortical
tissue around the water,

127
00:04:19,421 --> 00:04:20,201
like a balloon.

128
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,930
And one of the guys who was like that,

129
00:04:21,931 --> 00:04:24,100
they had a phd in
mathematics from Cambridge,

130
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:24,881
you know,

131
00:04:24,881 --> 00:04:27,370
5% of his brain tissue is intact.

132
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:27,671
Now,

133
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:32,530
it was pretty active that 5% and you
could also be sure that it would not have

134
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:34,720
been very resilient to damage.
