1
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:07,860
I would like to move on to,

2
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:08,521
if you have time,

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:09,440
I would like to move on to

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,720
question about religion because
I'm really interested in,

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:16,183
uh,

6
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:17,380
in myths and religion.

7
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:18,214
And

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,130
one thing that's,

9
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:24,351
I mean,

10
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:24,511
if,

11
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:27,470
if you call something a
myth then it's probably not,

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,200
well,

13
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:31,560
it's not a not alive anymore perhaps.

14
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:31,891
I mean,

15
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:33,480
if you're actually calling it the myth,

16
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,710
if you really believe in it,

17
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:36,750
you're not believing that it is a myth.

18
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,230
And so where we are now,

19
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,601
we've,

20
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:40,680
we've been studying the,

21
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:41,701
uh,

22
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,580
the Bible like scientifically and,

23
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,080
and so we'd be construct,

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,510
my first subject in university was
religious studies and then you deconstruct

25
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:55,730
the Bible and you learn about [inaudible]
when everything was written and

26
00:00:55,731 --> 00:00:56,091
everything.

27
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,160
But what would you do right now?

28
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,783
You sort of,

29
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,230
you making the Bible
in your Bible lectures,

30
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,300
you making it accessible for
people that of our our age or our,

31
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,920
uh,

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,753
uh,

33
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:12,890
yeah.

34
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,410
And uh,

35
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,190
and people who would,

36
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,110
I don't think would match,

37
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:20,390
you wouldn't have naturally turned
to the Bible for counseling.

38
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,153
You,

39
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:22,890
I think

40
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:24,050
cured completely.

41
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:28,700
It's just an indication of how surreal
the current circumstances really are.

42
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:33,320
I've been selling out the theater that
I booked in Toronto for these biblical

43
00:01:33,321 --> 00:01:34,810
lectures and it's all full of,

44
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,120
it's almost all young man.

45
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,730
I can not that young,

46
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:37,941
you know,

47
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:40,040
they're between say 18 and 30,

48
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:40,791
something like that.

49
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:41,240
Although they're,

50
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:41,511
you know,

51
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:43,430
there's women in there and
there's older people too,

52
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:44,690
but that's the main audience.

53
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:45,524
And it's like,

54
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,580
well that's crazy.

55
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:46,791
Right?

56
00:01:46,791 --> 00:01:48,500
That's impossible that that's happening.

57
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,580
But it's an attempt to
revive a Phi the myth.

58
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:53,893
Yeah.

59
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,850
So what's your,

60
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,770
what's your take take on why?

61
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,680
Why is uh,

62
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,980
I asked,

63
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:03,550
uh,

64
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,570
we should dork is this,

65
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:05,381
when I interviewed him,

66
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:10,381
like there are people there were worried
about the postmodern challenge to

67
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:11,211
everything.

68
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:12,044
Like,

69
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,440
like deconstructing everything.

70
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,990
And so you look for something from in,

71
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:16,470
in,

72
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,160
in your,

73
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,993
in your life.

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,990
And what I see you doing,

75
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,630
and I would like you
to your thoughts on it,

76
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:24,100
is that you are bringing some,

77
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,830
like a firm you're trying to bring
in sort of a firmer foothold.

78
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,003
Yes,

79
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,551
exactly.

80
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:35,260
That it's like I'm journeying to the
bottom of the ocean to rescue the father

81
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:35,830
from the,

82
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,630
from the fire breathing whale.

83
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:37,900
Like,

84
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:38,740
that's exactly it.

85
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,090
It's like the thing is,

86
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:42,640
is that when everything shakes,

87
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,070
then you look for the foundation.

88
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:45,940
Right?

89
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:46,240
Right.

90
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,150
And to me,

91
00:02:47,151 --> 00:02:48,080
the foundation,

92
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:48,830
the,

93
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:51,980
the thing the West got right is
the divinity of the individual.

94
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,393
Right.

95
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,760
It's true.

96
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,830
And it's the myth idea.

97
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:01,810
This is partly where I had a
discussion with Sam Harris.

98
00:03:01,811 --> 00:03:02,021
You know,

99
00:03:02,021 --> 00:03:03,550
that was quite a difficult discussion,

100
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:04,900
um,

101
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,950
to discussions.

102
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,740
I wasn't in the best of
physical health when I had them,

103
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,431
unfortunately,

104
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,360
but that's life.

105
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,270
But you talk when you talk about myth,

106
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,591
you know,

107
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,880
it sounds like untruth,

108
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,180
but I think about it
sort of as Metta truth.

109
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,130
It's truer than true in some sense because
it consists of abstractions that have

110
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:27,130
guided human behavior
properly for forever.

111
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,980
In so far as human beings
have been successful.

112
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,433
Um,

113
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,180
and even in so far as we define success,

114
00:03:34,181 --> 00:03:36,490
it's embedded within
these mythological ideas,

115
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:40,840
which are ideas that we act out
essentially not ideas that we hold or,

116
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,660
or believe or state their
ideas that we act out.

117
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:49,060
And the idea of the divine individual
is at the center of our law,

118
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:49,631
which is why,

119
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:50,231
for example,

120
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:51,910
even if you're accused of murder,

121
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,870
even if there's overwhelming
evidence against you,

122
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,790
you still have value that the
state cannot nearly trample on.

123
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,380
And that's,

124
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:02,891
well,

125
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:03,311
first of all,

126
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:04,210
it's unbelievable.

127
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,710
That's the case because you know,

128
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,280
the typical barbaric society,

129
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:09,731
let's say,

130
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:12,130
which is what we're trying
to reproduce very rapidly,

131
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:15,220
is the one that assumes that
if you're accused of something,

132
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:18,280
we might as well just shoot you on
the off chance that you're guilty.

133
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,450
That's a way easier to,

134
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
to adopt that as a principal.

135
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:22,810
And it,

136
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:26,170
and it's certainly satiates the Ma,

137
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,320
the blood lust of the mob
much more effectively.

138
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:35,060
The idea that we could have constructed
a worldview that put the pathetic week

139
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:36,450
malevolent,

140
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,680
insufficient,

141
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:41,850
vulnerable individual at the center
of the value structure is just,

142
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:46,620
it's an accomplishment who's grandier
cannot possibly be overstated.

143
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,600
And we,

144
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,390
we are the beneficiaries of that system.

145
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,320
We live within its protective confo
confines and we're doing everything we

146
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:59,830
possibly can to destroy
it as rapidly as possible.

147
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,293
So,

148
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,843
so you,

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,153
uh,

150
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,260
which it was a one of my
idols growing up and uh,

151
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,470
I read the hero with a thousand faces,

152
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,221
isn't too,

153
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:15,940
is a power of myth lectures.

154
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,570
Uh,

155
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,140
because uh,

156
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,681
I mean as,

157
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,520
as a lot of young men,

158
00:05:18,521 --> 00:05:22,380
I loved Star Wars and the Lord of
the rings and then you sort of,

159
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,340
you read his work and you find out that,

160
00:05:24,341 --> 00:05:24,671
okay,

161
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:29,390
so your [inaudible] he based his
storyline or he changed his storyline,

162
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:32,720
fit more into the hero where the,

163
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,080
the monomyth and be the
hero's journey story.

164
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,750
And he said that you need,

165
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:44,870
you need sort of a living
myth or theology to be,

166
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,860
to have psychological
health and spiritual health.

167
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:54,460
You need to live with enough
sort of a living mythology.

168
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,060
Yes,

169
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:55,721
absolutely.

170
00:05:55,721 --> 00:05:55,931
Yeah.

171
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:58,640
Big while the methodology
tells you who you really are.

172
00:05:59,100 --> 00:05:59,600
Yeah.

173
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,081
Like you know,

174
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:00,650
you,

175
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,080
you really are a divine son of God.

176
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,640
I mean people,

177
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,473
people,

178
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,130
people and and you know,

179
00:06:07,131 --> 00:06:10,130
you actually know that because you
feel guilty about not living up to your

180
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:10,964
potential.

181
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,460
Why in the world would
you possibly feel that?

182
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,820
But everyone feels that if
they have any sense at all,

183
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:18,890
unless they're narcissistic
or psychopathic,

184
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:23,920
everyone feels that burden
of the perfection to which
they have to perfection to

185
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,480
which they have not yet
aspired Nora attained.

186
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,980
And so,

187
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,570
and that's a testament to the,

188
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,200
to the overwhelming potential that
characterizes each individual.

189
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,590
And that's really what I'm trying to
point out in the biblical lectures.

190
00:06:36,591 --> 00:06:41,270
There's these continual stories about
the nature of humanity and the nature of

191
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,870
proper being in the face of the
tragedy and malevolence of life.

192
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,380
And the Bible is Western,

193
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,300
the Western world's attempt to,

194
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,060
to,

195
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,050
to formulate that as a,

196
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,320
as a comprehensible set of stories and
also a set of principles for behavior.

197
00:07:00,341 --> 00:07:01,110
It's,

198
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:03,020
it's the collective struggle of our,

199
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,200
of our imagination stretched
across tens of thousands of years,

200
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:10,310
maybe hundreds of thousands of years,

201
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,660
maybe even more than that.

202
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:12,290
You know,

203
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,310
cause some of these stories,

204
00:07:13,311 --> 00:07:13,890
the Snore,

205
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,670
the story of confronting
the malevolence serpent,

206
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,190
like I believe that in
one form or another,

207
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,840
that story is if you also consider it as
something that could be acted out that

208
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:26,660
stories at least 60 million years old.

209
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,670
So because Lynn is veiled,

210
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,680
this anthropologist at
Ucla has demonstrated quite
nicely that are tree dwelling

211
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,660
relatives coevolved with snakes,

212
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:43,250
and our continual battle with snakes
and predatory reptiles was part of what

213
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:44,630
gave us our acute vision.

214
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,530
Cool.

215
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:48,583
Yeah.

216
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:49,930
You know.
