1
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,480
Opens up a whole can a very,
very interesting issues.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,270
This try and pick a couple of them,
but the [inaudible] hard to,

3
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:10,210
it's evident to me,
and I'm enormously encouraged by this

4
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:10,691
because I,
you know,

5
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:14,260
I'm a passionate Australia and I'd want
this country to be the sort of place

6
00:00:14,261 --> 00:00:17,410
that offers opportunities of the sort
that I had when I was young.

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:19,960
You know,
I've had my opportunities when I look at

8
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:22,960
my kids' generation,
what's going to be there for them if we

9
00:00:22,961 --> 00:00:27,961
keep feeding them the sort of thin grew
in reality,

10
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:32,850
the people turning out in vast numbers.
Every one of your talks in Australia's

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,040
been oversubscribed massively.
It tells you they kind of get those more

12
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:40,600
to this.
They're being tall.

13
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:40,820
Oh

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,050
yeah.
They know well.

15
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,330
It's one of the things that's so
interesting about dealing with

16
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:47,030
archetipal themes.
You know archetipal themes are

17
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:51,350
archetipal because they actually speak
of the structure of human experience.

18
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,790
That's why they last.
And so it's human nature and human

19
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:59,540
experience has a pattern.
You don't have the capacity to do

20
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:03,230
articulate that pattern as an individual
in part because your life is too short.

21
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:06,020
You just can't figure it out.
But the,

22
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,040
the ancient representations of those
patterns are everywhere around you and

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,821
you,
you know,

24
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:11,950
some of them in the image,
you,

25
00:01:11,951 --> 00:01:14,330
you caught onto them automatically,
you,

26
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,500
you,
you fall into them.

27
00:01:15,501 --> 00:01:16,880
If you go to a movie,
for example,

28
00:01:16,881 --> 00:01:18,980
because movies always expressed
archetipal themes.

29
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,010
If you hear them articulate it,
you think,

30
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,060
I,
I knew that.

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,160
I knew that.
I just didn't know how to say it.

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:27,220
That's,
that's the platonic idea of,

33
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,323
of,
uh,

34
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,590
of,
of learning as remembering your,

35
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:33,890
your soul already knows,
but it doesn't have the words.

36
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,900
And so when people talk to me about
watching my lectures,

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,410
let's say they say,
they basically say one of two things.

38
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,540
If it,
if it's not just a simple thank you.

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,360
They say one of two things.
A third of them say,

40
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,900
quarter of them say,
when I listen to you talk,

41
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,750
it's as if you're telling me things that
I already know.

42
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:54,891
It's like,
yeah,

43
00:01:54,891 --> 00:01:58,100
well that's exactly right because that's
what archetipal stories are there.

44
00:01:58,101 --> 00:01:59,870
The description of what you already
know,

45
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,970
but that can be articulated.
And then who you are and how you see

46
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:08,630
yourself and the way you described
yourself all become the same thing.

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,270
So that's wonderful.
Then you're not at odds with yourself,

48
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,380
you know,
and then you have,

49
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,320
then you're a functioning unity and that
makes you much stronger and more

50
00:02:15,321 --> 00:02:18,530
indomitable than you would otherwise be.
And then the other thing that people

51
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:20,210
say,
and this is more like three quarters of

52
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,190
them,
is that they say,

53
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,050
I was in a very dark place.

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,280
I was addicted,
I was,

55
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,700
I was drinking too much.
I had a fragmented relationship with my

56
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:31,040
fiance and I wasn't getting married.
Uh,

57
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,990
things weren't going very well with my
family.

58
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:35,030
My relationship with my father was
damaged.

59
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,880
I didn't have any AME.
I was wasting my time.

60
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,700
Some variant of that,
some combination of those.

61
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,260
And they say,
well,

62
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:47,330
I've been watching your lectures.
I've decided to establish a purpose.

63
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:51,110
I'm trying to tell the truth and things
are way better.

64
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,380
And I've,
and so let's say I've done maybe eight

65
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,170
or nine large scale public talks in the
last two months.

66
00:02:57,171 --> 00:03:02,171
So that's probably 20,000 and about half
of them a third to half of the misstate

67
00:03:02,231 --> 00:03:05,260
afterwards to talk to me.
So that's about 7,000 people who have

68
00:03:05,261 --> 00:03:07,750
said that to me.
And then people stop me on the street

69
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,910
all the time.
And tell me exactly that story,

70
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:11,140
which is just wonderful.

71
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:15,010
Like you can't imagine how good it is to
be able to go to places you've never

72
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:17,140
been.
And to have people start peeling the

73
00:03:17,141 --> 00:03:19,600
streets spontaneously and say,
look,

74
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,150
my life is way better than it was.
It's like,

75
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,610
it's so good.
And so,

76
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,990
and I've got like,
I dunno,

77
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:29,050
35,000 letters from people since last
August.

78
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,790
It's more than that.
I can't keep track of them.

79
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:34,240
And it's exactly the same thing,
like three quarter quarter of them say,

80
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,160
well,
you've given me the words to say what I

81
00:03:36,161 --> 00:03:38,470
already knew was true.
And thank you for that.

82
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,620
I can see that in the audience.
It's so interesting because I can lay

83
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:44,020
out a story.
People go like this and say they're

84
00:03:44,021 --> 00:03:46,360
doing that all the time.
It's like the lights are going on.

85
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:48,150
And that's a really,
while there's no,

86
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:51,250
almost nothing better than that to watch
lights go on when you're talking to

87
00:03:51,251 --> 00:03:53,290
people,
it's like that's just absolutely

88
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,340
fantastic.

89
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,940
But to get this response from people,
my father,

90
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,650
I haven't,
my father is about 80,

91
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:02,140
80 is 83,
I think.

92
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,660
[inaudible] 81,
he's 81.

93
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:07,100
And uh,
I put it in charge of,

94
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,610
of going through my viewer email,
um,

95
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:14,020
which is an overwhelming job.
But now we've had discussions about this

96
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:16,720
constantly.
He's overwhelmed by the fact that so

97
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,790
many people are writing and saying the
same thing.

98
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:19,624
It's like,
well,

99
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,990
I have a purpose in my life actually
matters.

100
00:04:22,991 --> 00:04:26,620
I finally realized that and I'm putting
it into practice and I'm bearing up

101
00:04:26,621 --> 00:04:29,860
under the heaviest load I can imagine.
And it's really helping.

102
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:32,890
It's like God,
and that's tens of thousands of

103
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,950
responses now.
So it's,

104
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:39,160
it's,
you couldn't hope for anything better

105
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,650
than that.
There's zero harm in it,

106
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,240
right?
It's just people putting their lives

107
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,310
together,
they're not mucking about with other

108
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:49,240
people and are trying to make broad
scale social transformations about which

109
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,110
they have no idea.

110
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:54,730
They're trying to make their immediate
environment better and it's working.

111
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,920
It's like great,
great.

112
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,880
You say the zero harm in it,
say as a former legislator that there's

113
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:03,440
an enormous amount of good at a country
is only the,

114
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:07,110
some title of the people that make it up
to the extent that they put together

115
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,980
resilient.
I only contribute,

116
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,160
don't have to ask others to help them.
The stronger the nation and rapidly like

117
00:05:16,841 --> 00:05:19,150
I,
I mean I think I was thinking the other

118
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,340
day some a journalist asked me why the
audience,

119
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:24,010
why people are responding so positively
to what I'm saying,

120
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:25,630
the young men for example,
and I thought,

121
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,621
hmm,
why?

122
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:27,071
Why?
Yeah,

123
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:28,530
that's a good question.
He says,

124
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:30,370
well,
I'm actually on their side.

125
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm pretty happy that I'm really happy
that they're not wasting their lives.

126
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:39,250
I'm really sad to see that people are
disenchanted and nihilistic and

127
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:43,430
depressed and anxious and aimless and
and perverse and vengeful and,

128
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,400
and all of those things.
It's terrible.

129
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:50,401
And then to see people question whether
that's necessary and then to start to

130
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,090
rise out of that,
it's like,

131
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,900
it's so fun.
Like last night I was at after my talk.

132
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,823
It's overwhelming.

133
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,730
I don't usually think about these
things,

134
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:05,860
but I was,
I was after my talk last night,

135
00:06:05,861 --> 00:06:07,780
didn't.
So all these people line up and you

136
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:10,390
know,
they have their fifteens 15 seconds with

137
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:12,550
me and they're kind of tentative.
They're excited in a tentative,

138
00:06:12,551 --> 00:06:14,170
when they come up to talk to me and then
they have,

139
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,240
you know,
15 seconds of time to tell me something.

140
00:06:16,241 --> 00:06:20,470
I'm really listening to them and they're
hesitant about whether or not to share

141
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,450
the good news about their life.
You know?

142
00:06:22,451 --> 00:06:24,100
And I think it's often because

143
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:25,610
okay,

144
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,250
when people share good news about their
life,

145
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,000
people don't necessarily respond
positively.

146
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,030
You know,
they don't get encouragement and people

147
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:38,660
need so little encouragement.
It's just unbelievable.

148
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:40,750
And so they'll tell me something good
and I think,

149
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,690
God,
that's so good.

150
00:06:41,691 --> 00:06:42,590
You know,
somebody says,

151
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,270
oh,
I'm getting along way better with my

152
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:46,190
father.
I haven't seen him for 10 years and now

153
00:06:46,191 --> 00:06:48,710
we get along.
It's like crate.

154
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:52,520
And then the power of that,
you can't overstate the power of that

155
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:55,370
for individuals to get their life
together.

156
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,340
They individuals an unbelievably
powerful force.

157
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,300
And every single person who gets their
act together a little bit has the

158
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,970
capacity to spread that around them.
It's,

159
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,620
it's a chain reaction.
And so it's a lovely thing to see and

160
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,730
that's fantastic.
