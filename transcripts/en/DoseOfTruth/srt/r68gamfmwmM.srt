1
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,140
What's the proper level of analysis
because as I mentioned this to begin with,

2
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:21,250
it's very difficult to

3
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,150
formulate the question.

4
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:33,590
The original question is
what led to the issue.

5
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:40,480
I would say their request to the question
of human motivation for evil except

6
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,270
perhaps the opposite question,

7
00:00:44,271 --> 00:00:45,890
which is human motivation for good,

8
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,020
you will also historically positive it's
opposite or the dark because of light

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,490
or the evil you are of
the opposite of that.

10
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,610
There's no way around them.

11
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,180
So it's the same question and that would
be the question I suppose suppose of

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:05,600
ethical behavior morale or something
like that and the question,

13
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,190
the question of its nature,

14
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,380
the nature of reality in the world.

15
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,540
It's a deep question.

16
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,180
You'd say deepest,

17
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:18,640
deepest question and it
requires formulation at the
deepest possible level of

18
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:23,650
analysis and it's a mystery that requires
formulation at the deepest possible

19
00:01:24,021 --> 00:01:25,070
level of analysis.

20
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,080
And so you accepted to
history and you accepted.

21
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,610
It's the deepest level
analysis and yourself,

22
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,040
where do you go find an actual to request
it that's mysterious at the deepest

23
00:01:38,121 --> 00:01:42,140
possible level of analysis and answer
that at least the part as you go or you

24
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:45,200
don't go where you don't know.

25
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,540
You go to that place that you don't know.

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,820
There's actually a technical,

27
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,440
it's a technical issue.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,780
So one of the things that current,

29
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,790
and I think this is well supported by
the relevant neuropsychological and

30
00:02:02,121 --> 00:02:03,530
neuropsychiatric literature,

31
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,700
is that your dreams and your fantasies
containing information that you don't yet

32
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:13,274
know.

33
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,570
Now that's not an easy thing to
understand because you might take,

34
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:21,560
let's say you have a dream and you
figure out what the dream means.

35
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,910
There's a mystery,

36
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,773
which is,

37
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:24,531
well,

38
00:02:24,531 --> 00:02:25,610
if you didn't know what the three,

39
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:27,490
then how the hell did you dream,

40
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:28,610
right?

41
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,120
I mean because you drive,

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,970
you don't understand it.

43
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,080
So how does that work?

44
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:35,420
Because how can you think of
something that you don't understand?

45
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,170
Part of the answers that
you're not exactly a unity.

46
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,230
There's parts of you that know things
that other parts of you don't know.

47
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,590
And there's parts of you that know
things in ways that the part of you that

48
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:49,970
talks can't understand and there's
things that you act out that are too

49
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:52,610
complicated for you to
represent her to articulate.

50
00:02:52,611 --> 00:02:55,910
And so there's lots of
things about you that were,

51
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,990
that you don't understand
that or lesson foreman,

52
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,790
you know what?

53
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,030
You don't know how you breathe,

54
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,620
you don't know your heart works,

55
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:06,100
how your heart and so you don't
have voluntary control over that.

56
00:03:06,101 --> 00:03:08,230
So it's not surprising in
some sense that you're,

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,000
your mind could produce contents
that transcends your articulate.

58
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,460
No UMES idea was that,

59
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,020
that's what dreams did.

60
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:21,100
What dreams were doing
essentially was you a world view.

61
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,170
And that world is only partial obviously,

62
00:03:24,171 --> 00:03:24,860
because what the hell,

63
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:25,570
you know,

64
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,403
so you know,

65
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,641
you're,

66
00:03:26,641 --> 00:03:29,500
you're limited in your knowledge
and you're articulate and your,

67
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,830
and your logical it an integrated,

68
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:33,820
articulate knowledges,

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,260
limited domain,

70
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,250
and there's lots of things that
exist outside that made it goes,

71
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:39,551
it takes,

72
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,770
you don't understand or
errors that you've made.

73
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,170
And you also have to cope with them.

74
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:47,350
You have to start provisionally
understanding them because
not only do you have

75
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:49,480
to understand what you understand,

76
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,900
you have to come to understand
what you don't yet understand.

77
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:53,741
Right?

78
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,790
And that's how you learn and it's August.

79
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:00,810
How that happens at UMES idea was that
this is an elaboration is I think to some

80
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:05,830
degree while you learn in part by acting
and then you in part by representing

81
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:09,380
that APP and you learn by
analyzing this representation.

82
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,290
And I would say yoga is not particular,

83
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,650
well,

84
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,380
regardless,

85
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,410
in most cases,

86
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,370
by modern,

87
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,060
more biologically oriented
psychologists and medical practitioners.

88
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,090
But that's generally because they don't
understand what the hell he was talking

89
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:22,870
about.

90
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:27,670
So the reason is there's
good no psychiatric evidence,

91
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:31,000
neuropsychological epis that that's
actually how the brain functions.

92
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:36,030
So there is a neuropsychologist
and Goldberg who was a student,

93
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:39,810
he took another girl would call it
just made Alexander Luria is a Russian,

94
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:42,820
probably the greatest school
psychologist of the 20th century.

95
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,130
He basically laid the groundwork,

96
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:50,650
the modern understanding of the way
the brain functions in his students

97
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:56,010
discovered extraordinarily
fundamental neurophysiological facts.

98
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,820
Brady's and heavy hitter.

99
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:02,020
I guess student Kokona Goldberg was
very interested in why we have two

100
00:05:02,021 --> 00:05:02,854
hemispheres.

101
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:04,213
It's not wrong.

102
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,250
We have two brains and there is evidence.

103
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,160
There was surgery that was government,

104
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:15,610
not so much anymore but years ago
when people had intractable epilepsy.

105
00:05:15,611 --> 00:05:18,010
That cost to cut two hemispheres,

106
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,310
Corpus Callosum,

107
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:21,770
which is the fat tissue that

108
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,960
copper hemispheres and collective

109
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,863
consciousness

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,980
in you in your feet,

111
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:39,210
you have to consciousness is somewhat
separate that you communicate,

112
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,780
but at each house had various functions
and what that implies is if you need to

113
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:48,781
look at the world in two ways and that
implies maybe that the world is some

114
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:53,940
sense fundamentally divisible into two
because otherwise why would you involve

115
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,410
the brain?

116
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:56,200
Then we'd look at it in two ways.

117
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,190
Since you evolve to active live hitting
the world and it's not just you because

118
00:06:01,191 --> 00:06:03,410
animals have two hemispheres as well.

119
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:08,411
It's very fun and what Goldberg suggested
was that your left hemisphere was

120
00:06:10,811 --> 00:06:15,811
specialized for operation in places that
you understand your right hemisphere

121
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:20,540
was specialized for operation and
places that you don't understand.

122
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,400
I need to think about that.

123
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,950
If you want to think about it from
a more biological perspective,

124
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,530
you could say that you have one system,

125
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,270
say psychological system that
orients you explored territory,

126
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:36,830
which is where we're things are familiar
and where you can predict what's going

127
00:06:36,831 --> 00:06:37,341
to happen,

128
00:06:37,341 --> 00:06:41,240
where what you want to happen is happening
because that's the best definition of

129
00:06:41,241 --> 00:06:42,170
being comfortable,

130
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,830
right?

131
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:43,461
You know,

132
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:48,461
you know where you are when you act and
what you want to have happen happens.

133
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,860
That's a place that's home that's
explored territory and what an unexplored

134
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:54,831
territory is.

135
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,630
The space beyond accounting higher,

136
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:59,600
let's say the darkness
of the 19 the jungle,

137
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,930
but also that place where the things that
you didn't know what to expect or what

138
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:05,050
happened and he's the best bring.

139
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,580
So that's what the world is composed of,

140
00:07:07,581 --> 00:07:09,180
the substance of the world of experience.

141
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:12,860
It's all those things that you want to
have happen that you're familiar with and

142
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:14,870
all those things that
go bump in the night.

143
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,280
All those things that rise up out
of the unknown to disrupt your,

144
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,290
the best laid plans of mice,

145
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,070
let's say.

146
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:24,140
And so you do have these
two separate groups,

147
00:07:24,141 --> 00:07:25,820
logical systems in the way.

148
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,090
And so that was all fine,

149
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:30,050
but ultimately Goldberg quite nicely and,

150
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:30,920
uh,

151
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:34,430
it's been verified by their
own neuropsychiatric status.
