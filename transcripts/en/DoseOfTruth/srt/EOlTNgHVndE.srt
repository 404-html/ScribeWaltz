1
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:09,190
God says to Rachel,

2
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,630
two nations are in Di womb,

3
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:14,230
and two manner of people shall be
separated from night bowels and one people

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,550
shall be stronger than the other,

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,800
and the elder shall serve the younger,

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,290
and so there's a inversion there,

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,591
right?

8
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:23,680
Because as we've discussed

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,730
historically speaking in
traditionally speaking,

10
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:32,731
it's the elder son that to whom the
disproportionate blessings flow.

11
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:36,610
There's some truth in that too.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,040
Even more.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,680
What would you say more empirically?

14
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,810
Iq tends to decrease as the number of
children in the family increase the

15
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:47,380
younger.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,790
The oldest is the smartest.

17
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:49,810
Generally speaking,

18
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,430
it isn't clear why that is,

19
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:54,670
but it might be that they get
more attention and who knows?

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,390
So those of you who are younger can
be very unhappy about that fact.

21
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,480
Now Jacob.

22
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:02,231
Okay,

23
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:03,130
so there's another,

24
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,640
there's another plot line here too,

25
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:11,641
because I'm a Abraham and and Rebecca

26
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:14,980
are at odds.

27
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:15,711
It's.

28
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:16,001
Sorry,

29
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:19,240
Isaac and Rebecca are at
odds about the children.

30
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:19,811
Right?

31
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:20,644
So there's a,

32
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,920
there's an eda pole
twist to it too because.

33
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,480
Well,

34
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,200
Isaac is allied with Esau who
turns out to be the hunter type.

35
00:01:29,201 --> 00:01:32,560
So he's your basic rough
and tumble character,

36
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:32,771
you know,

37
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:37,210
when he's kind of a wild looking guy
called Harry and he likes to be outside.

38
00:01:37,211 --> 00:01:37,990
He lives in tents,

39
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,741
he likes to hunt.

40
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:40,090
He's a man's man.

41
00:01:40,091 --> 00:01:41,380
That's one way of thinking about it.

42
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,770
Whereas Jacob dwells intense,

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,051
you know,

44
00:01:44,051 --> 00:01:45,160
he doesn't go outside much.

45
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:46,060
He's more,

46
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,890
well maybe he's more introverted,

47
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:52,891
but he's certainly the sort of kid
adolescent say who hangs around home and

48
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,540
there's some intimation that he's as,

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,860
while he's clearly as mother's favorite
and with all the advantages and I

50
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:02,170
suppose disadvantaged
that go along with that.

51
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:07,500
And Isaac and Rebecca don't see Iti about
who should have predominance among the

52
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:09,551
sons.

53
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:14,551
And Rebecca is quite complicit with
Jacob in inverting the social order.

54
00:02:18,161 --> 00:02:23,161
So the first thing that happens that's
crooked is that Esau comes in from

55
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:26,290
hunting and he's,

56
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:26,900
you know,

57
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:30,520
he's been out for a number of days
and he's ravenous and he's kind of an

58
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:31,360
impulsive guy,

59
00:02:31,361 --> 00:02:34,630
doesn't really seem to think
about the longterm very much.

60
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,930
And Jacob was cooking some lentil
stew and Esau wants some of it.

61
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,880
Jacob refuses and,

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,460
and then says that he'll trade his,

63
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,860
his birthright for it.

64
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,743
And uh,

65
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,310
Esau Greece,

66
00:02:51,311 --> 00:02:53,470
which is a bad deal,

67
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:53,921
right?

68
00:02:53,921 --> 00:02:54,970
It's a bad deal.

69
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,210
And so you,

70
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,740
you could say that Esau actually
deserves what's to them,

71
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,000
although he at minimum,

72
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:06,700
you'd have to think of them
both as being equally culpable.

73
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,080
It's a nasty trick.

74
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,080
And so that's Jacob's first trick.

75
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:13,983
And then

76
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:21,270
the second trick is that it's later and
Isaac is old and blind and you know,

77
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:26,620
close to death and it's time for him
to bestow a blessing on his sons,

78
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,310
which is a very important event
apparently among these ancient people.

79
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,790
And Esau again is out hunting
and Rachel dress dresses.

80
00:03:36,791 --> 00:03:38,860
Jacob up in a hairy,

81
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:40,810
puts a goat skin on his arm.

82
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:43,540
So he's kind hairy like Esol and dresses.

83
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,970
A Minnesota was closed so
he smells like Esau and

84
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,850
Isaac tells Esau to go
out and hunt him up.

85
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,340
Some venison I think it is.

86
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,690
And uh,

87
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:56,770
which is a favorite of his.

88
00:03:56,771 --> 00:04:01,771
And Rebecca has Jacob Cook up a couple
of goat kids and serve that to Isaac and

89
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,920
play the role of Esol.

90
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:07,240
And so he does that,

91
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,010
it's pretty damn nasty.

92
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,630
Really all things considered,

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,440
you know,

94
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,440
to play a trick like that both on your
brother and on your blind father andy in

95
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,070
collusion with your mother.

96
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,850
It's not the sort of thing that's really
designed to promote lot of familial

97
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:22,684
harmony.

98
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,990
And so especially because you've already
screwed them over in a big way once you

99
00:04:28,241 --> 00:04:28,391
know,

100
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:30,970
you'd think you'd think
that would be sufficient.

101
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,190
So anyways,

102
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,460
he's successful and ESL
loses his father's blessing.

103
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:40,560
And so that Jacob ends up really
in the position of the firstborn.

104
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,250
And it's quite interesting because,

105
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:42,721
you know,

106
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:47,590
God tells Rachel that Jacob is going
to be the dominant twin and you'd think

107
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:52,390
again with God's blessing or at least the
prophecy that Jacob would end up being

108
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:53,260
in a good guy.

109
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:56,590
But he certainly not presented
that way to begin with,

110
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,160
which is also quite interesting given
that he's the eventual founder of Israel.

111
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:03,940
And it's another indication of
the realism of these old stories,

112
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:04,271
you know?

113
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:04,970
And it's,

114
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,250
it's quite amazing to me.

115
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:10,810
It's always been quite amazing to me
how unpredictable these stories have

116
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,644
remained.

117
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,041
You know,

118
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:15,460
because you'd think that if
you're even the least bit cynical,

119
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:19,690
especially if you had the kind of Marxist
religion is the opiate of the masses

120
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:20,620
kind of viewpoint,

121
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,221
which,

122
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:22,720
which is a credible viewpoint,

123
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,500
you know,

124
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,430
although it's wrong,

125
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,300
but it's quite.

126
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:26,163
Well,

127
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,550
I think it's a shallow.

128
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:31,330
I think it's a shallow interpretation
and not part of the reason I think it's a

129
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:35,680
shallow interpretation is because the
stories would be a lot prettier if that

130
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:36,880
was the case.

131
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:39,940
These characters wouldn't
have this strange,

132
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,320
realistic,

133
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,540
moral ambiguity about them.

134
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:44,500
You know,

135
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,100
if you're going to feed
people a fantasy then it,

136
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,340
you want it to be like
a harlequin novel or or,

137
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,600
or our greeting card
or something like that.

138
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:57,220
You don't want it to be a story that's
full of betrayal and deceit and murder

139
00:05:57,221 --> 00:05:59,350
and mayhem and genocide and all of that.

140
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,970
That just doesn't seem all that.

141
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,621
What would you say?

142
00:06:02,621 --> 00:06:03,430
Calming,

143
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,430
I guess would be the right,

144
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,770
right answer.
