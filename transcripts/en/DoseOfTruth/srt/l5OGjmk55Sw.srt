1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,250
My girlfriend is quite overweight,

2
00:00:03,251 --> 00:00:04,120
but I really love her.

3
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:06,070
Should I try to encourage
her to lose weight?

4
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,810
Aside from personal preference,

5
00:00:07,811 --> 00:00:10,660
is this likely to explode into
a major issue down the road?

6
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,190
I don't think that you can fool yourself
about what you're attracted to and yes,

7
00:00:22,191 --> 00:00:25,250
it's certainly likely to develop
into a major issue down the road.

8
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,593
Um,

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,830
it's tough,

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,693
you know,

11
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,450
uh,

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,400
because it's so,

13
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,903
okay.

14
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,350
The devil's in the details,

15
00:00:35,351 --> 00:00:35,621
you know,

16
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:37,660
should you try to encourage
her to lose weight?

17
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,020
I guess the question is how would
you do that without disrupting the

18
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:41,854
relationship?

19
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,263
Um,

20
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:43,950
yeah,

21
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,290
and without knowing more
about the details of that,

22
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:50,700
I would say that I don't know how to
tell what to tell you to do about that.

23
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:55,740
I think that it's necessary to be
truthful in a relationship period.

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,740
But I also think that you
can't use the truth to hurt,

25
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,191
you know,

26
00:00:59,191 --> 00:01:01,260
the truth is a very
complicated thing and it's,

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,580
it's a sword and it cuts and
you can't use it to hurt.

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,750
Now,

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,081
you know,

30
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:10,320
maybe you would be subtle enough to
figure out some way that you could both

31
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,750
embark on a health promoting endeavored
together and that would work out.

32
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,980
Um,

33
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:17,940
but I would say,

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,271
you know,

35
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,104
if you,

36
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,290
if you're in a stable long
term relationship with someone,

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,150
it's pretty much necessary for both of
you to address all the issues that are

38
00:01:27,151 --> 00:01:29,430
making you unhappy with each other.

39
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:30,720
Um,

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:30,961
you know,

41
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:35,310
assuming there's some give and take on
that because otherwise the relationship

42
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:37,350
can easily come apart at the seams.

43
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,580
Like I would say my wife and I are
both very hard on each other about our

44
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,140
physical appearance,

45
00:01:43,141 --> 00:01:43,561
let's say.

46
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:47,730
And I had gained a fair bit of weight
from the time I was say 40 until the time

47
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:51,060
I was 50 about probably because I was
eating things that weren't good for me.

48
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:53,190
And I would say that was
primarily carbohydrates.

49
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,930
I can tell you if you want to lose weight,

50
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,460
you stop eating carbohydrates,

51
00:01:56,461 --> 00:01:56,730
man,

52
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,361
you'll lose weight.

53
00:01:57,361 --> 00:01:58,290
Like you wouldn't believe.

54
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,021
Um,

55
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,740
I wouldn't necessarily recommend
it because it has some dangerous,

56
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:02,820
but it certainly works.

57
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,080
But you know,

58
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:04,914
the,

59
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,810
the alternative to protect
to the alternative is to
pretend that everything's

60
00:02:09,811 --> 00:02:10,231
all right.

61
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:13,410
And all that means is that you're likely
to get drunk sometimes and some day and

62
00:02:13,411 --> 00:02:15,510
have an affair out of
bitterness and spite,

63
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,790
and the fact that you're no
longer attracted to your partner.

64
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:19,890
So it's pretty rough.

65
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:22,200
So that's pretty rough way
of thinking about things,

66
00:02:22,201 --> 00:02:23,220
but life's pretty rough.

67
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:23,550
So.
