1
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,410
That's an old painting by,

2
00:00:08,411 --> 00:00:09,760
I think it's Hieronymus Bosch,

3
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:10,900
if I remember correctly.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,520
I really liked that because it's,

5
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:16,390
it's reminiscent of the
near death experiences that
you hear people describing.

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,530
They're quite common as well.

7
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:18,364
And,

8
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:19,203
and uh,

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,060
I had it very weird experience once.

10
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:23,920
I don't think I've told you this story.

11
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:24,963
I was,

12
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:29,260
I was assessing someone who had gone
through a car windshield and he was very

13
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:30,010
depressed.

14
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,540
It had happened a long time before,

15
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,320
but he was very depressed
and the insurance company
was basically accusing him

16
00:00:35,321 --> 00:00:39,180
of a malingering cause he'd been
depressed for so long and you know,

17
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,480
he'd sort of healed up and everything.

18
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:42,670
But if your left hemisphere is damaged,

19
00:00:42,671 --> 00:00:44,620
especially the frontal part
of your left hemisphere,

20
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:48,190
then you can be in a chronic state of
depression because the left hemisphere,

21
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,390
generally speaking,

22
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:51,610
is responsible for positive emotion.

23
00:00:51,611 --> 00:00:52,630
And so if it isn't there,

24
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:54,580
then it's like negative emotion for you.

25
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,090
And so I went and assessed
him and I was giving him this,

26
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,250
I think it was called the MMPI,

27
00:01:00,251 --> 00:01:02,710
the Minnesota multiphasic
personality inventory,

28
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:04,270
which is a kind of a standard,

29
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:05,860
uh,

30
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,330
path personality test,

31
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,040
half psychopathology test.

32
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,233
And uh,

33
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,730
he was filling it out.

34
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,790
He was a very serious guy,

35
00:01:12,791 --> 00:01:13,660
middle aged guy,

36
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,150
nothing about them was
new agey in the least.

37
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:18,730
He was like an accountant I think.

38
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,350
I think in fact he was an accountant,

39
00:01:20,351 --> 00:01:21,340
if I remember correctly.

40
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:22,713
Um,

41
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:24,970
and there's one question and it said,

42
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,300
my spirit has left my body.

43
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,071
I think that's right.

44
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:30,821
It's very close.

45
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:33,710
And he stopped and he asked me what,

46
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,480
well,

47
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:34,960
he said,

48
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,190
I'm not sure how to answer this.

49
00:01:36,191 --> 00:01:38,290
And so I said,

50
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:38,411
well,

51
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:38,741
why?

52
00:01:38,741 --> 00:01:39,131
And he said,

53
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:39,790
well,

54
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,380
after I went through the car windshield,

55
00:01:41,381 --> 00:01:43,510
I was in a coma for three weeks,

56
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:44,530
something like that.

57
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:45,370
And I died.

58
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:50,170
I think he said he died three times
and he said that he could remember,

59
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:53,140
he couldn't remember anything during
that period of time and he couldn't

60
00:01:53,141 --> 00:01:54,160
remember the car accident.

61
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:55,360
That's retrograde amnesia.

62
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:57,250
It's quite con common with head injuries.

63
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,760
And he said that during
one of those experiences,

64
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:02,470
and this is all he
remembered from the hospital,

65
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:07,471
was that he came out of his body and
went down the long tunnel of light.

66
00:02:08,531 --> 00:02:12,040
You've heard these near death experiences
and then saw his family members there

67
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:17,041
and so other heavenly light and then
realized that it wasn't his time and came

68
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:18,280
back to his body.

69
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,070
Now what was interesting
about this guy was that,

70
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:22,120
well first of all,

71
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:24,100
I didn't ask him about this,

72
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,551
right?

73
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:29,551
He basically volunteered this story and
it was instigated by this question and,

74
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,370
and he didn't know that
anybody else had any,

75
00:02:34,371 --> 00:02:35,880
he ever had an experience like that.

76
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,400
Cause I asked him if he'd ever heard
anything about like that and he said no.

77
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,540
So that was interesting.

78
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,290
But what really was interesting is
how the hell did he remember that?

79
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:45,581
Right?

80
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:48,310
Because he had amnesia during
that entire period of time.

81
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,660
He was in a bloody coma.

82
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,310
It's like he didn't remember anything.

83
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,780
He remembered that.

84
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,423
And so,

85
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,630
well those experiences are
more common than you think.

86
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,930
And then there's,

87
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,250
you know,

88
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,270
there's a painting of one,

89
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,360
which is quite interesting,

90
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:03,970
and that's like a tunnel to heaven.

91
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,800
It's the same basic idea.

92
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,930
It's a little bit more
suffering going on in this one,

93
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,321
I think.

94
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,840
But that's pretty much
typical of Hieronymus Bosch.

95
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:11,140
I mean,

96
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,490
I don't know what was up with that guy,

97
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:14,020
but he was,

98
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,640
he was one strange character.
