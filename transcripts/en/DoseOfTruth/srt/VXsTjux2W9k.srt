1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,071
I mean,

2
00:00:07,071 --> 00:00:12,071
part of the reason that the Germans
preferred Hitler to chaos was because they

3
00:00:12,861 --> 00:00:17,861
felt that the order that Hitler
promised repressive as it was,

4
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:23,090
it was preferable to the chaos that
was likely to ensue in its absence.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:26,350
What is it about chaos
that's so terrifying?

6
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,500
Second Nature said,

7
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:41,920
adopting a belief system of any sort
and imposing coherency on the world,

8
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,830
viewing it through the lens of that
explicit system disciplines your mind,

9
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:50,550
so for example,

10
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,290
to live in the absence of any stated
beliefs is hardly to live at all.

11
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:02,530
To live in the presence of a narrow minded
and extreme belief system is at least

12
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:04,370
to undergo the rigors,

13
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,690
both behavioral and intellectual
of coming to terms with the world.

14
00:01:08,691 --> 00:01:10,310
From some perspective,

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,360
Nisha said the reason that
the modern mind such as it is,

16
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,810
was able to free itself from the past at
all was because it had first thoroughly

17
00:01:25,381 --> 00:01:29,790
subjected itself to the tyranny
that was imposed by the past.

18
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:31,230
In consequence,

19
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:35,760
disciplined itself developed enough
discipline as a consequence of that

20
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:37,860
subordination to then break free of it

21
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,960
in all science of morals so far.

22
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:46,890
One thing was lacking.

23
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:48,060
Strange as it may sound.

24
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,950
The problem with morality itself,

25
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,250
what was lacking was any suspicion that
there was something problematic here.

26
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:55,380
Every society,

27
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,970
every functioning individual,

28
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:58,650
every functioning family,

29
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:01,890
every social unit has a moral code,

30
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,713
but they differ.

31
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,570
So what does that mean exactly?

32
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:06,961
Well,

33
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:07,920
it's complicated,

34
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:08,281
isn't it?

35
00:02:08,281 --> 00:02:11,340
Because the fact of the
university quality of the code,

36
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:17,090
the fact of the code indicates that
the code or our code is necessary.

37
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,870
By the same token,

38
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:23,130
the fact that there's a multiplicity
of codes seems to suggest that the

39
00:02:23,131 --> 00:02:26,550
particulars of a given code
aren't necessarily relevant,

40
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,860
and so nature says brilliantly,

41
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:31,140
I think we're faced with a problem.

42
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,830
No life without morality,

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,840
no absolute morality.

44
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,790
What do we do?

45
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,540
I wonder those things young observed
was that if you look at the structure of

46
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:43,374
stories,

47
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,820
you thought first there's a relationship
between stories and moral codes.

48
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:48,540
Well,

49
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,010
seems relatively straight forward,

50
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:50,640
doesn't it?

51
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,340
If you tell a simple story like a parable,

52
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:56,400
sometimes they're complex
to like an aesop fable safe.

53
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,740
What do you extract out from the story?

54
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,130
Moral?

55
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,300
What's the moral,

56
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,850
what's the implication of
this story for behavior?

57
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:04,684
Right?

58
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:08,980
So you tell a little story about someone
who acts out and given moral code and

59
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,600
that person does better or worse.

60
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,240
And the moral of this story
is if you act in this manner,

61
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,160
you will do better or worse,

62
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,570
proverbial knowledge.

63
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,450
We all tell stories,

64
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,150
they have identifiable structure.

65
00:03:23,151 --> 00:03:27,260
You can tell that because it's a movie
studio in Hollywood can produce a movie

66
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:29,240
and people all over the
world will watch it.

67
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,710
People all over the world,

68
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:33,020
all over the world tell
stories to one another.

69
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:36,290
The plot elements seem similar.

70
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,240
Are the morals similar?

71
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,800
That's a more difficult question,

72
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,030
right?

73
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,410
We know that the details of morality
can vary from culture to culture.

74
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,660
Is there anything that doesn't vary from
culture to culture and why would you

75
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,650
want to find that?

76
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:56,430
Well,

77
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:01,430
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn thought that one
of the most important occurrences of the

78
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:02,450
20th century

79
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:09,410
or the Nuremberg trials and Nuremberg
trials brought the perpetual perpetrators

80
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:14,560
of the Nazi genocide to justice.

81
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,390
And it's easy to be cynical about that.

82
00:04:16,391 --> 00:04:21,391
And perhaps you shouldn't be cynical
about it because the victors brought the

83
00:04:21,521 --> 00:04:22,780
losers to trial.

84
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,420
And so of course the losers,

85
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:29,410
we're going to be tried from the
perspective of the winners moral code.

86
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,670
But Solzhenitsyn says,

87
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,001
well wait,

88
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:31,570
you know,

89
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,180
there's something more to this story.

90
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,420
At least there seems to be in that many
of the events that characterized the

91
00:04:41,651 --> 00:04:46,651
Nazi atrocities were so awful outside of
intellectual argumentation because you

92
00:04:50,441 --> 00:04:52,660
can provide an intellectual
argument for anything.

93
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:58,050
They were so awful that the
proper visceral embodied
response of any observer,

94
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,890
regardless of specific moral code,

95
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,330
should be repugnant,

96
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,463
period.

97
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,570
Such that encoded,

98
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,510
at least initially in international law,

99
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,900
genocide is a crime against humanity,

100
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,370
right?

101
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:20,370
No matter what the particulars of
your moral code so goes the logic.

102
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:26,410
You cannot construct a viable
moral code that enables genocide,

103
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,830
if not a logical impossibility.

104
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,960
And I think it is a logical impossibility.

105
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,790
It's an ethical impossibility.

106
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,680
And then you have to ask yourself,

107
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,100
and this is not precisely
and intellectual question,

108
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,620
does that seem credible to you?

109
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,240
Cause it seemed credible that there are
acts that are so terrible that no one,

110
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,870
regardless of their stated position,

111
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:54,280
should ever engage in them.

112
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,410
And if the answer is yes,

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,131
then I would say,

114
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:58,580
well,

115
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:03,580
if you haven't moved towards personal
except of acceptance of an ultimate up so

116
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:06,800
to speak,

117
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,330
you've certainly identified at least one
down that you don't want to approach.

118
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:17,270
And that's the beginnings
of the establishment of some
notion of absolute moral

119
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:17,810
authority.
