1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,820
Position would be would be that,

2
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:12,480
okay,

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,480
you should try to become aware of the
totality of your subjective experience,

4
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,450
so not only do you feel it in an
embodied sense,

5
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:27,020
but that you represented at a that you
represented and the representation would

6
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:32,520
be mostly in terms of articulation.
It isn't clear that Roger is considered

7
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,380
other forms of representation,
but

8
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:41,790
Roger's the movement towards health is
an integrative process and it's very

9
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:47,490
body focused,
but the outcome of that integrative

10
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:52,380
process which Rogers would say is the
ability to live the good life is that

11
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,540
your language is no longer instrumental.
What you're doing instead is attempting

12
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:04,731
to state the truth as you see it because
of course your truth is a partial truth.

13
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:07,440
Obviously the basket you can do is,
well,

14
00:01:07,441 --> 00:01:11,040
I really think the best you can do is
not live if you can't tell the truth

15
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,500
because you're too damn stupid,
right?

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,110
You don't know enough to tell the truth,
but you can certainly do your best to

17
00:01:16,111 --> 00:01:20,400
represent what you know is clearly as
you possibly can in your communication

18
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:24,270
with other people.
And so rogers believed that it was the

19
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,300
moral responsibility of the therapist to
do that personally and then to the

20
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:34,050
degree that that was being done in the
therapy and the therapy

21
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:37,770
relationship in the therapeutic
relationship,

22
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,430
that that in and of itself would be
healing.

23
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:47,270
And so basically Roger's theory is that
honest communication heels.

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:49,471
No,
you know,

25
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:52,140
that's quite an interesting theory.

26
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:55,981
No,
it's not.

27
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:58,920
It's not completely unaligned from
Freud's earlier claims,

28
00:01:58,921 --> 00:01:59,970
right?
Because Freud

29
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,600
basically presumed that it was.

30
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:11,730
I didn't put so much of a moral element
on it.

31
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:17,030
He really viewed the person more as as
being trapped between titanic opposing

32
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:20,460
forces,
the IED underneath and the superego and

33
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:25,170
top important illegals are crunched up
in the middle and as a consequence of

34
00:02:25,171 --> 00:02:28,530
being pulled and product and crushed by
those titanic forces,

35
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,630
pathology was likely to emerge and he
talked about repression,

36
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:38,631
but for tended to view repression as an
unconscious process for for Rogers,

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,770
the moral element of the therapeutic
process is much clearer,

38
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:50,040
I believe,
and most of the time when you listen to

39
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:55,041
Rogers or you read what he had to say,
the injunctions that he's laying out or

40
00:02:56,401 --> 00:02:57,480
moral injunctions.
Now,

41
00:02:57,481 --> 00:03:01,450
it's quite interesting because you don't
necessarily think of psychotherapy as a

42
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:06,070
moral endeavor and I really never
thought about it that way fully until I

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,850
read.
I was reading Rogers at the same time,

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,990
but you don't tow weight out the
proposition in this book that most of

45
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:18,280
the problems,
many of the problems that people came to

46
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:22,540
see a therapist about,
we're actually moral problems and they

47
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:26,680
were moral problems of various sorts.
Now sometimes the person was in trouble

48
00:03:26,681 --> 00:03:28,900
because they had done something
seriously,

49
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:29,860
seriously wrong.

50
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,920
He had one client,
if I remember correctly,

51
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,050
and he discovered,
if I remember correctly,

52
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:46,000
that she had killed her children and she
did that when they were young.

53
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,480
She had them.
She let them become exposed to

54
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,340
tuberculosis.
I think it was.

55
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,870
She didn't take the proper precautions
and the reason she did that was because

56
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:59,650
she wanted to marry someone and he
wasn't very interested in her children.

57
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,140
So you might consider that a moral
problem on your.

58
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,110
Apparently
apparently it was weighing on her

59
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,130
conscience,
you know,

60
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,220
as it might.
Well now it's a strange thing because in

61
00:04:12,221 --> 00:04:16,360
some sense what she did was turn a blind
eye to something she could have

62
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:20,170
prevented it in legal terms that's known
as willful blindness,

63
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:24,280
but she knew whatever that means.
Well,

64
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,560
there's lots of different levels of
knowing,

65
00:04:26,561 --> 00:04:28,480
right?
You can know something in your body,

66
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,640
you can know something in your
imagination.

67
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,160
You can know something in articulated
form,

68
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,460
you know,
so the whole issue of knowing is a very

69
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:41,461
complicated.
But Rogers

70
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,370
definitely believed as far as I can
tell,

71
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:52,371
that
there was a moral dimension to life that

72
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:55,620
it was identifiable.
That in some sense,

73
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:58,860
it was linear that had had an observable
process,

74
00:04:58,861 --> 00:05:03,090
which was the continual integration of
experience within the phenomenal field,

75
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,450
the ironing out of contradictions within
the phenomenal field.
