1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,150
Many of my friends sing
the wonders of diversity.

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,870
I tried to tell them
diversity isn't a moral good,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,000
but I end up looking like
some terrible racist.

4
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:16,410
Why isn't diversity moral good?

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,300
While diversity is our moral good,

6
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:19,590
but you can't,

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,070
diversity by race doesn't
produce diversity.

8
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:23,430
That's,

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,780
that's called racism.

10
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:29,310
That idea or diversity of gender doesn't
produce diversity unless that's how you

11
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:30,240
define diversity.

12
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:31,074
Look,

13
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,420
let's say that you get diversity
partly as a consequence of personality,

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,790
which is a good way of looking at it.

15
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:44,100
There is more diversity within
groups of people then between,

16
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:47,460
so like men and women differ to
some degree in their personalities,

17
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,230
but there's far more difference between
men within the male group and women

18
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:53,280
within the male group.

19
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:56,550
Then there is between the average
or typical male and female.

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,560
So it's a stupid wait.

21
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:00,120
Let's assume that what you want,

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,260
the organization's pursuing your complex
goal and you want a variety of skills

23
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,520
that would be suited to that goal.

24
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,830
Then you want there to be enough diversity
of ability within the group so that

25
00:01:13,831 --> 00:01:17,370
the goal can be achieved
in a efficient and,

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,503
and uh,

27
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,460
and inexpensive manner.

28
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,821
Right?

29
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:22,080
Because what do you want

30
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,770
on efficient and expensive?

31
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:26,820
Obviously not.

32
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:32,270
So there's a presumption that you get
diversity by using identity politics

33
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:33,691
categories,

34
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:36,720
but there's absolutely no
evidence for that whatsoever.

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,680
So that's why diversity defined by race
or ethnicity or gender is not only not a

36
00:01:45,421 --> 00:01:46,050
moral good,

37
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:50,820
it's actually a moral evil because it
dispenses with the whole idea of the

38
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:52,080
individual dispenses.

39
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:53,370
With the idea of competence.

40
00:01:53,371 --> 00:01:57,630
It just replaces it with the assumption
that if you randomly select from the

41
00:01:57,631 --> 00:01:58,381
population,

42
00:01:58,381 --> 00:02:00,810
because that's how you
would get real equity,

43
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:05,280
you randomly select from the population
that that gives you the best qualified

44
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,210
group of people.

45
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,230
Well that's just,

46
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,070
that's,

47
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,960
you wouldn't do that
to select the plumber.

48
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,251
It's,

49
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:14,040
it's the stupidest possible way of
selecting for anything randomly,

50
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,270
you know,

51
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:19,200
there's no difference between selecting
randomly and selecting accidentally.

52
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:24,650
So it's moral diversity defined properly
is a moral good diversity based on

53
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,091
identity,

54
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:29,490
politics categories is a positive evil,

55
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,720
you know,

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,553
true to our,

57
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:32,910
our prime ministers.

58
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,290
Great example of that.

59
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:35,550
So back,

60
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:40,140
I think it was in 2015 he announced
that half of his cabinet was going to be

61
00:02:40,141 --> 00:02:45,141
women because it was 2015 or something
like muddle headed virtue signaling,

62
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,780
signaling excuse for not thinking.

63
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,560
I think only 20% or 25% of
the elected mps were female.

64
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:57,750
So the proper balance on
average would it be 25% female,

65
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,290
75% male.

66
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,380
What he should've done
was figured out who,

67
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,880
what qualities would make for a competent
cabinet minister because it's actually

68
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:11,800
quite important to have competent cabinet
ministers and then selected from among

69
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:14,770
his people for nothing
other than competence.

70
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,850
But he could virtue signal and then
he set up the most important board,

71
00:03:18,851 --> 00:03:21,600
let's say of the entire
comp country on it.

72
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:24,190
Cause I random basis Jesus,

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,270
how pathetic.

74
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,870
He should have been pilloried
by Canadians for that.

75
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,760
But we're so clued out and,

76
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:33,080
and also in this situation
that you described,

77
00:03:33,081 --> 00:03:34,840
just like if I say,

78
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,051
well,

79
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:37,960
50% of Trudeau's cabinet
shouldn't have been women.

80
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:38,740
It's like,

81
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,011
oh,

82
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:40,060
you're a misogynist.

83
00:03:40,061 --> 00:03:40,451
It's like,

84
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:41,110
no,

85
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:44,200
only 25% of the elected
officials were women.

86
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,011
Now you might say,

87
00:03:45,011 --> 00:03:45,310
well,

88
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,860
it would be better if
50% of the were elected.

89
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:48,310
It's like,

90
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,630
maybe it would be better,

91
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,860
but it didn't happen.

92
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,870
So you can't,

93
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:55,360
you can't fix it at the top end.

94
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,560
It was appalling.

95
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,930
So it's a hard argument to make,

96
00:03:58,931 --> 00:03:59,171
you know,

97
00:03:59,171 --> 00:04:04,171
because you need to know that there's
more difference within groups then between

98
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:07,540
them in order to be able to come
up with a credible argument,

99
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,374
you know?

100
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,210
And then so yeah.
