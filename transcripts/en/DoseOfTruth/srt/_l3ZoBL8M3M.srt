1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:09,220
One of the really useful things to
understand,

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,530
and this took me a long time to
formulate properly.

3
00:00:11,531 --> 00:00:13,330
You know,
you hear the terror management

4
00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:14,350
theorists,
for example,

5
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:18,880
and they have this idea that you're,
you're meaning representation.

6
00:00:18,881 --> 00:00:21,970
The story you tell about the world
regulates your,

7
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,250
your death anxiety.
It's something like that.

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,810
But that's not right.
I mean,

9
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:27,790
it's close to right,
and it's a smart idea.

10
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:29,500
It came from Ernest Becker,
by the way,

11
00:00:29,501 --> 00:00:31,180
who wrote a book called the denial of
death,

12
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:33,550
which is actually quite a good book,
even though it's wrong.

13
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,100
You know,
sometimes a book can be very useful.

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,830
It can be usefully wrong in that.
And Becker's book is usefully wrong

15
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,250
because he thought that it's the
internal representation of your belief

16
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:52,300
system that regulates your anxiety.
And that anxiety is fundamentally in the

17
00:00:52,301 --> 00:00:54,760
final analysis anxiety about death.
It's like,

18
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:55,870
well,
okay,

19
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:56,704
fine.

20
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,400
It's a reasonable proposition,
but that isn't how it works.

21
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:03,250
You see,
it isn't my beliefs right now that are

22
00:01:03,251 --> 00:01:08,230
regulating my emotion.
It's the fact that I'm acting out those

23
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:10,660
beliefs which include implicit
perceptions.

24
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,720
I'm acting them out.
And so are you.

25
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:17,560
And so what you're doing and what I
expect more,

26
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:20,200
more accurately,
what you're doing and what I want you to

27
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:23,080
do and the way I want you to react.
To me,

28
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,220
that's working.
So it's the match between my belief

29
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:31,360
system and the way everyone else is
acting that's regulating my emotions.

30
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,830
It's not the belief system.
It's mediated by the social culture.

31
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,270
And you see,
if you understand this,

32
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:41,920
then you understand more particularly
why people are willing to fight to the

33
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:46,180
bitter end to protect their culture.
It's not a psychological structure that

34
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:49,540
they're protecting.
It's a psychological structure and a

35
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,240
sociological structures.

36
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,410
Simile,
Tanium [inaudible].

37
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:57,610
So the social contract is you have a set
of expectations and I have a set of

38
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:59,830
expectations.
They're actually desires.

39
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,160
They're not merely expectations because
as living creatures,

40
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:05,560
we're desirous,
we don't just expect.

41
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,780
And so you desired outcome and I desire
and outcome and we agree to act in

42
00:02:10,781 --> 00:02:13,930
accordance with that.
That's the social contract.

43
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,660
And so people don't like to having that
disrupted.

44
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,810
Well it isn't because it's
psychologically destabilizes them.

45
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:24,220
Although it does.
It's because it actually destabilizes

46
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:27,670
the right.
If all of a sudden we can't occupy the

47
00:02:27,671 --> 00:02:32,671
same specified domain of territory.
It isn't only that we're thrown into

48
00:02:33,101 --> 00:02:35,650
psychological disarray,
although we will be,

49
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,710
it's that we'll start fighting with each
other like,

50
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,560
and that can kill you.
It's no joke.

51
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:44,110
It kills people a lot.
Like it happens.

52
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,740
It can happen very easily,
that are cohesive social group can

53
00:02:47,741 --> 00:02:51,460
fragment along some fracture line of
identity let's say.

54
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,010
And all hell breaks loose.
You know,

55
00:02:54,011 --> 00:02:58,210
that's what happened with the Tutsis and
Hutu and in uh,

56
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,190
in,
you know,

57
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,760
and those things can get out of control
just so fast.

58
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,380
It's just unbelievable.
And so,

59
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,010
and that wasn't death anxiety,
that was death.

60
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,260
That's a whole different thing.
And that's the other thing,

61
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:13,900
the terror management people don't
exactly get,

62
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,330
it's like,
it isn't just that your culture and your

63
00:03:16,331 --> 00:03:20,410
cultural beliefs protect you from
anxiety and say anxiety about death.

64
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:25,210
Even it's that they actually protect you
from death as well as protecting you

65
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,170
from death.
Anxiety.

66
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,004
I mean,
look,

67
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:31,180
it's warm in here.
It's cold outside.

68
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,310
The fact that the culture is intact
means that you're not outside freezing.

69
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,810
That's a hell of a lot more fundamental
in some sense than mere anxiety.

70
00:03:40,811 --> 00:03:44,260
Although I'm not trying to underplay the
role of anxiety.

71
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:47,140
That's a major issue,
but there's something that's a lot more

72
00:03:47,141 --> 00:03:49,780
fundamental at stake than mere
psychology.

73
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,110
So it's the match between your map of
the world and other people's actions

74
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:58,130
that regulates your emotion.
And,

75
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,600
and it,
it regulates it completely because you

76
00:04:01,601 --> 00:04:02,140
know,
if,

77
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,740
if someone in here started acting
seriously deranged,

78
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:10,240
like brandish to pistol,
let's say all of a sudden you would not

79
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,170
be in the same place at all,
not a bit.

80
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,210
And so what would happen?
Well,

81
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:21,670
chaos would happen and chaos isn't just
that you would get anxious.

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:25,450
That's not a good enough explanation.
What would happen is more complex than

83
00:04:25,451 --> 00:04:25,881
that.
What,

84
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:28,960
what happens in some senses that your
body,

85
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,480
and it does this,
does this,

86
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,900
what would happen is that you would
react the same way that Iraq reacts to a

87
00:04:34,901 --> 00:04:37,030
cat.
It's exactly that.

88
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,390
It's exactly that.
You would respond as if a terrible

89
00:04:40,391 --> 00:04:44,500
Predator had emerged in your midst.
And so what is that reaction?

90
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,620
Well,
it's not just anxiety because when you

91
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,890
encounter a Predator,
anxiety isn't the only thing that's

92
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,660
useful that just makes you freeze.

93
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,460
It's like that could be the worst thing
you can do.

94
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,230
You freeze and well you're a pretty easy
target so you have to be prepared for a

95
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,750
lot broader range of responses.
The mirror,

96
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,690
mirror,
mirror,

97
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,980
Petrofac location,
like how bout a little aggression that

98
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,540
might be helpful.
You don't know.

99
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,580
It also might get you killed,
but you know,

100
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:15,460
maybe you can take the guy down and
maybe that's a good idea,

101
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,743
you know,
and,

102
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,590
and maybe you have to run.
So that's deceive inhibited as well.

103
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:23,920
And maybe you have to think really
quickly and reflexively.

104
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:27,070
So that happens.
That's activated disinhibited I would

105
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:29,830
say as well.
It's like your whole being is thrown

106
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:34,780
into intense concentration on the moment
and you're burning up physiological

107
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,480
resources like mad.
And so what will happen after something

108
00:05:37,481 --> 00:05:41,560
like that if you don't develop outright
posttraumatic stress disorder,

109
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:45,790
which some of you would,
is that you assuming that the situation

110
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,330
was brought under control,
you'd walk out of here shaking with your

111
00:05:49,331 --> 00:05:51,910
heart,
rate it like one 70 and it would take

112
00:05:51,911 --> 00:05:54,430
you like,
while it might take you the rest of your

113
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:58,070
life and maybe you would never recover,
but you could bloody well be sure that

114
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,170
it would take you the rest of the day.

115
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,850
That's for sure.
And so it's no joke when someone steps

116
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:08,120
steps outside the confines of the social
contract,

117
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,470
right.
And that's kind of,

118
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,300
there's a philosopher named Hobbs who I
suppose in some sense was a centrally

119
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:16,790
conservative philosopher as opposed to
Russo,

120
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,330
who's kind of his exact opposite.
Rousseau believed that people were

121
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:25,160
basically good in their natural state.
So he believed nature was basically good

122
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:27,890
and he believed that culture was what
corrupted people.

123
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:28,724
And,
and so,

124
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,440
and uh,
uh,

125
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,750
Hobbs,
Thomas Hobbes believed exactly the

126
00:06:32,751 --> 00:06:35,480
opposite.
He believed that in the state of nature,

127
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:39,380
let's say every person was at every
other person's throat,

128
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:44,710
and the only thing that prevented
continual chaos was the imposition of a,

129
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,940
of a collective agreement that would be
the social contract that essentially

130
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:54,200
governed how people would interact and
that would keep that underlying chaos at

131
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,970
at bay.
And you know,

132
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,650
my contention is is that Hobbes was
correct and Russolo was correct.

133
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:04,940
And I think that if you add Russo and
Hobbes together,

134
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:07,640
you get a total picture of the world.
And that's really,

135
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:10,820
I think the picture of the world that
I'm trying to relate to you.

136
00:07:10,821 --> 00:07:12,500
It's both at once.
It's like,

137
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,740
well you can't just attribute human
malevolence and unpredictability to

138
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:21,120
society.
It's does.

139
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,690
It's a nonstarter.
It's like people build society.

140
00:07:23,691 --> 00:07:25,670
So all you're doing is pushing the
problem back.

141
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:28,760
It's like where did it come from while
society,

142
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,540
this society before?
Well then the one before that,

143
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,880
it's like,
well you got to tangle up the individual

144
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:37,640
in there at some point because people
created society.

145
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,180
And so you can't just blame human
irrationality and malevolence on

146
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:45,480
society.
Well and also it's,

147
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:50,150
it's ungrateful for God's sake.
It's like society obviously also makes

148
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:52,310
you peaceful.
Part of the reason you're peaceful right

149
00:07:52,311 --> 00:07:54,470
now,
all of you is because while you're not

150
00:07:54,471 --> 00:07:57,200
that hungry,
you're certainly not starving to death.

151
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,990
You would be a very,
very different person if you were

152
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:01,730
starving right now.
You know,

153
00:08:01,731 --> 00:08:05,690
or if you were enraged or if you were
panicking or if you were terrified

154
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,140
because your,
your future was radically uncertain.

155
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:11,810
I mean,
you're just not any of those people

156
00:08:11,811 --> 00:08:13,070
right now.
Europe,

157
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,850
satiated and I mean that technically
you're satisfied.

158
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:20,540
None of your biological systems except
perhaps curiosity,

159
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,310
which is a rather pleasant emotion are
activated in the least.

160
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,740
And you know,
because of that you all think,

161
00:08:27,741 --> 00:08:29,240
well,
you're in control of yourself.

162
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:32,360
But don't be thinking that.
That's just not right.

163
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,370
I mean,
if you look at how the brain is

164
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:35,690
structured,
for example,

165
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,390
the Hypothalamus,
which is a really important part of the

166
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:39,620
brain.
It basically,

167
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,980
it basically establishes the framework
of reference and the actions,

168
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,370
the framework of reference within which,
and the actions you take in order to

169
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,410
fulfill basic biological needs.

170
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,920
So the hypothalamus makes you thirsty
and the hypothalamus makes you hungry

171
00:08:54,921 --> 00:08:58,580
and it makes you sexually aroused.
If it puts you into a state of defensive

172
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,090
aggression.
And it,

173
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,110
it actually also makes you explore and
be curious.

174
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,050
All of that's hypothalamic.
It's an amazing structure.

175
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,110
And then,
and it's really small and it's right at

176
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:12,060
the base of the brain.
Um,

177
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,870
and you could imagine it as something
that has tremendously powerful

178
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,560
projections upward throughout the rest
of the brain into the emotional systems

179
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:24,270
in the cortical systems and all of that,
like tree trunk size connections,

180
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:25,950
you know,
metaphorically speaking.

181
00:09:25,951 --> 00:09:30,420
And then the cortex has these little
light vine like tendrils going down to

182
00:09:30,421 --> 00:09:32,280
regulate the hypothalamus.
You know,

183
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,320
and if it's,
when push comes to shove,

184
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,600
man,
the Hypothalamus,

185
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,000
that thing wins.
And so,

186
00:09:39,001 --> 00:09:41,340
you know,
you get people now and then who have a

187
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:45,060
hypothalamic dysfunction and one of them
produces a condition called,

188
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,210
I can't remember it,
it's not dips Romania.

189
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,120
Although it's,
it's like that doesn't matter.

190
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,890
It produces the uncontrollable thirst.
And so what will happen is that people

191
00:09:55,891 --> 00:10:00,030
who have this hypothalamic problem,
we'll drown themselves by drinking

192
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,950
water,
which you can do by the way.

193
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:05,550
Uh,
and so they just cannot get enough water

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,520
and there's no stopping them,
right?

195
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:10,920
No,
no more than there would be stopping you

196
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:13,080
if you were suffering from raging
thirst.

197
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,690
It's like,
it's a happy day when the hypothalamus

198
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:18,120
is not telling you what to do.
And you know,

199
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:21,930
you live in such a civilized state that
most of the time,

200
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,450
roughly speaking,
you're tranquil and satisfied and more

201
00:10:27,451 --> 00:10:30,630
or less,
you can imagine yourself as a peaceful,

202
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,840
you know,
productive well meaning

203
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:38,460
entity.
But don't be thinking that that's what

204
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:40,350
you'd be if you were put in the right
situation,

205
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:42,330
because that's just not right at all.
