1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,480
You have said that the only moral
absolute is always to tell the truth.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,570
What if you have Anne frank and the attic
and the gifts Stapel at your on your

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:07,200
doorstep.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,710
Then I would say that there has been a
lot of lies that have got you to that

5
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,544
point.

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,110
So you may be in a situation where you're
damned if you turn right and you're

7
00:00:16,111 --> 00:00:17,430
damned if you turn left.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,460
And what that means is you made
a lot of mistakes along the way.

9
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:21,691
You know,

10
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,600
so if the totalitarians
or knocking at your door,

11
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,910
if the totalitarians or
knocking on everyone's door,

12
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,490
that means everyone should
have spoke up a lot sooner.

13
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:33,300
And then they wouldn't end
up in a situation where the
Gestapo was out the door

14
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:35,790
and Anne Frank was in the
owl is it was in the attic.

15
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,460
So you'd now,

16
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:42,030
and then you end up in a situation where
you've made so many mistakes that all

17
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,470
you've got is hell around you.

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,020
And that was certainly
the case in Amsterdam say,

19
00:00:46,021 --> 00:00:47,000
or an in,

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,050
in when the Nazis came in on,

21
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:50,670
I mean the Dutch and admirable people,

22
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,300
and I know they were invaded by the
Nazis and that was a terrible thing,

23
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,531
but many,

24
00:00:55,531 --> 00:00:55,831
many,

25
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:56,131
many,

26
00:00:56,131 --> 00:00:56,431
many,

27
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,870
many people made many terrible moral
errors for all of that to occur.

28
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:04,590
And you have to be awake and do everything
you can to make sure your society

29
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:04,890
doesn't,

30
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,880
this is the answer.

31
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:06,991
You be away.

32
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:11,070
Can you make sure everything you society
does doesn't lead to the point where

33
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,180
the Gestapo is at your doorstep and
you have Anne Frank in the attic.

34
00:01:15,181 --> 00:01:17,790
It's a little late to be
thinking then I would say.
