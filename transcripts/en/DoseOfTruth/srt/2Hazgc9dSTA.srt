1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,260
How could I overcome my fear of driving
on freeways?

2
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,390
Well,
one of the things you could do,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
this is Ellis is do a fair bit of
imagining driving on freeways and try to

4
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:20,580
make the imagining as realistic as
possible.

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,640
But then the other thing you can do is
it's again,

6
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:26,400
it's graduated exposure.
If you're afraid of driving,

7
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,970
go drive with someone you trust in a
parking lot on Sunday morning when

8
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:34,260
there's no one there and then drive
around the block and a street that isn't

9
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,070
busy and then go to a slightly busier
street and then go to a slightly busier

10
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:43,071
street and then find a highway that's
like a just a two layer so that you know

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,750
you could practice merging and that sort
of thing.

12
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:50,700
And you got to build a plan,
say with 20 degrees of difficulty with

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,360
the highest degree of difficulty,
maybe being more merging onto a busy

14
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:55,680
four lane highway.

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,730
And you could go at night and practice
merging onto the busy highway because it

16
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:03,090
won't be busy at night.
So I would say what you do is you break

17
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:06,990
it down into small steps and then
practice each step until you're bored

18
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:09,270
with the step.
And when you're bored with it,

19
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,480
that means you're no longer anxious
about it and don't quit.

20
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,880
You know,
like stick at it because it's really

21
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:18,090
useful to overcome a fear.
And once you've identified a fear,

22
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,090
then you've identified something to
overcome that can definitely make you

23
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:22,530
stronger.
So like,

24
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,940
good luck with it and get professional,
like take a driving course if you need

25
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,670
to as well,
and find someone to work with.

26
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:32,280
It isn't going to make you nervous and
isn't going to harass you,

27
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:35,250
but don't quit.
It's really important to overcome a

28
00:01:35,251 --> 00:01:35,970
fear.
Lucked out.
