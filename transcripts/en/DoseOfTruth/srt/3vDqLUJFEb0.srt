1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,070
So you believe that the dream could
contain more information then was yet

2
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:10,290
articulated.
You think artists do the same thing?

3
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,470
You know,
like people go to museums and they look

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,840
at paintings,
renaissance paintings or modern

5
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:18,210
paintings and they don't exactly know
why they're there.

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:23,470
Now I was in this room and in New York,
I don't remember which museum,

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,010
but it was a room full of renaissance
art,

8
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,240
you know,
great painters,

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:31,140
the greatest painters and thought maybe
that room was worth $1 billion or

10
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:33,630
something outrageous because there was
like 20 paintings in there,

11
00:00:33,631 --> 00:00:35,250
you know,
so priceless.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,900
And the first thing is,
well,

13
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:40,410
why are those paintings worth so much
and why is there a museum in the biggest

14
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,410
city in the world devoted to them?
And why do people from all over the

15
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:46,590
world come and look at them?
What the hell are those people doing?

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,870
One of them was of the assumption of
Mary,

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,430
you know,
beautifully painted,

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,780
absolutely glowing work of art.
There's like 20 people standing in front

19
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:57,510
of it looking at it and think,
what are those people up to?

20
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,040
You know,
they don't know.

21
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,340
Why did they make a pilgrimage to New
York to come and look at that painting?

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,040
It's not like they know.
Why is it worse so much?

23
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,960
I mean,
I know there's a status element to it

24
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,520
too,
but that begs the question,

25
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,640
why did those items become such high
status items?

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,640
What is it about them that's so
absolutely remarkable?

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,280
Well,
we're strange creatures.
