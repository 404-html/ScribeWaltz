1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,460
No,

2
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:00,610
I'm,

3
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:05,610
I often talk to people who are trying to
make a difficult life decision and they

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,230
are weighing out the costs and the
benefits of making the life decisions.

5
00:00:09,231 --> 00:00:09,700
You know,

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:12,760
and one of the things I always talk
to them about is wait a second,

7
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,320
that's an incomplete analysis.

8
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,150
You have to weigh out the benefits and
the costs of doing this and you have to

9
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:21,460
weigh out the costs and
benefits of not doing that,

10
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,540
not doing it.

11
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,410
And that's not the same as the zero that
you assume that you're starting with.

12
00:00:26,411 --> 00:00:26,980
Right.

13
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:30,910
Because to not make a
decision also has a cost.

14
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:34,600
And sometimes the cost of not making a
decision is far worse than the cost of

15
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:35,434
making a decision,

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,480
even if the decision is risky.

17
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,490
And so one of the things
you can derive from that,

18
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:41,290
and this is very useful I think,

19
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,124
is that

20
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,780
this is also I think why it's so
useful to contemplate your mortality,

21
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:47,411
so to speak,

22
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:48,640
as you're screwed,

23
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:49,900
no matter what you do,

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:50,981
you know,

25
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:53,200
and that actually frees you is that you,

26
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:53,391
you,

27
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:55,660
you have power at the hay
that has catastrophes.

28
00:00:55,661 --> 00:00:59,020
And you have path B that has catastrophes
and you don't get to have the no

29
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:00,160
catastrophe path,

30
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,780
but you get to pick which one.

31
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:06,370
And that's really something because
if you know that there's terrible risk

32
00:01:06,371 --> 00:01:08,800
associated with everything
that you do and don't do,

33
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:10,960
then you can afford to take
some risks because you're not,

34
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:11,710
you know,

35
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:13,780
and this is all within the arc metaphor.

36
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:18,520
I'm still making the case that despite
the fact that your life is essentially

37
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:19,390
catastrophic,

38
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,470
you can,

39
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,070
you can make a covenant with the highest
ideal and that will take you through it

40
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:25,320
the best way possible.

41
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:25,750
I'm,

42
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,130
I'm still making that case.

43
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:28,503
So,

44
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:31,611
so then you think,

45
00:01:31,611 --> 00:01:31,911
okay,

46
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:33,170
well I'm trying to make this decision.

47
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:36,140
I'm going to go try to do something
difficult and isn't that terrifying?

48
00:01:36,141 --> 00:01:36,681
And then you think,

49
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:36,891
yeah,

50
00:01:36,891 --> 00:01:37,724
but wait a minute.

51
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,460
What's really terrifying is not doing it.

52
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,300
And then you think about
the cost of not doing it.

53
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:45,650
So in the future authoring program,

54
00:01:45,651 --> 00:01:46,940
we have people do this,

55
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,200
a little meditative exercise,

56
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:48,471
which is,

57
00:01:48,471 --> 00:01:48,771
okay,

58
00:01:48,771 --> 00:01:52,670
just think about your insufficiencies
by your own definition,

59
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:52,941
right?

60
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:57,941
The way that you don't do what you know
you should do about the things that you

61
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:58,940
do that you shouldn't do,

62
00:01:58,941 --> 00:02:01,820
that you know you shouldn't
do beyond a shadow of a doubt,

63
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:02,061
right?

64
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:06,710
There's some things like that and that
that's bad habits and poor aim and all of

65
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:10,940
the resentment and hatred and aggression
and unresolved conflicts and all those

66
00:02:10,941 --> 00:02:14,060
things that are dementing you
and warping you and then think,

67
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:14,630
okay,

68
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,190
those things get the upper hand man,

69
00:02:16,191 --> 00:02:19,880
they get the upper hand and they take
you the worst possible place you could go

70
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,200
in the next three to five years.

71
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,210
What exactly does that look like?

72
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,580
And so you sketch all
that out and you think,

73
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:25,761
hey,

74
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:26,660
I don't want to go there.

75
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,630
And so the next time that
a temptation comes up,

76
00:02:29,631 --> 00:02:29,961
you think,

77
00:02:29,961 --> 00:02:30,111
well,

78
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:32,720
it'd be a lot better for me if I
didn't succumb to this temptation.

79
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:32,991
It's like,

80
00:02:32,991 --> 00:02:33,824
that's kind of weak.

81
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,550
You'd look a little better if you
didn't eat like a cheesecake a day or

82
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:38,384
something like that.

83
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,290
You know,

84
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:39,650
that's,

85
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,281
that's something,

86
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,690
but it's not the same as,

87
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:42,680
um,

88
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,180
I'm going to have diabetes and I'm
going to lose my damn leg and in,

89
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:48,650
in five years if I don't
get my eating under control.

90
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,000
That's motivating.

91
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,920
And so then the temptation
comes along and you think,

92
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,233
oh,

93
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:55,070
how about no,

94
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,023
seriously?

95
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:56,691
How about,

96
00:02:56,691 --> 00:02:56,931
no,

97
00:02:56,931 --> 00:03:01,490
not just because a higher good
would be obtained if I avoided it,

98
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,840
but because of a terrible catastrophe
would be averted if I didn't.
