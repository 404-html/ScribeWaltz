1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:06,961
Okay.

2
00:00:06,961 --> 00:00:10,470
So that's another issue that I'd like
to bring up because one of the things,

3
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:15,471
I cannot say grout is the alliance
between the postmodernists and the Neo

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,470
Marxists.

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,120
I can't understand the causal
relationship there because the,

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:22,260
tell me if you disagree with this.

7
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:22,561
Okay.

8
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:23,190
Because,

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,700
um,

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:24,690
I'm a psychologist,

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,290
not a sociologist and so I'm dabbling in
things that are outside of my field of

12
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:30,150
expertise and there is
some danger in that.

13
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:31,320
But the scent,

14
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:35,700
the central postmodernist claim seems to
me that because there's a near infinite

15
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:38,850
number of ways to interpret
a complex set of phenomena,

16
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:39,250
which,

17
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:40,980
which actually happens to be the case,

18
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,120
that you can't make a case that any
of those modes of interpretation,

19
00:00:45,121 --> 00:00:46,050
our canonical,

20
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,730
and so if they're not canonical,

21
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:49,100
if that,

22
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,260
if that canonical element isn't
based in some kind of reality,

23
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:53,820
then it serves some other master.

24
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:57,510
And so the master that it hypothetically
serves for the postmodernists is

25
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,740
nothing but power because that seems
to be everything that they believe in.

26
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,250
They don't believe in competence.

27
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,720
They don't believe in authority.

28
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:07,120
They don't seem to believe in an objective
world because everything is language

29
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:07,954
mediated.

30
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,990
So it's an extraordinarily cynical
perspective that that because there's an

31
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:14,610
infinite number of interpretations,

32
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:15,720
none of them are canonical,

33
00:01:15,721 --> 00:01:18,240
you can attribute it to
everything to power and dominance.

34
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:18,751
Okay.

35
00:01:18,751 --> 00:01:19,310
So that,

36
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,390
that seemed like a
reasonable summary of the

37
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,210
radical relativism.

38
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:24,570
Okay.

39
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,070
It's a radical relativism now.

40
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:27,720
But the strange thing is despite,

41
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,021
okay,

42
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,620
and so what goes along with that is
the demolition of grand narratives.

43
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,150
And so that would be associated,

44
00:01:33,151 --> 00:01:33,721
for example,

45
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:37,170
with the rejection of thinkers like
young and Eric Norman because of course

46
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,970
their foundational thinkers,

47
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:39,900
um,

48
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,130
in relationship to the idea that there
are embodied grand narratives that's

49
00:01:44,131 --> 00:01:44,964
never touched.

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,930
But then despite the fact that
the grand narrative is rejected,

51
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:51,090
there's a neo Marxism that's tightly,

52
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,880
tightly allied with postmodernism.

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,890
It also seems to shade into
this strange identity politics.

54
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:56,790
And I don't,

55
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,141
two things,

56
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:00,720
I don't understand the
causal relationship there.

57
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:01,460
Like the,

58
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:05,010
the skeptical part of me thinks
that postmodernism was a,

59
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,720
was an intellectual,

60
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:11,220
it's intellectual camouflage for the
continuation of the kind of pathological

61
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:13,320
Marxism that produced the Soviet Union.

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,220
And that has no independent existence
as an intellectual field whatsoever.

63
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,470
But I still can't understand how the
postmodernists can make the no grand

64
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:23,700
narrative claim,

65
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,970
but then immerse themselves
in this grand narrative.

66
00:02:27,971 --> 00:02:31,680
W W without anyone pointing out
the evidence contradictions.

67
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,000
Like I don't understand that.

68
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:34,590
So what do you think about that?

69
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:34,951
Well,

70
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:38,070
I can only speak about
literary and professors really,

71
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,350
and they seem to me almost universally
in the u s to being very naive or they,

72
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:42,810
they,

73
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,090
they seem to know nothing
about actual history,

74
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,920
political science or economics.

75
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:48,960
It's simply an attitude.

76
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,590
They have an attitude and it would,

77
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:54,870
in Marxism becomes simply a badge
by which they telegraph their,

78
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:55,620
um,

79
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,860
their solidarity with a working class
that they have nothing to do with.

80
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,350
Right.

81
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,090
I mean,

82
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,840
really nothing but contempt.

83
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:02,180
Yes.

84
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,730
And the thing is that the,

85
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,880
the campus leftists are
almost notorious for their,

86
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:07,260
uh,

87
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,970
for their rather snobbish
treatment of staff.

88
00:03:09,971 --> 00:03:10,390
I mean they don't,

89
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,110
they don't have any rapport with the
actual working class members of the,

90
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,973
um,

91
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,210
of the infrastructure,

92
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:16,960
the janitor,

93
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,790
the janitors,

94
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,623
and even the,

95
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,630
even the secretaries,

96
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,480
there's a kind of high
and mighty aristocracy,

97
00:03:22,481 --> 00:03:22,661
you know,

98
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,980
about these have just,

99
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,150
these are people who,

100
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:25,780
um,

101
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,000
who have wandered into
the English department.

102
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,420
Right.

103
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:31,120
And we're products of a time when,

104
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,013
um,

105
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:32,441
during the,

106
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:35,800
the new criticism they wait with when
history with history and psychology had

107
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:36,634
been excluded.

108
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,210
I mean,

109
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,200
my ambition,

110
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,411
okay.

111
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,840
Was I love the new criticism okay.

112
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,270
As,

113
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,540
as a style of textual analysis.

114
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:43,910
Right.

115
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,120
And,

116
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:44,441
and the,

117
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:47,620
and the new criticism had
multiple interpretations.

118
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:47,831
Okay.

119
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:48,790
That were possible.

120
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,020
Okay.

121
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,180
And,

122
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,170
and they were encouraged.

123
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:50,711
In fact,

124
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,011
one of the,

125
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,140
you know,

126
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:53,680
one of the great projects
was made in Max series,

127
00:03:53,681 --> 00:03:54,740
20th century views.

128
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,380
What you had at least some books.

129
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:00,700
I adored them in college and it was about
Jane Austin or about Emily Bronte or

130
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,500
about Wordsworth.

131
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:06,280
And they were collections of
alternate views of the same thing.

132
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:07,690
The idea that no more,

133
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,620
no alternative views.

134
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,640
And there was no relativistic
situational kind of,

135
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,080
kind of an interpretive
approach is nonsense.

136
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:14,341
Okay.

137
00:04:14,341 --> 00:04:14,800
About,

138
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:19,800
but the point was we needed to restore
right history to literary literary study.

139
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,740
Okay.

140
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,140
And we needed to add psychology
to it because it was,

141
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,730
there was great animus against Freud.

142
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,130
And when I arrived in,

143
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:26,981
in graduate school,

144
00:04:26,981 --> 00:04:27,281
in fact,

145
00:04:27,281 --> 00:04:30,700
I actually went into the director of
graduate studies and protested the way

146
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:35,701
Freud and Freud and were
used as as negative terms
pay in a sneering way by that

147
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:36,790
very wasp professors.

148
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,120
Right.

149
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,110
So we need to do it.

150
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,650
Actually,

151
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,300
it seemed like we were moving there.

152
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:44,960
It can be in the early 1970s was a great
period of psycho biography about great.

153
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,180
About political figures.

154
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:47,014
Okay.

155
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:51,010
So I thought it's happening in all of
a sudden it all got short circuited by

156
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:51,761
this arrival,

157
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:51,981
you know,

158
00:04:51,981 --> 00:04:54,700
of of poststructuralism and
postmodernism and the in the,

159
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:55,900
in the 1970s.

160
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,500
All right.

161
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:56,861
Um,

162
00:04:56,861 --> 00:04:57,880
so I,

163
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:58,410
I feel,

164
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,100
I am an old historicist okay.

165
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,490
Not,

166
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:01,390
not a new historicist.

167
00:05:01,391 --> 00:05:01,870
So I mean,

168
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:02,471
I think new stores,

169
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:03,670
so it was an absolute scam.

170
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,480
Right?

171
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,021
And it's like,

172
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:06,010
it just a way,

173
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,030
it's like tweezers.

174
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,481
You'd like just,

175
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:07,601
you know,

176
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:09,010
you pick a little bit of this,

177
00:05:09,011 --> 00:05:09,731
a little bit of that,

178
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,660
a little bit of that.

179
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,130
You make a little tiny salad.

180
00:05:12,131 --> 00:05:14,200
I'm going to say I'm
selling this atomize thing.

181
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,920
Okay.

182
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,660
It's supposed to mean something.

183
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:18,070
It's all can be very superficial,

184
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:18,904
very cynical,

185
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,170
very distance.

186
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:20,860
I like,

187
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,540
I am a,

188
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,870
I am a product.

189
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:23,081
Okay.

190
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:25,510
Of Old historicism German philology.

191
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,040
I decided my,

192
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:30,430
my first choice of a profession when
I was a child would was Egyptology

193
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,313
archaeology.

194
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Everything I ever think about or say is,

195
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:37,030
is related to an enormous time scheme.

196
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:37,181
Okay.

197
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:37,391
From,

198
00:05:37,391 --> 00:05:39,730
from antiquity and indeed
from the Stone Age.

199
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,060
Right.

200
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,380
And that is the problem with,

201
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,101
with these people,

202
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:43,570
they're their mouth educated,

203
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:46,270
the postmodernist and academic Marxists.

204
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:46,870
Okay.

205
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,840
Our mount educated embarrassingly so.

206
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:50,051
Okay.

207
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:53,380
They know nothing before
the present full call.

208
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:53,890
Okay.

209
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:56,920
It's absolutely a joke
before the enlightenment.

210
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,793
Hey Dave,

211
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:01,570
perhaps he might be useful to people
to talk about what happened after

212
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,690
neoclassicism,

213
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,261
which by the way,

214
00:06:03,261 --> 00:06:06,650
he failed to notice a lot of
what he was talking about.

215
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:06,820
Okay.

216
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,670
Turns out to see be simply
the hangover of neoclassicism.

217
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:10,851
Okay,

218
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:11,031
this,

219
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:12,500
this is how ignorant that man was.

220
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:12,861
I mean,

221
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:13,311
his head was,

222
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:15,020
he was not talented as a researcher.

223
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,460
He knew absolutely nothing.

224
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,030
Okay with,

225
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:17,241
you know,

226
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,290
nothing about antiquity.

227
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:21,700
How can you make any
kind of large structure?

228
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:23,270
While I'm large mechanism,

229
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:23,571
you know,

230
00:06:23,571 --> 00:06:27,500
to analyze western culture without
knowing about classical antiquity.
