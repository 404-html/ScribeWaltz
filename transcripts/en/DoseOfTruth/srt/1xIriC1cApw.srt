1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:04,770
Could you please discuss freewill and
Sam Harris's and others' ideas of its

2
00:00:04,771 --> 00:00:05,760
non-existence?

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:06,331
Well,

4
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:08,610
that's a good complicated
question to kick things off.

5
00:00:08,611 --> 00:00:12,840
So I want to tell you a little bit
about how to conceptualize freewill.

6
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:17,841
I think first because it's obvious that
we don't have infinite free will are our

7
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,923
choice.

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,540
Our choices are constrained
in all sorts of ways.

9
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:23,500
And I think part of the
reason that there's a,

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,010
a continual discussion about freewill
and the philosophical and the

11
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,810
philosophical literature is because

12
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:36,510
just conceptualizing the issue
properly is extraordinarily difficult.

13
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:38,220
So I like to think about it,

14
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,750
at least in part,

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,520
the way that you think about a game.

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,540
You know,

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,920
if you're playing a game,

18
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,420
obviously the game has rules.

19
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:47,700
So if it's a chess game
or a basketball game,

20
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,540
then there are things that you can
do in and things that you can't do.

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,370
And but,

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,171
and so it's,

23
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:54,451
it's a,

24
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:55,260
it's a,

25
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,720
it's a closed world in some sense.

26
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,700
But the fact that there are things you
can't do when you play a game also seemed

27
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:05,790
to open up a universe of possibilities
for things that you can do.

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:11,090
So chess obviously constraints you to a
board and to a certain number of men and

29
00:01:11,461 --> 00:01:13,050
to a certain pattern of rules.

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,430
But the strange thing is,

31
00:01:14,431 --> 00:01:16,470
is that when you put in those rules,

32
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:17,850
because rules sound like limits,

33
00:01:17,851 --> 00:01:19,830
they sound always like
things you can't do.

34
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:25,050
But when you set up a constrained world
like that and you lay out a system of

35
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:25,471
rules,

36
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:27,480
what you do is open up an infinity of,

37
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,940
of a near infinity of possibilities.

38
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,080
Same with music.

39
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:31,291
You know,

40
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,880
music has rules obviously,

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,050
and,

42
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,160
and if you follow the rules,

43
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:37,800
then you can make an
infinite variety of music.

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,233
And so,

45
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:40,711
and so there's a,

46
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:45,120
there's a very interesting dynamic that's
hard to understand between constraint

47
00:01:45,121 --> 00:01:46,050
and possibility.

48
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,400
And there's a deep idea that's associated
with that that I read in some Jewish

49
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,470
commentary on,

50
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,070
on the biblical stories that I,

51
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,930
I read a long time ago.

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm talking about the
relationship between God and man.

53
00:01:58,921 --> 00:02:01,680
And the idea was that God,

54
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,331
imagine,

55
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:03,431
uh,

56
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:06,000
being with the classical
attributes of God,

57
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:06,601
omniscience,

58
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:08,250
omnipotence and omnipresence,

59
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,151
all seeing,

60
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,560
all knowing and all powerful.

61
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,600
What is it being like that lack,

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,940
and obviously the answer is nothing,

63
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:15,241
right?

64
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:20,241
Because by definition those three traits
provide for absence of limitation.

65
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:24,540
But then that's exactly
what's lacking is limitation.

66
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:28,350
And there's some strange
connection between limitation.

67
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,620
And I was saying say limitation
that that's rule governed
as I mentioned before,

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,850
and the opening up of possibility.

69
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:41,270
So it isn't necessarily the case that
now determine determinism and limitation

70
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,600
aren't exactly the same thing,

71
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:44,910
but they're analogous than they
need to be discussed together.

72
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:45,451
Okay,

73
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,140
so now,

74
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:47,940
so that's the first thing is that our,

75
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,260
whatever our free choice is,

76
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,190
it isn't limited.

77
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,470
It's limited,

78
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,880
it's deeply limited.

79
00:02:53,881 --> 00:02:55,260
Now here's another thing.

80
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,170
If I take my arm and I go like this,

81
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,470
see,

82
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,303
I'll do that again.

83
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,500
Now you see there's a movement like that
and then my hands stopped just before

84
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,130
my,

85
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,030
my other hand.

86
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,010
Now it takes a certain amount of time
for the neural messages to go from my

87
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:17,011
brain to my arm and back and the time it
takes my hand to go like this and stop

88
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,760
is actually shorter than the time it
takes a message to get to my brain.

89
00:03:21,761 --> 00:03:22,540
And back.

90
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,190
So what that means is that when I,

91
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,590
when I planned this movement,

92
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,330
which is called a ballistic movement,

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,610
it's called a ballistic movement
because it's like a bullet.

94
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,660
Once you let it go,

95
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:32,200
it's gone.

96
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,250
There's no calling back.

97
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,230
I've actually organized the neurological
and muscular sequences that enable that

98
00:03:38,231 --> 00:03:40,540
action before it's implemented.

99
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,980
I set all that up and then it's
released and the whole thing cascades.

100
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,300
And so once the action has been released,

101
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:50,134
let's say,

102
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,830
then I don't really have any free
will because I can't stop it now.

103
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,460
So,

104
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,720
so you think about that,

105
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,640
it looks like there's a temporal
gradient with regards to freewill.

106
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,660
Is that as you look out into the future
meet perhaps the farther out you look

107
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:04,510
into the future?

108
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:05,830
Um,

109
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,970
the farther down the road,

110
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:07,804
let's say,

111
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,030
the more free your choices are,

112
00:04:10,031 --> 00:04:12,010
but the closer they get to implementation,

113
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:17,011
the more they become deterministic
governed by standard cause a processes.

114
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:22,060
And there's some transition point where
they change from being what we would

115
00:04:22,061 --> 00:04:24,790
describe as choice that we
haven't got to free choice yet,

116
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:25,810
but at least to choice.

117
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:29,110
There's some transition point
between now and ballistic movement.

118
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,610
Here's another way of thinking about it.

119
00:04:30,611 --> 00:04:31,720
Like we know for example,

120
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:36,130
that people who are expert at playing
the piano look ahead of where they're

121
00:04:36,131 --> 00:04:38,320
playing and,

122
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,760
and they're doing the same thing.

123
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:40,810
They're watching the notes,

124
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:42,190
they're seeing where they're going,

125
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,920
but and then their disinhibiting,

126
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:49,180
the automated structures that enabled
them to play what they've practiced so

127
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:49,870
thoroughly.

128
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,980
They're disinhibited.

129
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,910
Those structures,

130
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,780
and then they go automatically and then
what happens if you make a mistake is

131
00:04:55,781 --> 00:05:00,781
that consciousness notes the error and
then unpacks the motor sequences that

132
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:02,740
have been practiced and then you read,

133
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:05,770
practice them and sequenced them
again until they become automatic and

134
00:05:05,771 --> 00:05:06,610
deterministic.

135
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,800
So there's choice in that.

136
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:10,150
You're reading ahead,

137
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,710
but there's no choice in that.

138
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:14,170
Once you've read ahead and
disinhibited the actions,

139
00:05:14,171 --> 00:05:17,650
then they run ballistically and then you
can think about the same thing that's

140
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,330
happening when you're driving in a car.

141
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,740
You don't look right in front of you when
you're driving a car because whatever

142
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,670
is right in front of you,

143
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:26,020
if you're going 40 miles an hour,

144
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,850
whatever you've already run over,

145
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,490
you look a quarter of
a mile down the road.

146
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:33,490
And that gives you the
opportunity to see what's coming.

147
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,880
And to set up a sequence of increasingly
automated movements that culminate in

148
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,080
whatever it is that you're
doing while you're driving.

149
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,980
And so there's a gradation
from choice to determinism,

150
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,450
a temporal gradation.

151
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,150
And,

152
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,760
and I,

153
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:52,760
I don't often see that addressed when
people talk about will and now Sam's issue

154
00:05:53,021 --> 00:05:58,021
with freewill is that if you get someone
to do something like lift their finger

155
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,560
and you,

156
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,950
and you scan their brains using a
variety of techniques while they're doing

157
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:04,430
that,

158
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:08,900
what you'll see is that there's an action
potential that emerge and you ask them

159
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,270
to voluntarily move their fingers.

160
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,103
So they're doing it,

161
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,440
let's say by free choice,

162
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,290
there's an action potential that you can,

163
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:20,270
that you can read off the
brain that occurs before the
person either moves their

164
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:23,090
finger or let's say decides
to move their finger.

165
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:28,190
And that occurs quite a bit before the
feeling of volunteerism or that voluntary

166
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:28,521
act.

167
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:32,360
And so that's been read by Benjamin
Libet who did the experiments,

168
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,530
um,

169
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:38,000
as indication that even the feeling
of voluntary choices determined.

170
00:06:38,001 --> 00:06:43,001
But I don't think that that's a very
useful way of addressing the issue because

171
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,050
the issue of when you lift your finger
up again is it requires pre-programming

172
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,621
to disinhibit.

173
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,970
Like you know how to do this right.

174
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,740
You don't have to learn to do that.

175
00:06:54,741 --> 00:06:57,410
So you have a little automated
circuit that does this sort of thing.

176
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,090
All these finger movements and everything,

177
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:02,780
you can see babies practicing them and
they develop automated circuitry that

178
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:07,250
tends to be posterior left
hemisphere in order to run those,

179
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,960
those automated processes out.

180
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,580
And what you're basically doing when you
decide to do something that's a routine

181
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:15,080
that you've already practiced or,

182
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,440
or made out of sub routines that you've
already practiced is disinhibiting them.

183
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,130
And the,

184
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,790
the degree to which you
might regard that as free.

185
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,150
Exactly is unclear as are
the temporal limitations.

186
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,560
So I don't think that Liberty's
experiments demonstrate conclusively that

187
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:31,970
there's no such thing as free will,

188
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:35,990
even though there are action potentials
that indicate that there is brain

189
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:37,220
activity signaling,

190
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,290
even the onset of a voluntary choice,

191
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,393
um,

192
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,530
voluntary choice early.

193
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,263
Now.

194
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,110
Um,

195
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,470
another thing that we might look
at in relationship to that is,

196
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,363
um,

197
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,443
yeah,

198
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:54,710
so we can look at it phenomenologically
and we could also look at it in,

199
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:55,280
in,

200
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,500
in relationship to how
people treat one another.

201
00:07:57,501 --> 00:08:02,501
So phenomenologically it seems clear
that we have free choice and it isn't

202
00:08:02,661 --> 00:08:06,620
obvious to me why we have consciousness
if free choice isn't real because

203
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:11,300
consciousness looks to me like a mechanism
that deals with potential before it's

204
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:13,010
transformed into actuality,

205
00:08:13,011 --> 00:08:13,844
let's say.

206
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,380
And I think consciousness
is also that the faculty,

207
00:08:18,381 --> 00:08:19,161
so to speak,

208
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:23,870
or a manifestation of the faculty that
enables us to preprogram deterministic

209
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:24,470
actions.

210
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:24,951
So again,

211
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:26,600
let's think about someone
playing the piano.

212
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,830
They're practicing,

213
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,161
you know,

214
00:08:28,161 --> 00:08:30,840
after you repeat and you repeat your,

215
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:32,540
your finger movements if
you're playing the piano,

216
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,250
any complex motor skill is like that.

217
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:36,440
You have to repeat it and repeat
it and repeat it and repeat it.

218
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,500
And you're using
consciousness to program it,

219
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:42,530
to sequence the motor movements
and to pay attention to them.

220
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,910
That all seems voluntary and it involves
the activation of a tremendous amount

221
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:48,860
of your brain because if
you're doing something new,

222
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:52,460
a lot of your brain is activated
and then as you practice it,

223
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,490
the amount of brain that's
activated decreases.

224
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:01,491
It shifts from right to left and then it
shifts from frontal to posterior and a

225
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:03,780
smaller and smaller area.

226
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:07,590
So what's happening is that consciousness
is creating little machines in the

227
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:10,650
back of your head that do
things in an automated manner.

228
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:11,963
And

229
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,960
the the,

230
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:21,850
the volume that consciousness looks like
consciousness appears and feels that

231
00:09:21,851 --> 00:09:25,270
would be the phenomenal logical land as
if it's doing that voluntarily and it is

232
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,850
associated with a different
pattern of brain activity.

233
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,193
And so,

234
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:29,951
okay,

235
00:09:29,951 --> 00:09:30,611
so there's that,

236
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:35,611
there's the long phenomenological
reality of voluntary choice and effort as

237
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:35,951
well.

238
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:38,650
Cause conscious programming of
that sort is also effortful.

239
00:09:38,651 --> 00:09:41,440
It doesn't seem to run
deterministically like a clock does.

240
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,330
And then finally,

241
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,040
there's also,

242
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:49,180
and I don't know what you think
about this with regards to evidence,

243
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:53,500
but what constitutes evidence is not
always that easy to determine even in in

244
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,430
the scientific domain.

245
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,330
So imagine,

246
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,190
think about how we think about ourselves
and other people and how we treat

247
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:01,330
ourselves and other people.

248
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,040
You could imagine that you're like a
clock running down and that's like a

249
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,090
deterministic model,

250
00:10:07,091 --> 00:10:07,781
but people aren't,

251
00:10:07,781 --> 00:10:09,520
clocks were dissipative structures.

252
00:10:09,521 --> 00:10:12,070
A clock is something that runs downhill.

253
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,150
But human beings,

254
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,820
you can look up dissipative structure.

255
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:19,990
I think that was an idea that was first
formulated by the physicist Schrodinger

256
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,813
we,

257
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:23,551
we're,

258
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:23,911
we're,

259
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:24,420
we're not,

260
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,000
we're not clocks by any
stretch of the imagination.

261
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,080
And we take energy in and
we disperse energy and,

262
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:35,220
and we were anti entropic
in an in a temporary sense.

263
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:35,851
So that makes us,

264
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:35,991
and,

265
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:36,421
and so,

266
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:40,020
and life is as well shorting a wrote
about that in a book called what is life?

267
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:41,663
And

268
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,290
yeah,

269
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:45,150
we don't what we seem to do,

270
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,530
this is how it looks to me.

271
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,240
We don't contend with the present
and we're not driven by the past.

272
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,021
Instead,

273
00:10:52,021 --> 00:10:55,680
what we see in front of us is
a landscape of possibility.

274
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,170
And my wilder moments,

275
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:01,590
I think that's associated with the
physical idea of multiple universes.

276
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:03,720
But that's in my wilder moments.

277
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:04,980
It's just a speculation.

278
00:11:05,490 --> 00:11:06,960
And so what we see in front of us is,

279
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:07,350
uh,

280
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,450
an array of potential universes.

281
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,810
And those are the universes that we
could bring about as a consequence of our

282
00:11:12,811 --> 00:11:14,460
actions and it,

283
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,010
and we make choices to
the right or the left.

284
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,880
There's a lot of mythological speculation
about that sort of idea to in an

285
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:21,571
ethical sense,

286
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:25,530
cause we decide what sort of reality
that we want to bring into being.

287
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,800
And so we encounter potential like God
did at the beginning of time when he made

288
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,390
order out of chaos.

289
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,100
Chaos is this chaotic potential.

290
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:38,970
We confront chaotic potential with our
consciousness and we cast that into

291
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:42,570
reality and that now then you think,

292
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:43,260
well,

293
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,550
is that really the case?

294
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,893
Well,

295
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,650
that's hard to say because
there are limits to our
knowledge about consciousness

296
00:11:49,651 --> 00:11:50,401
and about reality.

297
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:55,090
But if you treat yourself like you're
a free moral agent with choice and that

298
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:57,460
you can determine the course of your life,

299
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,540
then you seem to get along better with
yourself and to be less anxious and to be

300
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,374
more productive.

301
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,840
And if you treat other people like that,

302
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:08,380
that they're free agents that are making
voluntary choices about how reality is

303
00:12:08,381 --> 00:12:12,340
going to come into being and you reward
them when they do it properly and you

304
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,383
punish them,

305
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:13,980
uh,

306
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,330
or otherwise discipline
them when they don't,

307
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,410
when they do it badly,

308
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,680
then your relationships
with them seem to work.

309
00:12:20,681 --> 00:12:25,681
And then if we predicate our society on
the presupposition that each individual

310
00:12:26,381 --> 00:12:28,780
human being is capable of doing just that,

311
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:31,720
then we seem to have extremely
functional societies.

312
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,830
And so,

313
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,520
and this is something that Sam Harris
has been taken to task for many times,

314
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:39,070
is if you dispense with
the idea of free will,

315
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,000
how is it you organize your
relationship to yourself,

316
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,600
your interactions with your family and
your relationships with the broader

317
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:47,830
social community?

318
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,360
It's a very complicated issue.

319
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,720
So I believe strongly
that we have freewill,

320
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:56,800
that we're responsible for our choices.

321
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,170
Those choices are constrained in many,

322
00:12:59,171 --> 00:13:00,004
many ways.

323
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:05,340
I think there's a gradient of freewill
from free out into the future to

324
00:13:05,981 --> 00:13:10,570
increasingly constrained as the present
manifest itself to deterministic in the

325
00:13:10,571 --> 00:13:11,380
moment when,

326
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:14,290
when in the moment of action we,

327
00:13:14,291 --> 00:13:18,280
and you might think that we entered the
realm of deterministic causality at the

328
00:13:18,281 --> 00:13:19,061
moment of action,

329
00:13:19,061 --> 00:13:19,900
something like that.

330
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,400
That's how it looks to me.

331
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,773
So.

332
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:23,530
Well,

333
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:24,910
so at this rate,

334
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:26,790
we're going to answer about
five questions so that,

335
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,551
but that was a very,

336
00:13:27,551 --> 00:13:28,241
very hard one.

337
00:13:28,241 --> 00:13:29,080
So anyways,

338
00:13:29,081 --> 00:13:30,070
I hope that's helpful.
