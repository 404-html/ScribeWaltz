1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:07,793
Well,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,320
you know,

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,900
one of the things that,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:15,080
that people have pointed out over
the last year is that I'm better,

5
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:20,110
let's say when I'm less angry and some
of that is poor health am I helped,

6
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:22,124
has been,

7
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,040
I've had periods of very
bad health in the last year,

8
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,390
like dreadfully bad for,

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,470
for months on end.

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,320
And although that seems
to have resolved itself,

11
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,154
thank God,

12
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,320
knock on wood and all of that,

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:34,490
um,

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:39,490
I do know that you're not a master of
a serious topic until you can handle it

15
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:40,270
with play,

16
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:44,450
the fullness and lightness and that
that goes for even the most serious of

17
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:44,961
topics.

18
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:49,961
And so one of the things that I would
hope is that I can keep my head more

19
00:00:49,971 --> 00:00:54,971
effectively in the next year and let
some of this roll off my back and not

20
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:56,480
respond quite.

21
00:00:56,481 --> 00:00:57,314
So.

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:01,070
What would you say fit viciously?

23
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:01,904
Maybe.

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:02,983
Maybe that's it.

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:03,471
You know,

26
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:03,651
there's,

27
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:05,630
there's common English common law rule,

28
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,430
which I write about in 12 rules of life,

29
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:10,520
which is that you're not supposed
to respond with any more forced than

30
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:11,354
necessary.

31
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:15,050
And I think that there have been times
in the last year that I've responded with

32
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:16,670
more force than was necessary.

33
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,230
It wasn't easy to tell,

34
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:18,590
you know,

35
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:22,190
because sometimes the forces that were
brought them to bear on me seem quite

36
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,923
intimidating,

37
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,910
but it's,

38
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,570
it's an art to respond judiciously.

39
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:33,350
And so hopefully I can learn how to
do that better in the upcoming year.

40
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,140
But tabbing lived,

41
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:35,591
breathed,

42
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:38,980
and worked with a feminist
and radical leftist Marxists,

43
00:01:38,981 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm telling you,

44
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,780
being mellow and calm
with them doesn't work.

45
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,520
And they're almost like,

46
00:01:45,521 --> 00:01:46,420
um,

47
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,961
what am I going to say?

48
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:49,090
A pack of wolves at times
the way they attack.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,151
Well,

50
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:50,871
that's the thing,

51
00:01:50,871 --> 00:01:51,041
it's,

52
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:51,741
it's harder.

53
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:56,741
It's harder under conditions of mob
attack to remain cool and to remain and to

54
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:58,160
retain your head.

55
00:01:58,161 --> 00:01:59,030
But you know,

56
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,410
when I was at McMaster,

57
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,060
which was probably the most

58
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:08,270
extreme demonstration against me,

59
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,800
I was able to stay calm
and that really was useful.

60
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,210
It was unbelievably useful.

61
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,650
It was the right way to handle that.

62
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:17,450
And so I just have to,

63
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:18,981
well,

64
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,380
in not being ill helps a
lot too because you know,

65
00:02:21,381 --> 00:02:22,640
if your health is compromised,

66
00:02:22,641 --> 00:02:24,140
it's a lot more,

67
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,380
it's a lot easier to be touchy and,

68
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,260
and also to make errors in judgment.

69
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,830
And so hopefully I'll be back
on both feet for the next year.

70
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:42,500
That would be a good thing and won't
be inclined to make errors because of

71
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:43,334
fatigue or,

72
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,330
or,

73
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,163
uh,

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,100
will you be tweeting from Europe then
putting up your videos for all of us who

75
00:02:49,101 --> 00:02:52,880
will miss you so much here and we want
to keep up to date on what you're doing

76
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,780
and what you're working on.

77
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,200
I want to stay on top of my youtube
channel and the podcasts and all of that,

78
00:02:58,201 --> 00:02:59,790
so I'll definitely be doing that.

79
00:02:59,791 --> 00:03:00,060
So.
