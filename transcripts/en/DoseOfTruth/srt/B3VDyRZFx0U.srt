1
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,690
So here's,

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,880
here's part of the issue.

3
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:11,800
So let's say that you're,

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:13,180
you have a computer.

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,763
Yeah,

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,630
I have a story for this.

7
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,523
So,

8
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,783
um,

9
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,010
one time when I was in Montreal,

10
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:22,330
I was using my computer,

11
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,790
it's in my apartment and I was
typing out an essay and it crashed.

12
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:32,710
And so what happens when
your computer crashes?

13
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:32,981
Well,

14
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:33,251
you know,

15
00:00:33,251 --> 00:00:35,500
usually you add here some sort of curse.

16
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:40,840
And it's interesting that you do that
because the circuit that you use to curse

17
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:45,841
with is the same circuit that monkeys
used to detect eagles or leopards or

18
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:46,924
snakes.

19
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,400
And so when,

20
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:50,050
when there's a bunch of monkeys together,

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,591
you know,

22
00:00:50,591 --> 00:00:52,990
they're not all preyed on by
eagles and leopards and snakes,

23
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:53,950
but you know,

24
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:56,950
there's usually you have Predator in
that category for every single monkey

25
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:57,641
population.

26
00:00:57,641 --> 00:00:59,230
And so when the monkeys are watching,

27
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,240
they have an,

28
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,020
an emotional adherents that the most
nervous monkey might utter first that

29
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:05,950
basically says,

30
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:06,610
you know,

31
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,750
hide from the Eagle,

32
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:11,560
get out on the thin branch so the cougar
can't eat you and look the hell out for

33
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:12,394
the snake.

34
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,780
But there's a circuit that's linked to
emotions that produces that instinct,

35
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:19,150
instinctive audience that
represents that category.

36
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,050
And that's the same circuit
that you use when you curse.

37
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,620
And it's not the same circuit
that used for normal language.

38
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,890
And we know that because that circuit
is activated and people who have

39
00:01:29,891 --> 00:01:33,190
Tourette's syndrome because
they preferentially swear,

40
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:33,791
you think,

41
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:34,211
well how,

42
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:37,060
why in the world would you have a
neurological condition that makes you

43
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:38,350
preferentially curse?

44
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:41,620
Well that's the reason why you don't
just have one linguistic circuit.

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,120
You have one for,

46
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,961
oh my God,

47
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:48,961
there's a Predator and that's the one
that will get activated when something

48
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:49,871
happens.

49
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:53,530
Like your computer crashing because
you know you're an evolved creature.

50
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:58,531
And so those old circuits that were there
say 30 million years ago to deal with

51
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:02,830
exceptions are the same circuits you're
using now to deal with your computer.

52
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,390
Why else would you want to hit it?

53
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,411
Right?

54
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:07,180
Cause that's what you
want to give it a whack.

55
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:10,870
It's like it doesn't behave
whack aggression right away.

56
00:02:10,871 --> 00:02:13,170
Well that's some clue
as to the categorize,

57
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,480
categorize category system that you're
automatically using to encapsulate the

58
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:19,414
event.

59
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:20,501
Okay,

60
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,340
so fine.

61
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,880
What do you do when your computer crashes?

62
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,081
Well,

63
00:02:23,081 --> 00:02:26,380
first you curse and then you do the
stupid things that idiot primates do when

64
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:30,070
they're trying to deal with something
that's way too complex and maybe you turn

65
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:31,030
it on and off,

66
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,750
right?

67
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,650
And that doesn't work.

68
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:33,221
It didn't work.

69
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:34,001
And so then I thought,

70
00:02:34,001 --> 00:02:34,211
well,

71
00:02:34,211 --> 00:02:35,260
maybe the powerbar went.

72
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:37,390
So I checked the power bar and it,

73
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,560
I turned it on and off
and nothing happened.

74
00:02:39,561 --> 00:02:41,320
And so I brought a light
behind the computer.

75
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:42,230
The light wouldn't go on.

76
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:42,791
And so I thought,

77
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,624
Aha,

78
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:45,190
I must have blown a fuse.

79
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,190
So I went to the fuse box and took a,

80
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,011
took a look,

81
00:02:48,011 --> 00:02:49,360
but the fuses were fine.

82
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,493
And so I thought,

83
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:51,011
oh,

84
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:51,940
the power's gone out.

85
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,400
So then I went outside
and the power was out.

86
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,770
None of the street lights were working,

87
00:02:56,771 --> 00:02:58,120
the power was out everywhere.

88
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,230
And it was seriously,

89
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,500
because this was the time that the almost
the entire northeast power grid in,

90
00:03:04,501 --> 00:03:06,880
in Quebec collapsed.

91
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:10,420
And the reason it collapsed is because
there was a solar flare that happens

92
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,410
reasonably often.

93
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:15,850
And the solar flare produced
a huge electromagnetic
pulse because it's basically

94
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,290
like a billion high million hydrogen
bombs going off at the same time.

95
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,240
93 million miles away,

96
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,360
produces this tremendous
electromagnetic pulse,

97
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,490
passes through the Earth's atmosphere,

98
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:33,070
produces a spike and current in the main
power lines and blows the whole system.

99
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,020
And so just so you know,

100
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,970
assist,

101
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,310
uh,

102
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,020
an event like that happens about
every hundred and 50 years.

103
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,310
And if we had one now,

104
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:44,080
it would take out all of our electronics.

105
00:03:44,081 --> 00:03:44,950
Like one of the big ones.

106
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:46,750
There was a big one back
in the late 18 hundreds.

107
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,351
Everything,

108
00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:47,951
satellites,

109
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:48,521
computers,

110
00:03:48,521 --> 00:03:49,270
cars,

111
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,710
everything gone.

112
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,160
And so that's a big problem and
no one knows what to do about it.

113
00:03:54,161 --> 00:03:56,140
One missed us by about nine minutes,

114
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:56,501
I think,

115
00:03:56,501 --> 00:03:57,340
two years ago.

116
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,573
So,

117
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,420
so that's something else to worry about
if you're inclined to worry about those

118
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,254
sorts of things.

119
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,453
Um,

120
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,211
okay.

121
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:04,611
So what,

122
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:05,920
what did I conclude from that?

123
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:06,754
Well,

124
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,700
the function of my computer was
dependent on the stability of the sun.

125
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,180
It's not the first thing you check
out when your computer crashes,

126
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:16,361
right?

127
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:17,021
You don't run out and go,

128
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:17,560
hey,

129
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,041
well yeah,

130
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,320
the sun's still son's still there.

131
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,211
No problem.

132
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:21,391
In fact,

133
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:22,780
can cross that off the list.

134
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,530
But,

135
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,280
but it,

136
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:24,610
it,

137
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,443
to me,

138
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:30,040
it's an extraordinarily
interesting example of the
invisible interdependence of

139
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:30,550
things,

140
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:30,821
you know,

141
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,560
and our tendency to fragment,

142
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,330
what we seem to do is to look at things
at the simplest level of analysis that

143
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:38,620
actually functions.

144
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,120
So for example,

145
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:41,800
when you're interacting
with your computer,

146
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,980
you're not interacting with
your computer at all really.

147
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:49,630
You're interacting with the keyboard
sort of one key at a time and you're

148
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:52,180
interacting with the
symbols on the screen.

149
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,060
But as long as the computer is working,

150
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,040
you don't care about it at all.

151
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:57,321
You know,

152
00:04:57,321 --> 00:05:01,600
give it a second thought and you certainly
don't care about the fact that it's

153
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,590
dependent on,

154
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:03,570
well,

155
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,110
the electrical power for example,

156
00:05:05,111 --> 00:05:07,000
and the electrical power is dependent on,

157
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,610
you know,

158
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,710
I don't know how many men
are out there right now,

159
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,380
or we're out there last night
when it was freezing rain,

160
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,730
fixing power lines and freezing to death
while they're doing it so that your

161
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:21,370
stupid computer doesn't
malfunction while you're watching.

162
00:05:21,371 --> 00:05:22,240
Cat Videos,

163
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:22,631
you know,

164
00:05:22,631 --> 00:05:27,631
I mean there's this incredibly dynamic
living system that social and economic

165
00:05:28,451 --> 00:05:33,430
and political that has to remain dead
stable in order for us to have access to

166
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:38,670
functional and like pure non fluctuating
electricity 100% of the time.

167
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,650
Cause you also don't think,

168
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,710
well the stability of your computer
is dependent on the stability of the

169
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,491
political system.

170
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:49,450
But of course it is because if the
political system mucks up in the economic

171
00:05:49,451 --> 00:05:50,171
system goes,

172
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:54,550
then people don't go out and work to fix
things and things are breaking all the

173
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:55,384
time.

174
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,590
That's their normal state is broken,

175
00:05:57,591 --> 00:05:57,891
not,

176
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:58,724
not working.

177
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,013
And so,

178
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,640
and that's all in some sense folded
up not only inside your computer but

179
00:06:06,261 --> 00:06:08,630
actually inside your conceptions of,

180
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,860
of the your tiny conceptions
of the computer while
you're using it and you only

181
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:15,320
get a glimpse of what the
computer is really like.

182
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,400
When it doesn't work,

183
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:19,580
then it's when it
becomes a complex object,

184
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:19,761
right.

185
00:06:19,761 --> 00:06:20,930
As long as it's working,

186
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:23,180
then you're stupid.

187
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,010
Perceptions are,

188
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:27,800
are perfectly fine to get the job done.

189
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:32,510
And that's another indication that what
you're using your perceptions for is to

190
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:37,511
get the job done and how you specify
exactly the level of resolution that you

191
00:06:38,181 --> 00:06:39,230
should be operating at.

192
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,810
I haven't sorted that out,

193
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:45,350
but it's something like you default to
the simplest level that moves you to the

194
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,184
next step,

195
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:46,881
you know?

196
00:06:46,881 --> 00:06:47,691
So for example,

197
00:06:47,691 --> 00:06:49,430
and generally that is
what you should do with,

198
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,670
if you're having an argument with someone
that you have a longterm relationship

199
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,504
with,

200
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:57,380
you can start by arguing about what
the little argument is about or you can

201
00:06:57,381 --> 00:07:01,370
immediately cascade into whether or not
you should have a relationship with this

202
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:05,720
person at all or even into whether
or not you should even bother with

203
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,800
relationships,

204
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,143
which is,

205
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:08,691
you know,

206
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:10,040
every time there's an argument,

207
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:14,030
that question is a reasonable
question to have emerged.

208
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:16,760
Or at least it's in the realm of
potential reasonable questions.

209
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:22,030
But it doesn't seem useful to jump to the
most catastrophic possible explanation

210
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,710
every time some minor thing goes wrong.

211
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,260
That's what happens to people
that have an anxiety disorder.

212
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,780
And that's what happens to
people who are depressed,

213
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,081
right?

214
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,120
They can't bind the anomaly.

215
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,590
And so what happens is it
tends to propagate up the
entire system until it takes

216
00:07:36,591 --> 00:07:38,780
out their highest order
conceptualizations.

217
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:39,411
You know?

218
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:41,210
So if you're seriously depressed,

219
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,180
maybe you'll watch a news article about
something stupid and you'll think,

220
00:07:44,181 --> 00:07:44,541
Jesus,

221
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:45,800
why should I even be alive?

222
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:46,451
You know,

223
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:46,691
I'm not,

224
00:07:46,691 --> 00:07:47,990
I'm dead serious about that.

225
00:07:47,991 --> 00:07:51,140
If you score like 60 on the
beck depression inventory,

226
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:53,150
which puts you way the hell
up and the depressed rage,

227
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:58,220
anything that happens to you that's
negative will trigger suicidal thoughts,

228
00:07:58,221 --> 00:07:59,031
roughly speaking.

229
00:07:59,031 --> 00:08:00,770
And sometimes even positive things,

230
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:04,790
we'll do it because there are very few
positive things that happen that don't

231
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:05,624
carry with them.

232
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,300
Some threat of change or transformation.

233
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,610
So you know,

234
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,750
one mystery,

235
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:16,280
it's a big mystery is why don't you fall
into a catastrophic depression every

236
00:08:16,281 --> 00:08:17,840
time something little goes wrong,

237
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,850
because it's not.

238
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,310
That level of analysis
is not self evident.

239
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,400
And you'll see this with people
who are high in neuroticism too.

240
00:08:25,401 --> 00:08:26,234
You know,

241
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:28,310
they're trivial

242
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,060
fluctuations at their workplace or in
their relationships are in their health,

243
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:39,500
will produce a disproportionate
negative emotional response.

244
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:39,890
But it's,

245
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:42,590
it's part of the range of
normal emotional responses.

246
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:43,730
Some people are very,

247
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:44,840
very high in neuroticism,

248
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,130
so everything upsets them.

249
00:08:46,131 --> 00:08:47,360
Some people are very low.

250
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,320
And the reason that whole range exists
is because sometimes you should get upset

251
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:54,650
when some little thing happens to you
because it's an indication that the whole

252
00:08:54,651 --> 00:08:56,580
damn environment has got dangerous on you.

253
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,260
And sometimes you should just
brush it off because you know it's,

254
00:09:00,261 --> 00:09:02,850
it's net consequence is low.

255
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,160
But how do you calculate that?

256
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:05,821
Very,

257
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:06,960
very difficult question.

258
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:08,401
So you know,

259
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,900
when your computer goes wrong,

260
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:14,550
well you have to pick the proper
level of analysis to fix it.

261
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,720
And you could say,

262
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:16,410
well,

263
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,540
there's something wrong with
the circuit board and maybe,

264
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:18,871
you know,

265
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,160
there's a crack in one of the,

266
00:09:20,161 --> 00:09:20,994
uh,

267
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:26,150
and one of the US somewhere
that it's soldered or you know,

268
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,730
sometimes now when people are building

269
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,220
microchips,

270
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,890
they've run into a crazy problem.

271
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,800
No microchips keep getting
smaller and smaller and smaller.

272
00:09:37,801 --> 00:09:37,981
Right.

273
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,300
And so the little wires,

274
00:09:39,301 --> 00:09:42,720
now we're down to atomic
width or you know,

275
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,760
the width of maybe 20 items
or something like that.

276
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:45,361
But really,

277
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:47,280
really they're really getting thin.

278
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,460
And so that produces another problem,

279
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,590
which no one would have ever.

280
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,370
No,

281
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:53,581
no,

282
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:54,690
you wouldn't expect.

283
00:09:54,691 --> 00:09:55,111
And that is,

284
00:09:55,111 --> 00:10:00,030
you know that at the quantum level
there's uncertainty about where electrons

285
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:01,750
might be normally out,

286
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,593
doesn't matter.

287
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,630
The degree of uncertainty about where
your electrons are is small enough at your

288
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:08,520
size so that it's basically irrelevant.

289
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:12,510
But down at the subatomic level where
these microchips are starting to be

290
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,290
produced,

291
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:15,810
sometimes the electrons
will be outside the wires.

292
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,930
And that means that they're getting
Sadam small that they'll short circuit by

293
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:22,380
themselves because the electrons aren't
stable enough to be where they're

294
00:10:22,381 --> 00:10:23,610
supposed to be in the wires.

295
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:24,903
And so,

296
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,500
well the reason I'm pointing that out
is because a problem that exists in the

297
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:34,650
system can exist at any of the
multiple levels of that system.

298
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,540
And it isn't obvious where to start.

299
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,040
And a lot of political arguments are,

300
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,880
are like that.

301
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,630
You know,

302
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:44,610
it's like maybe a company goes
bankrupt and its shareholders get,

303
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,240
maybe a bank fails and so people
can't withdraw their money.

304
00:10:48,241 --> 00:10:49,780
And one response is,

305
00:10:49,781 --> 00:10:52,620
well that just shows you how
rotten the capitalist system is.

306
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,430
It's like,

307
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,770
well maybe that is what it shows.

308
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,260
But it seems there's,

309
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,860
it seems like that might not be the
most appropriate level to start.

310
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,241
And so again,

311
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:03,421
it's,

312
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:05,880
it's like Ockham's razor
in the scientific world,

313
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,660
right?

314
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:11,580
You want to use the simplest explanation
that it's not that fits the facts

315
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,250
because you don't organize
your perceptions by facts.

316
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,820
It's kind of like you want to use the
simplest tool you can possibly manage to

317
00:11:17,821 --> 00:11:19,830
fix the problem so you don't,

318
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,750
when your car has a flat tire,

319
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:22,890
you don't buy a new car,

320
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,580
you fix the flat tire if you
can figure out how to do it.

321
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:28,280
And so you go for the salon,

322
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,330
the thing that will put the tool back
together with the minimum involvement of

323
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,223
time and effort.

324
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,220
It's something like that.

325
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:40,050
And you care about that because you
have limited time and you have limited

326
00:11:40,051 --> 00:11:44,880
resources and so it makes
sense for you to conserve them.

327
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,010
And I'm telling you that
partly for practical reasons
too because this is a very

328
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:51,000
useful thing to know.

329
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,800
If you're arguing with someone,

330
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,040
you want to argue about the smallest
possible thing that you could argue about

331
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,240
that might fix the problem.

332
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,490
You want to really specify it.

333
00:12:00,491 --> 00:12:05,491
It's like what's going on at a micro
level and what's the minimum that I would

334
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,930
require to be satisfied with outcome?

335
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,580
And if you're,

336
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,160
this is especially true
in intimate relationships,

337
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:15,520
it's like if someone's bugging
you and you want them to change,

338
00:12:15,521 --> 00:12:15,941
you think,

339
00:12:15,941 --> 00:12:18,250
well how can I be
minimally bothered by this?

340
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:23,350
And what's the tiniest amount of change
I could request that might satisfy me?

341
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,770
Because otherwise the
argument will come unglued.

342
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,380
And every time you guys
try to discuss a problem,

343
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,620
you'll start talking about whether you
should even be together and then you're

344
00:12:32,621 --> 00:12:33,010
done.

345
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,180
Cause you'll never solve a problem and
then you won't be together cause you'll

346
00:12:36,181 --> 00:12:37,180
never solve a problem.
