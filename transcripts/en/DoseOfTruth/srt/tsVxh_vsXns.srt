1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:07,700
People generally assume,

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:12,770
here's the thing that I could do this
risk and the baseline they compare that to

3
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:13,670
is no risk.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,810
But that's wrong.

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,793
Always.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,470
It's risky or risky.

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,980
It's the risk of doing something versus
the risk of not doing something or if

8
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,540
the risk of doing this instead of this,

9
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,890
it's like risk is everywhere.

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:29,780
So do people make foolish
risks while sometimes,

11
00:00:29,781 --> 00:00:34,781
obviously it's foolish to go play slot
machine because the bloody thing is

12
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:35,840
stacked against you.

13
00:00:35,841 --> 00:00:37,280
So on average you're going to lose.

14
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:40,430
But you can't tell that to the
person who just won the jackpot.

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,850
Well the gamble partly because it's fun,

16
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:45,441
you know,

17
00:00:45,441 --> 00:00:46,270
like,

18
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:51,270
and I mean that technically most of the
neurochemicals that your brain producers

19
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:57,020
that are associated with the kind
of pleasure that people really like,

20
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,000
which is like for example,

21
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:03,680
the kind of pleasure that drugs like
cocaine produce are produced by um,

22
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,910
risky,

23
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:05,600
hi,

24
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,660
risky behavior that has the
potential for high return.

25
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,430
We liked that sort of thing.

26
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:15,530
And people are wired so that they're
more responsive to the probability of

27
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,290
something good happening
then even to the good thing.

28
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:19,341
So,

29
00:01:19,341 --> 00:01:19,911
for example,

30
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:21,470
we know that if people win the lottery,

31
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:22,161
I'll be here later.

32
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:23,510
They're about the same as they were,

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:24,591
no better,

34
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:25,424
no worse.

35
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:31,030
So actually winning all that money
has a limited longterm impact on their

36
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:31,801
happiness.

37
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:34,520
That's probably more determined
by their tray temperament,

38
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:37,250
but the lead up to the good event,

39
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,480
that's the exciting part.

40
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:39,380
It might happen.

41
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,214
It might happen.

42
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,330
That's excitement.

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,300
And that's produced by like gambling.

44
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:44,931
What produced that?

45
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:46,190
Especially for some people,

46
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,040
because some people are really
susceptible to that kind of reward.

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,980
Everyone susceptible to it to some degree,

48
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:55,070
and that can be manipulated and
that's what a slot machines do.

49
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:00,290
Like slot machines manipulate the human
propensity to engage in a certain kind

50
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:01,310
of gambling behavior.

51
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,170
And why do people gamble?

52
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:09,040
Sometimes taking a risk really pays off
and not taking a risk is also a risk.

53
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,880
So there's no way out of risk.

54
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,740
It's to gamble one way or another.
