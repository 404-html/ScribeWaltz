1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,350
Great.

2
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:00,950
Okay,

3
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:02,840
so the question is,

4
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,200
what do you mean by in forced monogamy?

5
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:06,951
Well,

6
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:07,910
we could start by what?

7
00:00:07,911 --> 00:00:08,900
I don't mean.

8
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:14,320
I don't mean taking innocent women at
gunpoint and handing them over to useless

9
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,224
men,

10
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:18,170
which is essentially the accusation.

11
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:19,220
You know,

12
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,380
it was really interesting
to watch that on full.

13
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:25,410
What I meant was that monogamy as,

14
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:25,780
as,

15
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,590
as something that's socially,

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:29,150
uh,

17
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:30,020
value is,

18
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:33,080
it appears to be essentially
a human universal.

19
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,500
That doesn't mean that human beings are
universally monogamous because obviously

20
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,291
we're not,

21
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:43,310
we could be serially monogamous and some
people are players and have multiple

22
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:44,240
partners and all of that,

23
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:49,241
but there's a strong proclivity across
no societies to tilt towards monogamy.

24
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,420
And the enforcement is social norms.

25
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,081
It's like,

26
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:57,171
well,

27
00:00:57,171 --> 00:00:57,891
think about it.

28
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,190
It's,

29
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:00,320
I can't believe that I
even have to say this.

30
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,490
Your son just gets married
and he comes home and he says,

31
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,630
Guess What Dad?

32
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:07,430
I've been screwing around.

33
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,361
And what do you do with you?

34
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,920
Pat Them on the head when you say,

35
00:01:09,921 --> 00:01:10,251
hey,

36
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:11,084
good work kid.

37
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:11,720
That's,

38
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,080
that's my young man.

39
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:14,630
Well,

40
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,463
no,

41
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,210
you're not happy about that.

42
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:20,120
And he doesn't tell you because he knows
you're not going to be happy about it

43
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,490
and that's in forest monogamy.

44
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,050
It's part of the social structure.

45
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,950
It's like what and what else is enforced?

46
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,551
Monogamy.

47
00:01:26,551 --> 00:01:26,901
It's like,

48
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:27,061
well,

49
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:31,250
most people want a monogamous relationship
and if they enter into a relationship

50
00:01:31,251 --> 00:01:31,670
with someone,

51
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:34,760
they're not happy if that
person goes and sleeps around.

52
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,150
Right.

53
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:35,831
Most of you do.

54
00:01:35,831 --> 00:01:37,280
You wouldn't be happy if that happened.

55
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,410
It's like not being happy.

56
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,900
That's part of enforced monogamy.

57
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,003
It's part of this.

58
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,340
No,

59
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,540
and you might've noticed,

60
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:45,350
you probably did.

61
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:47,870
Polygamy is actually illegal.

62
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,180
You can't have multiple America partners,

63
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,120
similar caneously that's
enforced monogamy.

64
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:54,140
That's like in,

65
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,980
and it's an anthropological term.

66
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,210
It's been known for a hundred
years by anthropologists,

67
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,400
most of whom are left bleeding by the way,

68
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:02,750
because that's how it goes.

69
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:08,860
Monogamous social structures are one
of the ways that you keep children

70
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,780
raised properly so that they have a
relatively stable environment and that you

71
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,520
keep male aggression,

72
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:20,870
especially the aggression of young men
under some degree of social control.

73
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,800
It's not a mystery in the fact
that I got in trouble for that.

74
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:24,931
It's,

75
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:26,120
it's kind of a miracle.

76
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:26,954
It's like,

77
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:32,990
don't you notice that we enforce
monogamy in like almost every way?

78
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,570
And that the same thing happens all
over the world in all sorts of diverse

79
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:39,404
societies.

80
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,360
And then when we deviate from that,

81
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:44,990
that there's a price to be paid so and so.

82
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:49,991
That's why like I'm a New York Times
pariah is because I think that monogamy,

83
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,660
all things considered is a good idea.

84
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
[inaudible].
