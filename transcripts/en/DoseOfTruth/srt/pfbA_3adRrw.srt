1
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,283
Huh?

2
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,250
The best round of applause
I've ever gotten in my life.

3
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,551
You guys know,

4
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:30,420
not Jordan Peterson,

5
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:31,254
right?

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,090
I know he jacked the beard and now
everybody's getting has been very nimble.

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:37,871
Wow.

8
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,460
This is incredibly exciting.

9
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:44,490
This is the beginning of the 12 rules
tour and you guys are out here to discuss

10
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:45,521
ideas.

11
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:46,354
Giving yourselves around it.

12
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:47,910
Whoa.

13
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,191
Really awesome.

14
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:55,371
I mean,

15
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:56,570
we're kicking this thing off.

16
00:00:56,571 --> 00:00:58,490
I'm joining Jordan on the tour.

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:58,940
I mean,

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,340
really look around for a second.

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,320
Like the world is upside down and you
guys are here because you want some

20
00:01:03,321 --> 00:01:05,450
answers that that is incredible.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,433
I actually

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,370
right one prisons with me.

23
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:09,204
That's what I like.

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,333
I liked the idea that,

25
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:12,871
what about you guys?

26
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:13,110
No,

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,590
no,

28
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,760
I agree with that.

29
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:15,900
You agree with that?

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:17,333
Ladies and gentlemen,

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,010
you preempted a joke.

32
00:01:23,011 --> 00:01:24,090
I was going to do in two minutes,

33
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:24,924
but I think that works.

34
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,823
Yeah.

35
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:29,120
Jordan wanted Kathy to open,

36
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:29,954
but uh,

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,970
so I just had dinner with Jordan.

38
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,350
He's incredibly excited for this and
kicking this thing off at the beacon,

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,930
this incredible place.

40
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,490
Uh,

41
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,360
everybody that was there,

42
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,260
all the agents were there.

43
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:41,411
The,

44
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:42,310
the book be boy,

45
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:43,270
they're the managers.

46
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:43,840
Everybody.

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,300
Everyone had steak.

48
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:45,610
Uh,

49
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:46,630
Jordan had lobster.

50
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,863
Yeah,

51
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,090
he actually made eat the lobster.

52
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:57,850
He just beat it relentlessly.

53
00:01:59,370 --> 00:01:59,690
Yes.

54
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:02,410
With a mallet over and over.

55
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,760
Who's your daddy?

56
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:09,920
Israeli.

57
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,050
It's,

58
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,420
I can see how many of you guys saw my,

59
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:11,600
uh,

60
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,500
my sit down with,

61
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:12,830
uh,

62
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,700
with Dr. Peterson.

63
00:02:13,701 --> 00:02:14,534
And eventually,

64
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:22,191
you know,

65
00:02:22,191 --> 00:02:23,780
it's funny because Jordan's got this,

66
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,490
this thing about the lobsters of course,

67
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:26,510
that you guys all know about.

68
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,700
Ben Is an Orthodox Jew.

69
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,420
So literally for like an
hour in the green room,

70
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:33,951
Ben was like,

71
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:36,190
could you just switch it
to fulfill the vision plan?

72
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:38,701
Okay.

73
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:40,050
Now I know how many Jews are in the crowd.

74
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:40,380
Very good.

75
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,213
Z.

76
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,320
Very good.

77
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,840
How many of you self identify
as lobsters by the way?

78
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:46,830
It's very important.

79
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:49,870
Oh,

80
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,580
we got a lobster claw look at,

81
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,830
I was walking around with stuff.

82
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:54,611
Lots of these people.

83
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:55,570
Are we making a difference?

84
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,413
You see my point

85
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,620
there really is very,

86
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,180
something amazing happening here.

87
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:01,341
I,

88
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:02,240
I love it.

89
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:02,591
You know,

90
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:02,981
it's funny,

91
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:04,180
I actually,

92
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,700
and I think probably
similar to many of you guys,

93
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,740
I didn't know who Jordan was until about
a year and a half ago and he was last

94
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,280
October actually,

95
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,700
right?

96
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,900
And suddenly,

97
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:15,550
I'm sure for some of you
guys that were doing it,

98
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,810
people started tweeting at me,

99
00:03:16,811 --> 00:03:16,961
you know,

100
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:17,771
you gotta talk to,

101
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:20,410
this is Jordan Peterson guy up in Toronto.

102
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:21,880
You gotta talk to this guy.

103
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,170
And we had him on my show and it was,

104
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:24,850
we were building out our studio.

105
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,210
So we did a Google hangout and the
connection wasn't great because we didn't

106
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:29,380
have great internet yet.

107
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:29,720
And I'm,

108
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm doing this Google
hangout with this guy.

109
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:34,810
And I really was just learning
about him as I was talking to him.

110
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,650
And here's this guy crying over Pinocchio.

111
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:41,890
Sure.

112
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:42,551
Lion King.

113
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,390
That makes sense to me.

114
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:45,160
A little mermaid seeing I was hysterical,

115
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:47,340
but crying over Pinocchio.

116
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:47,600
Well,

117
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,610
what is going on here?

118
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,540
What is this?

119
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,770
What is this thing?

120
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,200
And I got to tell you guys had,

121
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,080
in the last year,

122
00:03:53,081 --> 00:03:55,630
I have truly learned what this thing is,

123
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:55,900
this,

124
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,330
this guy is at the forefront.

125
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,500
I think of what all the
right ideas are right there.

126
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:03,670
There are a lot of bad ideas out there.

127
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,010
Right.

128
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,310
Can plug good ideas.

129
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:12,930
And that's right.

130
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:13,270
Where's the,

131
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,940
where's the girl that I
was tweeting with before?

132
00:04:14,941 --> 00:04:15,720
By the way,

133
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,010
I had that you deleted the tweet.

134
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:17,844
Where are you?

135
00:04:18,650 --> 00:04:19,470
Very,

136
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:19,650
Yo.

137
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:20,400
What up her clothing?

138
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,910
She made a mistake with Twitter and then
I tweeted her and she deleted it and

139
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:24,744
she's going through a line.

140
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,363
Oh yeah.

141
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,403
It goes down here.

142
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,520
I'll go back to China.

143
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,490
If anyone should be building a wall.

144
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:35,440
It's Canada and frankly,

145
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:35,740
yeah.

146
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,573
Okay.

147
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:39,971
Yeah.

148
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:41,380
The Canadians are down or that,

149
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,263
uh,

150
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:42,910
yeah,

151
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:44,140
like Trudeau could build anything

152
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,130
with Jordan.

153
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,061
He started,

154
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:54,211
you know,

155
00:04:54,211 --> 00:04:55,860
there was this whole
issue about the pronouns,

156
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:56,550
right?

157
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:58,410
That Jordan basically said,

158
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,440
I am a free man of my own free will and
free mind and the government cannot tell

159
00:05:03,631 --> 00:05:05,130
me what pronouns to use.

160
00:05:05,131 --> 00:05:07,050
That doesn't mean I dislike.

161
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,593
Ooh,

162
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,071
yeah,

163
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:14,580
you got it.

164
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,620
You fully realized that
this is a live show.

165
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,513
I like that.

166
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,511
No tape delay.

167
00:05:18,511 --> 00:05:19,321
Your applaud.

168
00:05:19,321 --> 00:05:19,891
Go crazy.

169
00:05:19,891 --> 00:05:21,570
You can scream whatever you want to do.

170
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,281
Thank you,

171
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:24,114
sir.

172
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,643
Thank you very much.

173
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,610
My parents are here.

174
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,473
This is this.

175
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,510
What'd I tell your mom?

176
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:32,971
Good night.

177
00:05:32,971 --> 00:05:33,291
You too.

178
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:33,421
Look,

179
00:05:33,421 --> 00:05:34,254
it's going to work out

180
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,153
okay.

181
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,810
But really old Jordan wanted to do is
the exact same thing that any of us want

182
00:05:41,811 --> 00:05:42,021
to do,

183
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:43,370
which is exercise our mind.

184
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,560
Be able to think the way we think,

185
00:05:45,561 --> 00:05:47,630
be able to speak the way we speak,

186
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,200
uh,

187
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:48,490
and,

188
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:51,200
and to understand what
the issues of the day are.

189
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,540
And since then in this last year,

190
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:53,931
I mean,

191
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:55,220
I can go down the list of,

192
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:56,570
of the people that you know,

193
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,500
Eric,

194
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,790
who I'm sure maybe you guys know,

195
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,150
uh,

196
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,811
coined this phrase,

197
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:04,160
the intellectual dark web and there is
something happening and you guys are part

198
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:04,460
of it.

199
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:04,820
That's,

200
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,760
that's the beauty of it.

201
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,070
You guys are part of it.

202
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,110
But this guy right here,

203
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:12,681
he really,

204
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,321
I think is,

205
00:06:13,321 --> 00:06:14,360
is the center of it.

206
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:14,691
I mean,

207
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:15,524
this guy's got,

208
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,450
I think it's the number
one book in the world.

209
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,284
I mean Bible.

210
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,293
Ooh.

211
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,223
Yep.

212
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,990
I don't want to say something else.

213
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:23,171
You know,

214
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:26,470
a lot of people ask me what I do
college gigs or I'm out on the street or

215
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:26,711
whatever.

216
00:06:26,711 --> 00:06:30,280
People will ask me about Jordan and they
always asked me what does he get the

217
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:31,114
same,

218
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,780
you know,

219
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,530
off camera.

220
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,161
Is He the same?

221
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:34,060
And I got to tell you guys,

222
00:06:34,061 --> 00:06:36,340
I know Jordan pretty well now and it had,

223
00:06:36,341 --> 00:06:40,450
it's been an honor and a pleasure getting
to know him and he truly is the same.

224
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,630
He talks as fast when he's off camera,

225
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,030
he moves his hands possibly
even more when we're together,

226
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,610
Andy and he cares about this
stuff and he is living this stuff.

227
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,623
And you know what,

228
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,770
just in the last couple of weeks,

229
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,160
how many you guys saw all these
ridiculous hit pieces about Jordan?

230
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,460
Just last couple of

231
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,770
people just tell her all right.

232
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:07,740
Like just these endlessly hysterical,

233
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,730
dishonest.

234
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:12,180
I mean the phrase that I've been using
is that these people are activists,

235
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,240
not journalist.

236
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,940
And I was really trying to think,

237
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:15,600
it's like,

238
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
well for years,

239
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:17,340
these last two years,

240
00:07:17,341 --> 00:07:19,860
this guy has caught fire and it's like,

241
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:20,071
where,

242
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:20,910
where are you guys?

243
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,010
Where were you when,

244
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:26,460
when we were all having
these conversations and then
suddenly they get it right

245
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,990
and then they don't
know what to do with it.

246
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,010
And the reason they don't know what
to do with it do what to do with it is

247
00:07:32,011 --> 00:07:34,680
because he's talking about
personal responsibility.

248
00:07:34,681 --> 00:07:37,110
What are these 12 rules that
Jordan's going to talk about tonight?

249
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:37,920
Right?

250
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,753
Sit Up Straight,

251
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,870
get your shit together.

252
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:40,790
You know,

253
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,241
and that's it.

254
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:42,450
That's a beautiful thing.

255
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,130
But for the people that
want to control you,

256
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,010
that's the thing that they hate the most
because they don't want you to get your

257
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:47,844
shit together.

258
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,960
And this guy being around him has
forced me in some ways to get my shit

259
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:52,794
together.

260
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,180
So with that in mind,

261
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,853
are you ready?

262
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,840
[inaudible]

263
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:06,323
yeah,

264
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,460
come on Chloe.

265
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,140
I think he can get them to
do a little better than that.

266
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,320
Glowing yellow.

267
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:11,751
Little more than that.

268
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:12,560
Can you a little more upbeat?

269
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,560
[inaudible]

270
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,580
was really,

271
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,330
there is an idea revolution
happening in this country.

272
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,710
You guys are part of it.

273
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,490
But this guy right now is the center of
it and it is my honor and pleasure to

274
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:36,350
introduce Dr. Jordan Peterson.

275
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:00,470
[inaudible]

276
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,733
you guys,

277
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,810
you New Yorkers here.

278
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:32,840
A real tough crowd.

279
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:39,183
Thank you.

280
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,140
If this is just completely ridiculous.

281
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,933
Yes.

282
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:45,763
Yeah.

283
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,670
I came here about an hour and a half ago
and there were people like the lined up

284
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:50,450
around the block.

285
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:50,890
That's don't,

286
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:51,800
what the hell are you doing?

287
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,423
Yeah,

288
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,480
look at where it's at.

289
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,230
I'm really looking forward to
talking to you guys tonight.

290
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,143
Really I,

291
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,223
it's,

292
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,521
I'm hoping,

293
00:10:03,521 --> 00:10:04,310
well,

294
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:05,900
get right to the bottom of the things.

295
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,360
That's the plan.

296
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,200
So if I'm going to just
launch right into it,

297
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,750
I'm going to talk to you
about my book tonight.

298
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:15,440
I'm going to go,

299
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,390
I'm going to try to go
through all 12 rules.

300
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,680
Yeah.

301
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,640
Try not to get too digressive
while I'm doing it.

302
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:27,260
You know,

303
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:32,260
each time I do this I try to hit it from
a different angle and to expand on the

304
00:10:32,421 --> 00:10:34,430
story to make it clearer and all of that.

305
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:37,880
So I'm gonna try to do that again
tonight and start with rule one.

306
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,360
How am I heard somebody has
lobster cause logs through teacher.

307
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:47,240
That's just quite a many ridiculous
things that have been happening.

308
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:52,850
But you know the first chapter which is
stand up straight with your shoulders

309
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:53,190
back.

310
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:53,900
It's,

311
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,060
yeah,

312
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,220
there's a variety of themes that
I was trying to weave together.

313
00:10:57,221 --> 00:11:02,221
And I think that there the three
themes or something like hierarchy,

314
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,040
inequality and the vulnerability.

315
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:07,420
It's something like that.

316
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,530
And I will start with
hierarchy because it's really,

317
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,980
really an important issue to tie.

318
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:14,370
Didn't take really into the issue of,

319
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,491
of inequality.

320
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:16,780
But I'll start with hierarchy.

321
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:17,853
So you know,

322
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:22,300
one of the things that Carl
Marx suggested 100 years ago,

323
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,800
150 years ago,

324
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,390
and not really all that originally because
other people had made the same kind

325
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:30,370
of comments was that uh,

326
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:34,330
wealth tends to accumulate in the
hands of fewer and fewer people.

327
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,180
And he regarded that as evidence of,

328
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:42,160
of a certain type of
profound unfairness APP.

329
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,210
You know,

330
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,160
you have to give the devil his due.

331
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,540
You really do.

332
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,580
You can't make the arguments of those
who stand in opposition to you week.

333
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,740
It's foolish.

334
00:11:53,741 --> 00:11:57,190
You have to make them strong
because then if you counter them,

335
00:11:57,191 --> 00:11:59,770
you've covered them in
the best possible manner.

336
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,330
And the thing about marks,

337
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,670
observation is that it was correct.

338
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,900
Wealth does tend to accumulate in
the hands of fewer and fewer people.

339
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:09,670
Now having said that,

340
00:12:09,671 --> 00:12:14,671
there's some complexities about that
that absolutely 100% has to be addressed.

341
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:21,310
The first is that it's not always
in the hands of the same people.

342
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,430
So if you look at how
many distributes itself,

343
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,750
imagine you're playing monopoly,

344
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:27,220
you guys have all played monopoly.

345
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:30,070
Every monopoly game ends the same way,

346
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:31,203
right?

347
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:35,770
Everybody who's playing except one
person starves to death and I'm the one

348
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,540
person gets everything right?

349
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:40,210
But if you play 10 monopoly
games that you find,

350
00:12:40,211 --> 00:12:41,021
it's very seldom,

351
00:12:41,021 --> 00:12:45,800
it's the same person who ends up our top
across the entire set of 10 gauge and

352
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,210
we're not.

353
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:50,320
We actually has more in common with
real life than you might think because

354
00:12:50,321 --> 00:12:52,090
monopoly is essentially a game of chance,

355
00:12:52,091 --> 00:12:53,050
but some skill in it.

356
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:58,330
But if you run a economic game like
monopoly out to its logical conclusion,

357
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:01,660
what happens is that one person ends up
with everything and everyone else ends

358
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:02,494
up with nothing.

359
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:06,790
That's actually a consequence
of the randomness itself.

360
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,410
And that's been modeled by the way,

361
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:11,710
by people who call
themselves econo physicists.

362
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,371
Like who knows?

363
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:13,660
But there's Econo physicists,

364
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:13,901
right?

365
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:15,670
Who would know that those
sorts of people exist.

366
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,980
But they've used mathematical equations,

367
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:19,210
mathematical equations,

368
00:13:19,211 --> 00:13:23,050
governing randomness to describe how
many distributes itself in an economy.

369
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,790
And it does just like monopoly.

370
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,190
Now the real world's more
complicated than monopoly.

371
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:28,960
And it's not only a random game,

372
00:13:29,530 --> 00:13:29,950
um,

373
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:30,480
but,

374
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,140
but there's a fundamental point here.

375
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,170
And the point is that in complex systems,

376
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,040
inequality tends,

377
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:36,874
do we merge?

378
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:41,770
Now the problem with the Damn Marxists
is that they laid out the feet of western

379
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,450
civilization and capitalism.

380
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,470
And that's,

381
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,120
that's a problem for two reasons.

382
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:49,510
The first reason it's a problem
is because it's simply not true.

383
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:51,310
And that's actually a problem.

384
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,180
The problem with inequality is way
more serious then whatever problems,

385
00:13:57,581 --> 00:13:59,530
capitalism in western civilization,

386
00:13:59,531 --> 00:14:01,630
how our societies aren't perfect.

387
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:04,090
But compared to most imperfect societies,

388
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:05,350
they're pretty damn good.

389
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,850
But the thing that,

390
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:11,703
that

391
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:13,530
they're being blamed for,

392
00:14:13,531 --> 00:14:13,970
it

393
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,520
is not their fault.

394
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,490
You cannot lay inequality
at the feet of capitalism.

395
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,810
And that's why I parked me,

396
00:14:19,811 --> 00:14:24,400
I wrote about lobsters because whatever
you don't see might say about lobsters,

397
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,020
they are not capitalists.

398
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,830
They don't partake in
a free market economy.

399
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:33,100
And their societies aren't
socio cultural constructs.

400
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,350
None of that is even vaguely true.

401
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,270
It's seriously not true.

402
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,560
But they still have inequality
and they still have hierarchies.

403
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,910
And so what that means,

404
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:47,220
and it's a point I make repeated like
in the chapter is hierarchical data

405
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:50,260
quality is at least a third
of a billion years old.

406
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,160
And so

407
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:52,940
one problem.

408
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,400
So one of the problems with misdiagnosing,

409
00:14:55,401 --> 00:14:59,840
it's cost is that you
lay it at the feet of a,

410
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,940
of a system that is producing it,

411
00:15:01,941 --> 00:15:04,220
or is it producing it any more
than any other system would.

412
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,891
But the second is,

413
00:15:05,891 --> 00:15:09,620
is that you actually failed to take it
as seriously as you need to take it if

414
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:10,910
you're going to address it.

415
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,980
So because right or left,

416
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:15,770
one thing we should all be able to
agree on as far as I'm concerned,

417
00:15:15,771 --> 00:15:16,370
isn't it?

418
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:21,370
Having people stack up in poverty at the
bottom of your hierarchy is not good.

419
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,150
Like who likes that?

420
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:23,710
Right.

421
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:23,990
Cool.

422
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:24,231
You know,

423
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:25,550
you see people marching,

424
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,050
I'm against poverty.

425
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,940
It's like really?

426
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,550
Who is for a porphyry?

427
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:32,510
No know.

428
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:33,343
It's not like,

429
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,640
it's not like well off.

430
00:15:34,641 --> 00:15:38,240
People walk down the streets of New
York saying they see someone homeless

431
00:15:38,241 --> 00:15:40,790
shivering away suffering off to the side.

432
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:41,360
They're thinking,

433
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,193
Hey man,

434
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:47,180
strike one up for the
capitalist is how people think.

435
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,130
They think they,

436
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:49,650
they're,

437
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,100
they're hurt by it and they
don't know what to do about it.

438
00:15:52,101 --> 00:15:52,761
They'll avoid it.

439
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:53,810
Maybe they won't even look,

440
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:54,920
they don't know what to do,

441
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,910
but they're not bloody
wall celebrate again,

442
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,570
perhaps they don't off her money.

443
00:15:59,571 --> 00:15:59,891
You know?

444
00:15:59,891 --> 00:16:02,600
And there's a variety of
complex reasons for that.

445
00:16:02,601 --> 00:16:06,290
But that's at least in part because it's
not obvious to me in a situation like

446
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:06,531
that,

447
00:16:06,531 --> 00:16:09,290
money directly help or at least it's not.

448
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,080
It's not a foregone conclusion,

449
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:13,370
but that's the proper solution.

450
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:17,450
So no one likes poverty and the evidence
on inequality has pretty strong.

451
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:19,040
From the social science perspective,

452
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:24,041
it's pretty clear that it doesn't matter
what size unit of social analysis you

453
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:25,161
use,

454
00:16:25,161 --> 00:16:26,840
whether it's city,

455
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,591
neighborhood,

456
00:16:27,591 --> 00:16:28,041
city,

457
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:28,521
state,

458
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:29,354
or country.

459
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,190
The more inequality there is,

460
00:16:31,191 --> 00:16:36,191
the more the society starts to destabilize
and the more violent the men get.

461
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:40,490
And that's also not good at the reason
the men get fired just because men are

462
00:16:40,491 --> 00:16:41,450
more violent than women,

463
00:16:41,451 --> 00:16:42,980
and so they get violent first.

464
00:16:42,981 --> 00:16:44,490
But the ones at the bottom,

465
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:48,320
the once you stack up at the bottom
and don't see any way of potentially

466
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:49,580
climbing to the top,

467
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,091
they pay.

468
00:16:50,091 --> 00:16:51,230
I don't have anything to lose.

469
00:16:51,231 --> 00:16:53,040
I might as well throw the
whole thing up in the air.

470
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:55,550
Let's play a new monopoly game.

471
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,020
Maybe I'll come out on top this time.

472
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,190
And that's not good.

473
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:58,431
Right?

474
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:00,410
It's not good to have
your society destabilized.

475
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,580
So we know that there was some parameters
within which our societies have to

476
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:06,650
operate in order to
maintain their stability.

477
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,150
Everybody can agree on that,

478
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,870
but enough with the misdiagnosis.

479
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,860
That's my sense.

480
00:17:12,861 --> 00:17:13,221
It's like,

481
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:14,054
okay,

482
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,990
we can have a discussion about inequality
and we can agree that it can become a

483
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:18,824
problem,

484
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,680
but we're not going to blame
it on capitalism and we're
not going to blame it on

485
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:24,470
the free market and we're not going to
blame it on the patriarchy or Western

486
00:17:24,471 --> 00:17:26,540
civilization because that's just wrong.

487
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:35,960
That's the first thing,

488
00:17:35,961 --> 00:17:36,730
and that's,

489
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:37,460
that's really it.

490
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,750
That's really an important site.

491
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,000
Now the second thing is,

492
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,050
well,

493
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,560
how do you best probably hunted?

494
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:49,780
So we'll say that hierarchy is a permanent
element of a social organization,

495
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:50,730
right?

496
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:53,580
It runs through the the Kingdom of life.

497
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,790
Any complex lifeforms organize
themselves into a hierarchy.

498
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,040
The winters tend to take
more than the losers.

499
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,540
That's how it is now.

500
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,070
I never once claimed,

501
00:18:02,071 --> 00:18:04,260
don't know why I'm being
accused of claiming that.

502
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,590
Well,

503
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,550
because that's how it is.

504
00:18:05,551 --> 00:18:06,780
That's how it should be.

505
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,690
It's like there's a big gap
between the way things are,

506
00:18:09,691 --> 00:18:10,860
the way they should be.

507
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,500
Any anyone knows that if
they're the least fit,

508
00:18:13,501 --> 00:18:14,830
philosophically astute,

509
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,721
you can't say,

510
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,240
well there's beggars on the street
and that's how it shouldn't be.

511
00:18:18,241 --> 00:18:19,920
It's like that's completely foolish.

512
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,240
We want to,

513
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,520
we want to ameliorate the
worst parts of the what the,

514
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,790
the painful elements of
reality and so forth.

515
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,040
And we're able to do that.

516
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,840
But that's doesn't mean
we know how to do it.

517
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,200
There's a book that was just published
by a guy named Walter shutdown called the

518
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:37,860
great leveler,

519
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,390
believe that's the name of it.

520
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,320
Um,

521
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:40,771
it was just,

522
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,830
just came out and it's an
analysis of inequality.

523
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:43,291
It's quite,

524
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:44,280
it's quite good.

525
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:44,570
It's,

526
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:45,780
it's kind of a technical book,

527
00:18:45,781 --> 00:18:46,614
but I'd recommend it.

528
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,360
One of the things shy did,

529
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,320
he was curious about,

530
00:18:49,321 --> 00:18:49,920
well,

531
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,960
is there anything that can
be done about inequality?

532
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:53,130
And so here's a question,

533
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,260
an empirical question
and scientific question.

534
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,090
Imagine that you stacked up left wing
governments and it stacked up right wing

535
00:19:00,091 --> 00:19:03,960
governments and you measured the levels
of inequality among the left wing

536
00:19:03,961 --> 00:19:06,540
governments and you measured levels
of inequality among the right wing

537
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:07,374
governments.

538
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,380
You'd hope probably that there would
be less inequality in the last week he

539
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,250
societies because after all,

540
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:17,970
what they're trying to do desperately is
to decrease inequality among all sorts

541
00:19:17,971 --> 00:19:18,540
of other things.

542
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,240
But you know,

543
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:19,830
as I said,

544
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:20,880
give the devil his due.

545
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,400
They're trying to reduce inequality.

546
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,010
Oh,

547
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,581
Shadelle phone.

548
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:26,730
There was no relationship whatsoever
between the political stance of the

549
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:31,731
government levels of inequality and
that that is not a finding to be.

550
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,313
Ah,

551
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
what would you say can
be thankful about to be,

552
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:37,501
to gloat about,

553
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,730
to be happy about?

554
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,840
It's actually really quite catastrophic
because what it means is that we don't

555
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:46,860
know how to manipulate sociopolitical
systems to eliminate or even alleviate

556
00:19:46,861 --> 00:19:47,520
inequality.

557
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,410
We simply do not know how to do it.

558
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,100
And that's another indication of
just exactly how deep the problem is.

559
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,150
Now I'm going to talk about some
potential solutions as we progressed.

560
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,941
But you know,

561
00:19:56,941 --> 00:19:57,191
we,

562
00:19:57,191 --> 00:20:00,090
we want to grapple with these things
like intelligent human beings instead of

563
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:01,710
like ideological robots,

564
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:02,440
you know,

565
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,270
and we can,

566
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:03,841
we can say,

567
00:20:03,841 --> 00:20:04,261
well look,

568
00:20:04,261 --> 00:20:07,290
obviously the fact that
some people have have that,

569
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,820
some people stack up at zero and zero's
a really hard place to get out of that's

570
00:20:11,821 --> 00:20:14,870
not in anyone's best interest self.

571
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,200
Evidently it's like,

572
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:16,800
okay,

573
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,760
well what do we do about it?

574
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,110
The answer is we don't know.

575
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,540
Now I think about the,

576
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:21,750
and,

577
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,600
and a lot of the things that we
try to do about it make it worse.

578
00:20:24,601 --> 00:20:26,160
So the other thing should
I delve pointed out,

579
00:20:26,161 --> 00:20:28,030
and this is one of the
horrifying elements of this book,

580
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,420
is there are things we can
do to reduce inequality,

581
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,800
uh,

582
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,450
mass plants,

583
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:34,740
reducing inequality,

584
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,180
right?

585
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:37,013
Right.

586
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:38,970
More reduces inequality.

587
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,780
Why?

588
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:43,800
Because everyone ends up at zero
and that reduces inequality.

589
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,240
And when everyone's dead,

590
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:46,260
they're all equal.

591
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,110
And those aren't solutions I think
that we should necessarily be pursuing.

592
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,000
But as far as Cardale can tell,

593
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,260
there aren't any self-evidently
viable alternatives.

594
00:20:56,470 --> 00:20:58,150
And so then we have another problem too,

595
00:20:58,151 --> 00:21:02,320
which is one of the things
about capitalism and about
the west I would say in

596
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:02,681
general,

597
00:21:02,681 --> 00:21:05,560
is that while we produce it and quality,

598
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,300
because we are producing inequality,

599
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,650
we also produce wealth.

600
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,330
And that's pretty new,

601
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:11,164
right?

602
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,790
In 1995,

603
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,750
the average western person lived on
less than a dollar a day by today's

604
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,500
standards,

605
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:17,790
India,

606
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:18,623
today's money.

607
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,080
So that's absolute poverty.

608
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,460
So the typical person in
1895 was absolutely poor,

609
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,890
poorer than the typical person
who lives on the planet now.

610
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,323
And so this,

611
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,740
this ability to produce
wealth into distributed,

612
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,110
which is something we're
actually extraordinarily good at,

613
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,580
is really quite new and
it's really quite fragile.

614
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,391
What were,

615
00:21:37,391 --> 00:21:38,840
were going great guns out it.

616
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:43,630
And also I worked for you in
committee for about three years or no,

617
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,720
who was a committee for the
secretary general that was,

618
00:21:46,721 --> 00:21:47,140
uh,

619
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,471
it was,

620
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:47,770
uh,

621
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,070
the production of a report on
sustainable economic development,

622
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,821
something like that.

623
00:21:51,821 --> 00:21:52,541
And it started out,

624
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,950
it was really cold war narrative.

625
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:56,230
It was nasty left versus right narrative,

626
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,940
which I didn't like it
all very pessimistic,

627
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,050
very anti human,

628
00:21:59,260 --> 00:21:59,471
you know,

629
00:21:59,471 --> 00:22:00,820
and we're destroying the planet.

630
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,920
We're horrible people in all that
sort of absolute pathological rubbish.

631
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,000
And so,

632
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,880
oh Jesus.

633
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,591
And so we,

634
00:22:13,591 --> 00:22:13,931
we,

635
00:22:13,931 --> 00:22:14,360
we,

636
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:18,440
we tried to update the narrative from
like 1984 which is where it was basically

637
00:22:18,441 --> 00:22:19,274
stuck,

638
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,640
pointed out that a lot of
things are really going well.

639
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:23,061
You know,

640
00:22:23,061 --> 00:22:26,960
if we have any sense
collectively we'd be celebrating.

641
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:32,020
Like I follow this group on Twitter called
human progress.org which I like quite

642
00:22:32,151 --> 00:22:32,960
a lot.

643
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,220
And they tweet out real positive things.

644
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,700
You don't not feel good
stories but like data driven,

645
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,890
optimistic news.

646
00:22:41,891 --> 00:22:46,010
And they had a mock up of the New York
Times front page recently that they

647
00:22:46,011 --> 00:22:51,011
tweeted if it said 186,000 people lifted
out of absolute poverty today and then

648
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:55,580
the cut line was we could run that
every day for the last 20 years.

649
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,710
It's like you think about that,

650
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,280
you know,

651
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,840
so the number of people
in absolute poverty in the
world fell by 50% between the

652
00:23:02,841 --> 00:23:07,130
year 2000 and the year 2012 which
was three years faster than the most

653
00:23:07,131 --> 00:23:09,830
optimistic projections had suggested.

654
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:10,730
It's like,

655
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,563
yes,

656
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,723
that's so good.

657
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,170
This isn't the same thing is
happening and all sorts of fraud.

658
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,010
So you know the fastest

659
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:18,791
are we getting caught him.

660
00:23:18,791 --> 00:23:20,920
He sit in the world right
now are in sub Sahara Africa.

661
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:21,761
It's like,

662
00:23:21,761 --> 00:23:24,750
and that's partly because the Africans
have got a hold of computation

663
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:25,960
computational technology,

664
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:26,201
right?

665
00:23:26,201 --> 00:23:27,330
Which is a massive deal.

666
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,300
You hold in your hand,

667
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,560
you hold in your hand and computational
device that puts the computational

668
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,970
devices that were used to launch the
Apollo space program absolutely to shape

669
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,480
right?

670
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,300
And everyone has one and those
who don't will have one suit.

671
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:40,811
And you know,

672
00:23:40,811 --> 00:23:45,410
that's one of the things that starts to
make you rich and about 300,000 people,

673
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,480
hundreds of thousands of people a week
or being hooked up to the power grid.

674
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:54,110
We're kicking the hell up chop
mortality and also all cause mortality.

675
00:23:54,111 --> 00:23:58,580
And extending life radically and people
are literate way more literate than they

676
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:00,290
were 50 years ago across the world.

677
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:04,280
It's like a lot of really amazing things
are happening harming what's happened,

678
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:04,731
I think,

679
00:24:04,731 --> 00:24:07,940
and this is made things more difficult
in the United States in particular,

680
00:24:07,941 --> 00:24:12,530
is that a lot of the advances made
by the working class in places,

681
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:13,280
say like Gideon,

682
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,060
China,

683
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,421
happy,

684
00:24:14,421 --> 00:24:18,050
purchased out the expensive and
increasing standard of living for American

685
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:18,800
working people.

686
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,420
And so they're the ones
who pretty paid for this.

687
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:20,950
But,

688
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:21,650
and that's,

689
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:23,660
that's sad and it's hard,

690
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,310
but it's not so bad that
the Chinese aren't starving.

691
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:26,780
You know,

692
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,700
it's not so bad that the
Indians aren't starving.

693
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,481
There's lots of them.

694
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:33,950
And if they were in the
economy and producing and
moving themselves up to middle

695
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:34,371
class,

696
00:24:34,371 --> 00:24:36,110
it's like that's a pretty damn good deal.

697
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,570
And one of the things
that really shocked me,

698
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,570
what particularly when,

699
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,620
when I was helping write
this report was like,

700
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,251
what the hell?

701
00:24:43,251 --> 00:24:44,450
Why don't we know this?

702
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,170
Why don't we like having a little
party or even a big party about it?

703
00:24:48,171 --> 00:24:50,480
Instead of biting off her own legs,

704
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,220
which we see to be doing
it the west spring.

705
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,160
Now with all this idiotic
political polarization,

706
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,830
like things are not so bad.

707
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:58,131
I mean,

708
00:24:58,131 --> 00:24:59,810
there was still a bloody catastrophe,

709
00:24:59,811 --> 00:25:00,081
right?

710
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,760
Because life is a catastrophe.

711
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:04,160
But comparatively speaking,

712
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:05,323
it's like,

713
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,410
well,

714
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:08,120
so that's what's doing that.

715
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:08,391
Well,

716
00:25:08,391 --> 00:25:10,050
I can tell you it's not communism.

717
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,940
It's doing that.

718
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:12,590
That's for blade shirt.

719
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,480
What's happening is the free market,

720
00:25:14,481 --> 00:25:17,450
essentially the free market
is making people rich.

721
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,640
It's increasing inequality
at the same time,

722
00:25:19,641 --> 00:25:20,181
but at least,

723
00:25:20,181 --> 00:25:20,381
whoa,

724
00:25:20,381 --> 00:25:21,860
it's increasing inequality.

725
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:24,020
It's stopping people
from starving to death.

726
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:24,441
I mean,

727
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:25,274
that's something.

728
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,573
Yeah,

729
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,840
so that's chapter one.

730
00:25:33,870 --> 00:25:33,991
Well,

731
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:36,870
there's a bit of an injunction in
chapter one and rule one there.

732
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:37,704
It's like,

733
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:38,371
you know,

734
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,204
so

735
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:44,340
you have to battle with a number of
things in your life and you have to battle

736
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:45,270
with the tragedy.

737
00:25:45,271 --> 00:25:46,110
That's your life.

738
00:25:46,111 --> 00:25:49,050
You know when you have to battle with
the fact that you're not everything you

739
00:25:49,051 --> 00:25:50,970
could be and probably never will be.

740
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,541
You know,

741
00:25:51,541 --> 00:25:55,020
you have to battle with the fact that
you've got an evil heart just like the

742
00:25:55,021 --> 00:25:55,831
person next to you.

743
00:25:55,831 --> 00:25:59,460
It's like there's all sorts of things
if you have to contend with in life that

744
00:25:59,461 --> 00:25:59,791
are very,

745
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,600
very difficult.

746
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,630
The fact of hierarchy and the fact that
they would call and he'd hold up that as

747
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:04,410
well.

748
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,870
That's part of your
intrinsic vulnerability.

749
00:26:06,871 --> 00:26:11,430
Let's say it's the price you pay
for BIA as far as I can tell,

750
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,810
but we'll talk about that later.

751
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,771
The question is,

752
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:13,921
well,

753
00:26:13,921 --> 00:26:15,990
how do you deal with that unfairness?

754
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,900
Let's say that the intrinsic unfairness,

755
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,450
well,

756
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,680
people are quite creative.

757
00:26:19,681 --> 00:26:23,930
I mean some of the things we do to
combat that's essential inequalities.

758
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,770
We generate a lot of different games.

759
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,341
You know,

760
00:26:26,341 --> 00:26:29,610
like animals basically played one game
and you're either good at it or you're

761
00:26:29,611 --> 00:26:29,911
not,

762
00:26:29,911 --> 00:26:30,661
but human beings,

763
00:26:30,661 --> 00:26:32,850
we played hundreds of games
and if you're not good at one,

764
00:26:32,851 --> 00:26:36,360
you can maybe find another one
that you're at least not so bad at.

765
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:40,050
Or at least improving out or maybe
you can invent your own game.

766
00:26:40,051 --> 00:26:43,140
And so that's a pretty creative thing to
do and we're pretty damn good at that.

767
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,120
And so that's one solution.

768
00:26:45,121 --> 00:26:46,910
But another solution to is this too.

769
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:51,260
The question is if,

770
00:26:51,261 --> 00:26:54,060
if the environment arrays
itself into a hierarchy,

771
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:59,160
how is it that you're best situated
to play within that hierarchy?

772
00:26:59,550 --> 00:26:59,781
You know,

773
00:26:59,781 --> 00:27:02,280
in one answer might be to
make yourself powerful,

774
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:02,551
you know,

775
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:03,900
in the physical sense or in the,

776
00:27:03,901 --> 00:27:07,590
in the menacing and threatening sense
because especially the people who

777
00:27:07,591 --> 00:27:12,120
criticize hierarchy always presume that
what makes you dominant in the hierarchy

778
00:27:12,121 --> 00:27:13,500
is something like raw power,

779
00:27:13,501 --> 00:27:15,060
which by the way is just not true.

780
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,880
It's true to a limited
sense among some animals.

781
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,470
It's really not true when human beings,

782
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:23,250
it's not even true among complex
primates because what's been found about

783
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,540
chimpanzees for example,

784
00:27:24,541 --> 00:27:29,130
is that the brutal tyrant chimps
tend to be ripped to shreds by there,

785
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,790
by the,

786
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:33,180
by the chimpanzees that there tyrannizing
as soon as they have a weak moment.

787
00:27:33,181 --> 00:27:36,240
And you don't have to have much of an
imagination to see how that plays out.

788
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,110
On the human stage.

789
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:40,830
And so it actually turns out that
if you want to climb a hierarchy,

790
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:44,100
let's say that the hierarchy
isn't the power hierarchy,

791
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,690
not not in a functioning society,

792
00:27:45,691 --> 00:27:49,620
it's more like a competence hierarchy
or more like a voluntary game.

793
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,520
And the way that you climb it actually
believe it or not is by being a good

794
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:54,354
person.

795
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,111
And you might think,

796
00:27:55,111 --> 00:27:56,820
well that's a little naive.

797
00:27:56,821 --> 00:27:57,630
It's like,

798
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:58,463
yeah,

799
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,220
no it's not really that night.

800
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,081
First of all,

801
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,060
it's not that easy to be a good person.

802
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,540
And the second is it's,

803
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,010
it's somewhat self evident.

804
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:06,721
You know,

805
00:28:06,721 --> 00:28:10,200
like you know people that you
trust and you don't trust.

806
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,330
And like once you don't trust someone,

807
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,950
you really don't trust them.

808
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,410
It's really hard for them
to recover from that.

809
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:17,400
And if you don't trust them,

810
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,260
you're not going to play with them.

811
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:19,890
None.

812
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,000
If you have any sense.

813
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:24,900
And we're really good at relationship
tracking and we're especially good at

814
00:28:24,901 --> 00:28:28,710
tracking behavior that's
ethically suspect.

815
00:28:28,711 --> 00:28:32,490
And we remember it like one
mistake of blowing your reputation,

816
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:32,701
you know,

817
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:33,534
it's harsh,

818
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,930
but it just shows you
how important trust is.

819
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,880
And if you act in a trustworthy manner,

820
00:28:38,970 --> 00:28:41,550
and I'm not saying this is
enough to make your life,

821
00:28:41,551 --> 00:28:42,300
you know,

822
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:43,490
all sparkles and,

823
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:43,801
and,

824
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:44,310
and,

825
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:45,240
and rainbows.

826
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:47,820
It's like forget that that ain't
happening no matter what you do.

827
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,260
But if you're,

828
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:51,330
if you're someone that can be trusted,

829
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,200
then the probability that you'll at least
move towards some degree of success in

830
00:28:57,211 --> 00:28:59,730
your domain is radically increased.

831
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,500
And so that's a good deal.

832
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:06,090
And then the other thing too is
that makes you a contender in a,

833
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,600
in a hierarchical game
is a kind of courage.

834
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,630
And it's a funny courage cause it's,

835
00:29:11,631 --> 00:29:12,900
it's paradoxical curves.

836
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,590
This is one of the things I really
liked about the narrative structure of

837
00:29:16,591 --> 00:29:17,341
Christianity,

838
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:17,761
I would say,

839
00:29:17,761 --> 00:29:20,960
because I think Christianity has done a
very good job of detailing out this idea

840
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:21,794
is that if you,

841
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:26,130
the competence that you
need to manifest in life,

842
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,460
the courage that you
need to manifest in life.

843
00:29:29,461 --> 00:29:32,040
And that goes along with being
someone that can be trusted,

844
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,660
is to be someone who will
stand up and expose themselves.

845
00:29:36,661 --> 00:29:37,494
So

846
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,040
let's try a different term

847
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,450
who will accept their vulnerability,

848
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:46,911
right?

849
00:29:46,911 --> 00:29:49,780
And take that on as part and
parcel of their responsibility.

850
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:52,630
And part of that for human
beings is to stand up,

851
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,320
you know,

852
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,950
because the most vulnerable
part of us is faced forward.

853
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,600
We're unlike our other creatures,

854
00:29:58,601 --> 00:29:58,811
right?

855
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:03,190
Because other animals they pour on on
all four and their back is armored and

856
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:05,170
that's what they present
to the world essentially.

857
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:05,711
But not us.

858
00:30:05,711 --> 00:30:09,640
We stepped up and make the most
vulnerable parts of us front and forward.

859
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,610
And there's a kind of courage in that.

860
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:16,620
But because I'm willing to take on the
catastrophe of existence forthrightly,

861
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:18,340
and that's what rule one is,

862
00:30:18,341 --> 00:30:18,640
that's,

863
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,473
that's,

864
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,320
it's not,

865
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,100
it's not,

866
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,980
it's not a finger wagging
injunction for stand up straight.

867
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:24,251
You know,

868
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:26,050
because there's something
wrong with you if you don't.

869
00:30:26,290 --> 00:30:27,123
Although there is,

870
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,060
it's an encouragement to say,

871
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:31,600
look,

872
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,040
the way that you find out how strong you
can be is to accept how vulnerable you

873
00:30:36,041 --> 00:30:36,874
are.

874
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,230
And if you think about it,

875
00:30:38,231 --> 00:30:41,020
that makes perfect sense because
we are self aware creatures.

876
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:44,320
We know perfectly well how badly we can
be hurt when we also know that we will

877
00:30:44,321 --> 00:30:44,701
be broken.

878
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:46,590
It's not just that we could be bird.

879
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,920
It's way worse than not.

880
00:30:47,921 --> 00:30:51,700
It's that we most certainly
will be hurt in terrible ways.

881
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,820
And to be able to stand up and take that,

882
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:55,780
you know,

883
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:58,150
and to take that like
someone who's courageous,

884
00:30:58,151 --> 00:30:58,750
it's like,

885
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,583
well that'll,

886
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,300
that'll float your boat man.

887
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,190
That'll make people respect you.

888
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,000
That'll increase the probability that
they'll trust you and it will allow you to

889
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:10,210
sleep with a good conscience
at ninth and that's something,

890
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,910
and maybe that's about as good as it gets.

891
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,410
And so that's rule one.

892
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,450
Rule two is an extension of that.

893
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:19,860
You know,

894
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,010
it,

895
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,381
it's,

896
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:25,381
it's treat yourself as if you have
someone responsible for helping and

897
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:30,880
okay,

898
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,150
you hear it from
psychologists frequently that,

899
00:31:34,151 --> 00:31:34,361
you know,

900
00:31:34,361 --> 00:31:37,960
people are kind of narcissistic and they
tend to overestimate their skills in

901
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:40,300
relationship to other people and so forth.

902
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,850
I don't really buy any of that.

903
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:41,961
I,

904
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:42,400
I don't,

905
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,270
I don't think it's true.

906
00:31:43,271 --> 00:31:44,890
I think most of that's
a measurement garden.

907
00:31:44,891 --> 00:31:45,724
In fact,

908
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,490
I think instead that people,

909
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,880
my sense of people from my
clinical perspective and
from my research perspective

910
00:31:54,221 --> 00:31:55,920
is actually Jeff or the opposite of that.

911
00:31:55,921 --> 00:31:56,650
If you,

912
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,320
if you sit down and you have a
serious conversation with someone,

913
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:02,710
it doesn't take very long if
you have a serious conversation,

914
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,790
unless they're narcissistic and in,

915
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,480
in really pathological manner.

916
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,260
Most people aren't like that.

917
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:12,280
They're so damn painfully aware of
what's wrong with them that it's hard to

918
00:32:12,281 --> 00:32:13,114
even,

919
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,490
it's hard to even face,

920
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:16,151
you know,

921
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:21,151
you don't have to talk to someone for
very long until they tell you what they've

922
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:25,450
done wrong or how they're inadequate.

923
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:27,610
It's not some whiny game,

924
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,560
although sometimes it's that it's,

925
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:34,670
it's genuine recognition of
their shortcomings and false.

926
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,323
No.

927
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,020
The with being an
individual person is that,

928
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,021
well,

929
00:32:43,021 --> 00:32:47,380
you kind of are aware of the fragility
of human beings in general and then not

930
00:32:47,381 --> 00:32:48,650
only that for fragility,

931
00:32:48,651 --> 00:32:52,340
but also is there tendency towards
malevolence because it isn't the only that

932
00:32:52,341 --> 00:32:53,174
we're vulnerable.

933
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:56,120
We're vulnerable and we're
capable of doing terrible things,

934
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,460
not to ourselves but also to other people.

935
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,950
And not only are we capable of doing that,

936
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,990
we've all done it and we know it.

937
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,690
And so you've got that to carry around,

938
00:33:05,691 --> 00:33:05,931
you know,

939
00:33:05,931 --> 00:33:07,670
the fact that you aren't
everything you could be.

940
00:33:07,671 --> 00:33:08,570
And that's for sure.

941
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,720
And the fact that you know you've done
some things that really aren't that pride

942
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:15,190
worthy,

943
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:15,920
let's say,

944
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,450
and you bloody well know it.

945
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,830
Even if you're trying to fight it,

946
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:19,880
if you're trying to avoid it,

947
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,930
you might even be more painfully
aware of it then you should be.

948
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,231
You know,

949
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:27,560
because sometimes I've also seen it with
people is they're much more willing to

950
00:33:27,561 --> 00:33:30,050
forgive other people than they
are willing to forgive themselves.

951
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:33,040
So I'm telling you think,

952
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,940
well so this chapter's well.

953
00:33:34,941 --> 00:33:37,490
Treat yourself like you're someone
responsible for helping you think.

954
00:33:37,491 --> 00:33:38,500
Well that's self evidence.

955
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:39,920
Like it's not so self evident.

956
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:43,790
I open the chapter with this
observation that if you have a pet,

957
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,090
if you go to a doctor and you
get a prescription medication,

958
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,550
well there's one third chance
that you won't fill it.

959
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,391
And if you do fill it,

960
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:52,850
there's a 50% chance you
won't take the medication.

961
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,201
And so you think,

962
00:33:54,201 --> 00:33:54,411
well,

963
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:55,850
maybe there's a bunch of reasons for that.

964
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,960
You don't trust the doctor,

965
00:33:56,961 --> 00:33:57,621
you're lazy,

966
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,060
you don't understand what's going on,

967
00:33:59,061 --> 00:33:59,541
who knows?

968
00:33:59,541 --> 00:34:00,980
But here's the weird thing.

969
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,851
That's not true.

970
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:05,990
If you take your pet to the that
if you take your pat to the Vat,

971
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,250
well then you'll go fill the prescription
and you'll give the damn pet the

972
00:34:10,251 --> 00:34:11,010
medication.

973
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:11,391
It's like,

974
00:34:11,391 --> 00:34:12,020
okay,

975
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,190
what's going on there?

976
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,620
Do you like your dog
more than you like you?

977
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:15,951
So like,

978
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:16,784
yeah,

979
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,560
yeah,

980
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:19,880
maybe even a lot,

981
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:22,280
you know love.

982
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,990
And there's some reason
for that because you know,

983
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:25,640
if you have a dog or a cat,

984
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,050
let's say a dog in this case,

985
00:34:27,051 --> 00:34:27,980
like the dog,

986
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:29,120
is it innocent creature?

987
00:34:29,121 --> 00:34:29,811
It's a carnivore,

988
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:30,980
but it's an innocent creature.

989
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,020
I get t doesn't have sins zone.

990
00:34:33,021 --> 00:34:33,950
It's conscience.

991
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,560
You don't expect the dog to be everything.

992
00:34:36,561 --> 00:34:37,580
It could be.

993
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:38,360
I said dog,

994
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,350
if that's where this this,

995
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:40,220
you do it right.

996
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,121
You know,

997
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:44,480
it's pretty happy when it sees you
and it's a pretty fair exchange of our

998
00:34:44,481 --> 00:34:45,200
factors.

999
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,090
There's no reason to distrust the dog.

1000
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:51,620
I mean it might do foolish dog things
like chew a toy when it's not supposed to,

1001
00:34:51,621 --> 00:34:54,410
but that's about as far
as sin goes for a dog.

1002
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,310
And so they're easy to like and you're,

1003
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,220
you're not so easy.

1004
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,420
Like that's for sure.

1005
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:02,223
Yeah.

1006
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,590
Yeah.

1007
00:35:03,590 --> 00:35:03,861
That's,

1008
00:35:03,861 --> 00:35:05,600
you can tell that cause
your family members,

1009
00:35:05,601 --> 00:35:07,530
they're happier to see if the
dog that they aren't seeing.

1010
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:12,981
So,

1011
00:35:12,981 --> 00:35:13,221
you know,

1012
00:35:13,221 --> 00:35:13,701
you got it,

1013
00:35:13,701 --> 00:35:14,271
you've got this,

1014
00:35:14,271 --> 00:35:15,620
you've got this tough problem,

1015
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:17,840
which is what you got
to put up with yourself.

1016
00:35:17,841 --> 00:35:20,420
And it's even worse than that
because you know who you are.

1017
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:20,781
It's like,

1018
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:21,614
oh my God,

1019
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:23,210
who's gonna take care of that?

1020
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,210
No one.

1021
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:24,860
It's like,

1022
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,590
well just let it walk her
off into a corner somewhere.

1023
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,483
Die.

1024
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,201
But you know,

1025
00:35:30,201 --> 00:35:31,550
it's not a good thing.

1026
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:33,540
One of the things I
learned from Carl Young,

1027
00:35:33,541 --> 00:35:33,970
he,

1028
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,140
he talked about this
is Christian junction.

1029
00:35:36,141 --> 00:35:37,950
It's from a psychological perspective,

1030
00:35:37,951 --> 00:35:39,630
which is to treat,

1031
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:43,050
treat other people like you
would like to be treated.

1032
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,470
And,

1033
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:43,950
and you know,

1034
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:47,700
people often think of that as this
injunction to be nice to other people.

1035
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,620
It's like that is not what that means.

1036
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,250
First of all,

1037
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,500
nice has a very low and virtue man.

1038
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,720
Nice as heartless as far as I'm concerned.

1039
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,230
That's,

1040
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:56,310
that's not a virtue.

1041
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:59,950
It's the absence of a
particular fault at best

1042
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:04,680
to treat yourself,

1043
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:08,870
to treat yourself like you.

1044
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,540
Treat others like you'd like to be
treated yourself is an equation.

1045
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:16,740
So let's say I've enjoyed in
some sense to treat you properly,

1046
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:17,603
but,

1047
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:20,860
but I'm also joined to
treat myself properly and so
then I'd have to think that

1048
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,301
through.

1049
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:22,090
It's like,

1050
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:23,550
let's say you have a child,

1051
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,350
you have a son and you
want to treat a properly.

1052
00:36:25,351 --> 00:36:25,651
It's like,

1053
00:36:25,651 --> 00:36:27,350
well you don't just let them
get away with everything.

1054
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:28,410
That's not helpful.

1055
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,970
You want to sit and think about what sort
of person you would like this child to

1056
00:36:32,971 --> 00:36:33,390
be calm.

1057
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,590
You want to encourage that,

1058
00:36:34,591 --> 00:36:35,070
right?

1059
00:36:35,070 --> 00:36:40,070
You want to act as if you're charged
with the care of something valuable and

1060
00:36:40,501 --> 00:36:43,110
precious and then you do what you can.

1061
00:36:43,111 --> 00:36:47,310
If you have any sense to help that
person become everything they can become,

1062
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:47,761
it's like,

1063
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:50,310
well you have the same
responsibility to yourself.

1064
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:51,301
Even as you know,

1065
00:36:51,301 --> 00:36:54,150
even even though you might
not think you deserve it,

1066
00:36:54,151 --> 00:36:56,040
it doesn't have anything
to do with deserving it.

1067
00:36:56,041 --> 00:36:56,970
It's some sense,

1068
00:36:57,090 --> 00:37:02,090
it's a moral requirement to view yourself
despite your inadequacies and your

1069
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:08,931
faults as if you're someone who needs
to be properly taken care of and,

1070
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:09,870
and,

1071
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,870
and it's a responsibility on your
part to figure out what that is.

1072
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,070
And this actually works.

1073
00:37:14,071 --> 00:37:14,904
You know,

1074
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:19,500
we have this program we designed called
self authoring and I designed it with

1075
00:37:19,501 --> 00:37:20,390
two of my colleagues,

1076
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,050
Daniel Higgins and Robert Peel.

1077
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,910
One was a graduate student of mine,

1078
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:27,930
that's Daniel Higgins and the other
was my graduate supervisor at McGill.

1079
00:37:27,931 --> 00:37:32,931
And we worked on that for about 20 years
figuring out how to make it accessible

1080
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,390
to individuals on the web.

1081
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,980
We want it to bring
psychological interventions to
people that were low cost and

1082
00:37:37,981 --> 00:37:38,411
effective.

1083
00:37:38,411 --> 00:37:39,420
And we have this,

1084
00:37:39,421 --> 00:37:41,780
part of this program is the
future authoring program.

1085
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:44,010
And it's two parts.

1086
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,660
It's a writing program because writing,

1087
00:37:45,661 --> 00:37:46,081
by the way,

1088
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:47,430
if you want to straighten out your brain,

1089
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:50,100
there's almost nothing you can
do that's better than writing.

1090
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,020
Writing really straightens you out.

1091
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:57,750
You're organized at the highest
level of your personality,

1092
00:37:57,751 --> 00:37:58,890
your organized verbally.

1093
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,143
And so you have to,

1094
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,460
you have to have an account of yourself.

1095
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:05,280
You have to have an articulated
the counting yourself of yourself.

1096
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,280
That's why you talk to people all the
time about what's going on in your life.

1097
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:11,260
It's so that you can have an
articulated account of yourself.

1098
00:38:11,261 --> 00:38:15,570
And if you're disorganized at the level
of the articulated account that you're

1099
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:16,380
disorganized,

1100
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:16,921
you might think,

1101
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:17,101
well,

1102
00:38:17,101 --> 00:38:17,641
who cares?

1103
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:18,150
It's like,

1104
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:18,391
no,

1105
00:38:18,391 --> 00:38:18,541
no,

1106
00:38:18,541 --> 00:38:18,840
no.

1107
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:19,920
You don't understand.

1108
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,210
If you're disorganized,

1109
00:38:21,211 --> 00:38:22,620
you fall into a pit.

1110
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,210
Like it's a bad thing.

1111
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:25,290
It's like you have a map,

1112
00:38:25,291 --> 00:38:27,000
but there's stains everywhere.

1113
00:38:27,001 --> 00:38:31,650
There's big holes torn in it and it's
half drawn in Crayon and like you're not

1114
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,230
getting anywhere good
with a map like that.

1115
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,760
And so you have to be able
to articulate yourself.

1116
00:38:36,761 --> 00:38:37,450
And so,

1117
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,350
and writing is a very
good way of doing that.

1118
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,810
And in the cell for three program,

1119
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:43,720
you could write about your past and you
could write about your personality and

1120
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:44,980
then you can write about your future.

1121
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:45,910
Now,

1122
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:46,630
you know,

1123
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:50,680
one of the things I've learned from
dealing with students forever is that in

1124
00:38:50,681 --> 00:38:50,861
our,

1125
00:38:50,861 --> 00:38:52,300
in our education system,

1126
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,010
this is so weird,

1127
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:54,490
I,

1128
00:38:54,490 --> 00:38:56,410
I've really struggled
with this realization.

1129
00:38:56,411 --> 00:38:57,910
I've had it about 15 years ago.

1130
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:58,960
We never said,

1131
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,910
I have these students who have been in
it in formal education for 16 years,

1132
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:04,450
right?

1133
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,970
And no one has ever sat them
down even once and said,

1134
00:39:06,971 --> 00:39:07,241
okay,

1135
00:39:07,241 --> 00:39:08,074
look,

1136
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,910
you've got three hours,

1137
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,670
right about who the hell you should be.

1138
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,310
And I don't mean you're going to be
a plumber or a lawyer or whatever.

1139
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:15,821
Fair enough.

1140
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:16,270
You know,

1141
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,110
that is what I mean.

1142
00:39:17,111 --> 00:39:17,944
It's like,

1143
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:18,873
you know,

1144
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:23,910
what kind of character do you want
to manifest in the world in detail,

1145
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:26,500
and then why you think,

1146
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:27,334
well,

1147
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,140
why don't we teach people to do this?

1148
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,441
It's like,

1149
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:30,610
it's the only question,

1150
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:32,380
zoning relevant question.

1151
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:32,741
It's like,

1152
00:39:32,741 --> 00:39:36,460
well if you can be who you could be,

1153
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:40,180
let's imagine you had that within the
palm of your hands since it would be

1154
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:43,180
possible for you to be who you could be.

1155
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,520
Let's say that's within you realm of,

1156
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,150
of,

1157
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:46,750
of,

1158
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,220
of competence.

1159
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:50,140
Who would that be?

1160
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,431
And if that answer is,

1161
00:39:51,431 --> 00:39:53,770
well I don't know and that's the answer,

1162
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,270
then give it up man.

1163
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,650
Cause it,

1164
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,650
cause you're not going to move
forward with a plan like that.

1165
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:02,980
You know like I think this
is a psychological truth.

1166
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:07,030
We know already that human
perception is organized around aim.

1167
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,260
Everything about us is organized around
and even the way we use our eyes,

1168
00:40:11,261 --> 00:40:12,790
it's organized around the aim.

1169
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:13,380
We're,

1170
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:13,651
we're,

1171
00:40:13,651 --> 00:40:17,890
we're aiming creatures and how
do you not hit something if you,

1172
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:18,521
if you're,

1173
00:40:18,521 --> 00:40:19,440
if there's a target there,

1174
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,200
how do you miss it?

1175
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,990
Well one is not specified at the target.

1176
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:23,681
So I,

1177
00:40:23,681 --> 00:40:25,900
how are you going to hit
something if you don't specify it?

1178
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,343
So it's like,

1179
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:29,380
I know that for most people,

1180
00:40:29,381 --> 00:40:31,240
life is something that happens to them.

1181
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,970
They're reacting to things all the time,

1182
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,880
which means that they're tangled
up in someone else's story,

1183
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:39,400
or they're pawns in someone else's aims,

1184
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,540
or they're pawns of the aims of their
own unconscious processes not to.

1185
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,440
And then,

1186
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:44,711
you know,

1187
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:47,920
that's the case when you find yourself
doing something that you can't believe

1188
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:48,641
you did.

1189
00:40:48,641 --> 00:40:48,851
Right.

1190
00:40:48,851 --> 00:40:50,020
I can't believe I did that.

1191
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:50,291
It's like,

1192
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:50,531
yeah,

1193
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,320
well there's something
Indian that had you,

1194
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,750
it wasn't you or it was a dark part of,

1195
00:40:55,751 --> 00:40:56,830
you know,

1196
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,480
but there's nothing to replace that.

1197
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:00,040
There's no super ordinate aim.

1198
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,930
And so in the future authoring program,

1199
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:02,800
we get people to,

1200
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,101
well,

1201
00:41:03,101 --> 00:41:04,330
just to think about their lives,

1202
00:41:04,331 --> 00:41:04,930
it's like,

1203
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,860
so there's this,

1204
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:08,140
another injunction in the new
testament is very strange.

1205
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,090
One Says No,

1206
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,800
Aka the door will open ask
and you will receive if think,

1207
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:13,703
yeah,

1208
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:15,490
fat chance,

1209
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:15,850
right?

1210
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:17,140
Who's going to believe that?

1211
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:17,430
Right?

1212
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,310
It's just to,

1213
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:22,930
it's way too looks to naively
optimistic to even possibly be true,

1214
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,600
but,

1215
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,790
but it's a strange thing.

1216
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:27,750
And I've seen this over and over in my
clinical and my consulting practice and

1217
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:28,584
with my students,

1218
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:31,330
I'll tell you that if you
don't aim at something,

1219
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,740
you will not hit it.

1220
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,350
And if you do a mad,

1221
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,400
the probability that you'll at least
get advanced in that direction,

1222
00:41:38,401 --> 00:41:39,234
it starts to,

1223
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,670
you will.

1224
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,750
That's what will happen.

1225
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,280
Now you aim at something,

1226
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:44,810
what the Hell do you know?

1227
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:45,120
Right?

1228
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,030
You set up your aim,

1229
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,801
you don't know anything.

1230
00:41:46,801 --> 00:41:47,240
And he's like,

1231
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,670
you're stupid in your aims just
like you are and everything else.

1232
00:41:49,671 --> 00:41:51,020
But at least you're aiming at something.

1233
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,520
You move towards it.

1234
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:53,960
And as you move towards it,

1235
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:57,050
you learn something because
you're actually doing something.

1236
00:41:57,230 --> 00:42:00,590
You might learn precisely how
stupid you were in your aims,

1237
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,270
but you learn it precisely.

1238
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:06,530
And that's so useful because once you
learn something precisely like that,

1239
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:09,340
then you can incorporate the knowledge
and you can reformulate your aim.

1240
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:12,620
And the next name is not
quite so bone headed.

1241
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:15,650
And so what you do is imagine
you should be aiming here,

1242
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,150
but you don't know cause you're blind.

1243
00:42:17,151 --> 00:42:18,560
And maybe that's even moving.

1244
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,730
And so you're so blind,

1245
00:42:19,731 --> 00:42:24,731
you aim over here or you walk a
little ways that you think no wrong.

1246
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,060
Then you even over here,

1247
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,250
you walk a little ways
and you think no wrong.

1248
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,540
And You keep doing that.

1249
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,420
And like it's a winding path.

1250
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:31,940
He's like,

1251
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,720
it's not the shortest point B,

1252
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:36,200
not the shortest distance
between point a and B,

1253
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,120
but you're moving forward.

1254
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:40,010
And so even if you're doing it badly,

1255
00:42:40,011 --> 00:42:41,900
you're approximating the ideal.

1256
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:42,850
And the more you do that,

1257
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:43,880
the better you get at it.

1258
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:45,800
And that actually works.

1259
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:48,290
And so we ask people,

1260
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:48,631
you know,

1261
00:42:48,631 --> 00:42:48,981
when you think,

1262
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:49,131
well,

1263
00:42:49,131 --> 00:42:49,940
what's life?

1264
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,390
You know,

1265
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:50,721
what,

1266
00:42:50,721 --> 00:42:51,110
what's,

1267
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,430
what's your life made out of?

1268
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:52,881
Well,

1269
00:42:52,881 --> 00:42:54,080
it's pretty straight forward.

1270
00:42:54,081 --> 00:42:54,860
You know,

1271
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,490
you need,

1272
00:42:55,490 --> 00:42:57,080
you need some relationships,

1273
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:57,820
right?

1274
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,000
You've got to have some friends.

1275
00:42:59,001 --> 00:42:59,571
That'd be good.

1276
00:42:59,571 --> 00:43:01,490
Maybe some of you don't want friends.

1277
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:02,210
Okay.

1278
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,610
You're a peculiar sort and
you don't need friends.

1279
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:07,610
But from her daughter are some
people who aren't that social,

1280
00:43:07,611 --> 00:43:07,881
you know?

1281
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:09,530
But broadly speaking,

1282
00:43:09,531 --> 00:43:11,390
a couple of friends is a good thing.

1283
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:12,200
Okay.

1284
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,300
How many and who?

1285
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,730
Who should get them for friends?

1286
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:17,301
Oh,

1287
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:20,360
you might take while people
who are kind of on your side,

1288
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:21,381
that'd be good.

1289
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:25,340
Or maybe people who are at least
aren't actively conspiring against you,

1290
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,240
you know,

1291
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:26,870
and you think,

1292
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:27,051
well,

1293
00:43:27,051 --> 00:43:29,240
my friends go actively
conspiring against me.

1294
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:29,571
It's like,

1295
00:43:29,571 --> 00:43:29,791
yeah,

1296
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,910
well you just think about it for
a while and see if that's true.

1297
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:35,000
It's same with your family members,

1298
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,770
so you as well,

1299
00:43:36,771 --> 00:43:37,020
right?

1300
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,800
Because you're actively conspiring
against yourself as well.

1301
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,820
So what if you could have the friends
you wanted and you were doing the things

1302
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:44,331
you want to quit?

1303
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:44,511
Is that,

1304
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,500
what would that look like?

1305
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,341
All right,

1306
00:43:46,341 --> 00:43:49,070
well what about your career or job?

1307
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:51,150
Like what's that gonna look like you,

1308
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:53,720
how are you gonna make sure
you are as educated as you are,

1309
00:43:53,721 --> 00:43:54,440
intelligent,

1310
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:55,700
something like that,

1311
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,790
are you to take care of yourself
mentally and physically?

1312
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,620
If you could do it
whatever way you want it,

1313
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:02,120
how are you going to handle temptations,

1314
00:44:02,121 --> 00:44:03,170
drug and alcohol abuse,

1315
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:03,980
for example?

1316
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,340
How are we going to regulate that?

1317
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,040
What are you going to do with your time
outside of work that's productive and

1318
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:10,874
meaningful?

1319
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:11,570
Well that's,

1320
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,760
that's not a bad start at six dimensions,

1321
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:14,020
you know,

1322
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:14,361
it's like,

1323
00:44:14,361 --> 00:44:14,601
okay,

1324
00:44:14,601 --> 00:44:15,021
you can have,

1325
00:44:15,021 --> 00:44:18,500
where do you want or you can have what
you need if you were taking care of

1326
00:44:18,501 --> 00:44:19,280
yourself,

1327
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:20,360
but you have to specify,

1328
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:21,590
okay,

1329
00:44:21,590 --> 00:44:23,000
so we tested that.

1330
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:23,170
We,

1331
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:24,110
we made this program,

1332
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:25,160
we tested it in Holland,

1333
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,000
first tested in three universities and
under pretty rocky conditions in one

1334
00:44:31,501 --> 00:44:31,860
college.

1335
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,850
We just had kids come in for the summer
orientation and just spend like an hour

1336
00:44:35,851 --> 00:44:36,684
writing.

1337
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,160
So you're hardly even start,

1338
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:38,581
you know,

1339
00:44:38,581 --> 00:44:38,821
with,

1340
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:39,930
with your plan.

1341
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:43,290
But it's a plan and that
means you're the planner.

1342
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,400
That's a good thing to learn.

1343
00:44:44,401 --> 00:44:49,401
You're not just this thing that's being
pushed back and forth by the bilingual

1344
00:44:49,621 --> 00:44:50,450
fate.

1345
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:54,510
You've got the grip on things
and you're at least contending.

1346
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:55,111
So like,

1347
00:44:55,111 --> 00:45:00,030
well people were 25% more likely to stay
in the university and the effect lasted

1348
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:01,440
more than two years.

1349
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:02,820
So that was amazing.

1350
00:45:02,821 --> 00:45:06,420
And great grades went up as well about
the same amount and the people that had

1351
00:45:06,421 --> 00:45:07,231
helped the most,

1352
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:10,620
which was really weird because usually
if you do a psychological intervention,

1353
00:45:10,621 --> 00:45:12,090
you say that people not do it so well.

1354
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:13,590
There's people who are doing pretty well.

1355
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,700
You do an intervention.

1356
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:18,180
The people who are doing well do even
better and the people who aren't doing so

1357
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:18,630
well,

1358
00:45:18,630 --> 00:45:20,070
they just stay where they are.

1359
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,860
But that isn't what happened with this
intervention is the people that weren't

1360
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:25,200
doing very well get way better.

1361
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:25,591
It was like,

1362
00:45:25,591 --> 00:45:26,670
well they never had a plan.

1363
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:29,130
So they make a halfhearted plant.

1364
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:29,730
He's like,

1365
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,810
they're way better.

1366
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,033
Well,

1367
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,450
so that's something to think about.

1368
00:45:33,451 --> 00:45:36,590
You don't want to take care of yourself
because you should or because you're

1369
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,930
compassionate or cause it's a moral
or because you're compassionate.

1370
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:42,750
Let's say you want to take
care of yourself because,

1371
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:44,093
well this is,

1372
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:47,460
this is at the center of
things as far as I'm concerned,

1373
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,720
and this is something I truly believe
despite my black heart and essential

1374
00:45:51,721 --> 00:45:53,320
pessimism is that you know,

1375
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,820
every human being is
a spectacular miracle.

1376
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,800
That's really the case.

1377
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,110
That's part of the secret.

1378
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,560
That's part of the secret of the West is
our legal system is predicated on that

1379
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:08,394
idea.

1380
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,550
It's predicated on the idea that
you're made in the image of God,

1381
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:12,300
let's say.

1382
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,300
And then even the law has to stay a
distance from you because you're just that

1383
00:46:17,401 --> 00:46:18,270
remarkable.

1384
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,430
And I believe that that's as close.

1385
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:23,460
That's literally true and
metaphorically true at the same time.

1386
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:26,790
And I think that everyone knows this
because if you don't treat yourself like

1387
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:27,270
that,

1388
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,620
you don't do very well.

1389
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:32,240
And if you have friends or family members
and you don't treat them like that's

1390
00:46:32,250 --> 00:46:32,790
true,

1391
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,500
they don't like him very much.

1392
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,780
And if you organize a society on
axiomatic principals that don't,

1393
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:44,940
that don't include that idea that
those societies become unproductive and

1394
00:46:44,941 --> 00:46:47,340
murderous almost instantly.

1395
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:49,230
And so to me that indicates this.

1396
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,120
There's something true about that.

1397
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,950
Let's call it metaphysical claim.

1398
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,121
And if it's true,

1399
00:46:54,121 --> 00:46:56,460
well then you have an obligation
to take care of yourself.

1400
00:46:56,461 --> 00:46:58,500
And it's not just for you.

1401
00:46:59,010 --> 00:46:59,671
That's the thing.

1402
00:46:59,671 --> 00:47:01,260
It's not selfish exactly.

1403
00:47:01,261 --> 00:47:03,600
Although it is because you
should take care of yourself.

1404
00:47:03,601 --> 00:47:07,050
But if you don't take care of yourself
then like what the hell are you to your

1405
00:47:07,051 --> 00:47:07,884
family,

1406
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:08,791
you know,

1407
00:47:08,791 --> 00:47:10,800
and what are you good are
you to your community?

1408
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,520
And it's like you might be
really useful to your family.

1409
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:15,421
You never know.

1410
00:47:15,421 --> 00:47:15,691
You know,

1411
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:19,920
you might be that the thing that stands
in between them and some catastrophe and

1412
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:20,641
for all you know,

1413
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:21,660
you might be that,

1414
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:26,690
that thing that stands in between
your society and that catastrophe.

1415
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,440
And I actually think that that's the case.

1416
00:47:29,441 --> 00:47:29,651
You know,

1417
00:47:29,651 --> 00:47:34,030
I read the great commentators on
the 20th century catastrophes,

1418
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:39,060
right and left wing alike and the really
profound ones all say the same thing.

1419
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,470
Society's degenerate it to hell.

1420
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:44,350
When individuals abdicate
their moral responsibility.

1421
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:49,900
It's like there's a direct connection
between you stepping up to the plate,

1422
00:47:49,901 --> 00:47:50,291
say it,

1423
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:53,590
relationship to yourself at
the stability of the world.

1424
00:47:53,591 --> 00:47:55,240
And I actually think it goes beyond that.

1425
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:56,890
I truly believe this.

1426
00:47:57,190 --> 00:48:01,060
I think we don't construe
who we are properly.

1427
00:48:01,061 --> 00:48:01,540
We don't know.

1428
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,940
We don't articulate it properly
even though we act it out.

1429
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,300
I think that what you confront in life
is something like an infinite landscape

1430
00:48:09,341 --> 00:48:10,210
of potential.

1431
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:11,530
That's the future.

1432
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,140
You don't live in the present,

1433
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,270
the presence already here and the past.

1434
00:48:16,271 --> 00:48:17,140
It's too late,

1435
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,710
but the future is right in
front of you and you're,

1436
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,320
you're interacting with
that potential future.

1437
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:27,100
It could go this way or it could go that
way and you can see those potentials

1438
00:48:27,101 --> 00:48:30,970
manifest themselves in front of you and
you make these decisions about which

1439
00:48:30,971 --> 00:48:34,270
part of that you're going to
make into concrete reality.

1440
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,610
And so I don't think that it's just,

1441
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,330
it isn't just your stability
that your decisions depending on,

1442
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,600
it's not just your family's
stability and flourishing.

1443
00:48:43,601 --> 00:48:45,160
It's not just society.

1444
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:45,820
It's not.

1445
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:48,280
Those are all important
things and they all stack up.

1446
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:53,230
I think that you play a role in directing
the structure of reality itself,

1447
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,360
and I think you bloody well know that.

1448
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,670
And we call each other on
it all the time saying,

1449
00:48:57,671 --> 00:48:59,530
you're not living up to your possibility.

1450
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,360
You're not living up to your potential.

1451
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:02,201
It's like,

1452
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:03,430
what the hell does that mean?

1453
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,440
Everyone says it.

1454
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:08,800
Everyone's embarrassed
because they know it's true.

1455
00:49:08,830 --> 00:49:09,910
You're not living up to your party.

1456
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:10,680
I know.

1457
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:10,990
God.

1458
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:11,823
You know,

1459
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:12,371
I know.

1460
00:49:12,371 --> 00:49:13,030
I know.

1461
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,350
Don't bother me about it.

1462
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,900
It's like you're ashamed of that.

1463
00:49:17,010 --> 00:49:17,140
Well,

1464
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,940
why wouldn't you be ashamed of it?

1465
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,320
You are.

1466
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:21,523
Why?

1467
00:49:22,210 --> 00:49:22,331
Well,

1468
00:49:22,331 --> 00:49:23,920
because it actually matters.

1469
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,750
Like it really matters unless you think
that it's okay for things to degenerate

1470
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,090
and we'll talk about that
in a little it a little bit.

1471
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:32,620
So that's rule too.

1472
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:34,510
It's like that's worth and like,

1473
00:49:34,511 --> 00:49:34,781
look,

1474
00:49:34,781 --> 00:49:39,781
I came to this realization it wasn't an
easy realization to come to you because

1475
00:49:39,881 --> 00:49:41,680
it just doesn't seem that self evident.

1476
00:49:41,710 --> 00:49:44,650
But I'm telling you when people like
Viktor Frankl and Alexandra social

1477
00:49:44,651 --> 00:49:45,430
medicine,

1478
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:50,430
Vaclav Havel people who really grappled
with the horrors of the 20th century,

1479
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:54,220
trying to understand how a society
like East Germany could emerge,

1480
00:49:54,221 --> 00:49:57,160
where one in three people
was a government informer.

1481
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:01,420
Imagine that you get six people in your
family and two of them are informing on

1482
00:50:01,421 --> 00:50:02,320
you to the government.

1483
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,640
How does the society,

1484
00:50:03,730 --> 00:50:04,840
how does that happen?

1485
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:05,981
Well,

1486
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:09,400
it happens because if the individuals
in the society abdicated their moral

1487
00:50:09,401 --> 00:50:10,234
responsibility,

1488
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:11,590
that's how it happens.

1489
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,371
You might take.

1490
00:50:12,371 --> 00:50:12,581
Well,

1491
00:50:12,581 --> 00:50:14,380
a lot of people have to do that.

1492
00:50:14,381 --> 00:50:15,010
It's like,

1493
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:15,580
yeah,

1494
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,650
we don't know how many people
have to do that before.

1495
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:22,651
Things tilt seriously sideways and it
might not have to be that many and it does

1496
00:50:23,081 --> 00:50:23,914
matter.

1497
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,840
I see people,

1498
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:27,170
this is actually,

1499
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:29,240
I decided to do what I
did with regards to these.

1500
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,720
He stamps on compelled speech in Canada.

1501
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:33,200
You know,

1502
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,100
people would be panicking,

1503
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:44,680
patted me on my dock for
my bravery and I'm saying,

1504
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:44,891
no,

1505
00:50:44,891 --> 00:50:45,580
no you don't.

1506
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:46,590
You don't have to stamp.

1507
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,610
It's like it's not bravery.

1508
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,740
It's fear of the right things.

1509
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,300
That's wisdom.

1510
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,030
Wisdom is fear of the right things.

1511
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:00,430
You think what you think that it's
dangerous to say what you have to say.

1512
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,760
But say he just tried not
saying what you have to say.

1513
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:07,000
He just tried out for 10 years
and see where the hell you go.

1514
00:51:07,210 --> 00:51:09,490
Because every time you
have something to say,

1515
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,960
which is something to live right,

1516
00:51:10,961 --> 00:51:12,040
there's no difference.

1517
00:51:12,130 --> 00:51:12,963
There's no difference.

1518
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,060
Every time you have something
to say something to live in,

1519
00:51:16,061 --> 00:51:17,650
you step backwards.

1520
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,510
Well,

1521
00:51:18,510 --> 00:51:19,780
they don't want to cause any trouble,

1522
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:20,051
you know?

1523
00:51:20,051 --> 00:51:20,770
And Fair enough.

1524
00:51:20,770 --> 00:51:21,011
You know,

1525
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,990
because don't go causing too much trouble,

1526
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:24,690
but it's cleaning out you.

1527
00:51:24,691 --> 00:51:25,630
You have something to say.

1528
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:25,991
It's like,

1529
00:51:25,991 --> 00:51:26,350
no,

1530
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:28,000
I don't need to do what.

1531
00:51:28,001 --> 00:51:29,290
I don't want the conflict.

1532
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:30,250
I don't want the trouble.

1533
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:30,940
It's like fine,

1534
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:31,541
no problem.

1535
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:32,374
No problem.

1536
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,790
You're an inch shorter.

1537
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,880
And the people who are conspiring,

1538
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:41,881
let's say against your essential best
interests are three inches taller.

1539
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:43,600
You think no will see it.

1540
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:44,770
See something in the future.

1541
00:51:44,771 --> 00:51:48,040
It's no you won't because you'll end
up an inch tall facing a monster.

1542
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:50,410
And if you can't speak now,

1543
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:53,970
what the hell makes you think you're
going to speak when that is the situation?

1544
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:58,680
[inaudible]

1545
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,743
so when

1546
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:05,340
you started it

1547
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:06,173
to oppose,

1548
00:52:06,450 --> 00:52:08,530
would I decided to
oppose this legislation?

1549
00:52:08,531 --> 00:52:09,364
I thought,

1550
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,453
well I got,

1551
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:11,823
you know,

1552
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:16,950
catastrophe to the left could catastrophe
to the right and that's good thing to

1553
00:52:16,951 --> 00:52:17,790
know about life.

1554
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:21,160
That's a good thing to
know is that lots of times,

1555
00:52:21,161 --> 00:52:22,020
so that's what you've got.

1556
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:24,840
There is no easy way forward.

1557
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,460
There is no easy way forward in life,

1558
00:52:26,461 --> 00:52:28,350
period that that just doesn't exist.

1559
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,000
You get to pick your catastrophe.

1560
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:35,310
And I knew by that point that I'd rather
have the catastrophe of say what I have

1561
00:52:35,311 --> 00:52:37,620
to say that in the
catastrophe of not saying it.

1562
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,270
And that's not bravery.

1563
00:52:39,271 --> 00:52:40,140
It's just why do you,

1564
00:52:40,141 --> 00:52:40,560
well,

1565
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,390
it's openminded attention,

1566
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,050
right?

1567
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,520
It's like it's,

1568
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:48,600
it's wisdom garnered from looking
at how things go catastrophic.

1569
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,260
Raul and deciding that I'd
rather not participate in that.

1570
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,713
So,

1571
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,390
so brutal.

1572
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,300
Three,

1573
00:53:01,870 --> 00:53:04,000
make friends with the people
who want the best for you.

1574
00:53:05,810 --> 00:53:07,280
That's a hard chapter.

1575
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:11,390
You don't because it's an extension
of the moral obligation idea.

1576
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:11,991
This,

1577
00:53:11,991 --> 00:53:16,520
this psychologist named Carl Rogers
and Carl Rogers had this idea that in

1578
00:53:16,521 --> 00:53:20,780
therapy you should have unconditional
positive regard for your clients.

1579
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:22,910
And he didn't really act that way.

1580
00:53:22,911 --> 00:53:24,290
And that's because you actually can't.

1581
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:24,810
And,

1582
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:24,960
but,

1583
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,520
but there was something
about what Roger said was,

1584
00:53:27,521 --> 00:53:28,354
was right.

1585
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,500
It wasn't formulated quite right here.

1586
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,273
You want to have,

1587
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,270
so I reformulated and I think I
got a closer to what it should be.

1588
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:40,890
When I see my clinical clients or when
I interact with people in general,

1589
00:53:40,891 --> 00:53:42,210
what I try to do is to take,

1590
00:53:42,211 --> 00:53:42,780
well,

1591
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:45,570
there's part of you working for you and
there's part of you that isn't working

1592
00:53:45,571 --> 00:53:46,140
for you.

1593
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,350
That's that eternal divide
in the human psyche.

1594
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:49,651
Right?

1595
00:53:49,651 --> 00:53:52,800
There's a division in all of us
between good and evil essentially,

1596
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,150
which is a real division.

1597
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:55,560
It's a real division,

1598
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:56,550
that's for sure.

1599
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,690
What I want to be with my clients is I
want to be on the side of the part of

1600
00:54:00,691 --> 00:54:05,310
them that's on their side and I'm not on
the side of the part of them that's not

1601
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:07,140
on their side at all.

1602
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:07,531
It's right.

1603
00:54:07,531 --> 00:54:09,180
That part can just go,

1604
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,570
that part can just go to hell.

1605
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:13,650
Right,

1606
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:13,981
right.

1607
00:54:13,981 --> 00:54:18,420
Which is where it's headed and so and
that's the thing that you also want from

1608
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,380
your friends.

1609
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:20,541
I think again,

1610
00:54:20,541 --> 00:54:23,550
that that falls under the
rubric of moral obligation.

1611
00:54:23,850 --> 00:54:24,091
You know,

1612
00:54:24,091 --> 00:54:25,860
you want to have friends.

1613
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,450
This doesn't mean you
shouldn't help people.

1614
00:54:27,451 --> 00:54:28,680
That that isn't what I mean.

1615
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:32,070
I don't mean that at all because
everybody needs a hand from time to time.

1616
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,473
But

1617
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:39,620
you are obliged to surround yourself
with people who are aiming up

1618
00:54:41,310 --> 00:54:41,940
fundamentally,

1619
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,440
even in their flawed way.

1620
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:43,741
You know,

1621
00:54:43,741 --> 00:54:45,660
like everybody's got their problems,

1622
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:48,510
but you're obliged to be around
people that are aiming up.

1623
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:49,860
If you're not.

1624
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,310
Part of that is you don't want the ethical
burden of surrounding yourself with

1625
00:54:53,311 --> 00:54:55,590
people who are aiming up
cause they make you look bad.

1626
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,410
And that's not an excuse to have
friends that aren't good for you.

1627
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,280
It's also not an excuse to have family
members that aren't good for you.

1628
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:02,551
You know,

1629
00:55:02,551 --> 00:55:06,360
and I've had did my clinical practice
and in particular I've had situations

1630
00:55:06,361 --> 00:55:10,470
where the best thing for my client to
do was to cut themselves off from almost

1631
00:55:10,471 --> 00:55:12,240
all of their family almost completely.

1632
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:17,040
There was just no other possible way
because they were surrounded by people who

1633
00:55:17,041 --> 00:55:20,430
were hell bent on destruction.

1634
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:22,470
And so you think,

1635
00:55:22,471 --> 00:55:22,681
well,

1636
00:55:22,681 --> 00:55:24,120
you know these people you love.

1637
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:24,570
It's like,

1638
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:25,050
yeah,

1639
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:25,650
fair enough.

1640
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:26,310
You know,

1641
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:27,001
I get that.

1642
00:55:27,001 --> 00:55:29,250
And it's no fun being
alone and it's no fun.

1643
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:33,420
Distancing yourself from
people you love that hate you.

1644
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:34,823
But,

1645
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:36,923
but,

1646
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:37,793
but

1647
00:55:42,170 --> 00:55:42,750
okay.

1648
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,380
And so that's rule of three and he's like,

1649
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:47,110
what's a hard book?

1650
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:47,710
This one?

1651
00:55:47,710 --> 00:55:48,501
So Harsh Cook,

1652
00:55:48,501 --> 00:55:49,334
Huh?

1653
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,530
Rule for,

1654
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:00,650
compare yourself to who

1655
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:03,800
you were yesterday,

1656
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:06,410
not to who's someone else's today.

1657
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,860
So I formulated that rule because,

1658
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:12,560
because I'm just thinking
about hierarchy again.

1659
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,710
So we already talked about
the downside of new hierarchy.

1660
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:19,430
The downside is while there's some people
on the top and there's some people at

1661
00:56:19,431 --> 00:56:22,430
the bottom and the bottom
is a painful place to be.

1662
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:26,800
And so what are the consequences of
erecting a hierarchy is that you erect a

1663
00:56:26,801 --> 00:56:30,280
structure of inequality and then that
can get really steep and out of control.

1664
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:31,360
That's a big risk,

1665
00:56:31,361 --> 00:56:31,990
right?

1666
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:32,651
So you might think,

1667
00:56:32,651 --> 00:56:32,861
well,

1668
00:56:32,861 --> 00:56:35,230
let's get flat and the hierarchies,

1669
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,210
so everyone's equal.

1670
00:56:37,900 --> 00:56:38,711
Well then you think,

1671
00:56:38,711 --> 00:56:38,891
well,

1672
00:56:38,891 --> 00:56:39,724
first of all,

1673
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,020
you really,

1674
00:56:41,930 --> 00:56:43,540
you want to flatten all the hierarchy,

1675
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,410
which hierarchies you can leave in time,

1676
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:46,323
any of them.

1677
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,090
You should be no differences
between people at all,

1678
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:50,073
really?

1679
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,670
Or we're going to draw some line.

1680
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:54,520
There were some differences are okay
at other differences aren't okay.

1681
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:56,080
Who's going to draw those lines?

1682
00:56:56,081 --> 00:56:56,914
Exactly.

1683
00:56:56,950 --> 00:57:01,210
I mean exactly who's going to draw those
lines and answer that is the people

1684
00:57:01,211 --> 00:57:03,130
that you least want to draw those lines,

1685
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,400
that'll be the answer because they'll
be the only ones interested in doing it.

1686
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,273
So,

1687
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,340
but then,

1688
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,350
but we can give more deeply into it too.

1689
00:57:14,351 --> 00:57:15,010
So here,

1690
00:57:15,010 --> 00:57:15,551
here's a,

1691
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:16,300
here's a,

1692
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,310
here's a peculiarity about human beings.

1693
00:57:18,550 --> 00:57:19,810
So we could start from,

1694
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:22,390
we can start from a dark place,

1695
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:23,950
cause that's always realistic.

1696
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,640
People believe in dark places,

1697
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:25,870
man.

1698
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,000
Everyone believes you
believe in your pain.

1699
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,730
No one doesn't believe in their pain,

1700
00:57:31,270 --> 00:57:31,810
right?

1701
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,900
Nobody's an agnostic with
regards to their pain.

1702
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:37,210
Everyone believes that
it's real or acts like it.

1703
00:57:37,211 --> 00:57:39,820
So we could start their life is painful,

1704
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:40,840
had PR it.

1705
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,130
It's emotionally painful,

1706
00:57:42,131 --> 00:57:43,600
it's anxiety provoking.

1707
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:45,700
And then of course there's
the malevolence aspect,

1708
00:57:45,701 --> 00:57:46,840
which makes it even worse.

1709
00:57:46,841 --> 00:57:50,470
And so that's the baseline
and you're stuck with it.

1710
00:57:50,580 --> 00:57:53,260
And there are times when it
will become excruciating,

1711
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:53,591
right?

1712
00:57:53,591 --> 00:57:55,300
To the point of being unbearable.

1713
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:55,781
You know,

1714
00:57:55,781 --> 00:57:58,180
you see people fight at a death bed.

1715
00:57:58,270 --> 00:58:01,180
That's a good example of a nice
combination of catastrophe.

1716
00:58:01,181 --> 00:58:02,110
And malevolence right?

1717
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,640
Because it's already pretty bad.

1718
00:58:03,641 --> 00:58:05,410
Someone's dying and that's bad.

1719
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:05,741
It's like,

1720
00:58:05,741 --> 00:58:06,001
yeah,

1721
00:58:06,001 --> 00:58:08,800
but little work you can
make it a lot worse.

1722
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:12,970
So I've often wondered,

1723
00:58:12,971 --> 00:58:13,241
you know,

1724
00:58:13,241 --> 00:58:16,840
just exactly what would be left of the
tragedy of life if people just didn't

1725
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:18,130
make things worse.

1726
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,540
And one of the things I have observed as
a clinician is that people can tolerate

1727
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:23,710
quite a lot of tragedy,

1728
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:29,430
but they can't tolerate very much having
everyone make it worse just for the

1729
00:58:29,441 --> 00:58:31,210
sake of making it worse.

1730
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:31,901
Right.

1731
00:58:31,901 --> 00:58:35,590
And that really hurts people if you're
around people who are bringing you down

1732
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,320
just for the sake of seeing you suffer,

1733
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:40,750
that really does hurt people a lot.

1734
00:58:40,810 --> 00:58:41,630
That's my level.

1735
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:41,721
It's,

1736
00:58:41,721 --> 00:58:46,060
I think that's the best definition of
evil really is to produce suffering for

1737
00:58:46,061 --> 00:58:47,260
the sake of the suffering.

1738
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,730
It's like an art form.

1739
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:49,991
It really is.

1740
00:58:49,991 --> 00:58:51,210
It's the right way to think about it.

1741
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:53,320
People don't like to think
that way because well,

1742
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,370
for obvious reasons,

1743
00:58:54,371 --> 00:58:56,110
like who would make an art form of evil?

1744
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:56,680
It's like,

1745
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,340
how about the guy who shot up the
elementary school in Connecticut?

1746
00:59:00,850 --> 00:59:01,683
How about him?

1747
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,060
You don't think that was
an artistic statement.

1748
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,980
You just don't have
the imagination for it.

1749
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:07,180
If you don't think that,

1750
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:07,391
I mean,

1751
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,230
just think about it,

1752
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:08,981
right?

1753
00:59:08,981 --> 00:59:12,490
You're going to make an artistic statement
that's associated with malevolence.

1754
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,001
Well,

1755
00:59:13,001 --> 00:59:14,260
who are you going to hurt?

1756
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:15,460
Well on?

1757
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:16,270
Not adults.

1758
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:16,511
These,

1759
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:18,760
they're guilty of
something for God's sake.

1760
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:20,410
You don't want to go after the adults,

1761
00:59:20,411 --> 00:59:22,130
even if they're innocent adults.

1762
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:22,461
No,

1763
00:59:22,461 --> 00:59:23,690
he'd go after children,

1764
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:25,400
elementary school children.

1765
00:59:25,430 --> 00:59:28,220
You really want to make a
statement that's malevolent.

1766
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,670
Then you do the worst thing he could
think of to the people who deserve it the

1767
00:59:31,671 --> 00:59:32,504
least.

1768
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,570
And if you don't think that there's
an aesthetic element to that,

1769
00:59:35,571 --> 00:59:39,020
like a considered a deeply
considered aesthetic element,

1770
00:59:39,230 --> 00:59:43,990
then well then you have thought about it
very much and I can understand why he's

1771
00:59:43,991 --> 00:59:44,151
like,

1772
00:59:44,151 --> 00:59:45,400
who wants to think that way?

1773
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:46,311
But you know,

1774
00:59:46,311 --> 00:59:50,610
we need to understand these things
because they keep happening and,

1775
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:53,680
and you don't understand them
without going very dark places.

1776
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:57,470
Chapter six in my book is called putting
your house in perfect order before you

1777
00:59:57,471 --> 00:59:58,340
criticize the world.

1778
00:59:58,341 --> 01:00:00,730
And it's actually about
the mass murderers.

1779
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:03,140
And why they do what they do.

1780
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:04,910
And I know why they do what they do.

1781
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:06,980
I'm actually make a case
for it in the chapter.

1782
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:07,460
It's like,

1783
01:00:07,460 --> 01:00:08,210
here's the reason,

1784
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,370
here's it's perfectly understandable.

1785
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:11,660
Life is very,

1786
01:00:11,661 --> 01:00:12,260
very,

1787
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:16,400
very difficult and it's often unfair and
were brutalized at the hands of other

1788
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:17,090
people.

1789
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,960
It's like that's enough to produce resent,

1790
01:00:18,961 --> 01:00:21,020
but even the people who are doing well,

1791
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:24,730
but there are people who are not doing
so well and they've had pretty damn roof

1792
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:28,230
lights and may be brutalized the law
and their lights and being trashed to

1793
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:31,670
tragic and they beat
betrayed and they get really,

1794
01:00:31,671 --> 01:00:32,390
really,

1795
01:00:32,390 --> 01:00:35,710
really bitter about it and
not the sort of better that,

1796
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:36,110
you know,

1797
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:40,370
it keeps you up for a night or to be an
angry but the kind of bitter that keeps

1798
01:00:40,371 --> 01:00:44,570
you in your mother's basement for like
two years doing nothing but fantasizing

1799
01:00:44,571 --> 01:00:46,400
about how you'd like
to take for advantage.

1800
01:00:46,940 --> 01:00:51,650
You could give some pretty terrible
places with two years of sustained effort

1801
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:53,090
and there's a reason for it.

1802
01:00:53,091 --> 01:00:54,410
There's a reason driving it.

1803
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,810
You know what the reason is is well,

1804
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:57,980
in escapable brutality of life,

1805
01:00:58,960 --> 01:00:59,360
well,

1806
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,021
there's a reason,

1807
01:01:00,021 --> 01:01:04,250
but there's no excuse for it because
just because things are terrible doesn't

1808
01:01:04,251 --> 01:01:06,650
mean that you're justified
in making them worse.

1809
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:07,311
So,

1810
01:01:07,311 --> 01:01:09,260
and that's another central element,

1811
01:01:09,261 --> 01:01:11,770
I would say up the ethic
that has to unite us.

1812
01:01:11,790 --> 01:01:12,380
No,

1813
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:15,980
you don't have the right to use your
tragedy to make the world a worse place.

1814
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:23,080
[inaudible]

1815
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:25,360
say that.

1816
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:25,990
I say that.

1817
01:01:25,990 --> 01:01:30,580
I don't say that lightly because I know
that people can have brutally difficult

1818
01:01:30,581 --> 01:01:32,100
lives and it's,

1819
01:01:32,101 --> 01:01:37,101
some people have lives that are so
brutally difficult that it's almost done

1820
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:38,773
imaginable.

1821
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,970
But some of those people,

1822
01:01:39,971 --> 01:01:41,190
and I've met people like that,

1823
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,830
they've had lives so
difficult that you just can't,

1824
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,420
you can hardly imagine it.

1825
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:47,020
You know,

1826
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:49,960
almost everything about
their life is a catastrophe.

1827
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:51,240
I met this one woman,

1828
01:01:51,241 --> 01:01:52,870
I won't tell you quick story about her.

1829
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:54,700
She was an amazing person.

1830
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:56,740
So she,

1831
01:01:56,800 --> 01:02:01,090
I met her in this outpatient
clinic I worked with,

1832
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:01,961
worked for us,

1833
01:02:01,961 --> 01:02:06,961
the Douglas Hospital at Montreal and
the Douglas Hospital as an inpatient

1834
01:02:07,751 --> 01:02:11,070
psychiatric hospital that was
building in the mid 20th century.

1835
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,540
It had hundreds and hundreds
of inmates at one point,

1836
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:14,291
patients,

1837
01:02:14,291 --> 01:02:14,920
let's say,

1838
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,450
but they were all basically released in
the 60s during deinstitutionalization

1839
01:02:19,740 --> 01:02:21,800
psychiatric drugs started
to become popular.

1840
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:22,670
Some of that was good,

1841
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:23,810
some of it wasn't so good,

1842
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,870
but there were some patients left at the
Douglas Hospital and they were people

1843
01:02:27,871 --> 01:02:30,780
who were so badly damaged that they
couldn't be the institutionalized.

1844
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,530
And what you've seen street people and
you know how bad the damage they are.

1845
01:02:34,531 --> 01:02:35,820
They at the institutionalized.

1846
01:02:35,821 --> 01:02:40,821
So just imagine for a minute how badly
damaged you would have to be to not be

1847
01:02:42,090 --> 01:02:43,710
deinstitutionalized.

1848
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,770
I don't know if you've ever
seen photographs by Diane Arbus.

1849
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:49,950
She went across the United States
and photograph people who were,

1850
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:53,970
well there were strange and and
hurt people generally speaking.

1851
01:02:53,971 --> 01:02:56,050
And the the,

1852
01:02:56,090 --> 01:02:57,870
the people who were left at the Douglas,

1853
01:02:57,871 --> 01:02:58,350
they were,

1854
01:02:58,350 --> 01:02:59,310
they were like Diane,

1855
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:02,220
Diane Arbus photographic subjects,

1856
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:07,250
so hurt and so destroyed by
decades of mental illness and they,

1857
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:10,590
the buildings and the Douglas Hospital.

1858
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,870
We're connected by underground passages,

1859
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,390
partly because it's so bloody
cold in Montreal and winter.

1860
01:03:15,391 --> 01:03:17,880
You didn't want everybody freezing to
death when they were moving from one

1861
01:03:17,881 --> 01:03:18,714
building to another.

1862
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,750
There are a lot of vending
machines and so forth downstairs,

1863
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:23,880
and that's where the
inpatients would congregate.

1864
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:24,750
And walking through there,

1865
01:03:24,751 --> 01:03:26,850
it was like walking
through Dante's inferno,

1866
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:28,080
like it was a real,

1867
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:31,060
it was really well as surreal.

1868
01:03:31,080 --> 01:03:32,520
Like there's no other way to put it.

1869
01:03:32,560 --> 01:03:34,800
I took my brother with me once he,

1870
01:03:34,801 --> 01:03:34,890
well,

1871
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:36,590
he wasn't accustomed to
this sort of thing at all.

1872
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:37,830
It just shell shocked him,

1873
01:03:37,831 --> 01:03:38,111
you know,

1874
01:03:38,111 --> 01:03:39,090
and no wonder.

1875
01:03:39,091 --> 01:03:41,100
So these people were in very rough shape.

1876
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:41,521
Anyways,

1877
01:03:41,521 --> 01:03:42,630
this woman came to see me,

1878
01:03:42,631 --> 01:03:46,320
I have to at the outpatient clinic
and so she had her problems,

1879
01:03:46,321 --> 01:03:47,154
but she wasn't,

1880
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:50,580
they weren't severe enough so that she
was an institutionalized inpatient,

1881
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,270
but she had her problem with span.

1882
01:03:52,271 --> 01:03:54,330
So she kind of looked
like a street person.

1883
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:57,990
She had this red down jacket on.

1884
01:03:57,991 --> 01:04:01,530
It was really dirty and her clothes
were dirty and she wasn't an attractive

1885
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:01,891
person.

1886
01:04:01,891 --> 01:04:06,891
And she was the young person and she was
so shy that like shy doesn't even begin

1887
01:04:08,041 --> 01:04:08,570
to,

1888
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:09,570
to describe it.

1889
01:04:09,570 --> 01:04:11,730
Like she was a whole universe of shy.

1890
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:15,090
So she would walk up to people like this.

1891
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:18,270
It was like she couldn't stand the
light that was emanating from him.

1892
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:21,030
She was so shy that that
was the best she could do,

1893
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:21,923
you know,

1894
01:04:22,020 --> 01:04:22,260
to,

1895
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,640
to approach someone like this.

1896
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,510
Of course,

1897
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:26,790
if she's out on the street
approaching people like this,

1898
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:29,160
it's like she's not getting
a positive response,

1899
01:04:29,161 --> 01:04:29,431
you know,

1900
01:04:29,431 --> 01:04:31,710
because people don't know
what the hell to make of that.

1901
01:04:31,711 --> 01:04:33,680
Especially because
she's also uncapped him,

1902
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:34,411
you know,

1903
01:04:34,411 --> 01:04:34,621
and,

1904
01:04:34,621 --> 01:04:37,440
and not very verbal and God.

1905
01:04:37,441 --> 01:04:40,410
So she came to see me and
we were trying to fish.

1906
01:04:40,411 --> 01:04:43,320
It wasn't very articulate
and she wasn't very bright,

1907
01:04:43,670 --> 01:04:44,503
um,

1908
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,061
at,

1909
01:04:45,061 --> 01:04:46,530
we're trying to figure
out what she wanted.

1910
01:04:46,531 --> 01:04:49,560
And so for a while what I was trying to
do is to get her to stand up a bit and

1911
01:04:49,561 --> 01:04:52,590
didn't take her hand away from her face
just so that she looked a little bit

1912
01:04:52,591 --> 01:04:55,560
more normal so that she had
a better chance of having,

1913
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:55,951
you know,

1914
01:04:55,951 --> 01:04:57,960
like a reasonable interaction with people.

1915
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,750
But I talked to her for awhile.

1916
01:04:59,910 --> 01:05:01,560
She told me a little bit about her life.

1917
01:05:01,590 --> 01:05:01,831
I mean,

1918
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:02,520
God,

1919
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:02,821
she was,

1920
01:05:02,821 --> 01:05:04,530
I've employed obviously,

1921
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:05,370
and her,

1922
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:09,870
she lived with her aunt who was like
deathly ill and her and her mom had a

1923
01:05:09,871 --> 01:05:14,250
boyfriend who was a violent schizophrenia
who was an alcoholic and all he ever

1924
01:05:14,251 --> 01:05:18,520
did was like harass her about
her being in league with Satan,

1925
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,460
which was just what you need when
you have all of those other problems.

1926
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:21,761
Right.

1927
01:05:21,761 --> 01:05:22,780
Because you know,

1928
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:24,393
anyways,

1929
01:05:24,940 --> 01:05:25,540
it was like,

1930
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:26,470
you just listen to this.

1931
01:05:26,471 --> 01:05:27,041
He's just like,

1932
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:28,000
Oh God.

1933
01:05:28,270 --> 01:05:28,541
It's like,

1934
01:05:28,541 --> 01:05:30,490
could this possibly be any worse?

1935
01:05:30,630 --> 01:05:31,960
And the answer is yes.

1936
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:34,670
It could be good to be worse even.

1937
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:35,720
But once,

1938
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:36,820
here's what she wanted.

1939
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:37,631
This is the thing.

1940
01:05:37,631 --> 01:05:38,170
When went to,

1941
01:05:38,170 --> 01:05:39,070
after I talked to her,

1942
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,590
like for five or six sessions,

1943
01:05:40,591 --> 01:05:44,170
it turned out she didn't even come to
the damn behavior therapy clinic to get

1944
01:05:44,171 --> 01:05:45,004
help.

1945
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:46,590
She didn't want hell.

1946
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,020
She had this dog and she
used to walk the dog around.

1947
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:56,280
She liked the dog and she had been in
the inpatient ward from time to time

1948
01:05:56,281 --> 01:05:57,980
because he's been
committed to the hospital,

1949
01:05:57,981 --> 01:05:58,550
you know,

1950
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:00,540
but then she went to the inpatient ward.

1951
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:04,250
She saw all these other people
who were worse off than her.

1952
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:05,270
It's hard to imagine,

1953
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:07,760
but that's what she saw.

1954
01:06:07,761 --> 01:06:10,790
She saw these people that were worse
off than her and what she wanted.

1955
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:14,660
She was trying to find somebody who is
an administrator at the hospital that

1956
01:06:14,661 --> 01:06:19,640
would give her permission to take one of
the inpatients out for a walk when she

1957
01:06:19,641 --> 01:06:23,120
wake to walk her dog and that one was her.

1958
01:06:23,210 --> 01:06:23,960
It's like,

1959
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:24,793
Jesus,

1960
01:06:27,170 --> 01:06:27,700
no right.

1961
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:28,533
Telling you.

1962
01:06:29,800 --> 01:06:31,120
When she told me that story,

1963
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:31,391
it's like,

1964
01:06:31,391 --> 01:06:34,720
I don't know what the hell you think of
someone like that because you know she

1965
01:06:34,721 --> 01:06:36,070
was so rude.

1966
01:06:36,071 --> 01:06:39,640
Did her presentation and she could see,

1967
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:42,400
she could see outside her own misery.

1968
01:06:42,460 --> 01:06:44,620
And as intense as it was,

1969
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:46,600
she could see outside their own misery.

1970
01:06:46,601 --> 01:06:47,830
And her decision was,

1971
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:48,640
well,

1972
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,360
maybe there's a way that I could make
something a little bit better for someone

1973
01:06:52,361 --> 01:06:53,260
worse off than me.

1974
01:06:53,530 --> 01:06:54,363
Wow.

1975
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,343
You know,

1976
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:57,160
I never forgot her.

1977
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:58,260
I'll never forget her.

1978
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,880
She just absolutely blew me away.

1979
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:01,983
Well,

1980
01:07:04,650 --> 01:07:05,483
what

1981
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:07,090
is it?

1982
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,220
The bigger person,

1983
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:09,430
she wasn't

1984
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:12,060
the bitter person by any
stretch of the imagination.

1985
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:13,411
Okay.

1986
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:13,591
Well,

1987
01:07:13,591 --> 01:07:14,840
so back to hierarchies.

1988
01:07:14,850 --> 01:07:15,150
Well,

1989
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,760
there's lots of ways that you
can be successful in a hierarchy,

1990
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:18,031
you know,

1991
01:07:18,031 --> 01:07:19,620
and she was asked to clean successful.

1992
01:07:19,621 --> 01:07:20,161
I would say it,

1993
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:20,881
that's for sure.

1994
01:07:20,881 --> 01:07:21,900
And that's really something.

1995
01:07:21,901 --> 01:07:23,700
And she didn't let her own suffering.

1996
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:24,890
Dominique,

1997
01:07:24,890 --> 01:07:27,090
her psychological reality and,

1998
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:32,310
and determined that the best move forward
was to extract revenge on the world.

1999
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:32,971
You know what?

2000
01:07:32,971 --> 01:07:34,540
She decided to play a straight game.

2001
01:07:34,541 --> 01:07:35,430
So there was something,

2002
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:35,851
you know,

2003
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:38,310
I hesitate to say st like about her,

2004
01:07:38,311 --> 01:07:39,270
but good God.

2005
01:07:39,271 --> 01:07:39,751
You know what I mean?

2006
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:44,751
She had everything you could possibly
imagine not going for her and still like

2007
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:45,960
how do you manage that?

2008
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:46,261
How do you,

2009
01:07:46,261 --> 01:07:46,940
how well you,

2010
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,600
as far as I could tell when he decide,

2011
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:50,100
like it's not that simple,

2012
01:07:50,101 --> 01:07:50,610
you know,

2013
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:53,490
but there's an element of
decision that goes into that.

2014
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:56,820
Maybe it's a thousand
decisions or 100,000 decisions,

2015
01:07:56,821 --> 01:07:57,041
you know,

2016
01:07:57,041 --> 01:08:01,530
a little tiny micro decisions that enables
someone to stay on the right side of

2017
01:08:01,531 --> 01:08:04,200
reality even though so many things
are stacked up against them.

2018
01:08:05,950 --> 01:08:06,550
Well,

2019
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,020
so she wasn't bitter.

2020
01:08:08,170 --> 01:08:08,560
Okay,

2021
01:08:08,560 --> 01:08:10,720
well back to the hierarchy or idea.

2022
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,040
Well

2023
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:15,083
life is full of,

2024
01:08:15,770 --> 01:08:16,100
right.

2025
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:17,450
We've already established that.

2026
01:08:17,530 --> 01:08:19,100
And the question is what do you have to,

2027
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:20,780
to set against that?

2028
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:24,800
What do you have to set against that is
actually what hierarchies provide for

2029
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:25,370
you.

2030
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:29,840
So because you can't set
happiness against tragedy,

2031
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,840
that doesn't work because you're
not happy when there's a tragedy.

2032
01:08:32,841 --> 01:08:34,420
And so that just doesn't work right?

2033
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,680
You're not going to be
happy all that often.

2034
01:08:36,681 --> 01:08:39,710
And when it come to like that's really
good and all of that and you should enjoy

2035
01:08:39,711 --> 01:08:41,000
it and thank God for it.

2036
01:08:41,001 --> 01:08:41,661
And all of that,

2037
01:08:41,661 --> 01:08:45,930
but you can't use it as
a has a boat in a storm.

2038
01:08:45,980 --> 01:08:47,180
Like that's not happening.

2039
01:08:47,270 --> 01:08:48,560
You got to have something else.

2040
01:08:49,190 --> 01:08:50,023
Well,

2041
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:53,550
the thing about a hierarchy of value
hierarchy because it will hierarchies,

2042
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:54,890
value hierarchies.

2043
01:08:54,950 --> 01:08:57,970
Something at the top is better and
something at the board of his worst.

2044
01:08:57,980 --> 01:08:59,090
That's really what defines her.

2045
01:08:59,090 --> 01:09:03,940
Her key is having a hierarchy
gives you a name I'm giving you.

2046
01:09:03,941 --> 01:09:04,611
They give you name.

2047
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:06,710
It gives you a purpose
and like we know this,

2048
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,050
even we know this neuro biologically,

2049
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:09,913
let's say

2050
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:13,730
if the baseline condition
of life is suffering,

2051
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,560
you have to have something to offset
it and what do you have to offset it is

2052
01:09:18,561 --> 01:09:22,970
whatever value I hierarchy offers you
because you need something to aim at.

2053
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:26,750
You need something to a map that
makes the suffering worthwhile.

2054
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:27,983
That's like,

2055
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,390
that's like the meaning of life.

2056
01:09:29,391 --> 01:09:29,661
You say,

2057
01:09:29,661 --> 01:09:29,841
well,

2058
01:09:29,841 --> 01:09:30,740
what's the meaning of life?

2059
01:09:30,741 --> 01:09:33,840
It's to have something to end up that
makes the suffering worthwhile so that you

2060
01:09:33,841 --> 01:09:34,460
can,

2061
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:37,070
when you're in the midst
of your limited life,

2062
01:09:37,071 --> 01:09:37,904
you could say,

2063
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:38,481
yeah,

2064
01:09:38,481 --> 01:09:38,951
but this,

2065
01:09:38,951 --> 01:09:40,340
this is worthwhile.

2066
01:09:40,490 --> 01:09:41,420
This makes it worthwhile.

2067
01:09:41,421 --> 01:09:43,170
And it's not something
that you think exactly.

2068
01:09:43,171 --> 01:09:44,480
It's something you've noticed,

2069
01:09:44,900 --> 01:09:45,100
right?

2070
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:45,391
Cause you,

2071
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:49,490
you can watch your life for a
couple of weeks detached have,

2072
01:09:49,491 --> 01:09:50,510
you can watch and you can,

2073
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,380
you can ask yourself,

2074
01:09:51,381 --> 01:09:52,214
okay,

2075
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,240
when,

2076
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:54,860
where is it that I am,

2077
01:09:54,861 --> 01:09:57,530
when I'm doing something
that justifies itself?

2078
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:59,240
Maybe it's playing music.

2079
01:09:59,510 --> 01:10:01,640
That's often the case for people
that are listening to music.

2080
01:10:01,641 --> 01:10:04,610
Or maybe you're with someone you love or
maybe you're working on something that

2081
01:10:04,611 --> 01:10:05,690
you're really engaged in.

2082
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:06,221
I don't know.

2083
01:10:06,221 --> 01:10:07,580
What would it be different
for different people?

2084
01:10:07,581 --> 01:10:09,290
But you can be sure that you're having,

2085
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:12,680
if something worthwhile and you're
on the pathway to managing it.

2086
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:14,450
And that's the thing about human beings.

2087
01:10:14,451 --> 01:10:17,150
That's where we get our
positive emotion is we,

2088
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:20,640
we aim at something the time
and then we moved towards it.

2089
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,210
And if we see ourselves
successfully moving towards it,

2090
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:26,690
then that engages us with the
meeting that makes life worthwhile.

2091
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:31,250
And what that means is that if you don't
have a hierarchy of value and you don't

2092
01:10:31,251 --> 01:10:32,270
have anything to aim for,

2093
01:10:32,330 --> 01:10:34,280
then all you're left
with is stupid suffering.

2094
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:35,740
Because like,

2095
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,570
that's not eradicable right.

2096
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:41,510
There's no way of getting
rid of that quality be down.

2097
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:45,650
Like if everyone had everything
and we were all the same,

2098
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:45,881
what?

2099
01:10:45,881 --> 01:10:49,190
We'd still be suffering with the
burden of being human and being alive,

2100
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:53,150
that you're not getting rid of that
the only thing you could do without is

2101
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,260
justify it.

2102
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:59,980
And the only way you can justify
something that's that terrible is to be

2103
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:03,710
pursuing something that's good
enough to make that justifiable.

2104
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:04,190
Well,

2105
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,360
who knows what that will be.

2106
01:11:09,740 --> 01:11:10,740
I learned that partly,

2107
01:11:11,280 --> 01:11:11,910
strangely enough,

2108
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,740
I learned that partly
from watching Pinocchio,

2109
01:11:13,741 --> 01:11:15,270
which I spent a lot of time watching.

2110
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:18,420
I have a Youtube Video About Pinocchio,

2111
01:11:18,421 --> 01:11:21,660
and there's a scene in Tokyo
where it was a very strange story,

2112
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,960
and it's full of Biblical allegories
and deep myths and all sorts of things,

2113
01:11:24,961 --> 01:11:25,900
but there's a scene in,

2114
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,170
but Akio where'd you,

2115
01:11:27,171 --> 01:11:30,060
Japan lifts his eye up
and wishes on a star.

2116
01:11:30,390 --> 01:11:30,600
You know,

2117
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:34,200
any wishes that his puppet would
become a genuine human being?

2118
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:35,820
And that's a very deep idea.

2119
01:11:35,850 --> 01:11:40,440
But the whole way that's acted out is
extraordinarily telling because a star

2120
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,980
think a star or something
that glitters in the darkness,

2121
01:11:42,990 --> 01:11:43,580
right?

2122
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:47,280
It and it's part of the cosmos is
part of the eternal cosmic structure,

2123
01:11:47,281 --> 01:11:48,990
which you sense when you look up,

2124
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,350
right?

2125
01:11:49,350 --> 01:11:53,940
Everyone who looks into the night sky
has a sense of awe associated with

2126
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:55,170
confronting the infinite,

2127
01:11:55,171 --> 01:11:56,670
let's say something like that.

2128
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,430
So it started something that
partakes of the infinite and it's,

2129
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:00,990
it's above the horizon,

2130
01:12:01,490 --> 01:12:01,681
right?

2131
01:12:01,681 --> 01:12:03,360
So it's something you lift your eyes too.

2132
01:12:03,361 --> 01:12:04,800
So it's a high aim.

2133
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:07,830
And so what [inaudible] does
is take as the highest aim,

2134
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:08,933
the,

2135
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:13,890
the hope that the puppet that
he's created could become genuine.

2136
01:12:14,340 --> 01:12:17,010
And there's something about that
that's extraordinarily deep.

2137
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:18,690
I mean that's the hope
you have for a child,

2138
01:12:18,691 --> 01:12:19,770
if you have any sense,

2139
01:12:19,771 --> 01:12:23,790
is that the person grows up to become
an autonomous and fully functioning,

2140
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:24,660
responsible,

2141
01:12:24,661 --> 01:12:25,111
awake,

2142
01:12:25,111 --> 01:12:25,531
aware,

2143
01:12:25,531 --> 01:12:26,780
conscious human being.

2144
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:31,200
Not The puppet of some idiot belief
system or the puppet of any person,

2145
01:12:31,201 --> 01:12:36,000
but someone who who's admirable
and competent and truthful,

2146
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:36,930
all of those things,

2147
01:12:36,931 --> 01:12:38,040
that's a high aim.

2148
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:38,491
Well,

2149
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:40,740
that's an aim that maybe
would justify your life,

2150
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:41,101
say,

2151
01:12:41,101 --> 01:12:41,640
well,

2152
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:42,960
in the face of your suffering,

2153
01:12:42,961 --> 01:12:45,000
you have this terrible
cross to bear him and say,

2154
01:12:45,001 --> 01:12:45,300
well,

2155
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:49,020
who the hell could you be
in the face of all that?

2156
01:12:49,050 --> 01:12:52,290
You could be something strong enough
to bear it and hopefully that'd be

2157
01:12:52,291 --> 01:12:52,890
something.

2158
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,780
Who would you be if you were that person?

2159
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,330
God only knows it's really,

2160
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,310
it's a task fit for a cake.

2161
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:01,080
It really is because it's so,

2162
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:02,980
it's such an impossible thing to,

2163
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:05,220
to imagine yourself managing,

2164
01:13:06,150 --> 01:13:07,270
but yet here we are.

2165
01:13:07,310 --> 01:13:07,531
You know,

2166
01:13:07,531 --> 01:13:08,040
and that's,

2167
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,530
and that's what's in front
of us as our calling.

2168
01:13:10,950 --> 01:13:12,540
It's right in front of us.

2169
01:13:13,830 --> 01:13:14,011
Well,

2170
01:13:14,011 --> 01:13:16,380
you need a hierarchy because
you need something to,

2171
01:13:16,381 --> 01:13:16,770
hey man,

2172
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:19,020
you need something to aim
out to justify your life.

2173
01:13:19,050 --> 01:13:19,381
It's like,

2174
01:13:19,381 --> 01:13:19,680
well,

2175
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,040
the problem with the hierarchy is that
what maybe other people will attain more

2176
01:13:23,041 --> 01:13:24,840
than you and you get bitter and resentful.

2177
01:13:24,841 --> 01:13:25,141
It's like,

2178
01:13:25,141 --> 01:13:25,620
well,

2179
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:29,400
there's a way around that and this
maybe this is a way around resentment,

2180
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:30,240
which is a very,

2181
01:13:30,241 --> 01:13:30,990
very,

2182
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,560
very toxic emotion.

2183
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,413
It's like,

2184
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:34,553
you know,

2185
01:13:34,650 --> 01:13:35,131
if you want,

2186
01:13:35,131 --> 01:13:35,641
we all send,

2187
01:13:35,641 --> 01:13:38,220
there's going to be people Richard than
you and you're going to be annoyed about

2188
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:38,460
that.

2189
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:39,300
And if you want fame,

2190
01:13:39,301 --> 01:13:40,380
the same thing applies.

2191
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:44,910
And then track if there's
any unit dimensional system
of values is going to put

2192
01:13:44,911 --> 01:13:46,890
you in a position where
you're likely inferior.

2193
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:47,400
You know?

2194
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:50,010
And even if you manage to
Max out on one dimension,

2195
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,360
maybe you're wealthy of it,

2196
01:13:51,361 --> 01:13:53,310
you're still old and fat and bald.

2197
01:13:53,370 --> 01:13:55,980
It's like good luck fixing
that with your wealth.

2198
01:13:55,981 --> 01:13:56,550
You know,

2199
01:13:56,550 --> 01:14:01,110
you might be a little nip and tuck will
help but still isn't going to make you

2200
01:14:01,111 --> 01:14:01,830
younger.

2201
01:14:01,830 --> 01:14:03,300
So you're stuck with,

2202
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:07,200
the problem with erecting the hierarchy
is it produces the potential for

2203
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:08,034
resentment,

2204
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:09,180
but you need the hierarchy.

2205
01:14:09,210 --> 01:14:09,511
It's like,

2206
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:09,721
well,

2207
01:14:09,721 --> 01:14:11,040
so how do you deal with that?

2208
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:11,381
It's like,

2209
01:14:11,381 --> 01:14:12,214
well

2210
01:14:13,330 --> 01:14:16,570
maybe you're not supposed to be comparing
yourself to other people and there's

2211
01:14:16,571 --> 01:14:17,770
real reason not to,

2212
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:18,430
you know,

2213
01:14:18,430 --> 01:14:19,420
there really is.

2214
01:14:19,570 --> 01:14:22,720
Maybe when you're 60 you can compare
yourself to other 16 year olds,

2215
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:22,901
you know,

2216
01:14:22,901 --> 01:14:26,200
but by the time you're like 30
you might as well just give it up.

2217
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,000
Because you're a strange,

2218
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:32,820
when you're 30 you're like you're this
thing that no one else is really like

2219
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:35,580
every other 30 year old
is like that tailored.

2220
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:38,380
So like what are you doing comparing
yourself to those other people because

2221
01:14:38,530 --> 01:14:40,030
they're really not light to you.

2222
01:14:40,150 --> 01:14:40,371
And then,

2223
01:14:40,371 --> 01:14:40,811
I mean it did.

2224
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:44,380
I didn't notice this 30 is when it really
seems to kick in because he gives so

2225
01:14:44,381 --> 01:14:47,260
particular in your genetics,

2226
01:14:47,261 --> 01:14:48,220
your biology,

2227
01:14:48,221 --> 01:14:49,060
your history,

2228
01:14:49,061 --> 01:14:49,990
your education,

2229
01:14:49,991 --> 01:14:51,220
your proclivities,

2230
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:52,330
your experience,

2231
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:52,811
all of that,

2232
01:14:52,811 --> 01:14:57,180
it makes you a very unique thing
and multidimensionally unique thing.

2233
01:14:57,310 --> 01:14:59,500
How the hell are you going to
compare that to someone else?

2234
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:02,260
Pick one dimension and then fall short.

2235
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:03,670
Well that's not very bright.

2236
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:04,821
Like it's just fluff.

2237
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:05,381
Seriously.

2238
01:15:05,381 --> 01:15:07,780
It's not a very
sophisticated cognitive act,

2239
01:15:08,230 --> 01:15:09,010
but you need,

2240
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:13,150
you still need to see that there's a
better and you need to strive towards it.

2241
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,360
So you can always use
yourself as the hallmark.

2242
01:15:15,370 --> 01:15:17,500
It's like you kind of have
some sense as these are,

2243
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:22,330
as we've already discussed about how
useless and worthless you fundamentally

2244
01:15:22,331 --> 01:15:23,140
are.

2245
01:15:23,140 --> 01:15:24,700
You can use that as the hallmark.

2246
01:15:24,750 --> 01:15:27,730
It's like it is possible
to and what do this in my,

2247
01:15:27,820 --> 01:15:29,980
my behavior therapy practice all the time,

2248
01:15:29,981 --> 01:15:34,981
it's like you can probably make tomorrow
like one 10th of maybe 100th of a

2249
01:15:35,261 --> 01:15:36,970
percent better than today.

2250
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,560
You could probably do that.

2251
01:15:38,561 --> 01:15:40,660
There's some thing you could do,

2252
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:42,820
minor thing and I mean you should aim low.

2253
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:45,400
You really should because
then you're likely to do it.

2254
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:49,480
There's something you could aim at that's
kind of low that you probably do that

2255
01:15:49,481 --> 01:15:53,140
would make your life a tiny bit better
and so you'd be a better version of

2256
01:15:53,141 --> 01:15:54,040
yourself.

2257
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:57,790
But what's so cool about that is that
you don't have to do that for very long

2258
01:15:57,791 --> 01:15:58,601
before you get,

2259
01:15:58,601 --> 01:16:00,820
you start hitting the exponential gains.

2260
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:03,310
That's part of that
inequality distribution.

2261
01:16:03,311 --> 01:16:03,910
You know,

2262
01:16:03,910 --> 01:16:06,600
there's this idea inequalities.

2263
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:07,503
The funny thing,

2264
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:09,010
we talked about it already that you know,

2265
01:16:09,011 --> 01:16:12,550
a tiny percentage of people tend
to take everything in every game.

2266
01:16:13,210 --> 01:16:14,470
It doesn't matter what the game is,

2267
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:15,100
by the way,

2268
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:16,810
it happens in pretty much every game.

2269
01:16:17,470 --> 01:16:20,590
But the way that that starts happening
to you is by making incremental

2270
01:16:20,591 --> 01:16:21,610
improvements.

2271
01:16:21,940 --> 01:16:24,850
Cause if you're a little better
tomorrow than you are today,

2272
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:28,840
then the probability that you'll be able
to be even a little bit better the day

2273
01:16:28,841 --> 01:16:33,841
after that has increased
rather than decreasing because
we as you are right now,

2274
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:36,220
you able to make yourself
a little stronger.

2275
01:16:36,910 --> 01:16:37,180
Also,

2276
01:16:37,180 --> 01:16:38,140
let's say you do that,

2277
01:16:38,170 --> 01:16:38,890
let's say,

2278
01:16:38,890 --> 01:16:40,630
and you can try this as an experiment.

2279
01:16:40,631 --> 01:16:41,500
This really works.

2280
01:16:41,501 --> 01:16:41,891
He can say,

2281
01:16:41,891 --> 01:16:42,191
okay,

2282
01:16:42,191 --> 01:16:45,760
well every day for the next year I'm
going to try and make one thing slightly

2283
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:47,380
better and it has to be,

2284
01:16:47,381 --> 01:16:49,900
you gotta be humble about this
cause like you're useless.

2285
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:51,490
You're not going to go to
the gym three times a week.

2286
01:16:51,491 --> 01:16:51,750
Frankly.

2287
01:16:51,750 --> 01:16:53,620
You're not going to stop
eating like bought bonds.

2288
01:16:53,950 --> 01:16:56,590
You've tried that a hundred
times that you've always failed,

2289
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:58,360
so a lower,

2290
01:16:58,810 --> 01:17:03,810
a lower aim so low that there's a
good probability that you'll do it,

2291
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:06,520
which is what you do if
you're encouraging a child,

2292
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:07,120
right?

2293
01:17:07,120 --> 01:17:09,130
You said you try to pick a target that,

2294
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:13,400
not that it's so easy that it's
contemptible because what good is that but

2295
01:17:14,360 --> 01:17:18,470
difficult enough to make a difference
but likely enough so that you'll do it.

2296
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:20,360
That's what a good
behavioral psychologist does.

2297
01:17:20,361 --> 01:17:21,200
It's like try that,

2298
01:17:21,201 --> 01:17:22,160
try that for a year.

2299
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:27,800
I'm just going to take
myself as a baseline and I'm
going to look at things that

2300
01:17:27,801 --> 01:17:28,670
I could improve,

2301
01:17:28,671 --> 01:17:32,240
that I would improve and then
I'm going to do the small things.

2302
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,590
And so that's where
humility comes into it too.

2303
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:38,990
Because the cap be grandiose things they
might not even be something you'd ever

2304
01:17:38,991 --> 01:17:41,450
talked to anyone else about
cause they're so trivial.

2305
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,630
But something that you do
every day is not trivial.

2306
01:17:45,470 --> 01:17:46,310
Something you repeat,

2307
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:47,091
that's your life,

2308
01:17:47,091 --> 01:17:47,720
right?

2309
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,250
Things you do every day,

2310
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:50,270
that's your life.

2311
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,733
And so if you,

2312
01:17:51,770 --> 01:17:53,930
if you institute that program,

2313
01:17:53,960 --> 01:17:54,171
take,

2314
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:54,471
okay,

2315
01:17:54,471 --> 01:17:57,800
well just how far could I
get if I did that for a year,

2316
01:17:58,310 --> 01:17:59,020
find out,

2317
01:17:59,020 --> 01:17:59,170
hey,

2318
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:01,850
I'll do it for a month and
see how far you could get.

2319
01:18:01,851 --> 01:18:02,061
You know,

2320
01:18:02,061 --> 01:18:05,600
and I've got 50,000 letters since August,

2321
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:06,650
something like that.

2322
01:18:06,651 --> 01:18:07,760
From this viewer account.

2323
01:18:07,761 --> 01:18:08,080
I haven't,

2324
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:08,571
obviously,

2325
01:18:08,571 --> 01:18:10,190
I'm not reading them all cause I can't,

2326
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,080
I put my father on it,

2327
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,330
so he's like swan

2328
01:18:13,510 --> 01:18:14,161
with email,

2329
01:18:14,161 --> 01:18:14,994
you know?

2330
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:16,303
Yeah.

2331
01:18:17,990 --> 01:18:20,200
He hates it and loves it at the same time.

2332
01:18:21,590 --> 01:18:22,600
You know,

2333
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:26,710
it's really quite interesting having
these letters and they kind of fall into

2334
01:18:26,711 --> 01:18:28,550
three bs.

2335
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:31,870
One Band is one person in a hundred
who isn't very happy with me.

2336
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:32,351
It's like,

2337
01:18:32,351 --> 01:18:33,050
okay,

2338
01:18:33,050 --> 01:18:33,883
so fine.

2339
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:37,990
And then about 25% say,

2340
01:18:38,070 --> 01:18:40,030
and this is what my students
have told me for years,

2341
01:18:40,031 --> 01:18:40,301
they say,

2342
01:18:40,301 --> 01:18:41,134
look,

2343
01:18:41,500 --> 01:18:44,890
listening to you has allowed me to
put in words things I already knew,

2344
01:18:44,891 --> 01:18:46,690
but that I didn't know how to say

2345
01:18:52,930 --> 01:18:54,160
be good for something

2346
01:18:58,900 --> 01:18:59,810
hypothetically done.

2347
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,150
It could be good for that.

2348
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:05,270
So despite the older other's sins,

2349
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:06,343
so,

2350
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:09,860
and then the other one
say I was in a bad place,

2351
01:19:09,861 --> 01:19:10,281
you know,

2352
01:19:10,281 --> 01:19:12,500
I was drinking too much or I was addicted.

2353
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:14,090
I didn't get along with my family.

2354
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:18,560
I was able to sit with my
girlfriend and my was nihilistic,

2355
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:18,980
uh,

2356
01:19:18,980 --> 01:19:19,791
depressed,

2357
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:19,940
uh,

2358
01:19:19,940 --> 01:19:21,140
overweight,

2359
01:19:21,290 --> 01:19:22,550
didn't have a plan.

2360
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:23,621
You know,

2361
01:19:23,621 --> 01:19:27,080
you know the horrible pitfalls
pits that people can fall in.

2362
01:19:27,081 --> 01:19:31,460
You know there's like 30 dimensional
pit of hell that people end up in.

2363
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:36,110
So they ranked say how they were located
in their particular bit of hail and

2364
01:19:36,111 --> 01:19:36,501
then say,

2365
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:36,891
well look,

2366
01:19:36,891 --> 01:19:39,350
I've been trying to do some
of the things you suggested.

2367
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:39,681
You know,

2368
01:19:39,681 --> 01:19:40,640
whatever that is,

2369
01:19:40,641 --> 01:19:43,550
be more responsible or try not to lie.

2370
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:44,570
That's a good thing.

2371
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,190
Try not to lie for a month.

2372
01:19:46,370 --> 01:19:47,420
It's really hard.

2373
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:49,730
It's almost everything you say is a lie.

2374
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:51,140
It's unbelievable.

2375
01:19:51,830 --> 01:19:52,590
It's a good sign.

2376
01:19:52,590 --> 01:19:53,260
Believable.

2377
01:19:53,260 --> 01:19:54,081
It's how much,

2378
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:55,830
it's just how lightning,

2379
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,290
not merely that it's an outright lie.

2380
01:19:58,291 --> 01:19:59,440
Do you know what it to be a faucet,

2381
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,990
but that you're saying things
that have no bearing on your life.

2382
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:04,580
Like they're not your things.

2383
01:20:04,581 --> 01:20:07,040
You know you're saying
that to impress people or,

2384
01:20:07,200 --> 01:20:11,100
or you're saying that because you think
they sound good or who knows what a bit

2385
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:14,610
stuck in your mind or you read a book
and you think those are your ideas now or

2386
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:15,720
something like that.

2387
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,010
All lies.

2388
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:22,380
That's so you can just stop doing that
and I will straighten out your horrible

2389
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:26,130
to stop doing that because you find out
that almost everything you say is a lie.

2390
01:20:26,131 --> 01:20:29,220
And that's so depressing to realize that,

2391
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:30,190
you know,

2392
01:20:30,190 --> 01:20:31,410
the people say,

2393
01:20:31,411 --> 01:20:31,651
well,

2394
01:20:31,651 --> 01:20:31,921
you know,

2395
01:20:31,921 --> 01:20:35,190
I've been making incremental improvements.

2396
01:20:35,880 --> 01:20:36,713
I don't work.

2397
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:37,801
It's so,

2398
01:20:37,801 --> 01:20:38,634
so fun.

2399
01:20:38,730 --> 01:20:41,100
This is one of the things that's
so fun about what I'm doing.

2400
01:20:41,310 --> 01:20:43,080
What I'm doing is completely insane.

2401
01:20:43,081 --> 01:20:43,681
And there's lots of,

2402
01:20:43,681 --> 01:20:45,950
if it isn't fun at all
but does some of it,

2403
01:20:45,951 --> 01:20:46,980
it's just great,

2404
01:20:46,981 --> 01:20:47,251
you know,

2405
01:20:47,251 --> 01:20:48,810
because wherever I go now,

2406
01:20:48,811 --> 01:20:50,850
people come up to me on
the street and they say,

2407
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:52,290
here's the little,

2408
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:52,830
you know,

2409
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:55,650
place in Halo than I was two years ago.

2410
01:20:55,920 --> 01:20:57,330
And then they describe it and they say,

2411
01:20:57,331 --> 01:20:57,550
look,

2412
01:20:57,550 --> 01:21:01,140
can I be trying out some of the
things you've been recommending?

2413
01:21:01,141 --> 01:21:02,340
And it's way better.

2414
01:21:02,670 --> 01:21:02,911
It's like,

2415
01:21:02,911 --> 01:21:03,744
Oh God,

2416
01:21:03,910 --> 01:21:04,860
that's so good.

2417
01:21:04,861 --> 01:21:05,490
You know,

2418
01:21:05,490 --> 01:21:05,831
it's,

2419
01:21:05,831 --> 01:21:06,450
it's,

2420
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:09,870
and so well that justifies the whole
office as far as I'm concerned.

2421
01:21:09,880 --> 01:21:10,380
But,

2422
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:10,801
but that's,

2423
01:21:10,801 --> 01:21:13,680
it's a testament to the strength
of just exactly doing that.

2424
01:21:13,681 --> 01:21:15,840
Cause you can use yourself
as your own marker.

2425
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,780
You know perfectly well that there's
more to you than meets the eye.

2426
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:20,400
You absolutely know that.

2427
01:21:20,401 --> 01:21:22,200
That's so cool that everyone knows that.

2428
01:21:22,230 --> 01:21:22,920
Right?

2429
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:23,880
And that's what we have,

2430
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:24,840
this deep shame,

2431
01:21:24,841 --> 01:21:27,030
that sort of associated with original sin.

2432
01:21:27,031 --> 01:21:28,800
That's how the Catholics
put their finger on it.

2433
01:21:29,040 --> 01:21:32,940
We all have this deep shame because
we know who we're not who we could be.

2434
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:33,541
It's like,

2435
01:21:33,541 --> 01:21:34,374
okay,

2436
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,480
that's an optimistic thing.

2437
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:38,370
It's like you're not who you could be.

2438
01:21:38,510 --> 01:21:39,240
All right,

2439
01:21:39,240 --> 01:21:40,620
who could you me?

2440
01:21:40,980 --> 01:21:41,131
Well,

2441
01:21:41,131 --> 01:21:41,964
maybe you could be.

2442
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:47,220
It's way better than you are and who
knows what that would do and why not find

2443
01:21:47,221 --> 01:21:47,491
out?

2444
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:49,170
Because like you don't
have anything better to do,

2445
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,210
so might as well find out.

2446
01:21:53,060 --> 01:21:55,950
So that's an optimistic message in
the middle of all the pessimism.

2447
01:21:56,310 --> 01:21:57,210
Rule Five,

2448
01:21:57,540 --> 01:22:00,180
don't let your children do anything
that makes you dislike the,

2449
01:22:00,780 --> 01:22:01,410
I thought that

2450
01:22:01,410 --> 01:22:02,243
for me the most,

2451
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:10,170
I thought that would be the
most contentious chapter
because it has to do with

2452
01:22:10,350 --> 01:22:11,520
disciplining children,

2453
01:22:11,521 --> 01:22:12,240
which is,

2454
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:13,050
you know,

2455
01:22:13,050 --> 01:22:14,280
that's a touchy subject,

2456
01:22:14,910 --> 01:22:17,280
but there's two elements to that rule.

2457
01:22:17,281 --> 01:22:18,540
Basically you want is,

2458
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:19,470
it's an,

2459
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:23,640
it's an injunction to
clearheaded pessimistic thinking,

2460
01:22:23,641 --> 01:22:27,900
I would say is the first thing you have
to do if you're going to abide by that

2461
01:22:27,901 --> 01:22:32,280
rule is you have to admit
that your children can do
things that are dislikable.

2462
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:33,540
No one.

2463
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:36,330
Everyone knows that obviously.

2464
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:36,631
I mean,

2465
01:22:36,631 --> 01:22:38,130
when you were a kid there
were kids who hate it,

2466
01:22:38,160 --> 01:22:38,670
right?

2467
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:38,971
It's like,

2468
01:22:38,971 --> 01:22:40,560
so how was that change?

2469
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,230
And you know,

2470
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:41,740
your,

2471
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:42,930
your friends have kids,

2472
01:22:43,530 --> 01:22:45,300
you don't like them.

2473
01:22:47,910 --> 01:22:49,670
Some of them you don't
like in this cancer,

2474
01:22:49,680 --> 01:22:52,590
horrible little monsters and their
parents let them do it's true.

2475
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,890
And their parents let them do all
sorts of reprehensible things that are

2476
01:22:55,891 --> 01:22:57,780
absolutely in no one's best interest.

2477
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:00,180
And they kind of either kind
of embarrassed about it,

2478
01:23:00,330 --> 01:23:03,330
but in the sort of smiling way and
they won't do anything about it.

2479
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,470
Except then you don't
invite them over anymore.

2480
01:23:05,471 --> 01:23:06,280
And think wider walls,

2481
01:23:06,280 --> 01:23:06,700
you know,

2482
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:08,830
not my friends liked me
ever since I have kids.

2483
01:23:08,831 --> 01:23:08,951
It's,

2484
01:23:08,951 --> 01:23:09,101
no,

2485
01:23:09,101 --> 01:23:09,671
it's not that.

2486
01:23:09,671 --> 01:23:10,350
It's your kids,

2487
01:23:10,350 --> 01:23:10,841
their kids,

2488
01:23:10,841 --> 01:23:11,674
your kids,

2489
01:23:12,110 --> 01:23:12,943
my kids.

2490
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:18,120
And so you have to admit
that kids can be dislikable.

2491
01:23:18,370 --> 01:23:19,300
Well that's hard tax.

2492
01:23:19,301 --> 01:23:21,470
And he saved the hat cause they don't,

2493
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,030
kids are,

2494
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:22,920
oh they're wonderful.

2495
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:23,231
It's like,

2496
01:23:23,231 --> 01:23:23,801
well they are,

2497
01:23:23,801 --> 01:23:26,710
but we don't have to be
stupidly naive about it.

2498
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:32,040
So maybe you have to admit it's even
worse that your kids could be dislikable.

2499
01:23:32,830 --> 01:23:34,630
That's a lot harder thing to swallow.

2500
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:38,380
And then you have to also admit you're
the sort of person that could dislike

2501
01:23:38,381 --> 01:23:39,310
your own kids.

2502
01:23:40,140 --> 01:23:43,510
And if you don't think that in your,

2503
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:44,740
you're dangerous,

2504
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:45,971
you're dangerous.

2505
01:23:45,971 --> 01:23:47,140
If you don't know that,

2506
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,120
that's one thing you definitely learn as
a clinical psychologist is because like

2507
01:23:51,121 --> 01:23:56,121
half the people that you see come to see
you because their parents brutalized in

2508
01:23:57,191 --> 01:23:58,210
every possible way.

2509
01:23:58,211 --> 01:23:59,230
Sometimes physically,

2510
01:23:59,231 --> 01:24:00,310
sometimes sexually,

2511
01:24:00,490 --> 01:24:02,800
more often mentally.

2512
01:24:02,830 --> 01:24:03,130
You know,

2513
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:07,300
I've had clients who like the parental
rule was wait till your kid does

2514
01:24:07,301 --> 01:24:09,250
something good and then hit the,

2515
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:10,240
you know what?

2516
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:12,370
Maybe physically that's not even so bad.

2517
01:24:12,430 --> 01:24:13,480
I mean it's bad,

2518
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:17,980
but that's not the best way to really
go after someone if they're doing

2519
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:18,910
something good,

2520
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:19,631
you know,

2521
01:24:19,631 --> 01:24:22,450
you want to wait until they do something
good and then maybe you want to demean

2522
01:24:22,451 --> 01:24:22,990
them.

2523
01:24:22,990 --> 01:24:26,760
You don't like with a few cutting
remarks over like an hour,

2524
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:30,970
something like that and [inaudible] you
there are two or 300 times to your kid

2525
01:24:30,971 --> 01:24:31,661
and they'll be very,

2526
01:24:31,661 --> 01:24:34,870
very careful about ever doing
anything good around you again.

2527
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:35,700
You know,

2528
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:36,390
then you win,

2529
01:24:36,390 --> 01:24:36,641
right?

2530
01:24:36,641 --> 01:24:40,450
Because well then you get to be martyr
or a parent who has this terrible child

2531
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:42,840
that you have to lug around
and he was always ungrateful.

2532
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,330
You can whine to your relatives about
it and they can pat you on the back for

2533
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:49,330
being so compassionate and tolerant.

2534
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:54,720
This is just absolutely sickening and
it happens way more often than you think

2535
01:24:55,060 --> 01:24:55,630
and so,

2536
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:57,940
and if you don't think
that you can do that,

2537
01:25:02,170 --> 01:25:03,790
if you don't think that you can do that,

2538
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:07,360
then you don't know anything
about yourself or about
other human beings because

2539
01:25:07,361 --> 01:25:09,010
you bloody well can do that.

2540
01:25:09,070 --> 01:25:14,070
And the probability that you've done some
of that is virtually 100% some of you

2541
01:25:14,621 --> 01:25:17,620
know what you need to know if you're a
parent and just if you're a human being

2542
01:25:17,770 --> 01:25:22,770
that you are a sub type of monster and
you should be very careful with how you

2543
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:23,621
act.

2544
01:25:23,621 --> 01:25:26,740
And part of that is you should be
very careful with your children.

2545
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:28,060
Like I knew why didn't talk,

2546
01:25:28,061 --> 01:25:28,721
I had kids,

2547
01:25:28,721 --> 01:25:30,010
I kind of knew what I was like,

2548
01:25:30,011 --> 01:25:31,840
although not as much as I might've,

2549
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:34,390
but I knew something about
what it was like and I thought,

2550
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:40,020
I'm not going to let my kids make me upset
and angry because God only knows what

2551
01:25:40,571 --> 01:25:42,670
will happen if they do that.

2552
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:46,240
And it isn't like an explosive outburst
of tamper or something like that.

2553
01:25:46,241 --> 01:25:46,451
You know?

2554
01:25:46,451 --> 01:25:49,630
You hear now and then about a parent who's
done something absolutely dreadful to

2555
01:25:49,631 --> 01:25:50,500
their children and you think,

2556
01:25:50,501 --> 01:25:50,591
well,

2557
01:25:50,591 --> 01:25:51,520
how could that happen?

2558
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:53,430
It's just think about it for awhile.

2559
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,350
If you actually want to know how
something like that could happen,

2560
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,080
you just have to sit and think
about it for about an hour.

2561
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:03,680
Like it's horrifying to put yourself
in the place of that parent.

2562
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:05,360
People generally won't do it,

2563
01:26:05,510 --> 01:26:06,620
but if you want to understand,

2564
01:26:06,621 --> 01:26:06,950
you can,

2565
01:26:06,950 --> 01:26:07,850
you can understand.

2566
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:10,700
It's just that you said you
don't want to and no wonder,

2567
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:15,790
but I knew that I was perfectly capable
of taking revenge on anybody that

2568
01:26:16,190 --> 01:26:17,090
crossed me,

2569
01:26:17,150 --> 01:26:17,983
let's say,

2570
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,800
and that the best way to deal without,

2571
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:21,860
apart from trying to
improve my own character,

2572
01:26:21,861 --> 01:26:23,600
listening to my wife when she's trying to,

2573
01:26:23,601 --> 01:26:24,020
you know,

2574
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:24,860
sort me out,

2575
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:30,220
was to not encourage my children to be
horrible little monsters because they're

2576
01:26:32,781 --> 01:26:37,781
little and fragile and I'm way bigger
and way meaner and way more malevolent.

2577
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:42,230
And so it's much better for them.

2578
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:47,290
It's much better for them if they behave
in a manner that elicits the positive

2579
01:26:47,870 --> 01:26:49,220
element from me.

2580
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:51,830
And it's not that hard to
encourage children to do that.

2581
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:55,040
Like if you have some sense and
you'd notice your own irritation,

2582
01:26:55,041 --> 01:26:58,640
I mean you can't assume your
perfect because you're not
and you're going to have

2583
01:26:58,641 --> 01:27:00,020
arbitrary irritations,

2584
01:27:00,021 --> 01:27:03,460
but that's partly why you have a partner
to kind of keep you on the straight and

2585
01:27:03,461 --> 01:27:04,294
narrow,

2586
01:27:04,370 --> 01:27:09,370
but you do your children a great favor
by not letting them act in a way that

2587
01:27:10,161 --> 01:27:10,994
irritates you.

2588
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:12,170
But even more importantly,

2589
01:27:12,171 --> 01:27:14,390
and this is where the
rubber really hits the road,

2590
01:27:14,391 --> 01:27:19,391
is what's your role as a parent to
promote the self esteem of your children?

2591
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:20,331
It's like,

2592
01:27:20,331 --> 01:27:21,164
no,

2593
01:27:22,190 --> 01:27:22,490
no.

2594
01:27:22,490 --> 01:27:23,930
That is not your role.

2595
01:27:23,990 --> 01:27:25,210
That's bald headed

2596
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:26,050
psychologists.

2597
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:31,050
[inaudible]

2598
01:27:31,970 --> 01:27:35,210
your role is to make your
children welcome wherever they go.

2599
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,250
That's your role.

2600
01:27:37,460 --> 01:27:42,460
Your role is to help your children
maintain that gloss of innocence and

2601
01:27:42,651 --> 01:27:43,371
attracted this.

2602
01:27:43,371 --> 01:27:47,300
That's part and parcel of being a child
so that when they interact with other

2603
01:27:47,301 --> 01:27:47,930
children,

2604
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,910
those children want to play it with them.

2605
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:51,920
If that means your child
has to know how to play.

2606
01:27:52,070 --> 01:27:56,300
Super important that your child knows
how to play with other kids because other

2607
01:27:56,301 --> 01:27:58,130
kids socialize your children.

2608
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:02,570
And if your child isn't socialized
properly by the age of four so that other

2609
01:28:02,571 --> 01:28:04,370
children want to play with him or her,

2610
01:28:04,430 --> 01:28:05,500
they're done.

2611
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:08,210
You failed and you can't fix it.

2612
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:12,650
So it's really because what happens is
the kids play with the other kids who can

2613
01:28:12,651 --> 01:28:16,240
play and their development takes
off and you're a kid who can't play,

2614
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:17,780
gets left in the dust.

2615
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:19,880
And there's a huge literature on that,

2616
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:20,721
that very,

2617
01:28:20,721 --> 01:28:21,920
very depressing literature,

2618
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:24,140
like most truthful
psychological literatures.

2619
01:28:24,141 --> 01:28:25,080
And that's what it indicates.

2620
01:28:25,670 --> 01:28:26,360
And so,

2621
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,290
well it's the case,

2622
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:27,711
you know,

2623
01:28:27,711 --> 01:28:29,150
if you're a social scientist,

2624
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:30,800
you know you've discovered something true.

2625
01:28:30,801 --> 01:28:33,740
If you hate it and it violates
your political instincts,

2626
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:35,020
it's like a fact

2627
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:41,370
[inaudible] so,

2628
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:47,180
but you also want for your children,

2629
01:28:47,420 --> 01:28:49,640
like we taught our kids how
to behave in restaurants.

2630
01:28:49,820 --> 01:28:50,011
We,

2631
01:28:50,011 --> 01:28:53,000
we take them to restaurants when they
were little all in for about 45 minutes

2632
01:28:53,001 --> 01:28:53,541
when they were little.

2633
01:28:53,541 --> 01:28:55,670
Cause you can't expect a
kid to sit for too long,

2634
01:28:55,880 --> 01:28:56,960
but you know the rule,

2635
01:28:56,961 --> 01:28:57,321
it was,

2636
01:28:57,321 --> 01:29:00,710
well you can come to the restaurant
but you have to act like a civilized

2637
01:29:00,711 --> 01:29:04,170
creature and if you didn't
then we went and stood outside.

2638
01:29:04,440 --> 01:29:04,750
You know,

2639
01:29:04,750 --> 01:29:06,660
and even if it was winter,

2640
01:29:06,690 --> 01:29:09,600
so I could remember my daughter
who's in the audience tonight,

2641
01:29:09,601 --> 01:29:10,434
by the way,

2642
01:29:10,830 --> 01:29:15,830
Stephanie [inaudible],

2643
01:29:18,200 --> 01:29:19,660
please behave in the restaurant.

2644
01:29:19,661 --> 01:29:20,381
Judge Tall,

2645
01:29:20,381 --> 01:29:23,140
some stunting cause kids will do that
and you take them to a new place.

2646
01:29:23,141 --> 01:29:23,970
They'll pull some stuff.

2647
01:29:23,970 --> 01:29:25,480
They never try it at home.

2648
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:26,770
It's because they know and they think,

2649
01:29:26,771 --> 01:29:27,190
ha,

2650
01:29:27,190 --> 01:29:28,750
what are you going to
do if I do this here?

2651
01:29:29,240 --> 01:29:31,020
It's like I'm going to take you on.

2652
01:29:31,030 --> 01:29:31,260
Sorry,

2653
01:29:31,260 --> 01:29:34,590
we're going to stamp where
it's cold down there.

2654
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,910
She looked at me and I look at her say,

2655
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:38,620
how's this going for you?

2656
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:39,733
It's like,

2657
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:40,271
it's like,

2658
01:29:40,271 --> 01:29:40,541
yeah.

2659
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:41,310
It's cool though here.

2660
01:29:41,310 --> 01:29:43,000
Race like was it better
than the restaurant?

2661
01:29:43,030 --> 01:29:43,720
Yeah,

2662
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:43,961
it was.

2663
01:29:43,961 --> 01:29:45,100
Do you want to go back to the restaurant?

2664
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:46,270
Yeah.

2665
01:29:46,270 --> 01:29:49,480
You want to act like a civilized
human being and we'll go back at the

2666
01:29:49,481 --> 01:29:50,051
restaurant.

2667
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:50,410
It's like,

2668
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:50,621
yeah,

2669
01:29:50,621 --> 01:29:51,790
okay back.

2670
01:29:51,791 --> 01:29:52,291
We'd go.

2671
01:29:52,291 --> 01:29:53,860
I know it was pretty straight forward.

2672
01:29:53,861 --> 01:29:55,240
It's pretty straight forward,

2673
01:29:55,570 --> 01:29:56,020
you know,

2674
01:29:56,020 --> 01:29:57,220
so and that worked.

2675
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:01,360
But what was so fun about that was first
of all we got to go to restaurants and

2676
01:30:01,361 --> 01:30:05,350
so that lead is not quite as bitter
and horrible about being parents as we

2677
01:30:05,351 --> 01:30:06,184
might've been.

2678
01:30:06,970 --> 01:30:07,803
The second was,

2679
01:30:08,050 --> 01:30:10,450
you know that adults are there adults,

2680
01:30:10,451 --> 01:30:12,970
he didn't know the kids would
respond to them really positively.

2681
01:30:12,971 --> 01:30:16,640
So we take the kids to restaurants and
they'd all sit there and smile and eaten,

2682
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:17,170
you know,

2683
01:30:17,170 --> 01:30:21,010
be civilized in that other parents or
other adults will come along and say they

2684
01:30:21,011 --> 01:30:21,731
pat them and say,

2685
01:30:21,731 --> 01:30:21,941
you know,

2686
01:30:21,941 --> 01:30:25,450
you kids really behaved well and
then they'd actually smile at them.

2687
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:28,330
You know how it fits a kid into
restaurant causing all sorts of trouble.

2688
01:30:28,510 --> 01:30:29,710
You kind of smile.

2689
01:30:29,711 --> 01:30:31,780
But like a carnivorous Fab pyre.

2690
01:30:31,790 --> 01:30:32,920
That's sorta how you smile.

2691
01:30:34,070 --> 01:30:36,660
But the kids would go out and
because they were behaving,

2692
01:30:36,670 --> 01:30:36,911
you know,

2693
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:40,570
with a certain amount of propriety that
all the adults would show their good

2694
01:30:40,571 --> 01:30:40,700
side.

2695
01:30:40,700 --> 01:30:42,460
Cause I don't actually like kids,

2696
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:47,590
you know like you have to be a pretty
dark person to not have a small child

2697
01:30:47,620 --> 01:30:47,981
light,

2698
01:30:47,981 --> 01:30:49,450
a little light in your heart,

2699
01:30:49,480 --> 01:30:50,230
you know?

2700
01:30:50,230 --> 01:30:54,520
And so as long as the child isn't doing
everything in its power to extinguish

2701
01:30:54,521 --> 01:30:55,354
that light,

2702
01:30:55,510 --> 01:30:56,590
then you know,

2703
01:30:56,660 --> 01:31:00,310
you can get some positive responses
even from really rough people.

2704
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:04,060
And so the kids would go out
to restaurants and people
would pat them and smile

2705
01:31:04,061 --> 01:31:06,250
at them and not like how,

2706
01:31:06,251 --> 01:31:08,200
why would you want that for your kids?

2707
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:09,270
You want your kids,

2708
01:31:09,270 --> 01:31:10,450
other kids like them.

2709
01:31:10,870 --> 01:31:11,680
What a deal.

2710
01:31:11,680 --> 01:31:14,560
Then other kids liked them and invite
them to play games and they have a good

2711
01:31:14,561 --> 01:31:19,561
life and adults want to have them around
and we'll be nice to them and teach

2712
01:31:19,721 --> 01:31:20,554
them things.

2713
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:22,660
It's like your dad parent,

2714
01:31:22,661 --> 01:31:23,860
you're done right.

2715
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:27,340
And you can do most of that
by the time the kids for so,

2716
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:32,400
but you have to come to the terms with
the fact that kids aren't innately good

2717
01:31:33,640 --> 01:31:34,870
and neither are you.

2718
01:31:34,930 --> 01:31:35,920
That's for sure.

2719
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:39,040
And so you have to act like a,

2720
01:31:39,080 --> 01:31:41,200
like a intelligent person with some,

2721
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:46,520
some apprehension of your own horror and
the terrible things that you're capable

2722
01:31:47,141 --> 01:31:52,141
of doing and then regulate your household
so that those things aren't necessary.

2723
01:31:52,990 --> 01:31:54,430
And so that's really useful.

2724
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,200
So that's rule five.

2725
01:31:56,470 --> 01:31:57,303
Well

2726
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:04,900
rule six,

2727
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:10,840
put yourself house in perfect order
before you criticize the world.

2728
01:32:10,980 --> 01:32:11,813
So

2729
01:32:12,210 --> 01:32:17,070
[inaudible]

2730
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:23,080
about the mass shooters mostly not
only I talk about this guy named Carl,

2731
01:32:24,141 --> 01:32:28,400
Pam's round in the chapter and
pans ramp was this mass killer.

2732
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,380
He kept track of everyone he killed.

2733
01:32:30,381 --> 01:32:33,860
He kept track of all the buildings
he first down and the dollar value.

2734
01:32:34,130 --> 01:32:38,090
He was out for mayhem and no wonder
like he was a delinquent kid.

2735
01:32:38,091 --> 01:32:42,140
I think he was one kid at 14 or something
in the Midwest and he's kind of a bad

2736
01:32:42,141 --> 01:32:42,830
kid.

2737
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:47,830
And then they sent them to a reform school
as they did not help put it that way.

2738
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:53,770
He was seriously brutalized in the
reform school in all the inventive and

2739
01:32:53,901 --> 01:32:58,040
creative ways that you might imagine
that a child could be abused in a reform

2740
01:32:58,041 --> 01:32:58,431
school.

2741
01:32:58,431 --> 01:32:59,840
That basically happened to him.

2742
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:01,460
And when he came out,

2743
01:33:01,490 --> 01:33:03,830
he was not a happy person.

2744
01:33:04,550 --> 01:33:09,550
And so he decided that he would devote
his life to producing as much misery as

2745
01:33:09,741 --> 01:33:11,000
he possibly could.

2746
01:33:11,720 --> 01:33:12,850
And he wrote it.

2747
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:15,020
He wrote an autobiography.

2748
01:33:15,950 --> 01:33:17,090
He was in prison,

2749
01:33:17,510 --> 01:33:22,100
beat half to death by the guards
and no doubt deservedly so.

2750
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,400
And uh,

2751
01:33:24,290 --> 01:33:29,290
a doctor in the prison gave him a dollar
to buy cigarettes or something like

2752
01:33:29,421 --> 01:33:30,000
that,

2753
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:32,270
pads around in his own accounts had that,

2754
01:33:32,271 --> 01:33:35,490
that was the only kind of thing that
he could remember anyone ever doing for

2755
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:35,780
them.

2756
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:36,141
Well then,

2757
01:33:36,141 --> 01:33:36,711
no wonder,

2758
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:37,460
I mean,

2759
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:37,880
you know,

2760
01:33:37,880 --> 01:33:39,170
it's a complicated story,

2761
01:33:39,171 --> 01:33:40,310
but he wasn't like,

2762
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:44,390
he was like a dog that comes up to you
and bites your ankle and is surprised

2763
01:33:44,391 --> 01:33:45,580
that it doesn't get petted,

2764
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:46,190
you know.

2765
01:33:46,190 --> 01:33:47,023
So,

2766
01:33:47,350 --> 01:33:50,540
and I'm saying that with some due regard
for the fact that he did in fact have

2767
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:51,980
an absolutely dismal life.

2768
01:33:51,981 --> 01:33:52,191
Right?

2769
01:33:52,191 --> 01:33:52,371
I mean,

2770
01:33:52,371 --> 01:33:56,570
he got tortured pretty bad that he
was very badly when he was a teenager.

2771
01:33:57,140 --> 01:33:57,973
Um,

2772
01:33:57,980 --> 01:33:58,401
anyways,

2773
01:33:58,401 --> 01:34:03,401
Patra writes about his hatred for,

2774
01:34:03,650 --> 01:34:05,660
it's not just himself,

2775
01:34:06,410 --> 01:34:07,850
but for other people,

2776
01:34:08,150 --> 01:34:09,110
absolute hatred.

2777
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:12,890
But it went way past that because
like if you're going to hate,

2778
01:34:12,920 --> 01:34:16,670
you're only get warmed up if you hate
yourself and other people that's you

2779
01:34:16,671 --> 01:34:16,881
think,

2780
01:34:16,881 --> 01:34:18,410
well that's about as bad as it can get.

2781
01:34:18,420 --> 01:34:18,771
It's like,

2782
01:34:18,771 --> 01:34:19,490
no,

2783
01:34:19,490 --> 01:34:22,940
like there's this old idea
that hell is a bottomless pit,

2784
01:34:22,990 --> 01:34:23,630
you know,

2785
01:34:23,630 --> 01:34:25,280
and there's a psychological
reason for that.

2786
01:34:25,281 --> 01:34:26,114
And the reason for that is,

2787
01:34:26,120 --> 01:34:28,040
is that no matter how bad something is,

2788
01:34:28,041 --> 01:34:29,390
you could make it worse.

2789
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:32,390
And so like there's no limit to hate.

2790
01:34:32,660 --> 01:34:35,360
And you might start by hating
yourself and other people,

2791
01:34:35,361 --> 01:34:36,650
but that's your,

2792
01:34:36,651 --> 01:34:38,600
that's just beginner hate.

2793
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:41,150
If you really push it,

2794
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:43,430
not only do you come to hate,

2795
01:34:43,820 --> 01:34:46,250
you would come to hate being itself.

2796
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:50,510
The mere fact that the reason
anything fills you with rage,

2797
01:34:50,600 --> 01:34:51,890
but that isn't even where you,

2798
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:55,330
you don't even stop there if
you're really proficient at he,

2799
01:34:55,870 --> 01:34:56,270
ew,

2800
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:56,630
ew,

2801
01:34:56,630 --> 01:34:56,870
ew.

2802
01:34:56,870 --> 01:35:01,130
That's of a philosophical hate and you're
getting pretty down to the bottom of

2803
01:35:01,131 --> 01:35:03,260
things when you're
philosophical in your hatred,

2804
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:06,560
but you're not as far down as you could
get if you want to get right to the

2805
01:35:06,561 --> 01:35:09,110
bottom and you get
theological into your hate,

2806
01:35:09,590 --> 01:35:10,071
and if you get,

2807
01:35:10,071 --> 01:35:11,200
feel logical in your hate,

2808
01:35:11,201 --> 01:35:13,760
and I don't care if you're at
the ECS than your pull the page,

2809
01:35:13,761 --> 01:35:14,960
it doesn't make any difference.

2810
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:15,800
It's this is this.

2811
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:16,640
That's all irrelevant.

2812
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:22,090
You Act as if there's someone
responsible for the horror of being,

2813
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:24,913
let's

2814
01:35:26,180 --> 01:35:29,540
call that God and you hate him

2815
01:35:30,910 --> 01:35:35,910
and then you do everything you possibly
can to make that be a hypothetical or

2816
01:35:36,221 --> 01:35:41,110
otherwise as angry and
sad about your existence,

2817
01:35:41,111 --> 01:35:46,111
antibiotic resistance itself
as you possibly can with
all of the imagination and

2818
01:35:47,261 --> 01:35:50,100
tools at your disposal and then you,

2819
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:50,830
you,

2820
01:35:50,830 --> 01:35:55,660
you're getting way down in the
Haight hierarchy when you do that,

2821
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:57,490
and if you don't believe that,

2822
01:35:57,550 --> 01:35:58,383
go read about it.

2823
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:03,760
Go read the diaries of the kids who shot
up the Columbine high school and see if

2824
01:36:03,761 --> 01:36:05,980
that isn't exactly what they say.

2825
01:36:06,160 --> 01:36:06,851
These people,

2826
01:36:06,851 --> 01:36:07,090
you know,

2827
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:08,500
they write manifestos,

2828
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:13,510
they tell you exactly what they're
thinking and that's exactly what they tell

2829
01:36:13,511 --> 01:36:14,860
you and that's what pans up his head.

2830
01:36:14,861 --> 01:36:15,460
He said,

2831
01:36:15,460 --> 01:36:16,700
you know what his dying words are.

2832
01:36:16,750 --> 01:36:17,583
He said,

2833
01:36:18,400 --> 01:36:22,750
I wish the human race pet one neck so
that I could put my hands around it.

2834
01:36:22,751 --> 01:36:23,770
Then squeeze.

2835
01:36:23,830 --> 01:36:24,820
That's one of the quotes.

2836
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:25,690
That's a pretty good one.

2837
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:27,070
His dying words,

2838
01:36:27,071 --> 01:36:28,000
he was being hung.

2839
01:36:28,440 --> 01:36:31,660
There was a woman's group that tried to
stop him from being hung and he wasn't

2840
01:36:31,661 --> 01:36:32,980
very happy with him by the way.

2841
01:36:32,981 --> 01:36:34,540
And let them know that quite blunt blade.

2842
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:37,000
And he said he was in Indiana.

2843
01:36:37,001 --> 01:36:38,110
He said to the hang man,

2844
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:39,190
hurry up you,

2845
01:36:39,190 --> 01:36:40,210
who's your basket?

2846
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,230
I could kill tip men and the time
it's taking you to new stuff.

2847
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:45,064
No.

2848
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:46,210
Right.

2849
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:47,830
That's Carl pants route man.

2850
01:36:48,520 --> 01:36:49,480
That's really something.

2851
01:36:49,481 --> 01:36:53,950
So the chapters about him and it's about
the Columbine kids who left a pretty

2852
01:36:53,951 --> 01:36:55,230
decent stock of writings.

2853
01:36:55,231 --> 01:36:59,410
And how about the guy who showed up
the elementary school about people like

2854
01:36:59,411 --> 01:36:59,681
that,

2855
01:36:59,681 --> 01:37:02,980
if what their motivation is
and why they're so angry,

2856
01:37:03,070 --> 01:37:08,050
like so unbelievably hellishly say
tactically angry cause that's the only

2857
01:37:08,051 --> 01:37:11,590
language that really suffices to
describe that level of outreach.

2858
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:12,543
You can't even,

2859
01:37:12,730 --> 01:37:17,260
you're not even close to describing
what's going on in situations like that.

2860
01:37:17,650 --> 01:37:20,320
You find yourself forced to
use a theological language.

2861
01:37:20,321 --> 01:37:25,321
It's the only language that suffices
to encapsulate that kind of absolute

2862
01:37:25,451 --> 01:37:26,320
brutality.

2863
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,071
It's,

2864
01:37:27,071 --> 01:37:27,540
it's,

2865
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:28,480
it's hellish.

2866
01:37:32,110 --> 01:37:32,740
Okay.

2867
01:37:32,740 --> 01:37:34,130
They make a powerful case for him.

2868
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:35,260
Yeah.

2869
01:37:35,260 --> 01:37:36,220
That's the thing.

2870
01:37:36,800 --> 01:37:39,910
It's powerful enough to
convince them of it's right now.

2871
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:40,710
Sorry,

2872
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:41,580
I looked at that.

2873
01:37:42,390 --> 01:37:42,640
All right.

2874
01:37:42,640 --> 01:37:43,300
It's all about it.

2875
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:43,880
A lot.

2876
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:47,200
Almost like cause life is very hard
and people do get betrayed in there is

2877
01:37:47,210 --> 01:37:48,320
malevolence in the world.

2878
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:49,353
Like it's,

2879
01:37:49,370 --> 01:37:49,670
yeah,

2880
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:49,830
the,

2881
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:53,390
I don't think there's a single person
alive who doesn't have some point think,

2882
01:37:53,870 --> 01:37:54,220
okay,

2883
01:37:54,220 --> 01:37:56,640
well maybe I should it that's one thing.

2884
01:37:56,970 --> 01:37:58,340
But not even that to say,

2885
01:37:58,380 --> 01:38:01,890
well maybe this is just so terrible
that it should just not exist at all.

2886
01:38:02,270 --> 01:38:06,300
You'll find yourself in situations like
that when your dreams are dashed really

2887
01:38:06,301 --> 01:38:08,760
in an unpleasant way or someone
close to you has a very,

2888
01:38:08,761 --> 01:38:10,080
very painful illness,

2889
01:38:10,081 --> 01:38:10,914
something like that.

2890
01:38:10,920 --> 01:38:12,210
Especially if it's a child,

2891
01:38:12,570 --> 01:38:14,930
it's very easy to B two B.

2892
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:17,801
Well,

2893
01:38:17,801 --> 01:38:22,090
to find yourself questioning whether
beating itself is a justifiable,

2894
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:24,830
if reality itself is just the firewall.

2895
01:38:25,620 --> 01:38:27,460
It's like because of all it's suffering.

2896
01:38:31,900 --> 01:38:33,880
So what do you do about,

2897
01:38:36,100 --> 01:38:40,180
so there's this book I read
called the cocktail party Celia,

2898
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:45,330
and then in the cocktail party there's
a woman who speaks to a psychiatrist and

2899
01:38:46,391 --> 01:38:48,370
she says that her life
isn't going very well.

2900
01:38:48,371 --> 01:38:49,330
She's suffering a lot,

2901
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:52,210
and she tells the psychiatrist,

2902
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:55,360
I really hope that this is my fault.

2903
01:38:56,440 --> 01:38:57,940
I'm the psychiatrist says,

2904
01:38:57,941 --> 01:38:58,774
well,

2905
01:38:59,080 --> 01:38:59,913
what do you mean you hope?

2906
01:38:59,920 --> 01:39:00,880
If this is your fault,

2907
01:39:00,881 --> 01:39:01,990
why would you hope that?

2908
01:39:02,470 --> 01:39:02,981
And she says,

2909
01:39:02,981 --> 01:39:03,191
well,

2910
01:39:03,191 --> 01:39:03,431
look,

2911
01:39:03,431 --> 01:39:04,241
if it's my fault,

2912
01:39:04,241 --> 01:39:05,650
then maybe I could do something about it.

2913
01:39:05,651 --> 01:39:06,370
But if it's just,

2914
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:07,690
this is just how it is,

2915
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:10,480
it's like if this is just
the structure of reality,

2916
01:39:10,481 --> 01:39:11,710
then I've lost.

2917
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:12,850
You know,

2918
01:39:12,850 --> 01:39:14,380
that's a really good thought.

2919
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:14,681
Well,

2920
01:39:14,681 --> 01:39:16,030
Tsla Ian was a genius.

2921
01:39:16,150 --> 01:39:17,310
That's a really good thoughts,

2922
01:39:17,350 --> 01:39:19,870
like that's a pretty good place
to start because you think,

2923
01:39:19,871 --> 01:39:20,680
well,

2924
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:24,820
when everything isn't going you away
and that's going to happen a lot.

2925
01:39:24,821 --> 01:39:25,331
You know when,

2926
01:39:25,331 --> 01:39:26,350
when there's suffering,

2927
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:31,770
the suffering in your life exceeds
what you think to be reasonable and you

2928
01:39:31,811 --> 01:39:34,570
attempted to curse fate with all that.

2929
01:39:34,571 --> 01:39:35,890
That entails.

2930
01:39:36,760 --> 01:39:37,181
You think,

2931
01:39:37,181 --> 01:39:38,014
well,

2932
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:43,900
have you done everything
that you could do?

2933
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:47,640
Have you put your house in order?

2934
01:39:48,420 --> 01:39:50,670
There's opportunities that are
sitting there in front of you.

2935
01:39:50,880 --> 01:39:51,181
It's like,

2936
01:39:51,181 --> 01:39:53,640
have you made full use of the right?

2937
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:55,200
Have you imagined?

2938
01:39:55,260 --> 01:39:58,650
Because life is so difficult
that you don't get to waste.

2939
01:39:58,710 --> 01:39:59,940
You don't get to waste it.

2940
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,680
You don't get to waste resources.

2941
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:05,460
They're too precious because you have
too big a problem to solve and why waste

2942
01:40:05,461 --> 01:40:10,260
resources so things aren't turning out
for you exactly the way you want them to.

2943
01:40:10,261 --> 01:40:11,010
It's like,

2944
01:40:11,010 --> 01:40:11,880
well,

2945
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:14,790
how much time are you wasting?

2946
01:40:15,250 --> 01:40:15,711
All right.

2947
01:40:15,711 --> 01:40:20,711
You Ask my students there 20 something
years old at the crowd of the maybe 200 I

2948
01:40:21,091 --> 01:40:21,271
say,

2949
01:40:21,271 --> 01:40:22,104
okay,

2950
01:40:22,150 --> 01:40:22,410
let's,

2951
01:40:22,410 --> 01:40:22,771
let's,

2952
01:40:22,771 --> 01:40:24,420
let's do a quick analysis of your life.

2953
01:40:24,750 --> 01:40:26,580
How many of you wasted an hour a day?

2954
01:40:26,581 --> 01:40:30,780
It's like everybody puts up
their hands three hours a day.

2955
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:32,670
Everybody puts up their hands.

2956
01:40:32,671 --> 01:40:36,210
It's like usually by seven hours a day.

2957
01:40:36,270 --> 01:40:38,220
Some people have their hands down,

2958
01:40:38,520 --> 01:40:39,230
right?

2959
01:40:39,230 --> 01:40:40,470
I just wasted time.

2960
01:40:40,471 --> 01:40:41,060
Like man,

2961
01:40:41,060 --> 01:40:44,550
we do a quick financial analysis cause
like if you're a university student,

2962
01:40:44,551 --> 01:40:47,550
maybe your time's worth 50 bucks
an hour or something like that.

2963
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:49,230
If you consider in terms of,

2964
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:50,123
you know,

2965
01:40:50,610 --> 01:40:51,570
lifetime earnings,

2966
01:40:51,930 --> 01:40:52,860
it's like seven hours a,

2967
01:40:53,200 --> 01:40:54,310
it's $350

2968
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:54,611
a day.

2969
01:40:54,611 --> 01:40:56,080
It's about $2,000 a week,

2970
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:58,660
$40,000 months for $100,000 a year.

2971
01:40:58,661 --> 01:40:59,494
It's like,

2972
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:00,170
fine.

2973
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:01,870
It's like your life isn't everything.

2974
01:41:01,900 --> 01:41:05,140
It could be you're wasting
a hundred thousand dollars
worth of your time a year.

2975
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:08,530
It's like maybe possibly
there's a causal connection.

2976
01:41:09,460 --> 01:41:11,080
It's worth contemplating,

2977
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:11,860
right?

2978
01:41:11,860 --> 01:41:12,460
Kind of.

2979
01:41:12,460 --> 01:41:14,050
This is an existential question.

2980
01:41:14,051 --> 01:41:14,530
It's like,

2981
01:41:14,530 --> 01:41:17,500
and I don't know the answer to this
because I do know that life is brutally

2982
01:41:17,501 --> 01:41:19,780
difficult and that we're
up against it all the time,

2983
01:41:19,930 --> 01:41:21,880
both in terms of tragedy and malevolence.

2984
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:22,960
It's no joke,

2985
01:41:22,961 --> 01:41:23,231
man,

2986
01:41:23,231 --> 01:41:23,710
it's,

2987
01:41:23,710 --> 01:41:25,780
it's full frontal attack.

2988
01:41:25,900 --> 01:41:27,280
If you're a human being,

2989
01:41:27,910 --> 01:41:31,240
it's like what do you have
to mitigate against that?

2990
01:41:31,660 --> 01:41:35,920
And that's sort that is you have what
presents itself to you as possibility and

2991
01:41:35,921 --> 01:41:36,754
opportunity.

2992
01:41:36,880 --> 01:41:37,870
That's all you have.

2993
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:38,800
And so then you might say,

2994
01:41:38,801 --> 01:41:39,370
well,

2995
01:41:39,370 --> 01:41:42,550
if you made full use of everything
that was offered to you,

2996
01:41:43,900 --> 01:41:45,100
what would your life be like?

2997
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:47,170
And that's,

2998
01:41:47,260 --> 01:41:51,550
that's a thought that
you can use productively.

2999
01:41:52,150 --> 01:41:55,390
It pretty much every situation forever.

3000
01:41:56,080 --> 01:41:58,330
And there's something about
it that's really like,

3001
01:41:58,331 --> 01:42:03,331
it's a really profound idea because
it is the case that you have.

3002
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:06,070
I actually think this is the case.

3003
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:08,230
I think that what we confront,

3004
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:10,900
this is how I think
reality is constituted.

3005
01:42:13,030 --> 01:42:18,030
I think that we confront reality
as divine centers of consciousness.

3006
01:42:19,540 --> 01:42:19,841
I don't,

3007
01:42:19,841 --> 01:42:21,580
I don't think there's a
better way of saying that.

3008
01:42:21,790 --> 01:42:26,290
And the reason I say that
define is because we don't
understand consciousness at

3009
01:42:26,291 --> 01:42:27,124
all.

3010
01:42:27,370 --> 01:42:29,980
We don't understand its
relationship to material reality.

3011
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:34,900
And we do know that it's intake really
involved with being no consciousness,

3012
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:35,400
no,

3013
01:42:35,400 --> 01:42:37,810
no one to experience what is there.

3014
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:39,431
Well,

3015
01:42:39,431 --> 01:42:41,620
you can't even say there's a,

3016
01:42:42,010 --> 01:42:44,770
we've confront potential consciously,

3017
01:42:45,720 --> 01:42:46,650
we interact with it.

3018
01:42:47,640 --> 01:42:47,770
Well,

3019
01:42:47,770 --> 01:42:49,360
how much potential is there?

3020
01:42:50,050 --> 01:42:50,883
Well,

3021
01:42:52,060 --> 01:42:56,080
we're a very finite and
constrained like a genie in a,

3022
01:42:56,230 --> 01:42:58,900
it allows just like that.

3023
01:42:59,110 --> 01:43:00,970
That's where that idea exists.

3024
01:43:01,750 --> 01:43:02,650
We're constrained,

3025
01:43:03,150 --> 01:43:03,970
you know,

3026
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:04,803
and,

3027
01:43:05,760 --> 01:43:07,000
and there's reason for that.

3028
01:43:07,001 --> 01:43:08,140
It's a complicated reason,

3029
01:43:08,141 --> 01:43:09,730
but we won't go into that for a moment.

3030
01:43:10,330 --> 01:43:11,163
But,

3031
01:43:11,170 --> 01:43:14,500
but what we confront seems to be something
that's essentially infinite in its

3032
01:43:14,501 --> 01:43:15,430
potential.

3033
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:16,871
So then you take,

3034
01:43:16,871 --> 01:43:17,290
well,

3035
01:43:17,290 --> 01:43:19,630
if you have an impossible
problem and you do,

3036
01:43:19,660 --> 01:43:21,070
you have an impossible problem.

3037
01:43:21,070 --> 01:43:22,090
And so does everybody else.

3038
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,940
What do you need to solve
an impossible problem?

3039
01:43:24,970 --> 01:43:26,200
You need an infinite,

3040
01:43:26,350 --> 01:43:28,960
you need it for the potential
to solve an impossible problem.

3041
01:43:29,110 --> 01:43:29,321
Well,

3042
01:43:29,321 --> 01:43:30,850
maybe you have that right in front of you.

3043
01:43:30,970 --> 01:43:32,860
And I actually think this is true.

3044
01:43:33,220 --> 01:43:38,220
I think that if you conducted your life
as if what you had in front of you was

3045
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:40,090
infinite potential,

3046
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,580
that he find out that that was true.

3047
01:43:43,450 --> 01:43:45,910
And I think that in interacting with that,

3048
01:43:46,330 --> 01:43:51,310
you'd also find what you needed to
justify the catastrophe of your life.

3049
01:43:51,490 --> 01:43:53,030
That that's what you need to do.

3050
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:58,000
And maybe maybe you could even find
it so that you would accept it.

3051
01:43:58,880 --> 01:43:59,713
You'd except the,

3052
01:43:59,990 --> 01:44:00,823
because

3053
01:44:02,600 --> 01:44:05,420
I tried to develop this too in the rest
of the book and I didn't think I'll

3054
01:44:05,421 --> 01:44:06,470
probably close with this.

3055
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:09,260
I thought about my son
when he was a little kid.

3056
01:44:09,290 --> 01:44:10,123
You know,

3057
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:11,030
it's about three.

3058
01:44:11,060 --> 01:44:12,680
He was super cute kid.

3059
01:44:12,740 --> 01:44:13,790
I still think he's cute,

3060
01:44:13,791 --> 01:44:15,620
but he's like 26 and he doesn't care.

3061
01:44:15,830 --> 01:44:18,980
So He's a really cute kid.

3062
01:44:19,010 --> 01:44:19,361
But you know,

3063
01:44:19,361 --> 01:44:21,020
he's three and three year olds.

3064
01:44:21,350 --> 01:44:21,891
They're like,

3065
01:44:21,891 --> 01:44:24,200
they stand up under tables
and bumped their head.

3066
01:44:24,220 --> 01:44:26,630
Like they fall down the stairs
and other kids pushed them over.

3067
01:44:26,631 --> 01:44:27,290
It's like,

3068
01:44:27,290 --> 01:44:28,123
you know,

3069
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:31,880
you're pretty fragile when you're three
and it's kind of painful if you're a

3070
01:44:31,881 --> 01:44:35,150
parrot noticing how fragile
and your children are.

3071
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:36,530
And so you think,

3072
01:44:36,830 --> 01:44:36,981
well,

3073
01:44:36,981 --> 01:44:38,450
it's painful that fragility.

3074
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:41,060
And then so I did a
little thought exercise.

3075
01:44:41,061 --> 01:44:41,331
I thought,

3076
01:44:41,331 --> 01:44:41,541
okay,

3077
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:42,230
well let's,

3078
01:44:42,230 --> 01:44:46,040
let's dispense with the
fragility since it's so painful.

3079
01:44:46,041 --> 01:44:46,371
It's like,

3080
01:44:46,371 --> 01:44:51,371
well he shouldn't be like three feet tall
because that's not working out 20 feet

3081
01:44:52,941 --> 01:44:53,774
tall.

3082
01:44:53,780 --> 01:44:54,620
That'd be good.

3083
01:44:54,910 --> 01:44:55,340
And then,

3084
01:44:55,340 --> 01:44:56,180
well,

3085
01:44:56,270 --> 01:44:58,070
why camper to be made of flesh and blood?

3086
01:44:58,070 --> 01:44:58,903
Because what we do,

3087
01:44:59,840 --> 01:45:01,160
we know if that that's a problem.

3088
01:45:01,300 --> 01:45:01,641
It's like to,

3089
01:45:01,641 --> 01:45:02,780
how about titanium?

3090
01:45:02,781 --> 01:45:06,860
Who just replace it with robotic part
so it can be 20 feet tall and made of

3091
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:07,820
titanium.

3092
01:45:08,300 --> 01:45:08,750
It don't want,

3093
01:45:08,750 --> 01:45:13,750
obviously you want something like that
to be capable of defending itself.

3094
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:16,130
So it's kind of a fighting machine.

3095
01:45:16,131 --> 01:45:16,431
It's like,

3096
01:45:16,431 --> 01:45:16,761
okay,

3097
01:45:16,761 --> 01:45:21,350
well so now I can dispense with my three
year old sound and I can have this 20

3098
01:45:21,351 --> 01:45:24,590
foot tall robotic fighting machine
that's more or less indestructible.

3099
01:45:25,250 --> 01:45:26,083
It's like,

3100
01:45:26,290 --> 01:45:27,980
who's going to make that trade?

3101
01:45:29,060 --> 01:45:32,990
And that's strange j because it's not,

3102
01:45:33,050 --> 01:45:35,090
it's not obvious why you
wouldn't make that trade.

3103
01:45:35,091 --> 01:45:38,960
But what happens is that by
sacrificing that for agility,

3104
01:45:39,020 --> 01:45:40,190
which is what you'd be doing,

3105
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:43,040
you actually end up
sacrificing what you love.

3106
01:45:43,730 --> 01:45:44,570
And so then you think,

3107
01:45:44,571 --> 01:45:44,750
well,

3108
01:45:44,750 --> 01:45:45,830
isn't that a funny thing?

3109
01:45:45,831 --> 01:45:47,100
Because we,

3110
01:45:47,120 --> 01:45:48,650
we love people.

3111
01:45:48,740 --> 01:45:48,951
You know,

3112
01:45:48,951 --> 01:45:50,390
we all have someone we love if we're,

3113
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:54,110
if we're the least bit fortunate
and so often our children hopefully,

3114
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:55,790
but then there's that,

3115
01:45:56,300 --> 01:45:56,631
but it's,

3116
01:45:56,631 --> 01:45:59,000
you see this also when
your parents get older,

3117
01:45:59,180 --> 01:45:59,421
you know,

3118
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:01,970
they start getting fragile and
all sorts of ways and you think,

3119
01:46:01,971 --> 01:46:03,290
well God,

3120
01:46:03,300 --> 01:46:04,880
it's not so good that there so fragile.

3121
01:46:04,881 --> 01:46:05,151
It's like,

3122
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:05,451
okay,

3123
01:46:05,451 --> 01:46:06,500
start replacing it.

3124
01:46:07,010 --> 01:46:08,580
What were you going to stop?

3125
01:46:08,720 --> 01:46:11,930
You're going to start with
all of that fragility gone.

3126
01:46:11,931 --> 01:46:13,340
It's like the person's gone then.

3127
01:46:13,910 --> 01:46:17,390
And so then there's this strange
way where if you love someone,

3128
01:46:18,440 --> 01:46:23,360
you civil tenuously love and
accept their fragility and that,

3129
01:46:23,361 --> 01:46:26,780
that means that in some way you actually
think it's justifiable that the heart,

3130
01:46:26,781 --> 01:46:28,040
that's what I thought about my son.

3131
01:46:28,041 --> 01:46:28,371
It's like,

3132
01:46:28,371 --> 01:46:28,551
no,

3133
01:46:28,551 --> 01:46:29,301
I think he's fine.

3134
01:46:29,301 --> 01:46:31,640
Just the way he is like three years old,

3135
01:46:31,910 --> 01:46:33,050
God has problems,

3136
01:46:33,320 --> 01:46:33,920
you know,

3137
01:46:33,920 --> 01:46:35,660
certainly gets hurt a fair bit.

3138
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,910
And is probably going to get hurt more,

3139
01:46:37,940 --> 01:46:39,440
but I'm not trained in.

3140
01:46:39,800 --> 01:46:41,210
I liked them just the way he is.

3141
01:46:41,211 --> 01:46:42,740
And so that's like a,

3142
01:46:42,860 --> 01:46:47,860
it's a realization of the soul that
there's something about the fragility of

3143
01:46:49,171 --> 01:46:53,340
human life that's actually valuable
and they just still limitation.

3144
01:46:53,370 --> 01:46:57,570
That's the thing that's so cool about
it is that it's this limitation that we

3145
01:46:57,571 --> 01:46:58,890
are because that's what we are,

3146
01:46:58,891 --> 01:47:00,120
is we're limitation.

3147
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:00,631
We're,

3148
01:47:00,631 --> 01:47:01,140
we're,

3149
01:47:01,140 --> 01:47:01,921
we're potential.

3150
01:47:01,921 --> 01:47:05,910
Can conjoin with limitation in some
sense take well we want to get rid of the

3151
01:47:05,940 --> 01:47:07,920
limitation but it's not the case.

3152
01:47:08,070 --> 01:47:11,550
We have to keep the limitation
because it's integral to who we are.

3153
01:47:11,610 --> 01:47:16,500
And so we're in this situation where we
have to be limited and we have to accept

3154
01:47:16,501 --> 01:47:21,501
it and we have to confront
what's essentially an
infinite potential to help us

3155
01:47:21,601 --> 01:47:22,434
manage it.

3156
01:47:23,340 --> 01:47:24,630
And I think that,

3157
01:47:24,900 --> 01:47:27,960
I think that that's why
I think that that's true.

3158
01:47:29,130 --> 01:47:30,390
I think that's how we act.

3159
01:47:30,391 --> 01:47:31,590
I think it's what we expect.

3160
01:47:31,591 --> 01:47:34,440
I think it's what we need to
know cause you have to say,

3161
01:47:34,441 --> 01:47:38,580
and that's part of standing up straight
paid and accepting the tragedy and

3162
01:47:38,581 --> 01:47:40,080
catastrophe of existence.

3163
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:42,190
This is partly why I
think the West Florida,

3164
01:47:42,240 --> 01:47:43,073
right?

3165
01:47:44,460 --> 01:47:45,770
Because I do think we got it right.

3166
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:50,910
The central story where a Judeo
Christian culture and there's a,

3167
01:47:51,090 --> 01:47:55,860
there's a central story at the bottom
and the story is about the radical

3168
01:47:55,861 --> 01:47:57,720
acceptance of fragility.

3169
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:00,480
That's what the crucifixion represents.

3170
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:03,120
The fact that that's a
voluntary act and it,

3171
01:48:03,150 --> 01:48:04,320
it's about everybody.

3172
01:48:04,350 --> 01:48:04,981
That's the thing.

3173
01:48:04,981 --> 01:48:05,940
It's about everybody.

3174
01:48:05,970 --> 01:48:06,780
It's that,

3175
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:07,613
well,

3176
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,023
you're going to die,

3177
01:48:09,540 --> 01:48:11,130
you're going to be betrayed.

3178
01:48:11,490 --> 01:48:12,930
Those are going to happen.

3179
01:48:14,160 --> 01:48:17,000
And so you can either
shrink from that and maybe,

3180
01:48:17,050 --> 01:48:22,050
and maybe it develop yourself
in bitterness and hatred
and no wonder no other,

3181
01:48:22,860 --> 01:48:24,360
or you can say,

3182
01:48:25,290 --> 01:48:26,430
bring it on,

3183
01:48:28,280 --> 01:48:29,060
bring it on.

3184
01:48:29,060 --> 01:48:34,060
[inaudible]

3185
01:48:41,340 --> 01:48:42,161
and so I would say,

3186
01:48:42,161 --> 01:48:42,994
well,

3187
01:48:44,800 --> 01:48:46,960
I've looked at dark
things as much as I can,

3188
01:48:47,890 --> 01:48:48,251
you know,

3189
01:48:48,251 --> 01:48:51,040
and I think that's probably
hurt me in many ways,

3190
01:48:51,520 --> 01:48:54,640
but let's be not unbelievably helpful,

3191
01:48:54,850 --> 01:48:55,121
you know,

3192
01:48:55,121 --> 01:48:59,770
because the thing about darkness
is it makes the light stand up.

3193
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:04,810
And as I've looked deeper and
deeper into terrible things,

3194
01:49:06,220 --> 01:49:10,600
I've also realized that that there's
something amazing about human beings.

3195
01:49:10,900 --> 01:49:11,111
You know,

3196
01:49:11,111 --> 01:49:12,880
because we are,

3197
01:49:12,940 --> 01:49:17,940
our lives are bounded by tragedy and
we are capable of deep malevolence more

3198
01:49:18,591 --> 01:49:20,830
solar than you can almost imagine,

3199
01:49:22,060 --> 01:49:23,860
but I don't think that's what defines us.

3200
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:24,753
I really don't.

3201
01:49:24,940 --> 01:49:27,790
I think what defines us is
the ability to transcend that.

3202
01:49:28,090 --> 01:49:30,730
I truly believe that and
so I'm not pessimistic.

3203
01:49:30,731 --> 01:49:32,630
I'm optimistic and knowing know.

3204
01:49:32,890 --> 01:49:34,270
I do believe that people,

3205
01:49:34,271 --> 01:49:37,090
I believe that people
are embodied miracles.

3206
01:49:37,120 --> 01:49:40,690
I really think that's the right way of
thinking about it and I think we all know

3207
01:49:40,691 --> 01:49:45,691
this and what I'm hoping egg in
these polarized times is that

3208
01:49:47,730 --> 01:49:52,730
that we return to that realization and
that we adopt the responsibility of full

3209
01:49:52,901 --> 01:49:53,560
individual.

3210
01:49:53,560 --> 01:49:58,150
Big has an antidote to well
idiot political polarization,

3211
01:49:58,390 --> 01:50:02,320
but also as an impetus for us all
to move forward into the future.

3212
01:50:02,560 --> 01:50:04,180
We're in an inflection point.

3213
01:50:04,181 --> 01:50:05,230
I think in our culture,

3214
01:50:05,231 --> 01:50:06,064
in the world,

3215
01:50:07,030 --> 01:50:10,960
things are opening up in front of us
that have never opened up before and it's

3216
01:50:10,961 --> 01:50:11,890
very dangerous.

3217
01:50:11,891 --> 01:50:16,210
Our technological prowess
is very dangerous and things
could go very dreadfully

3218
01:50:16,211 --> 01:50:17,044
wrong,

3219
01:50:17,290 --> 01:50:18,520
but I don't think they have to.

3220
01:50:18,521 --> 01:50:19,960
I think they could go extraordinarily.

3221
01:50:20,380 --> 01:50:21,213
Right.

3222
01:50:21,520 --> 01:50:23,170
And I think that each of us,

3223
01:50:23,171 --> 01:50:24,001
I do believe this,

3224
01:50:24,001 --> 01:50:26,080
that every single person sitting here,

3225
01:50:26,150 --> 01:50:27,370
every single person there is,

3226
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:31,270
but every single person sitting here
plays a key role in that decision.

3227
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:32,530
No,

3228
01:50:32,530 --> 01:50:33,370
we're all part of it.

3229
01:50:33,400 --> 01:50:34,690
We're deeply networked.

3230
01:50:34,691 --> 01:50:36,230
We all influence everyone else.

3231
01:50:36,231 --> 01:50:40,540
And we are these divine
centers of consciousness that
are separate but United at

3232
01:50:40,541 --> 01:50:41,241
the same time.

3233
01:50:41,241 --> 01:50:44,890
And the decisions that each of us make
as individuals are far more important

3234
01:50:44,891 --> 01:50:48,640
than we realize our lives are
ultimately it meaningful I think.

3235
01:50:48,860 --> 01:50:53,860
And that we do decide whether by our
actions we're going to bring a worse or a

3236
01:50:54,101 --> 01:50:56,710
better cosmos into Ba.

3237
01:50:57,040 --> 01:51:00,730
And I would say that we should dispense
with our resentment and bitterness

3238
01:51:00,760 --> 01:51:05,760
despite the fact that we have every
reason for it and stand up and face things

3239
01:51:06,191 --> 01:51:10,150
forthrightly and speak the truth
and make the world a better place.

3240
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:15,650
[inaudible]

3241
01:51:29,050 --> 01:51:31,710
and that seems like a good place to stop.

3242
01:51:34,600 --> 01:51:39,600
[inaudible] [inaudible]

3243
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:08,220
am I mistaken or he only
knocked out six rules there.

3244
01:52:08,221 --> 01:52:09,054
Huh?

3245
01:52:10,070 --> 01:52:11,810
You guys want to do
this at my place after?

3246
01:52:13,880 --> 01:52:14,713
Okay.

3247
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,120
I look that could quite get all yet,

3248
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:16,840
but we'll try it.

3249
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:17,710
We'll see what we can do.

3250
01:52:17,790 --> 01:52:18,340
All right Jordan,

3251
01:52:18,340 --> 01:52:21,930
just taking a second to just happen
to have the glass of water and uh,

3252
01:52:22,030 --> 01:52:23,320
maybe loosen his tie and then,

3253
01:52:23,350 --> 01:52:24,090
uh,

3254
01:52:24,090 --> 01:52:24,440
I mean,

3255
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:27,340
I guess we can do a Q and a unless
you guys fully got all that.

3256
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,540
All right.

3257
01:52:31,580 --> 01:52:36,580
[inaudible]

3258
01:52:39,780 --> 01:52:39,901
oh,

3259
01:52:39,901 --> 01:52:41,180
Harry is Jordan Peterson.

3260
01:52:42,150 --> 01:52:45,950
[inaudible]

3261
01:52:48,280 --> 01:52:49,180
all right.

3262
01:52:49,260 --> 01:52:51,920
So I said is we're going to have
roughly 40 billion questions.

3263
01:52:51,921 --> 01:52:54,140
There's two mics on the sides down here.

3264
01:52:54,170 --> 01:52:56,240
They couldn't do it for
logistical reasons upstairs,

3265
01:52:56,241 --> 01:52:58,580
but we're told we will call on one or two.

3266
01:52:58,581 --> 01:52:59,570
You guys have yet,

3267
01:52:59,660 --> 01:53:01,040
if you speak clearly,

3268
01:53:01,430 --> 01:53:02,990
but why don't we start,

3269
01:53:02,991 --> 01:53:03,660
are we over here?

3270
01:53:03,660 --> 01:53:04,171
Where am I low?

3271
01:53:04,171 --> 01:53:05,110
And looking right over here,

3272
01:53:05,240 --> 01:53:10,240
you try to keep it kind of brief and a
no major or Asian so we can get to as

3273
01:53:10,581 --> 01:53:11,660
many questions as possible.

3274
01:53:11,870 --> 01:53:12,703
Take it away.

3275
01:53:13,560 --> 01:53:14,393
Good evening.

3276
01:53:14,600 --> 01:53:15,070
Uh,

3277
01:53:15,070 --> 01:53:17,460
my question is for Dr. Peterson.

3278
01:53:18,030 --> 01:53:21,420
You referenced in 12 rules
and thank you for your time.

3279
01:53:21,900 --> 01:53:25,230
Your referencing should follow the
rules to the dragon that gets bigger and

3280
01:53:25,231 --> 01:53:27,150
small increments if leftover,

3281
01:53:27,151 --> 01:53:27,984
if ignored.

3282
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:29,423
Um,

3283
01:53:29,820 --> 01:53:33,960
I was wondering if you thought that it
was possible to assume that you have

3284
01:53:33,961 --> 01:53:36,180
certain groups on the left,

3285
01:53:36,660 --> 01:53:40,230
if they achieve what they
felt maybe was equity,

3286
01:53:40,740 --> 01:53:45,740
could that possibly lead to them wanting
to then go further and actually subject

3287
01:53:46,450 --> 01:53:48,000
their political enemies?

3288
01:53:48,660 --> 01:53:53,660
Like what was no problem with the equity
idea is that there's no limit to the

3289
01:53:54,181 --> 01:53:56,610
number of fractionation is you can make,

3290
01:53:56,611 --> 01:53:58,350
you can generate for group identity.

3291
01:53:58,980 --> 01:54:02,910
So there's an unlimited number of
dimensions across which equity might be

3292
01:54:02,911 --> 01:54:03,744
attained.

3293
01:54:04,080 --> 01:54:05,250
Problem number one.

3294
01:54:05,670 --> 01:54:09,510
Problem number two is there's an
infinite fractionation of group identity.

3295
01:54:09,750 --> 01:54:10,590
So it's a problem.

3296
01:54:10,591 --> 01:54:12,120
It can never be sold.

3297
01:54:12,540 --> 01:54:14,780
So I mean what,

3298
01:54:14,781 --> 01:54:16,590
what groups are you going to make equal?

3299
01:54:16,620 --> 01:54:17,880
Cause that's a quick followup.

3300
01:54:17,910 --> 01:54:18,530
I guess what,

3301
01:54:18,530 --> 01:54:20,760
so just one step further would need them.

3302
01:54:20,790 --> 01:54:23,040
So if they achieve some type of equity,

3303
01:54:23,041 --> 01:54:26,760
would they maybe determined that they're
not going to be happy until they're in

3304
01:54:26,761 --> 01:54:28,170
charge of other people?

3305
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:28,900
Well,

3306
01:54:28,900 --> 01:54:29,310
well that,

3307
01:54:29,310 --> 01:54:30,400
that question means what?

3308
01:54:30,401 --> 01:54:32,520
What's the motivation at
the bottom of all this?

3309
01:54:32,521 --> 01:54:35,680
And I don't believe that the
motivation is equity at all.

3310
01:54:35,710 --> 01:54:39,940
Like I think the motivation is the
ending of the patriarchal tyranny,

3311
01:54:40,390 --> 01:54:41,470
and it will find the mentally,

3312
01:54:41,500 --> 01:54:42,370
and that's not the same.

3313
01:54:42,650 --> 01:54:44,020
Those are just mechanisms.

3314
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:45,910
Like having said that,

3315
01:54:45,940 --> 01:54:46,210
look,

3316
01:54:46,210 --> 01:54:49,540
I already stated that
inequality is a problem.

3317
01:54:49,760 --> 01:54:54,040
Inequality drives the
left and fair enough.

3318
01:54:54,070 --> 01:54:57,220
Like that's where you need a left wing
is because inequality is actually a

3319
01:54:57,221 --> 01:54:58,090
political problem.

3320
01:54:58,750 --> 01:55:03,430
But the radical abolishment of
inequality is not a possible goal.

3321
01:55:03,850 --> 01:55:05,230
There's one thing I did want to say.

3322
01:55:05,290 --> 01:55:07,810
We actually have a technical
problem in our culture.

3323
01:55:08,320 --> 01:55:08,741
Okay.

3324
01:55:08,741 --> 01:55:10,690
And it's something that's
worth thinking about.

3325
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:15,370
So the technical problem is we can
draw a border around the radical,

3326
01:55:15,371 --> 01:55:16,204
right.

3327
01:55:16,740 --> 01:55:16,991
You know,

3328
01:55:16,991 --> 01:55:19,780
so conservatives can say,

3329
01:55:19,930 --> 01:55:20,321
okay,

3330
01:55:20,321 --> 01:55:24,190
here's some people to the right of me
and they're claiming racial superiority

3331
01:55:24,191 --> 01:55:24,821
doctrines.

3332
01:55:24,821 --> 01:55:25,654
Let's say,

3333
01:55:25,750 --> 01:55:25,961
okay,

3334
01:55:25,961 --> 01:55:28,240
we're gonna put them in a
box and we're going to say,

3335
01:55:28,270 --> 01:55:31,360
you're not us and we're
not playing that game.

3336
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:32,290
Okay.

3337
01:55:32,290 --> 01:55:32,650
Right,

3338
01:55:32,650 --> 01:55:32,891
right.

3339
01:55:32,891 --> 01:55:36,340
And that that happened with William F.

3340
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:37,470
Buckley back in the 60s when,

3341
01:55:37,700 --> 01:55:41,620
when he started his conservative movement
and disassociated themselves from the

3342
01:55:41,621 --> 01:55:42,610
white supremacists.

3343
01:55:42,640 --> 01:55:42,950
So like,

3344
01:55:42,950 --> 01:55:43,620
okay,

3345
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:46,020
now we know that people can
go too far on the right,

3346
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:46,920
right?

3347
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:48,050
That was what the Nazis for there,

3348
01:55:48,110 --> 01:55:51,660
but then we know that people
can go too far on the left.

3349
01:55:52,270 --> 01:55:52,751
It was a beat.

3350
01:55:52,751 --> 01:55:55,560
The communists and 100 million
people they manage to kill.

3351
01:55:55,620 --> 01:55:55,861
Okay,

3352
01:55:55,861 --> 01:55:58,920
so we know that people can
go too far on the left.

3353
01:55:59,460 --> 01:56:00,293
Okay,

3354
01:56:00,330 --> 01:56:01,500
what's the marker?

3355
01:56:02,700 --> 01:56:03,270
Okay.

3356
01:56:03,270 --> 01:56:04,950
And the answer is we don't know.

3357
01:56:05,440 --> 01:56:07,140
And that's not a good enough answer,

3358
01:56:07,530 --> 01:56:09,810
especially not for people on the list,

3359
01:56:10,320 --> 01:56:15,320
because they have the same
ethical responsibility to
dissociate themselves from

3360
01:56:15,331 --> 01:56:16,740
the dangerous radicals.

3361
01:56:16,930 --> 01:56:18,660
Has the Conservatives do on the right,

3362
01:56:19,170 --> 01:56:20,970
but they're incapable of doing it.

3363
01:56:21,000 --> 01:56:21,510
Now,

3364
01:56:21,510 --> 01:56:22,830
partly it's technical.

3365
01:56:22,860 --> 01:56:23,693
It's like,

3366
01:56:24,180 --> 01:56:24,361
well,

3367
01:56:24,361 --> 01:56:27,030
you can point to racial superiority
doctrines on the right can.

3368
01:56:27,031 --> 01:56:27,451
You can say,

3369
01:56:27,451 --> 01:56:27,601
no,

3370
01:56:27,601 --> 01:56:28,710
we're not going there.

3371
01:56:28,830 --> 01:56:31,290
What exactly do you 0.2 on the left?

3372
01:56:31,890 --> 01:56:33,480
Because the idea is in,

3373
01:56:33,481 --> 01:56:35,270
in their individual form,

3374
01:56:35,271 --> 01:56:36,210
see,

3375
01:56:36,510 --> 01:56:38,370
well at least harmless.

3376
01:56:38,380 --> 01:56:39,600
Even though they're not,

3377
01:56:39,660 --> 01:56:43,860
they seem at least harvest and they ha
they have the mask of even something that

3378
01:56:43,861 --> 01:56:45,270
appears to be beneficial.

3379
01:56:45,690 --> 01:56:48,620
Now I think of all the
pathological ideas on the left,

3380
01:56:48,900 --> 01:56:51,150
the most dangerous is equity.

3381
01:56:51,540 --> 01:56:55,290
I would say when people start
talking about equality of outcome,

3382
01:56:56,130 --> 01:57:01,130
they've crossed the Rubicon and then it's
incumbent on reasonable people in the

3383
01:57:01,501 --> 01:57:06,501
center and on the left can point that
out and dissociate themselves from them

3384
01:57:06,750 --> 01:57:09,690
and they're not doing
it and it's not good.

3385
01:57:10,220 --> 01:57:11,053
Thank you.

3386
01:57:16,130 --> 01:57:18,980
If only there was someone that came
from the left that had been trying to do

3387
01:57:18,981 --> 01:57:19,221
that,

3388
01:57:19,221 --> 01:57:20,150
but his past couple of years,

3389
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:23,343
Ruben.

3390
01:57:29,070 --> 01:57:33,650
All right to say I gave up
three hours of gameplay play.

3391
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:35,183
Okay,

3392
01:57:40,370 --> 01:57:41,780
and it's questions about Zelda.

3393
01:57:43,420 --> 01:57:43,940
No.

3394
01:57:43,940 --> 01:57:47,720
Here's an interesting spin off from the
Jq that I've been pondering on recently.

3395
01:57:48,110 --> 01:57:52,280
How do we solve nepotism and [inaudible]
preferences in groups as the majority

3396
01:57:52,281 --> 01:57:53,690
of the power and influence?

3397
01:57:53,930 --> 01:57:55,640
Is it even a problem at all?

3398
01:57:56,030 --> 01:57:56,631
By the way,

3399
01:57:56,631 --> 01:57:58,340
this doesn't have to
do anything with Rice.

3400
01:57:58,341 --> 01:57:59,960
Any differential factor can,

3401
01:58:00,100 --> 01:58:00,491
yeah,

3402
01:58:00,491 --> 01:58:01,324
it can be used here.

3403
01:58:02,970 --> 01:58:03,361
Well,

3404
01:58:03,361 --> 01:58:05,910
I mean I think that we solved
the problem with nepotism.

3405
01:58:05,911 --> 01:58:08,550
The way that we have essentially
solved it in the west.

3406
01:58:09,140 --> 01:58:09,570
You know,

3407
01:58:09,570 --> 01:58:11,310
our bureaucracies for example,

3408
01:58:11,311 --> 01:58:13,290
are basically meritocratic.

3409
01:58:13,880 --> 01:58:14,160
No,

3410
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:14,520
you know,

3411
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:17,700
measuring merit is no simple thing,

3412
01:58:17,790 --> 01:58:18,091
right?

3413
01:58:18,091 --> 01:58:21,840
Because it's not easy to establish a
measurement that actually has a decent

3414
01:58:21,841 --> 01:58:23,700
correlation with the desired outcome.

3415
01:58:23,850 --> 01:58:24,571
If it was easy,

3416
01:58:24,571 --> 01:58:26,610
everybody could set up
a successful business,

3417
01:58:26,670 --> 01:58:28,080
it's actually very difficult.

3418
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:29,400
But we have decided,

3419
01:58:29,850 --> 01:58:32,850
imagine that managing your
institution has a function.

3420
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:34,140
Okay.

3421
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:36,420
Which you know is not
so difficult to imagine.

3422
01:58:36,930 --> 01:58:39,540
And then imagine people
differ in that function,

3423
01:58:39,570 --> 01:58:41,890
which obviously they will then imagine,

3424
01:58:41,950 --> 01:58:44,470
imagine you could measure
those differences.

3425
01:58:44,850 --> 01:58:45,880
Now we kind of do that.

3426
01:58:45,881 --> 01:58:46,780
So for example,

3427
01:58:46,900 --> 01:58:48,160
if you're applying to university,

3428
01:58:48,161 --> 01:58:53,161
you might have to take the sat because
we know that sat scores roughly sample

3429
01:58:53,481 --> 01:58:57,340
the same competence domain
that university does now.

3430
01:58:57,340 --> 01:58:59,200
It's not perfect by any stretch.

3431
01:58:59,201 --> 01:58:59,561
In fact,

3432
01:58:59,561 --> 01:59:04,090
the correlation between her sat scores
and grades is about 0.4 or something like

3433
01:59:04,091 --> 01:59:04,361
that.

3434
01:59:04,361 --> 01:59:09,361
So leaves about 85% 70% let's
say of the variance unexplained,

3435
01:59:11,340 --> 01:59:12,250
but it's on [inaudible],

3436
01:59:12,300 --> 01:59:15,850
active and neutral and it's
the best that we've got.

3437
01:59:16,030 --> 01:59:17,980
And so that's what you
do is you reduce people,

3438
01:59:17,981 --> 01:59:20,500
the individuals first
of all and then you say,

3439
01:59:20,501 --> 01:59:20,711
well,

3440
01:59:20,711 --> 01:59:25,030
we're going to assist you in accordance
with your competence in relationship to

3441
01:59:25,031 --> 01:59:27,010
the function of this organization had.

3442
01:59:27,011 --> 01:59:28,690
That's all we're going to do.

3443
01:59:29,440 --> 01:59:31,650
We do that quite well now it's,

3444
01:59:31,660 --> 01:59:33,790
it's very difficult if
we can't do it perfectly,

3445
01:59:33,791 --> 01:59:38,791
but there isn't a better solution and
to to substitute instead like quotas for

3446
01:59:40,781 --> 01:59:42,520
race and sex is,

3447
01:59:42,730 --> 01:59:45,220
well it's impossibly dangerous.

3448
01:59:45,670 --> 01:59:50,200
It promotes us into the identity
politics realm and that's subject gates,

3449
01:59:50,201 --> 01:59:53,690
the individual to the group and
that's fine if you want like on travel

3450
01:59:53,691 --> 01:59:54,524
tribalism,

3451
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:55,600
okay,

3452
01:59:55,600 --> 01:59:56,433
go for it.

3453
01:59:56,900 --> 02:00:00,790
But we know where as elite it leads to,

3454
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:02,350
it leads to death.

3455
02:00:03,160 --> 02:00:05,350
That's where it leads and
maybe that's what you want.

3456
02:00:11,220 --> 02:00:13,280
Why don't we try one one up in the second?

3457
02:00:13,281 --> 02:00:14,114
Anyone over there,

3458
02:00:15,970 --> 02:00:16,930
right there.

3459
02:00:18,590 --> 02:00:19,423
Yes,

3460
02:00:26,260 --> 02:00:26,980
yes.

3461
02:00:26,980 --> 02:00:27,940
Can you talk to any,

3462
02:00:27,970 --> 02:00:32,970
is there any benefits or the negative
emotion in your role or is it just let me

3463
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:34,184
someone else.

3464
02:00:35,460 --> 02:00:35,791
Okay,

3465
02:00:35,791 --> 02:00:37,890
so then the question is the gentleman,

3466
02:00:37,891 --> 02:00:41,310
who else the question said he took my
personality test and scored rather high in

3467
02:00:41,311 --> 02:00:44,460
neuroticism and asked if
there was any benefit to that.

3468
02:00:49,410 --> 02:00:50,243
Well,

3469
02:00:50,250 --> 02:00:50,501
you know,

3470
02:00:50,501 --> 02:00:51,360
the answer is,

3471
02:00:51,390 --> 02:00:53,880
the answer is it's a normal distribution,

3472
02:00:54,270 --> 02:00:54,570
right?

3473
02:00:54,570 --> 02:00:58,380
And so sometimes if you're terrified
out of your skull and hiding in the

3474
02:00:58,381 --> 02:00:58,921
basement,

3475
02:00:58,921 --> 02:01:02,040
then the king's tyrants
don't cut off your head.

3476
02:01:02,910 --> 02:01:03,211
Right.

3477
02:01:03,211 --> 02:01:06,480
So there are times when the environment
is so dangerous that you should be

3478
02:01:06,481 --> 02:01:08,670
terrified all the time and high.

3479
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:12,240
Like lots of human
environments are like that.

3480
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:12,910
Right.

3481
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:13,231
You know,

3482
02:01:13,231 --> 02:01:13,410
in,

3483
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:14,243
in many,

3484
02:01:14,590 --> 02:01:14,940
you know,

3485
02:01:14,940 --> 02:01:15,151
in,

3486
02:01:15,151 --> 02:01:16,770
in a western culture you might think,

3487
02:01:16,771 --> 02:01:16,951
well,

3488
02:01:16,951 --> 02:01:20,430
extroverted and emotionally
stable is a pretty good solution.

3489
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,140
Fair bit of positive emotion,

3490
02:01:22,380 --> 02:01:25,650
fair bit of verbal
assertiveness nor too much fear.

3491
02:01:25,680 --> 02:01:26,513
It's like,

3492
02:01:26,520 --> 02:01:26,701
well,

3493
02:01:26,701 --> 02:01:28,860
if you were like an extroverted,

3494
02:01:29,100 --> 02:01:32,730
extroverted and emotionally stable
in 1930s in the Soviet Union,

3495
02:01:32,731 --> 02:01:33,330
you were like,

3496
02:01:33,330 --> 02:01:34,163
damn,

3497
02:01:35,090 --> 02:01:35,401
fuck.

3498
02:01:35,401 --> 02:01:35,630
Yeah.

3499
02:01:35,630 --> 02:01:38,850
Because like if you're
introverted and terrified,

3500
02:01:39,130 --> 02:01:41,420
then maybe you will be killed.

3501
02:01:42,110 --> 02:01:46,550
So it's brutal because you have
to put up with the neuroticism,

3502
02:01:46,551 --> 02:01:46,730
right?

3503
02:01:46,730 --> 02:01:49,700
You have to put up with the anxiety
and maybe with the volatility as well.

3504
02:01:49,701 --> 02:01:51,950
But in a hyper dangerous environment,

3505
02:01:51,951 --> 02:01:53,270
it's inappropriate strategy.

3506
02:01:54,140 --> 02:01:55,940
So now having said that,

3507
02:01:55,950 --> 02:02:00,020
I would also say that if you're
neuroticism levels are extremely elevated,

3508
02:02:00,021 --> 02:02:04,040
then there's some possibility that you
have an anxiety disorder or that you're

3509
02:02:04,041 --> 02:02:06,800
depressed or that there's something
wrong with you physically that you might

3510
02:02:06,801 --> 02:02:08,000
want to get checked out.

3511
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:12,290
So because there's lots of reasons to be
upset and unhappy and some of them are

3512
02:02:12,291 --> 02:02:13,041
temperamental,

3513
02:02:13,041 --> 02:02:13,281
you know,

3514
02:02:13,281 --> 02:02:14,450
that's just how you're wired.

3515
02:02:14,451 --> 02:02:16,940
And you can detect that in
kids as early as six months.

3516
02:02:17,270 --> 02:02:19,920
But sometimes it's a secondary
consequence of you know,

3517
02:02:20,150 --> 02:02:22,400
other things that have
happened in your life or,

3518
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:22,910
or,

3519
02:02:22,910 --> 02:02:24,200
or general ill health.

3520
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:28,880
So I also think I've been puzzling for
a long time over why women have higher

3521
02:02:28,881 --> 02:02:30,890
levels of negative emotion than men.

3522
02:02:31,310 --> 02:02:32,150
And I think,

3523
02:02:32,210 --> 02:02:34,010
I think there's a couple
of reasons for it.

3524
02:02:34,190 --> 02:02:35,300
It kicks in at puberty,

3525
02:02:35,301 --> 02:02:35,721
by the way,

3526
02:02:35,721 --> 02:02:37,340
because it isn't true for boys and girls,

3527
02:02:37,341 --> 02:02:41,510
but it is true for adult men and women
and it's true throughout the lifespan.

3528
02:02:42,130 --> 02:02:45,710
I think the reason for it is is that
the world's actually more objectively

3529
02:02:45,711 --> 02:02:47,990
dangerous to women at an individual level,

3530
02:02:48,170 --> 02:02:50,980
partly because they're sexually
vulnerable and also partly because they're

3531
02:02:50,990 --> 02:02:51,890
physically smaller,

3532
02:02:52,430 --> 02:02:54,830
so it makes sense that
they'd be more nervous,

3533
02:02:55,070 --> 02:02:59,300
but then also I think women are more
sensitive to negative emotion because they

3534
02:02:59,301 --> 02:03:03,200
have to be sensitive to the distress
of India of infants because it isn't

3535
02:03:03,201 --> 02:03:07,190
obvious to me at all that female nervous
systems are adapted for the individual

3536
02:03:07,191 --> 02:03:07,910
female.

3537
02:03:07,910 --> 02:03:11,960
I think they're probably adapted for
the infant mother dyad and you're a lot

3538
02:03:11,961 --> 02:03:15,320
more vulnerable as an infant mother
diet than you are as an individual.

3539
02:03:15,620 --> 02:03:16,580
But I mean you have to be,

3540
02:03:17,030 --> 02:03:17,690
you know,

3541
02:03:17,690 --> 02:03:18,920
if you're a good mother,

3542
02:03:19,160 --> 02:03:21,260
especially of really young infants,

3543
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:24,100
you know when your infant
is sleeping and wakes up,

3544
02:03:24,120 --> 02:03:25,130
goes beep,

3545
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:30,190
you're a right response is to jump out
of bed awake and alert and go likely

3546
02:03:30,291 --> 02:03:34,940
nurse the infant and you have to be on
a hair trigger essentially to be that

3547
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:35,803
sensitive.

3548
02:03:36,020 --> 02:03:36,890
Well you pay a price.

3549
02:03:36,950 --> 02:03:38,120
Like if you think about it,

3550
02:03:38,121 --> 02:03:40,970
you pay a price for being
sensitive to your infant.

3551
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:42,920
Why the hell wouldn't
you pay a price for that?

3552
02:03:42,950 --> 02:03:45,740
Cause it's really like
infants are a lot of work.

3553
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:47,180
They require a lot of care.

3554
02:03:47,240 --> 02:03:48,950
You have to be super attentive to them.

3555
02:03:48,951 --> 02:03:50,630
They're unbelievably dependent.

3556
02:03:50,990 --> 02:03:54,530
And so to be wired for that means
you're going to pay a price.

3557
02:03:54,800 --> 02:03:58,520
Like maybe it's going to be harder for
you to deal with adult males because

3558
02:03:58,550 --> 02:04:00,890
you're more sensitive to
the distress of infants.

3559
02:04:00,950 --> 02:04:02,060
Highly probable.

3560
02:04:02,450 --> 02:04:03,920
So these things are

3561
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:05,260
okay.

3562
02:04:05,260 --> 02:04:07,540
You'd never get an advantage
without paying a price.

3563
02:04:07,570 --> 02:04:07,901
That's,

3564
02:04:07,901 --> 02:04:10,420
that's basically the rule from
a temperamental perspective

3565
02:04:11,910 --> 02:04:12,743
right here.

3566
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:14,350
Adoptive Peterson.

3567
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:15,430
My name's John Carlo,

3568
02:04:15,470 --> 02:04:16,303
Patelco.

3569
02:04:16,570 --> 02:04:16,871
First.

3570
02:04:16,871 --> 02:04:20,590
I just want to thank you so much for
sharing the fruits of your suffering with

3571
02:04:20,591 --> 02:04:22,600
us and all of the work that you've done.

3572
02:04:23,050 --> 02:04:23,771
I love it.

3573
02:04:23,771 --> 02:04:24,461
Appreciate it.

3574
02:04:24,461 --> 02:04:25,660
Thank you for doing that.

3575
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:26,201
Sharing.

3576
02:04:26,201 --> 02:04:28,780
I guess my question is about technology.

3577
02:04:28,781 --> 02:04:32,250
I've been doing a lot of thinking about
the role of technology in our evolution.

3578
02:04:32,950 --> 02:04:37,950
It's cert an amazing purpose in creating
distance between us nature so that we

3579
02:04:37,951 --> 02:04:39,960
can survive and live longer.

3580
02:04:40,310 --> 02:04:40,710
Um,

3581
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:44,340
but it seems like we've reached a
point of which technology is so deeply

3582
02:04:44,341 --> 02:04:49,341
embedded in our lives that
it is preventing us from
living a more meaningful by,

3583
02:04:50,340 --> 02:04:53,700
and I'm thinking specifically of the fact
that we now have these mobile devices

3584
02:04:53,701 --> 02:04:54,540
that are with us,

3585
02:04:54,541 --> 02:04:57,810
except when we were in the shower
and when we're sleeping basically.

3586
02:04:57,900 --> 02:04:59,440
And now there are water provide phones.

3587
02:04:59,450 --> 02:05:01,560
So I don't know what's
going to happen next,

3588
02:05:01,561 --> 02:05:05,240
but we have these phones with us all
the time and they've got social media on

3589
02:05:05,310 --> 02:05:05,580
that.

3590
02:05:05,580 --> 02:05:10,490
It seems like it kind of addictive and
distracting us from ourselves and our

3591
02:05:10,491 --> 02:05:11,150
lives.

3592
02:05:11,150 --> 02:05:14,420
And it's something that I'm exploring
and working on and have transformed my

3593
02:05:14,421 --> 02:05:16,100
life by taking control over.

3594
02:05:16,101 --> 02:05:17,930
I'm wondering if you have thoughts about,

3595
02:05:18,050 --> 02:05:18,440
uh,

3596
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:21,890
the role of technology in our lives and
if we've reached a turning point in some

3597
02:05:21,891 --> 02:05:22,724
ways.

3598
02:05:22,730 --> 02:05:23,540
Well,

3599
02:05:23,540 --> 02:05:23,931
okay,

3600
02:05:23,931 --> 02:05:26,530
I won't comment specifically
on the cellphone.

3601
02:05:27,110 --> 02:05:31,340
I think the reason for that is that
we're in a place where the rate of

3602
02:05:31,341 --> 02:05:35,510
technological transformation is so fast
that the probability that cell phones

3603
02:05:35,511 --> 02:05:38,210
will still be the problem
in 10 years is zero.

3604
02:05:38,750 --> 02:05:39,171
Right?

3605
02:05:39,171 --> 02:05:43,760
It'll be something else and maybe
something even more difficult to manage.

3606
02:05:44,420 --> 02:05:45,253
And so,

3607
02:05:45,530 --> 02:05:45,840
you know,

3608
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:50,840
I talked about this idea that this
infinite landscape of potential is opening

3609
02:05:51,231 --> 02:05:55,280
itself up to us even more right now than
it has in the past with his tremendous

3610
02:05:55,281 --> 02:05:57,110
rate of technological transformation.

3611
02:05:57,740 --> 02:05:57,891
Well,

3612
02:05:57,891 --> 02:05:58,850
the question is,

3613
02:05:58,970 --> 02:05:59,360
you're,

3614
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:03,230
the broader question that you
have is how do we deal with this?

3615
02:06:03,560 --> 02:06:04,820
And that's a great question.

3616
02:06:04,821 --> 02:06:08,360
But I would say the answer
to that is prepare yourself.

3617
02:06:09,230 --> 02:06:09,830
You know,

3618
02:06:09,830 --> 02:06:10,910
because if I say,

3619
02:06:10,940 --> 02:06:11,031
well,

3620
02:06:11,031 --> 02:06:11,390
there's,

3621
02:06:11,390 --> 02:06:12,260
there's a bunch,

3622
02:06:12,530 --> 02:06:15,890
there's a lot going to come
at you in the next 10 years.

3623
02:06:16,730 --> 02:06:19,370
And there's no predicting
what it's going to be.

3624
02:06:19,430 --> 02:06:22,880
It's going to be something that can be
used for ill and something that can be

3625
02:06:22,881 --> 02:06:23,840
used for good.

3626
02:06:24,230 --> 02:06:25,063
Well,

3627
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,660
but we can't predict it.

3628
02:06:26,690 --> 02:06:28,340
So what should you do?

3629
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:31,040
And the answer is you should prepare,

3630
02:06:31,490 --> 02:06:31,760
right?

3631
02:06:31,760 --> 02:06:34,970
You should eradicate
your obvious weaknesses,

3632
02:06:35,270 --> 02:06:36,920
you should strengthen yourself,

3633
02:06:36,950 --> 02:06:41,590
you should become more alert and more
educated and more disciplined and that,

3634
02:06:41,650 --> 02:06:45,170
and you'll do that in your own particular
way and that will make you a better

3635
02:06:45,171 --> 02:06:47,360
whoever you are that you are now.

3636
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,770
And as a collective,

3637
02:06:48,771 --> 02:06:50,360
that's the best we've got because,

3638
02:06:50,650 --> 02:06:50,850
and,

3639
02:06:50,850 --> 02:06:52,670
and I mean this is a really deep level.

3640
02:06:53,150 --> 02:06:57,920
We have become a planetary transforming
force and that's probably really been

3641
02:06:57,921 --> 02:06:59,510
true since the end of World War II.

3642
02:06:59,570 --> 02:06:59,840
Right?

3643
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:01,400
When we invented the hydrogen bomb,

3644
02:07:01,420 --> 02:07:03,250
it was like that was a,

3645
02:07:03,320 --> 02:07:05,120
that was a whole new thing.

3646
02:07:05,630 --> 02:07:10,630
And we obviously have to develop the
wisdom that will enable us to manage that

3647
02:07:12,230 --> 02:07:15,650
because what else are we going to
do otherwise we're infants with,

3648
02:07:15,890 --> 02:07:16,970
with guns.

3649
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:20,060
And one of the things I learned from Carl,

3650
02:07:20,070 --> 02:07:21,440
you know what I really liked,

3651
02:07:21,500 --> 02:07:22,410
I really liked this,

3652
02:07:22,411 --> 02:07:25,040
is he was very interested in Alchemy,

3653
02:07:25,850 --> 02:07:28,940
which was a weird ad mixture of ethics,

3654
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:30,420
religion and produce.

3655
02:07:30,421 --> 02:07:32,900
Science is the birthplace is science.

3656
02:07:33,350 --> 02:07:37,570
And it was kind of a dream and the was
that human beings could investigate the

3657
02:07:37,571 --> 02:07:40,420
material world and generate
the philosopher's stone,

3658
02:07:40,450 --> 02:07:42,100
which would make everybody healthy,

3659
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:43,113
wealthy,

3660
02:07:43,330 --> 02:07:44,163
immortal.

3661
02:07:44,170 --> 02:07:45,010
But there was a dream.

3662
02:07:45,011 --> 02:07:45,241
They're,

3663
02:07:45,241 --> 02:07:49,690
the dream was we could discover that
by investigating the material world.

3664
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:52,000
And that was the impetus for
the development of science.

3665
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:52,301
Well,

3666
02:07:52,301 --> 02:07:53,710
that took off like mad.

3667
02:07:53,890 --> 02:07:58,060
And in some sense we have
discovered the philosopher's stone.

3668
02:07:58,690 --> 02:07:59,740
We are much healthier,

3669
02:07:59,741 --> 02:08:00,730
we lived much longer,

3670
02:08:00,731 --> 02:08:01,810
were far richer,

3671
02:08:02,050 --> 02:08:03,400
and that was all a consequence of,

3672
02:08:03,620 --> 02:08:04,140
of,

3673
02:08:04,140 --> 02:08:06,070
of investigating the material world.

3674
02:08:06,071 --> 02:08:10,210
But there was a lot of religious and
ethical thinking that was part and parcel

3675
02:08:10,211 --> 02:08:11,560
of the l chemical dream.

3676
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:14,110
And it didn't grow the same way.

3677
02:08:14,440 --> 02:08:18,410
And so it's like we're stuck
ethically in like 1600 and we're,

3678
02:08:18,450 --> 02:08:20,260
and technologically it's,

3679
02:08:20,290 --> 02:08:23,380
it's the 21st century and
that's not good enough.

3680
02:08:23,620 --> 02:08:27,910
We have to become as powerful as
quickly as we are scientifically or,

3681
02:08:27,911 --> 02:08:29,350
or we'll do ourselves in.

3682
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:31,630
So that,

3683
02:08:31,631 --> 02:08:35,860
and I think that's part of what we're
trying to sort out is what's our ethical

3684
02:08:35,861 --> 02:08:36,760
responsibility?

3685
02:08:36,790 --> 02:08:40,300
How good could we become as individuals
and where could that take us if we

3686
02:08:40,301 --> 02:08:41,680
decide to go there?

3687
02:08:41,920 --> 02:08:42,753
So,

3688
02:08:42,760 --> 02:08:47,760
and cell phones are one
small but significant element
of that credibly powerful

3689
02:08:50,321 --> 02:08:51,154
devices,

3690
02:08:51,490 --> 02:08:56,470
but requiring wisdom in their management
and that's just going to get worse

3691
02:08:56,471 --> 02:09:00,220
because there are things coming down
the pipes technologically that we can,

3692
02:09:00,280 --> 02:09:01,390
we can't even imagine.

3693
02:09:02,160 --> 02:09:03,340
So thank you so much.

3694
02:09:17,200 --> 02:09:17,570
No,

3695
02:09:17,570 --> 02:09:18,560
it's the antidote.

3696
02:09:19,030 --> 02:09:20,630
It's the justification.

3697
02:09:21,560 --> 02:09:22,910
It's not a distraction.

3698
02:09:23,330 --> 02:09:26,930
It can't be a distraction because
if it's a distraction and it just,

3699
02:09:27,200 --> 02:09:28,033
it won't work.

3700
02:09:28,190 --> 02:09:28,580
You know,

3701
02:09:28,580 --> 02:09:31,130
generally people distract
themselves with trivialities,

3702
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:31,951
you know,

3703
02:09:31,951 --> 02:09:32,200
with,

3704
02:09:32,200 --> 02:09:32,740
with,

3705
02:09:32,740 --> 02:09:33,350
with cheap,

3706
02:09:33,350 --> 02:09:34,940
impulsive entertainment.

3707
02:09:35,180 --> 02:09:37,430
And I don't have anything
against even cheap,

3708
02:09:37,431 --> 02:09:38,990
impulsive entertainment for that matter.

3709
02:09:39,050 --> 02:09:41,190
But it's not,

3710
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:43,460
it's not something that you do well.

3711
02:09:43,461 --> 02:09:46,640
You're busily suffering
yourself into extinction.

3712
02:09:46,770 --> 02:09:49,510
It's like I do believe that I,

3713
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:51,590
and I believe that
there's evidence for this,

3714
02:09:51,591 --> 02:09:56,170
that that instinct of meaning is the
deepest instinct that you have and it

3715
02:09:56,180 --> 02:09:58,700
actually does orient
you to the proper place.

3716
02:09:58,790 --> 02:09:59,690
Whatever that means.

3717
02:10:00,160 --> 02:10:04,640
It means something biological
that means something political.

3718
02:10:04,641 --> 02:10:05,900
It means something economic.

3719
02:10:05,901 --> 02:10:09,920
But I think it means something universal
as well because I do think that

3720
02:10:09,921 --> 02:10:12,330
consciousness plays a
central role in being.

3721
02:10:12,950 --> 02:10:16,310
And so if you orient yourself
towards what's meaningful,

3722
02:10:16,311 --> 02:10:19,820
then you participate in all
those levels at the same time.

3723
02:10:20,360 --> 02:10:22,580
I don't know what the ultimate
significance of that is,

3724
02:10:22,581 --> 02:10:26,450
but I suppose it's the same as the
ultimate significance of reality itself.

3725
02:10:27,290 --> 02:10:29,510
But there's something profound too.

3726
02:10:29,990 --> 02:10:31,670
It's not just a distraction by any.

3727
02:10:32,020 --> 02:10:33,800
Like I don't think we're away.

3728
02:10:33,801 --> 02:10:35,030
We'll Rome burns.

3729
02:10:35,480 --> 02:10:39,560
I don't think you find
pleasant occupations to
preoccupy yourself while you,

3730
02:10:39,800 --> 02:10:41,360
while you trudge towards death.

3731
02:10:41,870 --> 02:10:42,703
You know,

3732
02:10:42,740 --> 02:10:43,580
it's not like that.

3733
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:44,713
It's

3734
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:48,920
the orientation towards meeting
is a fundamental reality.

3735
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:53,330
You're neurologically
wired and so it's real.

3736
02:10:53,930 --> 02:10:55,640
Now what that means ultimately,

3737
02:10:55,700 --> 02:10:56,241
I don't know.

3738
02:10:56,241 --> 02:10:59,720
But one thing I do know that it
means is that it means less hell.

3739
02:11:00,710 --> 02:11:01,880
And that's something,

3740
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:02,330
right.

3741
02:11:02,330 --> 02:11:06,080
Really that's something so we could
start with that and see where it goes.

3742
02:11:06,730 --> 02:11:07,563
Yeah,

3743
02:11:10,930 --> 02:11:11,300
sure.

3744
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:12,111
If you stand up to it,

3745
02:11:12,111 --> 02:11:12,944
everybody can hear you,

3746
02:11:12,950 --> 02:11:13,783
right?

3747
02:11:14,340 --> 02:11:15,173
Yeah.

3748
02:11:18,930 --> 02:11:20,470
I'm going to want to university CME.

3749
02:11:20,810 --> 02:11:22,050
And your lack of it.

3750
02:11:22,060 --> 02:11:25,790
Part of the reason why I decided to
make my intended major neuroscience.

3751
02:11:25,870 --> 02:11:26,180
Yup.

3752
02:11:26,180 --> 02:11:27,070
Kind of in if it's under,

3753
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:27,480
I was like,

3754
02:11:27,480 --> 02:11:27,880
yeah.

3755
02:11:27,880 --> 02:11:32,600
And I was just wondering in terms of what
the Canyon and psychologically works,

3756
02:11:32,660 --> 02:11:33,620
you know Floyd Young,

3757
02:11:34,550 --> 02:11:37,960
does it matter which order you read
the books in or finish kind of getting

3758
02:11:38,240 --> 02:11:40,100
started with Rogers Rogers.

3759
02:11:41,870 --> 02:11:42,703
Yeah.

3760
02:11:42,980 --> 02:11:45,930
Rogers is a very useful thing practically.

3761
02:11:46,260 --> 02:11:47,390
So that's Carl Rogers,

3762
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:48,290
the psychotherapist.

3763
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:50,030
I'd recommend his writings.

3764
02:11:50,270 --> 02:11:52,010
He wrote a book called the way of being,

3765
02:11:52,310 --> 02:11:53,750
which is a really great book.

3766
02:11:54,100 --> 02:11:58,170
Gary Rogers was a very practical
person and I think a good person,

3767
02:11:58,690 --> 02:11:59,730
but it's,

3768
02:12:00,170 --> 02:12:01,370
it's very clear.

3769
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:02,713
Um,

3770
02:12:03,890 --> 02:12:05,750
Freud is harder and Yeoman.

3771
02:12:05,780 --> 02:12:06,613
Is it possible?

3772
02:12:09,700 --> 02:12:10,700
Very terrible.

3773
02:12:12,020 --> 02:12:12,853
Oh yeah.

3774
02:12:13,010 --> 02:12:14,120
You don't want to start with that.

3775
02:12:15,530 --> 02:12:16,070
Yeah,

3776
02:12:16,070 --> 02:12:16,270
no,

3777
02:12:16,270 --> 02:12:16,470
no,

3778
02:12:16,470 --> 02:12:17,290
no.

3779
02:12:17,290 --> 02:12:18,123
That's advanced.

3780
02:12:18,200 --> 02:12:18,770
This.

3781
02:12:18,770 --> 02:12:20,630
That's partly why he didn't publish it.

3782
02:12:21,000 --> 02:12:21,833
He didn't publish.

3783
02:12:22,790 --> 02:12:24,210
So here's a reading list on my,

3784
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:25,133
on my website.

3785
02:12:25,320 --> 02:12:25,610
Okay.

3786
02:12:25,610 --> 02:12:26,241
The best thing,

3787
02:12:26,241 --> 02:12:29,240
if you're interested in cycle
in psychological theory,

3788
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:30,260
I think the best book,

3789
02:12:30,830 --> 02:12:32,810
likely especially psychoanalytic theory,

3790
02:12:32,811 --> 02:12:35,390
is a book called the
discovery of the unconscious.

3791
02:12:35,960 --> 02:12:39,100
And then we'll give you an introduction
to Freud and Jung and Adler and also did

3792
02:12:39,101 --> 02:12:40,440
the history of psychoanalytic thought.

3793
02:12:40,640 --> 02:12:41,680
It's a brilliant book.

3794
02:12:41,940 --> 02:12:44,690
It's really quite any gross Greek as well.

3795
02:12:44,691 --> 02:12:46,280
So that's a really good place to start.

3796
02:12:46,610 --> 02:12:47,443
We have time for,

3797
02:12:47,870 --> 02:12:48,441
thank you very much.

3798
02:12:48,441 --> 02:12:49,274
We have time for one.

3799
02:12:49,280 --> 02:12:50,330
One last question.

3800
02:12:50,420 --> 02:12:51,040
Okay.

3801
02:12:51,040 --> 02:12:51,750
I'm your girl.

3802
02:12:51,750 --> 02:12:52,470
Okay.

3803
02:12:52,470 --> 02:12:53,120
Okay.

3804
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:54,050
Who's the girl who's there?

3805
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:55,333
All right.

3806
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:57,030
You said recently that uh,

3807
02:12:57,750 --> 02:13:00,450
you'll never grow up and tell
you how your own children,

3808
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:01,433
yeah.

3809
02:13:01,560 --> 02:13:06,560
Coming from a woman who doesn't have any
children but is trying to sort herself

3810
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:11,370
out and has mental
issues in their history,

3811
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:12,420
is it,

3812
02:13:12,420 --> 02:13:16,620
is it more important to sort yourself out
and do the best you can and try to get

3813
02:13:16,621 --> 02:13:17,940
to adulthood in that way?

3814
02:13:18,150 --> 02:13:20,430
Or is it really necessary to have kids?

3815
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:22,430
You know,

3816
02:13:22,430 --> 02:13:24,980
this is something Carl Young
said about psychotherapy.

3817
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:30,020
He said that it can be replaced by a
supreme moral effort because young like

3818
02:13:30,021 --> 02:13:35,021
most of the great knew that a lot of
what d ranges people in their life is

3819
02:13:35,460 --> 02:13:36,293
falsehood.

3820
02:13:36,360 --> 02:13:36,601
You know,

3821
02:13:36,601 --> 02:13:41,601
Freud talked about repression and Alfred
Adler talked about the lifeline and

3822
02:13:41,850 --> 02:13:43,050
Carl Rogers talked about,

3823
02:13:43,051 --> 02:13:43,410
you know,

3824
02:13:43,410 --> 02:13:46,230
anticipate and sort of the
existential psychotherapist,

3825
02:13:46,231 --> 02:13:46,830
they all,

3826
02:13:46,830 --> 02:13:50,760
they all had their finger on the idea
that just straighten yourself out as a

3827
02:13:50,761 --> 02:13:51,594
moral effort.

3828
02:13:52,020 --> 02:13:57,020
The thing about having kids that's telling
is that if you have a child then it's

3829
02:13:59,131 --> 02:14:03,930
almost inevitable that you will then
come to regard someone else as more

3830
02:14:03,931 --> 02:14:04,890
important than you.

3831
02:14:05,760 --> 02:14:07,980
And like I think you can do that.

3832
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:08,940
Other ones,

3833
02:14:08,940 --> 02:14:10,260
there's other routes to that,

3834
02:14:10,590 --> 02:14:11,610
but they're hard.

3835
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:12,540
I mean,

3836
02:14:12,540 --> 02:14:14,090
because the reason to,

3837
02:14:14,091 --> 02:14:18,270
anything that's a bigger commitment are
there very few things that are a bigger

3838
02:14:18,271 --> 02:14:20,250
commitment than having a child.

3839
02:14:20,820 --> 02:14:22,160
And so it forces,

3840
02:14:22,170 --> 02:14:26,280
it catalyzes a change in you that
you're entirely prepared for it.

3841
02:14:26,670 --> 02:14:30,780
And I think there are ways of doing
that for people who don't have children,

3842
02:14:31,450 --> 02:14:32,180
but,

3843
02:14:32,180 --> 02:14:33,013
but it's,

3844
02:14:33,480 --> 02:14:34,710
it's tar.

3845
02:14:34,920 --> 02:14:35,531
That's right.

3846
02:14:35,531 --> 02:14:35,660
It,

3847
02:14:35,660 --> 02:14:36,000
it,

3848
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:37,650
it requires the same sort of effort.

3849
02:14:37,680 --> 02:14:39,840
I wouldn't say that
having a child requires,

3850
02:14:39,841 --> 02:14:42,900
which is a lot of effort to do so,

3851
02:14:43,560 --> 02:14:45,840
but I'm going to make
statements like that.

3852
02:14:45,841 --> 02:14:46,674
They have to be,

3853
02:14:47,430 --> 02:14:47,641
you know,

3854
02:14:47,641 --> 02:14:48,360
they're,

3855
02:14:48,360 --> 02:14:49,193
they're,

3856
02:14:49,710 --> 02:14:50,280
what are they?

3857
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:52,100
They're crunchy and generalized.

3858
02:14:52,620 --> 02:14:56,160
And it's not to say that there are no
people who are mature that don't have

3859
02:14:56,161 --> 02:14:56,994
children,

3860
02:14:57,090 --> 02:15:01,020
but this fastest and most certain way
to maturity for people is to have a

3861
02:15:01,021 --> 02:15:01,710
chocolate.

3862
02:15:01,710 --> 02:15:04,590
That also doesn't mean that everyone
who has a child becomes mature.

3863
02:15:05,080 --> 02:15:07,650
So because they don't generally,

3864
02:15:07,651 --> 02:15:09,990
they at least become more
mature than they were,

3865
02:15:10,050 --> 02:15:10,883
which is something

3866
02:15:13,140 --> 02:15:15,430
we have to abandon theater.

3867
02:15:16,200 --> 02:15:21,200
[inaudible].
