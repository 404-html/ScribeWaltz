1
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:15,970
You're trying to match matches your
weaknesses.

2
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,980
The Parker,
pretty much everybody knows what those

3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,510
weaknesses are.
You know,

4
00:00:20,511 --> 00:00:23,740
some people would smoke too much,
too much,

5
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:28,290
and some people would be unfaithful and
have a comfort productive areas.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,720
Some people would end up on the street
because they would generate.

7
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,830
Everybody kind of knows how they fall
apart if they fell apart in their own

8
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,940
idiosyncratic and spectacular manner.
Those sorts of things that keep you

9
00:00:43,941 --> 00:00:45,060
awake at night.
If you.

10
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:50,350
If you contemplate them deeply,
where would you be interested?

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:53,270
Five years.
If you let her go directly to hell,

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,480
that's useful.
That's useful because then see it's one

13
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:02,230
thing that want to make yourself because
you see them.

14
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,760
What you're doing is moving.
You have something that you want,

15
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,080
but that's whole hope is a powerful
emotion,

16
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,800
but terror acts and so one of the things
out with my clinical clients,

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,550
it's their baby.

18
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,830
They don't have a job.
They really like,

19
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,730
you know,
and it's grinding away at your soul and

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,140
just leave your job into another job.
That's actually a really complicated

21
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:30,651
problem,
right?

22
00:01:30,651 --> 00:01:33,680
If you don't like your job,
it's not just a psychological problem,

23
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,530
have to have a job,
otherwise you die.

24
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,650
So it's a cycle.
And so just changing the battery,

25
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,670
just adjusting yourself psychologically.
You might be planning to change your

26
00:01:46,671 --> 00:01:48,660
job,
you have to update your CV and maybe you

27
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:52,430
have to make your skills and we've gotta
figure out how to be a little more

28
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,090
credit,
Melinda,

29
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,880
an interview and you have to overcome
your fear of rejection.

30
00:01:55,881 --> 00:01:59,390
Like there may be all sorts of things
that African set yourself up to move

31
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:04,391
laterally or let's say to a different
position when it's more engaging and uh,

32
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,170
you know,
you might be,

33
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,460
you might be willing to do that.

34
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:15,650
Um,
and so you were afraid of doing now

35
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:24,401
and you think,
well,

36
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:26,380
if I'm afraid of it,
why should I do it?

37
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,550
People ask themselves the same question
like I have a difficult conversation to

38
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:33,550
have with their wives or their children
or their parents,

39
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,770
you know,
because a lot of us are very conflict

40
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:39,150
diverse and there are difficult
conversations to have.

41
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,390
And the reason is is because they're
awkward and make us afraid.

42
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,710
So you might think,
well,

43
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,470
why the hell is it makes you afraid?
Why not just not,

44
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,400
which is one of the ideas that keeps
people in jobs they hate and in

45
00:02:53,471 --> 00:02:56,910
relationships with and,
and it stops them from repairing or

46
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,230
relationships with some very difficult
thing to do.

47
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,960
And the answer is,
well,

48
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,900
let's imagine that you just keep doing
the thing that you don't like,

49
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:09,510
that you don't change it because you're
afraid to,

50
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,460
well,
are you afraid of what happens if you

51
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:13,294
don't change it?

52
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:19,000
And if you lay out this little hail,
but I described it really in a one way

53
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:22,660
so you know where you would degenerate
if you were going to degenerate.

54
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,930
And then you look at life and say,
well here's a bunch of things that are

55
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,830
not doing because I'm afraid that's,
you know,

56
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,250
keeping me secure.
It's like,

57
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,113
no,
it's not.

58
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,790
It's just taking you to that place that
you lay down.

59
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:38,200
It's an absolute catastrophe.
And so sometimes the answer to why

60
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:42,850
should I do this thing that I've been
putting off is well,

61
00:03:42,851 --> 00:03:45,100
otherwise they end up in this particular
hell.

62
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:49,150
I already know.
I already know the parameters of and so

63
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,140
hope can help you move out of that.
It would be better if I did this,

64
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:57,520
but fear of not doing it and the
consequences.

65
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,250
That's where you've been and what's
better yet is to have both of them

66
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:03,250
working in tandem,
so psychologists figured this out when

67
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,490
they were looking at sphere years ago
because I'm trying to figure out how to

68
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:11,491
motivate them to do things like run down
a major update and reward.

69
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,020
Turns out that a hungry,
hungry,

70
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:17,160
rapid run down.
A little bays quite rapidly get a

71
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,350
cheesy,
but if that brand is,

72
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,980
if you.
If you have the hungry wrap and you walk

73
00:04:23,981 --> 00:04:28,981
in some capital,
expats are terrified of cats and even if

74
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:31,360
they've never met a capital,
just a different smell.

75
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:34,010
The cash,
they know what cat smell like and like.

76
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,960
And so if you take your hungry,
grab and throw in a little caterpillar,

77
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,170
he'll sit down that runway like nap much
faster than one that's just hungry.

78
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,420
So running away from something that
you're terrified out.

79
00:04:47,421 --> 00:04:51,220
We're avoiding something that your
property terrified though and running

80
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:54,550
towards something you want is a good way
of being maximally motivate people and

81
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,840
so with the second part of that program
we have people,

82
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,841
they don't have very detailed plan about
their position in the briefing.

83
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,650
If April's prior quiz tools and figure
why would you be better if he would take

84
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,800
the first goal was how would your
families be better?

85
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,700
Also with maybe how it would be a
benefit to the community if you would

86
00:05:18,701 --> 00:05:22,570
take that book because it'd be nice if
you could sort yourself out in ways that

87
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:26,950
also sorted out your family and then
also sort of your community and since

88
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:29,170
you're making a plan,
but where the hell no name for all

89
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:31,520
three.
It's more sustainable anyways.

90
00:05:31,521 --> 00:05:36,220
Right.
So this broke the famous psychologist

91
00:05:36,221 --> 00:05:37,210
show,
Piaget hold,

92
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:40,690
that included a braided state.
He said that it's like a game that

93
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:43,300
everyone wants to play with.
It's better if you're going to play a

94
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:47,320
game to play a game that everyone wants
to play and that's a good.

95
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,180
That's a good indication that it's a
good game.

96
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:52,080
And so if you could figure out how to
fix yourself off in a way that would

97
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,040
simple phineas,
they fix up your family and your

98
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,130
community.
It's like,

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,720
hey,
everybody wins and maybe it would be

100
00:06:01,011 --> 00:06:02,840
good to play a game that everybody wins.

101
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:08,470
So we don't think of games that often,
but it's certainly possible in 25 exists

102
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:15,260
and so well back to courage and that
free speech.

103
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:18,980
One of the things that I do recommend
that people who try these programs is

104
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:23,981
that they do the map because if that
plan has been that the no plan at all

105
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,030
and you're going to come up with a
better plan because what they have and

106
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,790
you know,
and so it's either a bad plan or no plan

107
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,910
and no Glenn is way worse than a bad.
At least when you implemented that plan

108
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:39,710
and you start walking towards what the
plan lays out,

109
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:44,110
you'll see specifically where it is that
you're an error like specifically.

110
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,130
And you'll learn from that.
And then you can use what you learn

111
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,060
while you're making the mistakes.
Implementing your plan to make a better

112
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,760
plan.
And if you keep doing that eventually,

113
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,220
like there'll be a lot of failure along
the way.

114
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,690
That's the adventure of your life,
by the way.

115
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:04,030
If you do that and you keep laying on
plant and learning painfully from your

116
00:07:04,031 --> 00:07:09,031
failures and then correcting the planet,
what'll happen is that you get on target

117
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,170
as you move through life,
and even though you're hitting a moving

118
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:15,700
target,
because life is complicated.
