00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,990
A Washington Post article,

2
00:00:07,991 --> 00:00:09,850
November,

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,850
2016 and it said out of the
700 counties in Pennsylvania,

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:17,640
Ohio,

5
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:18,783
um,

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,090
Wisconsin that voted for Obama twice,

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:24,910
predominantly white counties,

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:29,080
a third of them flipped and
voted for president Trump.

9
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:34,290
So the racism argument just doesn't
wash because if you vote in a black man

10
00:00:34,331 --> 00:00:36,160
twice for president,

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,090
uh,

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:37,990
especially in Ohio,

13
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,150
I think where there was
37 counties that voted,

14
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:40,900
uh,

15
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:41,860
predominantly white,

16
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,330
predominantly white,

17
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,880
that voted President Obama in twice.

18
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:48,010
And then they flipped and turned to Ohio.

19
00:00:48,011 --> 00:00:51,280
And I've been raising the red
flag on this for a long time.

20
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:54,970
I've been saying to people that I really
believe that president Trump's victory,

21
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:56,500
he's ill equipped to be president.

22
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:57,300
We all know that.

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,300
He has no clue what he's doing was an
absolute a signal that the regressive

24
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:05,811
left.

25
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:10,540
This had driven people crazy and insane
and they were frustrated and fed up,

26
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,740
um,

27
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,970
for being called bigoted.

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,390
They were sick of being
talked down to and then

29
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,270
still being talked down to like the,

30
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,050
the classic response of
the mainstream media to,

31
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,670
to the existence of Trump is to basically
assume 50% of the American electorate

32
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,420
are stupid racist bigots.

33
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,300
Like Hillary called them deplorables.

34
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,830
The basket of deplorables.

35
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,490
Yeah.

36
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,450
But you know what,

37
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:38,660
I've been actually kind of looking at
what the grievances are and what the

38
00:01:38,661 --> 00:01:42,030
concerns are and do you sound like
really decent people to me would,

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,080
they're asking real questions
about unvetted immigration,

40
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,510
large amounts of
immigration to the country,

41
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,220
border security,

42
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,090
uh,

43
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:51,740
millions of illegal immigrants.

44
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:56,510
They're asking very real questions
that would concern anybody and for that

45
00:01:56,511 --> 00:01:58,550
they're being labeled bigoted and racist.

46
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,430
Yeah,

47
00:01:59,430 --> 00:01:59,710
yeah.

48
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:00,580
Well it is in it.

49
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,030
That's the sort of thing that's driving
this dangerous polarization and it's,

50
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,923
it's really,

51
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,520
it's really unfortunate.

52
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:07,863
Yeah.

53
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,590
And my concern is,

54
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:14,591
and my concern ever since Trump has been
elected is that we're going to create a

55
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,980
toxic environment in Canada because from
the universities and colleges we can

56
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:23,540
already see it's there that we are
going to drive people in Canada to very

57
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,310
radical fringe positions.

58
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,570
And that's my worry.

59
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:26,951
Well,

60
00:02:26,951 --> 00:02:30,340
if we elect wouldn't again then we'll
certainly be well on the road to doing

61
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:30,551
that.

62
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:34,270
And I also think that the
Trudeau government is far
to the left of where people

63
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:35,740
originally assumed it would be.

64
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:36,551
I mean,

65
00:02:36,551 --> 00:02:41,551
I think that his decision to put 50%
women in the cabinet was an abdication of

66
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:44,260
responsibility on the magnitude that,

67
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,560
that we haven't seen before
in Canadian political history.

68
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,770
Only 26% of the of the MPs elected
were female and that should have been

69
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:55,330
approximately the proportion
of cabinet members.

70
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:59,110
But to say this is 2015 or
whatever the hell the year.

71
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:03,670
And then to abdicate his responsibility
for selecting the most competent people

72
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,000
was an an indication of exactly how,

73
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:07,750
uh,

74
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:12,460
what would you say how suited he is to
be prime minister and people just didn't

75
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:16,090
make much of an issue of that because
of their attempts to be tolerant.

76
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:17,960
But I think that what he did was re,

77
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:18,461
oh,

78
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:22,540
I thought the fact that he ran to begin
with was reprehensible because he ran

79
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:27,010
entirely on the name brand recognition
that he had derived from his father.

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,760
And I think that that's the mark
of someone who's narcissistic.

81
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,430
You shouldn't have done that

82
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,860
for him.

83
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,540
Very charismatic and attractive,

84
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,130
and he knows how to behave in public.

85
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,140
And so Andy had a very,

86
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:42,850
very famous name and,

87
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,650
but I believe that it was immoral
of him to run because the,

88
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,090
we're not dynasties,

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,770
democracies aren't dynasties,

90
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:52,540
and he hadn't the,

91
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:53,973
um,

92
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,271
the CV,

93
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:55,900
the,

94
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,370
the record of success that you would
need as an independent individual to

95
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,400
justify himself as a qualified
candidate for prime minister.

96
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:09,190
So I thought that is his candidacy right
from the start was ethically flawed

97
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,533
then to,

98
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:14,800
to multiply that error with these,

99
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,903
these,

100
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,103
these,

101
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:17,740
uh,

102
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,860
shallow attempts at
broadcasting tolerance,

103
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:25,750
especially at the expense of competence
and the capacity to truly evaluate is

104
00:04:25,751 --> 00:04:28,300
just inexcusable.

105
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,380
Inexcusable.
