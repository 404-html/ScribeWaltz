1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,360
Amy pellegrini says,

2
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,450
why is self sabotage such a
huge feature of human life?

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,463
You know what,

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,750
I have a chapter about
that in my new book too.

5
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,283
Um,

6
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,750
which chapter is it now?

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:21,813
I think it's it.

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,330
I can't always match the
content with the chapter title.

9
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,583
Oddly enough.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,810
I think it's the chapter about
picking friends that are good for you.

11
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:37,741
See,

12
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:38,221
Oh yes,

13
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,120
I have it right here.

14
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,390
And I didn't set that up by the way.

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,170
I genuinely did remember,

16
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,760
make friends with the people

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,740
who wants the best for you.

18
00:00:47,741 --> 00:00:48,251
Was that it?

19
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:48,491
No.

20
00:00:48,491 --> 00:00:51,310
Treat yourself like someone you
are responsible for helping.

21
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,443
There we go.

22
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,663
MMM.

23
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,280
Why are self sabotage such a feature?

24
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:58,731
Okay,

25
00:00:58,731 --> 00:00:59,720
here's a couple of reasons.

26
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:00,261
The first is,

27
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:04,430
is that there's a lot of
responsibility with success,

28
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,293
right?

29
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,070
So if you,

30
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:09,023
okay,

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,330
if you say yes to things and you do a
good job and you bear a large burden,

32
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:14,260
then you have to carry it.

33
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:15,940
And a lot of that might be success.

34
00:01:15,941 --> 00:01:17,050
But you know,

35
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,300
failure is a lot easier than success.

36
00:01:19,301 --> 00:01:23,560
Plus you can complain about it and whine
about it and be a victim and garner all

37
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:26,440
sorts of Kudos from yourself
and others that way.

38
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,730
So there's that.

39
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,670
It's just failure to adopt responsibility.

40
00:01:30,671 --> 00:01:31,570
But then I would say too,

41
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:34,720
there's also revenge
on on the self and God,

42
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,910
that's partly why I liked the
Cain and Abel story so much.

43
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:38,500
Once I sort of figured out what it meant.

44
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,803
Um,

45
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,310
people have a hard time not having the
kind of contempt that borders on self

46
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,020
hatred for the cells,

47
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,340
partly because you know,

48
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:57,341
we are fragile and mortal creatures and
prone to error and malevolence and we

49
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:00,250
know that of ourselves
better than anyone else.

50
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:02,190
Okay.

51
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,730
Because we know that we're
prone to punish ourselves and,

52
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,540
and to think ill of ourselves.

53
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:07,310
And,

54
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:07,680
you know,

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,240
one of the things I learned from young
was that the injunction to do unto your

56
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:16,740
neighbor as you would have him do
unto you was an equation rather than,

57
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,790
um,

58
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,660
a statement about how to be nice to
people and that you have an ethical

59
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:24,030
obligation to treat
yourself as if you're some,

60
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,500
a person of value.

61
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,110
Even if you don't really feel that,

62
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:29,720
that you owe yourself the,

63
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,230
that you owe yourself the same treatment
that you would give someone that you

64
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,280
cared for in love.

65
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,080
Now it's a really hard thing to learn,

66
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:37,651
you know,

67
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:40,980
cause you kind of have to detach
yourself from your knowledge of all your

68
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:45,750
insufficiencies and your flaws and
treat yourself with dignity and respect.

69
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,670
At least the dignity and respect.

70
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,780
Do someone who's faulty that
could conceivably learn.

71
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,780
And that's a very difficult
ethical lesson to learn.

72
00:02:54,781 --> 00:02:55,021
It's,

73
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:57,600
it's easier to beat yourself
continually on the hip,

74
00:02:57,601 --> 00:03:02,601
back of the head with a club and to feel
it's justified given how much you know

75
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,780
about how wretched and useless you are.

76
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:05,883
So,

77
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,320
so let's say there's two reasons.

78
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,553
Um,

79
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:12,850
one is that you don't
want the responsibility.

80
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,530
So it's not really self sabotage,

81
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:17,410
it's just avoidance of responsibility
and consequent failure.

82
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:18,280
And the second is

83
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:20,861
punishment,

84
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:21,850
self punishment.

85
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:25,450
That seems only just given what you
know about all your pathology and,

86
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,430
and an error and,

87
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,620
and insufficiencies.

88
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,430
So I would say that
that's the big two there.
