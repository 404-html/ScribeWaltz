1
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:07,460
So you might say,
well,

2
00:00:07,461 --> 00:00:10,430
what happens when you,
when you feel one way and you say

3
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:12,550
something else,
I mean you're all in,

4
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,820
you're all perfectly,

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:18,510
it's the middle year with that
experience.

6
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:21,780
In fact,
my experience with people has been that,

7
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:25,350
and this is another issue with
instrumental use of language.

8
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:25,891
You know,
you say,

9
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,480
well what are you using your language
for?

10
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,910
Well,
have to get what you want,

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,210
but that can be consciously manipulated.
Then maybe we'll say,

12
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,120
well that's what the psychopath is like
except the psychopath is not only

13
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:39,390
consciously manipulative,
he's also unconsciously manipulative

14
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,940
because he's been practicing it for like
three decades.

15
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,180
So all the little machines in his head
or deceptive too,

16
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:48,900
and they run on automatic.
So he'll just lie just to see if he can

17
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:52,590
pull one over on you because that
demonstrates that not only is he smarter

18
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:54,510
than you,
but that you deserve to be victimized

19
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:56,550
because you're such an idiot.
So,

20
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,210
but people use instrumental language
like that.

21
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:02,190
Not only consciously to get what they
want,

22
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,010
but you know,
it's something that we definitely think

23
00:01:05,011 --> 00:01:07,410
of is characteristic for example of
teenagers.

24
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,850
Right?
I mean,

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,240
there isn't a teen movie that's be made
in the last 50 years.

26
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:15,030
I don't think.
It doesn't deal with the negative

27
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:17,250
consequences of using instrumental
language.

28
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:19,650
Right.
Basically the team has put in some

29
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:24,420
position where they're being pulled,
pulled by maybe various social forces,

30
00:01:24,421 --> 00:01:26,660
different friendship groups or,
or there's a,

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,030
um,
but there was a

32
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,850
contradictory relationship between what
their friends want and their parents

33
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:38,000
want or what their friends want and
there's school wants or what they want

34
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:40,040
and their friends want or what the
school wants.

35
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,090
So all of these things are pulling and
pushing in different directions and the

36
00:01:44,091 --> 00:01:47,390
directions are essentially in some,
in some sense the directions or moral

37
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:50,260
because they're all about what to do.
And the,

38
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,180
the plot of the movie is how the
teenager,

39
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,720
it's usually a Rogerian plot.
It's usually about how the teenager

40
00:01:56,721 --> 00:02:00,500
comes to more to fuller self
realization.

41
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,570
Right.
And that they're able to,

42
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:07,900
that they're able to stave off the,
the temptations that are posed sometimes

43
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:11,990
by the authorities,
so they don't become too obedient and

44
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:16,991
sometimes by their peers so that they
don't become only a reflection of peer

45
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:17,710
pressure.

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:19,680
Question.
I was just going to say,

47
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,690
wouldn't care.
Absolutely.

48
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,910
Peer pressure,
peer peer pressure is absolutely that.

49
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:32,690
And so if you're using language to fit
in,

50
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:36,290
well that's also instrumental use of
language and for,

51
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,570
and for Rogers,
that would be one of the sources of

52
00:02:38,571 --> 00:02:39,740
pathology.
Now

53
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,990
it's very much worth taking this
seriously.

54
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,093
So

55
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,090
here's an example that I thought about a
lot.

56
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,180
What do you do if you're at work and
someone tells you to do something that

57
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:57,000
you don't want to do?
And I don't mean that,

58
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,440
forget,
assume you're disciplined,

59
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,930
you know,
assume that you're not just lazy and

60
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,610
worthless.
And that's why you don't want to do it.

61
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:05,650
And you want to ask yourself that first,
right?

62
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:09,760
Because maybe you're just being lazy and
worthless and you should pull yourself

63
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,860
together and do the thing you know.
So,

64
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:14,650
but failing that,
let's say that you're being asked to do

65
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:19,510
something that you're finding,
you're having a very difficult time to

66
00:03:19,511 --> 00:03:22,720
get motivated to do.
So that'd be one clue.

67
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:27,220
And that it's also making you uneasy.
So you're waking up in the middle of the

68
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,260
night and you're being anxious and it's
running through your mind.

69
00:03:29,261 --> 00:03:32,080
And
what should you do?

70
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,690
Well,
it's your job.

71
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,130
Someone who is in the hierarchy above
you is telling you to do it.

72
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,330
Maybe you should just do it.
Well then you might ask yourself,

73
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,940
well,
why can't you just go ahead and do it?

74
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:50,841
You know,
you might say,

75
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:52,460
well,
maybe it's because I criminal and you're

76
00:03:52,461 --> 00:03:54,650
afraid of getting caught,
but let's forget about that for a

77
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,350
minute.
Let's assume that the probability,

78
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,140
maybe it's a low level moral
transgression,

79
00:04:00,141 --> 00:04:03,470
it's not precisely illegal.
And even so the probability that you're

80
00:04:03,471 --> 00:04:08,471
going to get caught is very low.
Why would it bother you and should you

81
00:04:09,021 --> 00:04:14,021
take that seriously?
Now Rogers would claim that the reason

82
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:20,141
it would bother you is because it would
make the structure of yourself system

83
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,700
inconsistent.

84
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,353
So

85
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,880
imagine you're trying to organize a
group of people to do some tasks.

86
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,640
You know,
like maybe they were in a row and you

87
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:35,850
have to fill it in a hole in the road.
And so you have to put people in a row

88
00:04:35,851 --> 00:04:38,250
and you've,
you handed rocks down the line.

89
00:04:38,251 --> 00:04:40,050
You know,
if you got one person in there who is

90
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,860
trying to put rocks,
make the rocks go the other way or

91
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:47,640
dropping them or something like that,
well then obviously the entire structure

92
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:50,720
is not going to function properly.
And it's because there's an internally

93
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:54,780
to consistency in 10 you know,
it's a fundamental presupposition of,

94
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,430
of,
of logic.

95
00:04:56,431 --> 00:05:01,260
It's maybe the most fundamental
principle of communication that a thing

96
00:05:01,261 --> 00:05:04,470
can't be itself and something else at
the same time.

97
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,420
That's the principle of
noncontradiction.

98
00:05:06,421 --> 00:05:10,080
Right.
And so the hypothesis here would be that

99
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:14,310
you have to follow the principle of
noncontradiction with regards to the

100
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:16,620
organization of your own self.

101
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,620
The self would be,
Roger's thinks about that as an are a

102
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:25,230
differentiated field,
subfield of the phenomenal field.

103
00:05:25,231 --> 00:05:27,690
Right?
So you're always experiencing things and

104
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:32,280
part of what you've experienced is that
you at the center of that and that's the

105
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:37,281
self as far as Roger's is concerned.
And the proposition would be you have to

106
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,950
organize the self in a non contradictory
manner or well or what well or you feel

107
00:05:45,661 --> 00:05:48,990
negative emotion.
Now he would think about that as anxiety

108
00:05:48,991 --> 00:05:52,840
general.
Yes we can start the narrative around,

109
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,890
well that might work.
You know,

110
00:06:00,891 --> 00:06:05,810
I mean that's a very good and
complicated question because what you're

111
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,840
asking is,
well why,

112
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,760
why can't you rationalize effectively?
That's really,

113
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,463
well

114
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:22,510
that's a postmodern theory I would say
in some sense because the postmodern

115
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,250
like to claim that there's nothing
outside of the text.

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,380
Right?
And then things in some sense are

117
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:32,240
infinitely malleable and that the
malleability comes as a consequence of

118
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:34,940
the different narratives that you like
might weave.

119
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:39,770
But Rogers would point out that,
well the first thing he pointed out is

120
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:41,790
that stupid,
which it is.

121
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:45,500
I mean there's all sorts of things that
are characteristics of your

122
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:49,190
characteristic,
of your experience that haven't gone.

123
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,680
Pets like phenomenology,
you know,

124
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:54,680
like I think it's very,
very difficult to claim that pain is,

125
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,900
is textual,
you know?

126
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,090
And we do know that you can,

127
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:04,690
you can manipulate the way an organism
feels pain quite extensively.

128
00:07:04,691 --> 00:07:05,680
So,
for example,

129
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,100
if you whack the dog on the nose with a
newspaper,

130
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:11,950
every time it goes to eat,
it will starve to death.

131
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:13,810
You can teach it not to eat very
rapidly.

132
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,170
And so what you're doing is you're
teaching the dog that hunger is

133
00:07:17,171 --> 00:07:21,340
punishing and then it transforms hunger
into anxiety and then it go heat.

134
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,420
So the reason I'm telling you that is
because even something as fundamental as

135
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:27,550
hunger,
which you might think about as a basic

136
00:07:27,551 --> 00:07:30,250
phenomenon,
can be modulated by learning,

137
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,340
but there are limits to that.
There evident limits to that.

138
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,740
Now,
I think the problem with weaving a

139
00:07:35,741 --> 00:07:39,760
narrative is that even if it's complex
and sophisticated,

140
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,930
and so you've convinced yourself,
that doesn't necessarily mean that the

141
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:48,760
actions and perceptions undertaken as a
consequence of that formulation are

142
00:07:48,761 --> 00:07:51,460
going to be commensurate with the rest
of your personality.

143
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,200
It's a big risk,
you know?

144
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:58,530
So and I think it is the risk that
people run when they tell themselves or

145
00:07:59,711 --> 00:08:01,570
act out at the false owed.
No,

146
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,750
because for Rogers,
you could also act out false hoods.

147
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,531
Right?
In fact,

148
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:07,780
the philosophers call that a
performative contradiction.

149
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,940
That's when you say one thing and do
another,

150
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,250
it's a form of lie,
but it's an embodied line.

151
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,320
Rogers was,
he was a very,

152
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,350
he was very cognizant of embodiment as
a,

153
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,300
as a central human feature.
So,

154
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,200
you know,
he was very concerned about the fact

155
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:27,430
that the representational structures had
to take into account the realities of

156
00:08:27,431 --> 00:08:30,550
the underlying biology and those.
So those would be felt states in a

157
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,640
sense.
So I think the Rogerian answers,

158
00:08:33,641 --> 00:08:37,660
you can't get away with it that easily.
What that'll do is it'll produce

159
00:08:37,661 --> 00:08:41,680
contradictions as you move forward.
And those contradictions will,

160
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:46,750
will unsettle you either in a minor way
or in a deep way.

161
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,320
Now,
as far as I can tell by Rogers,

162
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:55,321
never really formalized a theory about
why something is deep and why something

163
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,240
was shallow in terms of it's
misrepresentation.

164
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:05,270
But we've already talked about that.
If you think about the hierarchical

165
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:09,960
structure that I showed you many times,
the idea there is that higher level of

166
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,150
the abstraction that you mess around
with,

167
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:14,730
the more of your personality you
pathologize.

168
00:09:14,731 --> 00:09:17,330
And I,
I've been thinking this week too that,

169
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:18,980
that that hierarchy,
you know,

170
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,530
the one I showed you many times,
I believe I have any ways little eggs in

171
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,690
rows.
I think that's the structure of the

172
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,120
unconscious actually.
So,

173
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:31,200
and you miss about without at your peril
because you're programming your own

174
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:35,490
perceptions and your actions.
And so the Rogerian presupposition,

175
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:38,700
and this is why I'm talking about the
presuppositions that underlied is

176
00:09:38,701 --> 00:09:42,850
thinking because the Rogerian approach
is based on a deep presupposition,

177
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:47,160
which is that honest integration
matters.

178
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,290
Now you could say,
well,

179
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,090
perhaps not.
It's like,

180
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,800
well,
that's been the question that people

181
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,810
have been debating since the beginning
of time.

182
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:59,310
But my experience as a therapist,
just so you know,

183
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,590
I've never seen anyone get away with
anything.

184
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:06,630
I think every time you do something that
you know isn't right,

185
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,090
you're going to get wall up for it.
Sooner or later.

186
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,880
Now you may be,
may have blinded yourself so badly

187
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:16,710
because of your ms apprehensions and
deceptions that you can't see the causal

188
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:19,080
connection between what you did and the
punishment.

189
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,590
In fact,
sometimes it takes years of

190
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:27,591
psychotherapeutic investigation to,
to lay out the causal narrative,

191
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:30,680
you know?
But why,

192
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,840
why would anybody ever think they can
bend the structure of reality and get

193
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:34,800
away with it?
You know?

194
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,800
To me it's like,
you know those plastic rulers,

195
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,290
it's like you can hold one of those in
front of your nose and bend it forward

196
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,990
and that's fine.
But as soon as you let go,

197
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,480
it's going to hit you in the face.
And so,

198
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,830
you know,
then you're going to curse,

199
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:49,110
faced fake because you got hit in the
face,

200
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:50,820
but you've been the down ruler.
