1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:06,180
You and was a great believer in the dream
and I noted that dreams will tell you

2
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:07,380
things that you don't know.

3
00:00:07,381 --> 00:00:07,981
And then I thought,

4
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:08,071
well,

5
00:00:08,071 --> 00:00:09,240
how the hell can that be?

6
00:00:09,241 --> 00:00:14,040
How would that in the world can something
you think up tell you something you

7
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:14,851
don't know?

8
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:16,590
How does that make any sense?

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:17,910
First of all,

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,590
why don't you understand it?

11
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:22,290
Why does it have to come forth
in the form of the dream?

12
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,250
It's like you're not,

13
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,790
there's something going on inside
you that you don't control rights.

14
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,730
The dream happens to you just
like life happens to you.

15
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,950
I mean there is the odd
lucid dreamer who can,

16
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,210
you know,

17
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:35,190
apply a certain amount
of conscious control,

18
00:00:35,191 --> 00:00:36,270
but most of the time it's,

19
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:41,570
you're laying there asleep and this
crazy complicated world manifests itself

20
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:44,970
inside you and you don't
know how you could,

21
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,390
you can't do it when you're awake
and you don't know what it means.

22
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,020
It's like what the hell is going on?

23
00:00:50,021 --> 00:00:53,220
And that's one of the things that's so
damn frightening about the psychoanalysts

24
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:56,430
because you get this both
from Freud and young,

25
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,600
you really start to understand that
there are things inside you that are

26
00:01:00,601 --> 00:01:04,050
happening that control you
instead of the other way around.

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,311
You know,

28
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:04,470
he,

29
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:06,120
there's a bit of reciprocal control,

30
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:11,121
but there's manifestations of spirits so
to speak inside you that determine the

31
00:01:12,061 --> 00:01:15,720
manner in which you walk through
life and you don't control it.

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,920
And what does,

33
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,631
is it random?

34
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:18,841
You know,

35
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:22,950
there are people who have claimed the
dreams are mirror merely the consequence

36
00:01:22,951 --> 00:01:24,390
of random neuronal firing,

37
00:01:24,391 --> 00:01:28,200
which is a theory I think is absolutely
absurd because there's nothing random

38
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:29,250
about dreams.

39
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:29,941
You know,

40
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,451
there are very,

41
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:32,550
very structured and very,

42
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:36,600
very complex and they're not like
snow on a television screen or,

43
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:38,100
or static on a radio.

44
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,850
Like those things are complicated.

45
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:44,370
And then also I've seen so often that
people have very coherent dreams that have

46
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:45,930
a perfect narrative structure.

47
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,490
Now they're fully developed,

48
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,301
did some sense.

49
00:01:48,301 --> 00:01:49,700
And so that just as an ide,

50
00:01:49,701 --> 00:01:51,570
that theory just doesn't
go anywhere with me.

51
00:01:51,571 --> 00:01:53,820
I just can't see that as useful at all.

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,240
And so,

53
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,920
so I'm more likely to take
the phenomena seriously.

54
00:01:58,950 --> 00:01:59,251
Say,

55
00:01:59,251 --> 00:01:59,431
well,

56
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:01,470
there's something to dreams,

57
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,790
what you dream of the future.

58
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:06,330
And then you try to make it into a reality
that seems to be an important thing,

59
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:06,991
you know?

60
00:02:06,991 --> 00:02:10,230
Or maybe you dream up at nightmare and
try to make that into a reality because

61
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,041
people do that too.

62
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:12,510
If they're hell bent on revenge,

63
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:13,141
for example,

64
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:17,490
and full of hatred and resentment
mean that manifest itself in terrible

65
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:18,241
fantasies,

66
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:18,511
you know,

67
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,380
those are dreams,

68
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:20,790
then people go act them out.

69
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,590
These things are powerful,

70
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:22,880
you know?

71
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,620
And whole nations can get
caught up in collective dreams.

72
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,510
That's what happened to the Nazis.

73
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:31,080
That's what happened to Nazi Germany
in the 1930s and it was absolutely

74
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:31,950
remarkable,

75
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,761
amazing,

76
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:33,481
horrific,

77
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,100
destructive spectacle.

78
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:36,750
And the same thing happened
in the Soviet Union.

79
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,160
The same thing happened in China.

80
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,860
It's like we have to take
these things seriously,

81
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,580
you know,

82
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,290
and try to understand what's going on.
