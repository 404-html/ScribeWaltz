1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,150
One of the things that I've thought,

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,670
this is a bit of a tangent,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,520
but I'll move back to
the mortal afterwards.

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:10,200
See,

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,340
I really liked the psycho analyst and
I liked the idea that you have a psyche

6
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:18,270
that's inside of you and that that is
structured in partly consciously and in

7
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:19,770
part unconsciously.

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,370
There's something about that that's really
cool and I've learned a lot from the

9
00:00:23,371 --> 00:00:24,270
psychoanalyst,

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,201
but you know,

11
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:30,201
there is a funny consequence of thinking
the way they think and you do think the

12
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:30,931
way they think,

13
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,950
even if you don't know it.

14
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:35,520
Like we tend to think that a
lot of us has inside our head.

15
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:36,300
You know,

16
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,370
that's the psyche model basically.

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,760
But the more I've practiced
as a clinical psychologist,

18
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:42,241
the last,

19
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,220
I've actually been
convinced that that's true.

20
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,751
So I could say,

21
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:46,110
well,

22
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,570
let's say I want to know
about your personality.

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:49,471
We think,

24
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:49,621
well,

25
00:00:49,621 --> 00:00:50,490
I want to know you.

26
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:52,980
I want to know about your subjectivity.

27
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:54,450
I didn't want to know
what's inside of you,

28
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,040
but that isn't actually what you do.

29
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:56,650
Want to know if,

30
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:56,950
if,

31
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:58,080
if you're doing clinical work,

32
00:00:58,081 --> 00:01:00,210
say with someone you want to know,

33
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,730
did they have any friends?

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,280
That's really important because if you're
miserable and anxious and badly placed

35
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,290
in life and misbehaving,

36
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,100
one of the reasons that all of that
can occur is because you don't have any

37
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:14,401
friends.

38
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,240
You don't know anyone.

39
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,880
And that's not something
that's inside you.

40
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:18,951
It's,

41
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:22,650
it's you localized in a broader sphere.

42
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,371
And then you might say,

43
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:23,641
well,

44
00:01:23,641 --> 00:01:25,890
do you have job and well,

45
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:26,910
let's talk about the job.

46
00:01:26,911 --> 00:01:28,770
Do you actually make
enough money with your job?

47
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,140
Is it satisfying for you in any way?

48
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:32,430
Are you bullied all the time?

49
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:33,264
When you're at work?

50
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,740
Does it provoke anxiety?

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,530
Is it a career that allows
you to go somewhere?

52
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,820
Are you overworked?

53
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:39,540
Well,

54
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,340
but let's start with
just the first question.

55
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,840
Do you have a job?

56
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:43,201
Well,

57
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:44,820
if the answer to that is no,

58
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:49,620
you have a serious problem and that
would enough might be to depress you and

59
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,710
make you anxious and hopeless and
nihilistic and all of those things.

60
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:53,821
And you could say,

61
00:01:53,821 --> 00:01:54,001
well,

62
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,730
you're not reacting very
well to not having a job.

63
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,040
But that's kind of a foolish objection,

64
00:01:59,041 --> 00:02:00,600
even though some of it might be true.

65
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,770
One problem is,

66
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:04,260
is that you're not reacting
very well to not having a job.

67
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,130
But another problem is that you don't
have a job and that actually constitutes a

68
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,964
problem,

69
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,510
right?

70
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:10,530
You don't get to eat.

71
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,970
You don't have a place to live.

72
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,670
Those aren't psychological
problems precisely,

73
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,520
even though a psychological
problem could make it worse.

74
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,690
Well,

75
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:20,610
are you as educated as you should be?

76
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,780
That's another question.

77
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,610
How do you handle drugs and alcohol?

78
00:02:23,611 --> 00:02:25,440
Are they taking you down a bad pathway?

79
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:26,603
You know?

80
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,503
Um,

81
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,880
what about intimate relationships?

82
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,750
Do you have one?

83
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,450
You have a plan for one or they,

84
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,730
is that a never ending series of
catastrophes or something that you avoid

85
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:36,564
completely.

86
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:37,740
That's a big problem.

87
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,270
And maybe people don't,

88
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,550
aren't attracted to you
for one reason or another.

89
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,920
And you can think about that
as a psychological problem,

90
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:46,050
but it's an interpersonal problem.

91
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,560
And the degree to which that's
a psychological problem is,

92
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,320
is certainly an unspecified.

93
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,820
When you first begin to talk to somebody,

94
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,050
what about your family?

95
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,100
Do you have a family?

96
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,830
Because it's hard to be in
the world all by yourself.

97
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,710
That's sure.

98
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,630
It makes things a lot more stressful.

99
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:04,900
Even though having a family can
also be extraordinarily stressful,

100
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:05,800
you know,

101
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,420
do you have plans to have children?

102
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,920
How are you doing with your parents?

103
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,660
Do you get along with your siblings?

104
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:11,321
You know,

105
00:03:11,321 --> 00:03:12,070
all of that.

106
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,700
All of that to me is more
fundamental and it's outside of you.

107
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:21,090
Those are elements of your experience
more broadly conceptualized more than they

108
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:25,090
are objects of your psychology
or of your internal experience.

109
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:25,930
You know,

110
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,763
it's sort of like

111
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,581
while a person is,

112
00:03:31,581 --> 00:03:32,180
uh,

113
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,510
is it is a creature that exists
at multiple levels of analysis,

114
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:36,860
right?

115
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,410
Something might go wrong
with you at a cellular level,

116
00:03:39,411 --> 00:03:41,810
so maybe you're born with
a genetic abnormality,

117
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,890
so something's wrong with you molecularly
or you have something wrong with a

118
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:46,730
major organ.

119
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,430
Or maybe there's something
wrong with you psychologically,

120
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:53,780
or maybe you're in a pathological family
or maybe you're stuck in a pathological

121
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:55,540
social system and,

122
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,140
and figuring out what's,

123
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,310
why you're suffering means going
up and down those different levels.

124
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:04,280
Trying to specify the
appropriate level for analysis.

125
00:04:04,281 --> 00:04:06,350
And also the appropriate
level for intervention.

126
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:07,940
And for me as a,

127
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:08,541
as I've said,

128
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:12,050
even though I'm a great admirer of the
psychoanalysts and I do things like dream

129
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:12,531
analysis,

130
00:04:12,531 --> 00:04:17,330
which I really find you an incredibly
useful and enlightening the first,

131
00:04:17,331 --> 00:04:18,950
the fundamental level of analysis is,

132
00:04:18,951 --> 00:04:20,810
well what's your
experience structured like?

133
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,033
Exactly.

134
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,810
And that isn't localized in you.

135
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,890
Now the behaviorists do that too because
it's one of the things I really liked

136
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:29,750
about the behavioral
approach to psychotherapy.

137
00:04:29,751 --> 00:04:30,171
It's very,

138
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:31,460
very concrete and practical.

139
00:04:31,461 --> 00:04:32,780
It's like they'll say,

140
00:04:32,781 --> 00:04:33,614
well,

141
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,890
there are certain things that you need
to have in order to live properly and

142
00:04:36,891 --> 00:04:40,520
maybe you don't have the skills or the
wherewithal where with all to accumulate

143
00:04:40,521 --> 00:04:43,610
them and we'll break them down into
tiny little pieces and you'll practice.

144
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:44,510
So for example,

145
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,490
with someone who doesn't have any friends,

146
00:04:46,491 --> 00:04:49,910
then you do a micro analysis
of their social skills,

147
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:54,170
say and maybe an analysis of the kinds
of anxiety that are stopping them from

148
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,610
going out and meeting people.

149
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,520
And then you address those
things practically one by one.

150
00:04:58,521 --> 00:05:00,320
You try to get the person
to have some friends,

151
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,710
he tried to figure out how they can
establish an intimate relationship.

152
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:06,170
You see if you can help
them sort out their family,

153
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:08,060
you do what you can
about their employment.

154
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:12,380
And a lot of that's only tangentially
related to really in some sense to the

155
00:05:12,381 --> 00:05:13,550
structure of their psyche.

156
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,440
But one of the things you'll see if you
work as a clinician or as a counselor is

157
00:05:18,441 --> 00:05:21,470
that most of the time people come and
see you because they have problems,

158
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:25,640
not because they have
psychological problems and
those things are not that easy

159
00:05:25,641 --> 00:05:26,540
to distinguish.

160
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,231
You know,

161
00:05:27,231 --> 00:05:28,880
it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea,

162
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,331
sort of like,

163
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:30,920
well if you just start your act together,

164
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:32,360
everything would work out for you.

165
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,410
It's like,

166
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:34,243
yeah,

167
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,963
okay,

168
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,480
there's some truth in that,

169
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,213
but,

170
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,651
but you know,

171
00:05:43,651 --> 00:05:46,650
if you're 55 years old and
you've just been laid off work

172
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,990
and maybe through no fault of your own,

173
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,160
it isn't obvious how much
getting your act together,

174
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,670
it's going to help you find
another job because the,

175
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,940
the actual problem that you're facing may
have relatively little to do with you.

176
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:06,170
And that would especially be the case if
you're maybe on the bottom half of the

177
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:07,520
intelligence distribution,

178
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:08,211
for example.

179
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:12,980
And so it isn't as easy for you just
to go out and pick up new skills at the

180
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:13,880
drop of a hat.

181
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,850
You know?

182
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,051
Again,

183
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:18,110
that gets harder as you get older
because your Iq actually declines quite

184
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,550
substantially as you get older.

185
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,420
That that working or the the
fluid intelligence part anyways,

186
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,550
exercise can keep that at bay.

187
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:25,971
By the way,

188
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:27,410
it's the best way to keep that at bay.
