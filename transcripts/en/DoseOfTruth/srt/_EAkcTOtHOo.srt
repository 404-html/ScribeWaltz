1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm,

2
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,380
no,
the scandinavians have this idea that

3
00:00:09,381 --> 00:00:12,530
the world is a tree.
And uh,

4
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:17,900
I'd been thinking about that a lot.
I think that the tree idea tree is

5
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:21,470
something that is grounded in,
in matter,

6
00:00:21,471 --> 00:00:23,510
let's say.
And that reaches up to heaven in the

7
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:26,300
Scandinavian tree at the bottom.
There's quite a cool idea at the bottom

8
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:27,081
of that.
See,

9
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:29,780
this tree is constantly being not by
snakes.

10
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,350
You can sort of see the snakes at the
bottom and at the same time it's being

11
00:00:33,351 --> 00:00:37,160
watered and the water makes the tree
grow at the same rate that the snakes no

12
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,800
on its roots.
So it's like a Yin Yang idea,

13
00:00:39,801 --> 00:00:41,990
you know,
that there's continual chaotic

14
00:00:41,991 --> 00:00:45,530
destruction and replacement at the basis
of whatever this process is.

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,110
But the tree seems to me to be a
representation,

16
00:00:48,111 --> 00:00:52,430
not so much of.
It's like a different dimensional space.

17
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,410
That's what's trying to be represented.

18
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,230
So imagine that you know,
you're structured.

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,120
If you take powers of 10 magnification,
say human beings are about in the middle

20
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:06,020
of the tiniest thing and the largest
thing if you do it by,

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,060
by powers of 10.
And so,

22
00:01:08,061 --> 00:01:10,700
you know,
you have a sub atomic level and an

23
00:01:10,701 --> 00:01:13,250
atomic level on a molecular level and
you know,

24
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,273
that,
uh,

25
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:18,470
that are maybe a level of organs and
then there's you and then there's your

26
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:23,390
family and so on,
all the way up the tree fundamentally.

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,030
And so I think that what this tree
represents,

28
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,000
and this is the things that thing that
the shaman moves up and down,

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,950
I think that's what it represents.
It's this,

30
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:34,850
it's this different view of,
of its dimensionality.

31
00:01:34,851 --> 00:01:36,830
It's something like that.
And I think that what happens in the

32
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:39,920
psychedelic experiences that
consciousness can travel up and down

33
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:41,840
that structure.
It's something like that,

34
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:45,050
and maybe not only up and down it,
but maybe right through it.

35
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:49,070
I know that's a radical claim.
It's a really radical claim.

36
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,240
And if it might be wrong,
but it's probably wrong even because

37
00:01:53,241 --> 00:01:54,860
most radical claims are wrong.

38
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,350
But,
but,

39
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:08,270
but I'm not so sure it's wrong.
Here's something cool.

40
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:14,600
So that's the Scandinavian world tree.
And that was drawn by an anthropologist

41
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:18,420
who visited the tribes in the Amazon who
use IOWASCA.

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:27,150
Now you see it's a snake.
It's a tree with snakes.

43
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,141
Well,
you know,

44
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:31,410
that's reminiscent of the story in Adam
and Eve obviously,

45
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:34,680
but it's also reminiscent of our primate
dwelling place,

46
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:36,960
right?
Because that was basically our ancestral

47
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,350
home,
a tree surrounded by snakes and the

48
00:02:40,351 --> 00:02:42,870
snakes like to eat us and this is a long
time ago.

49
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,704
This is like

50
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,470
$50 million years ago.
It's really a long time ago and so we

51
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:52,470
don't know where these images come from
precisely,

52
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,830
but I do have the suspicion that
we use the circuitry that we developed

53
00:02:59,621 --> 00:03:04,621
to detect snakes to represent the
unknown as such because like snake is

54
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,590
something that comes out of the unknown
and like we evolved,

55
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:10,300
right?
We all evolved out of an animal

56
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,310
substructure and so we had to get our,
our biological cognitive structure from

57
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:20,080
somewhere and we have this capacity of
thinking about the absolute unknown and

58
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:24,040
the terrors that are involved in that.
The horrors that can emerge from what we

59
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,230
don't understand and it stands
perfectly.

60
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:30,490
The reason that we would use circuits
that were already pre developed for that

61
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,240
and that this is a reasonable
representation of the existential

62
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:36,700
structure of the world.
So

63
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,720
I think I might've showed you this
before but

64
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:45,460
it never ceases to amaze me this,
this picture.

65
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,460
So my son drew this when he was nine,
eight and so on the right you see

66
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:55,471
mushroom houses and they have the names
of all his friends on them and so that's

67
00:03:56,381 --> 00:04:00,130
order right?
And then on the left side you see chaos

68
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,970
there and that little orange thing is a
bug and then there's a river that runs

69
00:04:03,971 --> 00:04:08,680
right down the middle and so that's like
the know the Yin Yang symbol with the

70
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,960
divide in the middle.
So that's quite cool.

71
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,100
And then there's,
there it is,

72
00:04:12,101 --> 00:04:15,190
there's Jacob's ladder.
It's like Jack and the beanstalk,

73
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:19,870
which is by the way another variant of
the same shamonic story and there are

74
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:24,310
bugs going up and down it and then
they're taking messages from heaven and

75
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:29,311
then up there and haven't got the sun.
And there's St Peter and I don't know

76
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:32,440
where in the world he got this.
It's not like he had a lot of religious

77
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,110
education,
I mean read despite me.

78
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,020
Um,
and then,

79
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:38,530
oh,
there's the pearly gates up there and

80
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:42,430
then that was the world as far as his,
he had a very well ordered psyche I

81
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:43,264
would say.
And,

82
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,640
and still does,
but when he drew that,

83
00:04:45,641 --> 00:04:49,690
it just absolutely blew me away.
And so I had it laminated and it's in my

84
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:52,290
office because,
well,

85
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:54,640
I don't know because like,
what the hell do you make of that?

86
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:55,380
You know,
that's,

87
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,430
that's why so,

88
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,820
well you sort of get the picture there,
you know,

89
00:05:10,821 --> 00:05:15,821
the cathedral is the great cathedrals of
Europe or they're like the forest in

90
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,241
stone,
right?

91
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:21,380
And they try to represent the light
coming through the leaves and so it's

92
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,700
sort of our ancestral forest home,
but it's,

93
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:27,790
it's transformed into these great
sculptures of stone and you know,

94
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,760
they produce all because of the
combination of light and darkness and

95
00:05:31,761 --> 00:05:34,040
color.
But also I think for the same reason

96
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,800
that huge trees produce art and people,
you know,

97
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:39,800
and we don't want them cut down.
They seem sacred in some sense.

98
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,350
And perhaps they are.
But

99
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,910
no,
and it also seemed to me this is an

100
00:05:46,911 --> 00:05:51,740
intuition that the the architects of
these great cathedrals were trying to

101
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:54,050
get.
You're trying to express something

102
00:05:54,051 --> 00:05:57,560
that's deep and structural.
They're trying try and try and to

103
00:05:57,561 --> 00:06:00,500
express the idea that if being was
constituted properly,

104
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,480
then it would be organized from the
subatomic level all the way up to the

105
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:10,220
highest cosmic level perfectly,
so every layer stacked on top of each

106
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:14,720
other without any contradictions.
That would be an ideal mode of being and

107
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,510
everything would come together under
those circumstances.

108
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:20,180
And that's what's being expressed in
these cathedrals.

109
00:06:20,181 --> 00:06:23,420
It's not all that's being expressed
because they're also shaped like a cross

110
00:06:23,421 --> 00:06:26,180
and you know,
the idea is that the center of the

111
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:27,920
Cross,
which is the center of suffering,

112
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:31,460
is also the place of the individual.
The place where the transformation takes

113
00:06:31,461 --> 00:06:33,320
place.
That's all built into the architecture

114
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,940
as well.
So

115
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,240
then there's the tree like structures
that make us up.

116
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,020
It's stretched down to the tiniest
realities,

117
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,410
the microcosm,

118
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,200
and there's this,
this idea,

119
00:07:01,201 --> 00:07:03,090
it's all represented in the same way.
Again,

120
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:06,060
it's this idea,
especially the Mandela up in the top

121
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,760
right,
it's the idea of his perfection of

122
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,990
crystalline structure and that's what
the Yogis are trying to attain when they

123
00:07:12,991 --> 00:07:15,840
organize their bodies.
They're trying to get every single layer

124
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:19,140
of there being aligned properly and it's
something like,

125
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,810
and you can kind of see an echo of that
in the.

126
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:26,130
I think that's a Tibetan sand painting,
if I remember correctly,

127
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,880
on the on the bottom left.
The idea is that if you get yourself

128
00:07:29,881 --> 00:07:33,060
aligned properly,
then information can flow along that

129
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:35,580
tree,
that that's you without

130
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,340
without impediment,
something like that,

131
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,560
and that would be like a state of
optimal health and that both physical

132
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:49,180
and spiritual exercises can put you in
that state and that's while those are

133
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:52,180
all clouds of ideas that surround this
idea of a ladder to heaven.
