1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,390
Not so good to have a low Iq.

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:05,440
You know,

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,440
people don't like the idea of Iq
because it seems so arbitrary,

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:11,590
you know,

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:12,490
have a high Iq.

6
00:00:12,491 --> 00:00:14,350
Well it's not like you deserve that.

7
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:14,951
Exactly.

8
00:00:14,951 --> 00:00:18,640
It's your set up that way pretty
much right from the beginning.

9
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:19,474
It's very,

10
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,051
very,

11
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:20,501
very,

12
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:21,640
very stable.

13
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:24,250
You can make a high Iq person stupider.

14
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,231
Why?

15
00:00:25,231 --> 00:00:25,510
You know,

16
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,320
not educating them up to the level of
their possibility but taking someone who

17
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,330
has a low Iq and trying to raise that.

18
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,190
It's like if you can
figure out how to do that,

19
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,670
well you know it's Nobel prize time for
you because people have tried that a lot

20
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,510
and most recently with those,

21
00:00:40,511 --> 00:00:44,230
you know Luminol Lumosity games and
that sort of thing and the evidence that

22
00:00:44,231 --> 00:00:49,231
those produce anything other
than brilliant performances
on the Lumosity game

23
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:53,260
itself is basically zero.

24
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:58,300
We haven't been able to figure out how
to see cause I intelligence is a cross

25
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:03,010
domain phenomena and you can get really
good in a single domain by practicing

26
00:01:03,011 --> 00:01:07,420
like Matt and what you'd want is to
practice like mad in a single domain and

27
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:09,760
hope that it generalizes to other domains.

28
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,700
That's the holy grail of
intelligence increase.

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,720
It's like no,

30
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:15,610
no one's done it.

31
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,660
People claim it but the claims never
hold up and people have been trying for a

32
00:01:19,661 --> 00:01:22,930
long time to do it and they
haven't been able to do it.

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,033
And

34
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:30,770
differences in Iq really
make a difference.

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,190
You know,

36
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,350
I mean you guys,

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,440
average Iq is probably one 25 one 30 ad
at one 15 you're at the 85th percentile

38
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,610
and and one 15 would
barely get you going for,

39
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:50,980
for hard university one 30 you're
probably graduate school material,

40
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,400
you know one 45 you're up there

41
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,480
at the range where you can probably
do pretty much whatever you want.

42
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:01,130
Although as you get smarter,

43
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:03,610
the scatter between
your abilities increase.

44
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,340
So you might have a very high verbal Iq
but not be so good at mathematics or the

45
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,323
other way around.

46
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:11,720
But it's a massive contributor
to lifetime success.

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,590
And I don't know what to do about that.

48
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,453
I mean,

49
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,920
why do smart people make more money?

50
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:20,090
Well,

51
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:25,090
they get to where the edge
of production is faster.

52
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:29,090
So if you have a thousand people
and you rank order them by Iq,

53
00:02:29,091 --> 00:02:32,480
the smart people are going to come up
with a new ideas first and they're going

54
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:35,600
to have more ideas and they're
going to strategize better.

55
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:37,870
And you know,

56
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,340
with an Iq of 90 which is

57
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,280
15% of the population,

58
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:47,890
you think about that
15% of the population.

59
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,690
That's pretty much the threshold for
reading instructions and being able to

60
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:53,524
follow them.

61
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,280
Okay.

62
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,113
So you know,

63
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,000
and our societies and Chris
increasingly sophisticated.

64
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,170
So it's by no means obvious.

65
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:03,760
You know,

66
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,511
the Liberals think,

67
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:09,511
well the society is unfair because
there's unemployment and the Conservatives

68
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,310
think while there's a
job for everyone and,

69
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,930
but none of them think,

70
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,231
well,

71
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:15,160
there are massive,

72
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,821
massive,

73
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:18,100
massive differences in people's ability,

74
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,530
far greater than anyone realizes.

75
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,620
And that poses a structural problem.
