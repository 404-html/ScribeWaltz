1
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,783
At

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,340
Ucla on telling you a story

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,350
because it's pretty damn easy.

4
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:18,010
So there's this neurological condition

5
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:22,530
virtually comprehensible.

6
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:24,540
What happens if you have any,

7
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:25,730
you,

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,190
you have a stroke in the right.

9
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:28,780
Uh,

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,870
the right priority area of
your right hemisphere has,

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,430
it doesn't happen.

12
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:40,470
What happens if you have that stroke is
you lose the lending side and the loss

13
00:00:42,431 --> 00:00:43,610
is extremely interesting.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,250
Firstly,

15
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,620
it gives you lose motor
control so you can't move.

16
00:00:47,270 --> 00:00:48,970
But that's really the beginning of it.

17
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,200
You lose your ability to conceptualize
the fact that you had a left side of your

18
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:55,900
body and more.

19
00:00:55,901 --> 00:01:00,550
You lose the ability to conceive
and we don't know how this happens.

20
00:01:00,551 --> 00:01:05,551
I think it must be something like if I
stand here and look out at all of me,

21
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,400
I can see that people right
in front of me quite clearly.

22
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,890
And then the people to
my right and left tomes,

23
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,960
I keep my eyes big savings
right in front of me.

24
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:15,130
They're quite blurry.

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,780
I can't see their faces on the way,

26
00:01:16,781 --> 00:01:17,531
no other people.

27
00:01:17,531 --> 00:01:21,360
And then by this are out at the
periphery of my visual system.

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:23,170
I don't even have color vision anymore.

29
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:28,171
Even white tape it for the test
showed that and then past that,

30
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:29,980
which is behind me.

31
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,993
There's nothing,

32
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,800
it's not black.

33
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,970
It's not an amputee,

34
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,160
it's just not there.

35
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:37,023
It's not even,

36
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,380
it's not even not fair.

37
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:39,580
It just doesn't exist.

38
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:44,020
And what seems to happen with people
who have neglect that moves around the

39
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,390
three corners of
everything instead of half.

40
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,210
Now that's a gap because
we really don't know.

41
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:52,120
But if you get people
who like to draw a claw,

42
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,970
they'll put all the numbers in one half
and if can give you a plate full of

43
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:55,241
food,

44
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:57,910
they'll only eat the food on
the right side of the plate.

45
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,240
And then if you turn the brake bill,

46
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:03,130
he half of what's left and
then even more strangely now,

47
00:02:03,131 --> 00:02:07,480
and then they notice that they have a
left heart and it really upsets them.

48
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,343
So the,

49
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,890
and they noticed they have a
left arm and they'll try to,

50
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,430
they'll be horrified by it.

51
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,080
They'll think in someone else's.

52
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:16,320
They'll think extremely someone
that they know or that we did.

53
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:20,840
The nurses left the body and sometimes
they'll even try to throw it out of bed

54
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,940
and so and so they don't seem to buy.

55
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,060
And here's the other thing,

56
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:26,590
strange strangers,

57
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,050
they're not upset about the fact
that they're half paralyzed.

58
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:33,370
It's because they actually don't know
that they're half parallax and the reason

59
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:36,760
for that specific part of the brain
that would alert them to the fact that

60
00:02:36,761 --> 00:02:39,010
they're half paralyzed as
being destroyed by the stroke.

61
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,690
So it's,

62
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,590
it's they're not have sex at all white.

63
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,090
The apartment would make
them upset because you should
be upset if you lose half

64
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:46,924
your body.

65
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,490
It's like that's very upsetting.

66
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:53,550
And the fact that you get upset is your
emergency to the importance of the loss.

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,640
And so imagine you can
carry me a little bit.

68
00:02:57,641 --> 00:02:59,570
Well then would you
notice and answer as well?

69
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,670
We not.

70
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,120
And so what grandma Sean was
experimented with the balance,

71
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,150
literally the balance of
people who have neglected.

72
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,220
He did this weird little experiment
that you do to test people's vestibular

73
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:15,641
system,

74
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,400
which enables them to
stay on felons consultant.

75
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:21,310
If you pour cold water in someone's ear,

76
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,390
then it upstairs have sense of their
balance because your ears are intensely

77
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:28,550
involved in your balance and your
eyes are moving back and forth and it

78
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,810
destabilizes the seas.

79
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,310
And so around the Shaundra was testing
his neglect patients for their,

80
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,010
for their,

81
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:37,843
uh,

82
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:40,470
their particular function
using cold water.

83
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,870
A number of them woke up and
realized that they were paralyzed.

84
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,770
And his idea was
essentially that the shock,

85
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:51,250
eventually the shock of the
cold water was enough to,

86
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,170
to increase,

87
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,471
say,

88
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:57,700
emotional functioning enough to
reactivate the damage efforts in the right

89
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,310
hemisphere to wake them up enough
to notice that half you're going,

90
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:01,990
he was missing.

91
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:02,231
Thank you.

92
00:04:02,231 --> 00:04:07,180
Produce a catastrophic people show
response when people realize what had

93
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:08,014
happened.

94
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,003
Um,

95
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,370
so if you call the attention
of someone with neglect,

96
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,990
the left him say you have
a left hand there and say,

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,691
can you move it?

98
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:17,111
And he'll say,

99
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:17,291
well,

100
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,124
never mind.

101
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,610
I don't feel like it hurt my
arthritis is for you this morning.

102
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,000
It hurts me to come up with
some rationalization for
why they can't move it,

103
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,650
but they're upset.

104
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:30,070
So Robuchon none with irrigating for years
and then they wake up and they have a

105
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:34,180
catastrophic emotional response to the
loss of the live side of your body.

106
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,140
But then 20 minutes later they snap out
of it and then they forget they lost the

107
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:38,760
left side.

108
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,350
They go right back to
their old way of thinking.

109
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,100
And what's so interesting about this
and how it's related to whatever he told

110
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:49,210
you is that sees their left hemisphere
had already built a board with their body

111
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,620
and you know you haven't
more than with your boy.

112
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,750
It's really BPL walk when you,

113
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:56,530
you can tell that magic
if you break a tooth,

114
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,080
what happens if you break your tooth?

115
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:00,580
It's your tongue goes absolutely insane,

116
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:00,851
right?

117
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:01,930
Your next three months,

118
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,450
all your tongue is poke round in there.

119
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:10,330
Figure out exactly the contours of your
problem and maybe it takes you three

120
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:11,790
months to update that too.

121
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,320
You don't feel like your
bones is a stranger.

122
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,880
And the reason for that is,

123
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:21,020
well you should let him know which in
your outright like clearing your mom just

124
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,450
unbelievably wide are not insensitive.

125
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,580
And so because why?

126
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:29,581
You put things in there and you have to
eat and so you have the intelligence of

127
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,030
what's you and what isn't for you.

128
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32,230
Choose your town like,

129
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:35,350
I mean it's very important to
have that map that you see.

130
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,130
You see with your experience
with having a damage tooth,

131
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:42,850
you see just how much work it takes to
even do a little tiny bit of remapping,

132
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:43,270
right?

133
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,300
It's like three months of of Tom,

134
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,610
the effort to update your
will over your mouth.

135
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,880
Imagine how much effort it would be
lucky we'll take to update your model of

136
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,590
your body if you've lost half of it.

137
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:54,641
Right?

138
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,181
So that's it.

139
00:05:55,181 --> 00:06:00,181
So your left hemisphere count do that
keeps on process in your body with the old

140
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,530
model and since the right
hemispheres damaged,

141
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,410
there isn't any emotions
associated with the loss.

142
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,440
And so the left hemisphere just keeps
on grinding away on its own logo on.

143
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:15,590
And that happens to us and
walk like that's sort of
how we think is that we have

144
00:06:15,591 --> 00:06:20,591
these partial models of reality more or
less work and were really stubborn about

145
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,690
and we don't want them to disappear
because they take a bloody modern work to

146
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,240
formulate.

147
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,360
And if we're forced to lose the
mega trends to be catastrophic.

148
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,550
And so an example of that might be,

149
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:32,660
you know,

150
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,050
let's say you put a whole bunch
of effort into up monogamous,

151
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:36,800
you know,

152
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,060
monogamous relationship.

153
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:40,760
And so actually it's lasted 10 years.

154
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,340
What's the African?

155
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:42,611
Okay,

156
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:43,650
well the first PBS,

157
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,920
you've gone a lot of places with this
person and that model claims with them.

158
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:52,960
You have a story and the story's based
on your understanding of that person and

159
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:57,140
the implication of that understanding
for your understanding of you.

160
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,020
So you know,

161
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,620
you might be,

162
00:06:58,620 --> 00:06:59,840
well I took my,

163
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,130
my wife or husband to Hawaii
and we had a nice time at God.

164
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,810
You have that whole memory and you
have hundreds of memories like that.

165
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:13,520
All secrets to national story about who
you are and where you are in the past.

166
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,410
And then you have a story like that about
the present who you are now and then

167
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,090
give a story like that about your future.

168
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:24,080
And then you find out that your partner's
been having sequential affairs for the

169
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:26,360
last 15 years and it's like,

170
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:30,350
well what happens all your
models now in development?

171
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,001
And then you think,

172
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:33,410
well what does that mean exactly?

173
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,191
Well,

174
00:07:34,191 --> 00:07:38,270
it doesn't just mean that you
don't know who your partner is,

175
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,550
although we greeted means that it also
means everything you thought about your

176
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,810
past isn't wrong.

177
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:46,700
All those memories of,

178
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:47,960
of everything that happened,

179
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,180
those aren't accurate.

180
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,540
And so when something like
that happens in DC trail,

181
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,900
this is why Dante betrayers
in the lowest level of hell,

182
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:57,734
by the way,

183
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:00,450
besides safety itself and chase Deniece,

184
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:05,470
this is the betrayers because it blows
out your model up in the past and the

185
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,590
presence of the future.

186
00:08:06,591 --> 00:08:08,660
You told me about where your are,

187
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,900
we don't know where you were and
you don't know where you're going.

188
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:16,460
And it's worse than that because you also
don't know who you are anymore because

189
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:21,461
you are obviously someone who just wasn't
that awake and you were with Justin

190
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,480
wasn't who you thought they work.

191
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,040
And so it's no wonder you'd be
resistant to information like that.

192
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,221
You know what I mean?

193
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:32,080
It's like who think out.

194
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:36,880
Once they have a global theory of
that magnitude disprove that globe,

195
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,400
it just leaves you wide open
and exposed to the world.

196
00:08:40,401 --> 00:08:41,330
So we heard your tech,

197
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:41,840
your,

198
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,060
your theory is as much
as you possibly can,

199
00:08:44,061 --> 00:08:48,290
and I'm going to overthrow them because
of some housing will disapprove pretty

200
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,343
to,

201
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,630
you know,

202
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:52,790
psychologists talk about
that as confirmation bias.

203
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:53,271
Like Sam,

204
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:56,730
think about it as a cognitive
that they no be moaning.

205
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,940
The fact that people are very stubborn
about giving up their presuppositions,

206
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,430
but it's so bloody one little,

207
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:01,711
you know,

208
00:09:01,711 --> 00:09:02,250
it's,

209
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,083
it's,

210
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,880
you put a lot of effort into
that formulation of the world.

211
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,920
It's not just a representation,

212
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:08,670
right?

213
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:11,010
It's the way you live in the world.

214
00:09:11,011 --> 00:09:14,130
And so when you give that up and then
what the hell are you supposed to do?

215
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:14,851
Right?

216
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,200
You're supposed to be enraged.

217
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:18,550
He supposed to have a 50
supposed to become herbivorous.

218
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,930
Are you supposed to
collapse into depression?

219
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,370
It's supposed to be
like infinitely cynical.

220
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:26,610
Are you supposed to never have
a relationship in your life?

221
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,120
Are you supposed to have complete contempt
for yourself for being seen nine even

222
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:30,954
blind,

223
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,290
or you're supposed to hate you mad at
him because it contains the capacity for

224
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,670
that kind of betrayal.

225
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,200
It's like you don't know.

226
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,560
All of those things are true
all at one civil paisley,

227
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:43,110
and that's the little
space that you occupy,

228
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:43,860
right?

229
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,020
That's the mythical
underworld essentially.

230
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:49,500
That's a place you go when
your dreams and hopes die.

231
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,690
Everyone goes there from time to time.

232
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,180
Lots of people go there
and never come out.
