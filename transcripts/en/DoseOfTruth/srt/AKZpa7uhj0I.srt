1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,463
Hm

2
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:15,010
probability of a collapse is proportional
to the number of events or curry.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:18,540
And so the more events occur,

4
00:00:18,541 --> 00:00:21,900
the more likely extremely
unlikely events are to take place.

5
00:00:21,901 --> 00:00:23,550
And everything's been speeding up,

6
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,050
really speeding up.

7
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:25,321
I mean,

8
00:00:25,321 --> 00:00:28,860
you think about how many trades now
are made in microseconds by computer,

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:29,671
you know,

10
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:34,671
so my suspicions are if you calculated
the complexity of the trading system and

11
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:39,330
held that constant that the rate
of failure would be about the same.

12
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:41,430
It seems to be highly problem.

13
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:42,001
In fact,

14
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:44,860
it would really surprise me if that wasn't
the case because that's basically how

15
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:46,140
systems work.

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:46,590
You know,

17
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,180
there's a certain number of events
that are outliers per certain number of

18
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:51,810
events.

19
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,340
So if you raise the number of events,

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,750
you raise that number of outliers.

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,650
And so I,

22
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,311
and you see this,

23
00:00:56,311 --> 00:01:00,390
I think also reflected in things
like tech company growth in collapse.

24
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,643
You know,

25
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:02,580
20 years ago,

26
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:04,590
the average lifespan of a company,

27
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:05,100
it was,

28
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:05,431
you know,

29
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:08,580
perhaps something around 30 to 40 years.

30
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:11,310
My suspicions are now that on average,

31
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,020
especially in fast changing fields,

32
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:14,310
that they don't last that long.

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,471
So you know,

34
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:17,250
we're speeding,

35
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:17,500
you know,

36
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,190
if you think time is actually
a measure of the events,

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,570
average number of events,

38
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:22,404
well,

39
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,030
times events are occurring
a lot faster now.

40
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,790
So time in some senses sped up,

41
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,170
at least in certain systems.
