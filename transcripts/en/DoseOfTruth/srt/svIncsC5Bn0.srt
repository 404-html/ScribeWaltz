1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,270
Why do you think,

2
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,103
you know,

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,201
there's cars,

4
00:00:10,201 --> 00:00:13,230
there's a kind of a contradictory
narrative that runs through that story,

5
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:14,064
which is that,

6
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:14,281
you know,

7
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:14,580
when you,

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,121
you're a kid,

9
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:16,170
you were sort of isolated,

10
00:00:16,171 --> 00:00:16,831
you were bookish,

11
00:00:16,831 --> 00:00:18,900
she were more scientifically oriented,

12
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,190
but at the same time you obviously had a,

13
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:22,610
what,

14
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,431
what would you call it,

15
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:27,330
a a feel for ecstatic
experience and like was that,

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,350
was that a consequence of
your participation in the
counterculture in the 60s or

17
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:33,540
was that something that
emerged even before that?

18
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:38,570
It was suddenly an emerge probably between
the age of 10 and 12 it probably came

19
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:41,360
from the fact that I was suffering
serious social deprivation.

20
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,630
I'm really,

21
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,560
I had one friend at a time and that's
about as much as I had and I was,

22
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:51,090
I was an indispensable figure when it
came time to beat somebody up because I

23
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:51,924
was the target.

24
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,003
Um,

25
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:53,620
okay.

26
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:53,861
How,

27
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:54,221
okay.

28
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:56,020
So That's interesting
too because that also,

29
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,110
I mean it isn't obvious how you get from
that position to being interested in

30
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:03,310
ecstatic experiences per se.

31
00:01:03,311 --> 00:01:04,021
So what,

32
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:07,450
what's the connection there with your
rather like what would you call it?

33
00:01:07,451 --> 00:01:09,310
Isolated childhood experiences,

34
00:01:09,311 --> 00:01:10,030
do you think?

35
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,730
I mean you said it had something
partly to do with music,

36
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:14,200
which makes a perfect,

37
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:16,870
perfect sense to me
because music has almost a,

38
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,891
what would you say?

39
00:01:17,891 --> 00:01:22,891
It's an unerring gateway into that
ecstatic experience for for very complex

40
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:23,550
reasons.

41
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,090
I'd like to talk to you
about that a little bit,

42
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:26,600
but it,

43
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:32,100
it isn't obvious why someone who was more
scientifically oriented say would also

44
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,090
make that leap over to the more mystical
end of things and then of course pursue

45
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:36,901
it through pop culture.

46
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:37,734
So you laid out,

47
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:38,500
you know,

48
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,760
you're surprising involvement,

49
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,140
literary magazine,

50
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:45,430
your transformation of that into what was
essentially an visual art publication,

51
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,790
your entry into the world
radio and then into rock.

52
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,580
I don't want to lose that thread because
that also leads to your PR firm and I

53
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:53,650
presume we're getting to that,

54
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:55,680
but what he can,

55
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,750
is there anything you can
put your finger on you,

56
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,260
you associated it also with like being
physically bullied and being a social

57
00:02:02,261 --> 00:02:02,711
outcast,

58
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:05,110
but why did that give you that
hunger for that experience,

59
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:06,550
for that ecstatic experience?

60
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:06,951
Well,

61
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,440
remember back to the days
of the 1960 [inaudible],

62
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,450
the 1970s one sleep deprivation was a
new discovery and then back in the 1990s

63
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,860
and early two thousands Jaak
Panksepp took that a step further.

64
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,190
And in his studies of rat behavior,

65
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,440
he discovered that if he
deprived a bunch of child rats,

66
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,150
little rats,

67
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,983
baby rats,

68
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,570
if he deprives them of
the ability to play.

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,080
Yeah.

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,240
And didn't give them access to
each other as peers until they,

71
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:35,520
they become adults.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,110
They suffered play deprivation and they
spent just as much time playing with

73
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:44,200
each other as adults as they would
have spent playing with each other.

74
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,010
Have they been allowed to as children?

75
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:47,480
Okay.

76
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,340
So I want to make a quick lateral
move there and we'll get back to that.

77
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:50,910
You know,

78
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,350
I've been thinking about these,

79
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,740
these strange modern manifestations of
identity fantasy or that's what it looks

80
00:02:58,011 --> 00:03:00,130
to me like these people are playing out.

81
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,480
Um,

82
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,201
what do they call them,

83
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:06,160
other kids and playing with their
identities in a really fantasy based way.

84
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:10,270
And sometimes I wonder if part of that
isn't a consequence of play deprivation

85
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:11,104
in childhood.

86
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:12,251
Well,

87
00:03:12,251 --> 00:03:13,000
that sounds,

88
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,671
that sounds like it.

89
00:03:13,671 --> 00:03:14,710
The same possibility.

90
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:19,711
But remember Herman has said that there
is somewhere deep dark in the mind.

91
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,870
There's a closet with
10,000 hidden personalities.

92
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,790
One of the things that I discovered,

93
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,740
we're going to get out
of chronological order,

94
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,730
but one of the things that I discovered
when I first became full time involved

95
00:03:30,731 --> 00:03:33,280
with rock and roll was
the story of Alice Cooper.

96
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,210
And the story of Alice Cooper reveals
something about the question that you just

97
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,020
raised.

98
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:38,853
Um,

99
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,040
Alice Cooper was a little bit
like me when he was a kid.

100
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,340
His mom used to dress up in a suit every
day and he was a gawky then with a huge

101
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,574
nose.

102
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,270
Um,

103
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,010
I was lucky fin with a huge nose.

104
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,821
I can identify.

105
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:52,870
I never wore suits though.

106
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,300
And he was always a teacher's pet.

107
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,400
And the result was the other kids hated
him and he was kicked around and beaten

108
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:00,761
and,

109
00:04:00,761 --> 00:04:03,640
and excluded the way that I'd
been kicked around and beaten,

110
00:04:03,641 --> 00:04:04,474
then excluded.

111
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,780
Then one day a neighbor was at in his
kitchen who was into a weegee board and

112
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,760
making contact with spirits
through the weegie board.

113
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,013
Um,

114
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,530
so,

115
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:14,591
uh,

116
00:04:14,591 --> 00:04:18,100
spirit allegedly contacted her and said,

117
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,190
I am the ghost of a witch who was burned
of the say in the 16th century and,

118
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,000
or 17th century.

119
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,480
And you pointing to Alice,

120
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm pointing to his thing was
rinse for an ea at the time,

121
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,830
pointing into Vince,

122
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,850
you are my modern reincarnation
and my name is Alice Cooper.

123
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:40,830
Hmm.

124
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,160
Now when,

125
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,380
when Vince for an ea one onstage and
address with Mascara at a high school

126
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:51,910
talent night for the very first
time playing his own music,

127
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,130
chopping up baby dolls with an ax,

128
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,950
which is the more real person,

129
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,220
Vince for NEA,

130
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,330
the shy little kid dressed up in a suit
who gave apples to his teacher or Alice

131
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:03,941
Cooper,

132
00:05:03,941 --> 00:05:07,630
the person on stage who comes to life
with an ecstatic identity that makes them

133
00:05:07,631 --> 00:05:10,570
a surfer on the back
of those mass passions,

134
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:13,690
those mass exhilaration that
make the forces of history.

135
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:14,261
Well,

136
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:15,310
Alice of the two,

137
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,040
they're both real people and they're
both inside events for an ea,

138
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,740
but the one that's in there that has
a greatest passionate intensity is the

139
00:05:23,741 --> 00:05:24,574
Alice Cooper,

140
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,050
not the Vince for an NEA.

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:30,760
And that's why though he had been picked
on and none of the kids in his school

142
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:31,594
had liked him.

143
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:34,060
The minute he finished
his first performance,

144
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,940
all the football guys who used
to beat the crap out of him,

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,710
surge down to the foot of the stage and
volunteered to be parts of his band.

146
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:42,973
And when he,

147
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,260
when he was super famous,

148
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,640
some of those guys were
still mainstays of his band.

149
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:51,640
We carry many selves inside of us.

150
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:51,751
Uh,

151
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:56,751
my job in PR was to find
people who deserve to be
iconic and then to explain to

152
00:05:59,001 --> 00:05:59,211
them,

153
00:05:59,211 --> 00:06:00,044
first of all,

154
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,093
I will not,

155
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,550
if you think that I as your publicist,

156
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,640
I'm going to fashion an artificial mask
and image and through that make you a

157
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,090
star.

158
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:12,140
I'm going to get you an appointment with
my best competitor immediately you'll

159
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:13,070
be whether I'm an hours,

160
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,240
um,

161
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,290
if you're going to work with me,

162
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,760
you will have to understand something.

163
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,710
The music you make is about human soul
that comes from the very soul of you and

164
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,730
what happens to you when you go out on
stage and feel as if to yourself leaves

165
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:29,270
you and you are a dance like a
puppet or like a puppet on a string,

166
00:06:29,271 --> 00:06:31,400
like a marionette on stage.

167
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,170
The force that moves you,

168
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:36,450
that's one of the gods inside of you
that is your soul and what you're

169
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:39,230
experiencing with that
audience is a soul exchange.

170
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:42,740
If you're willing to put up with the
fact that music is not about marketing,

171
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:44,120
music is not about product.

172
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,220
Music is not about downloads,

173
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:48,980
music is about these
chains are human soul,

174
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,330
then I will work with you.

175
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:55,080
And quite the statement
for a Zionist is to yes,

176
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,530
they talk really is all in that manner.

177
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:57,850
That's,

178
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,640
you know,

179
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,091
I listen,

180
00:06:59,091 --> 00:07:03,410
tell us Cooper a lot when I was a kid
and still now especially that record a

181
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,520
welcome to my nightmare,

182
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:06,320
which I think is an absolute classic.

183
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:06,741
You know,

184
00:07:06,741 --> 00:07:08,270
there's a couple of pop songs on it,

185
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,870
which,

186
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:09,703
which I think,

187
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:13,250
I mean record companies
did that a fair bit on,

188
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:13,850
on,

189
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,260
on concept albums.

190
00:07:15,261 --> 00:07:15,450
You know,

191
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,940
they'd throw a pop hint on there,

192
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:18,620
but right as a concept album,

193
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:21,800
it's brilliant and it's really
well arranged and it's really

194
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,150
not horrifying.

195
00:07:26,151 --> 00:07:28,430
Exactly because that's not exactly right,

196
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,380
but it's unbelievably dramatic.

197
00:07:30,381 --> 00:07:33,140
I would say theatrical in in the best way.

198
00:07:33,141 --> 00:07:36,470
And I really think it's a work of
genius that welcome to my nightmare.

199
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:37,304
So,

200
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:37,851
and I,

201
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:38,930
I had no idea that,

202
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,460
that that was Alice Cooper's background,

203
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,250
although I did hear that he
was the child of a minister.

204
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:44,180
Is that also correct?

205
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,370
Oh,

206
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:44,631
no,

207
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:44,841
no,

208
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:45,141
no.

209
00:07:45,141 --> 00:07:47,930
His father was in the
aerospace industry in Arizona.

210
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,190
Oh,

211
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,660
big aerospace territory.

212
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,990
Right.

213
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,730
But a lot of the kids who were turned on
to Alice Cooper and were turned down by

214
00:07:55,731 --> 00:07:58,940
other shark bands like
that were the children of,

215
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,600
uh,

216
00:07:59,600 --> 00:07:59,920
uh,

217
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,680
ministers,

218
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,870
the children of deeply religious people,

219
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,460
the religious right.

220
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,290
Uh,

221
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:07,460
because he's bringing out
the other side of things.

222
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:07,641
He,

223
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:08,090
right,

224
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:08,923
exactly.

225
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,380
Right.

226
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:10,680
Well,

227
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,850
he's obviously the precursor
of people like Marilyn Manson.

228
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:14,511
Yes,

229
00:08:14,511 --> 00:08:15,201
exactly.

230
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:16,910
A Marilyn Manson was to sort of cheap,

231
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:19,310
even though Marilyn Manson
was kind enough to be good.

232
00:08:19,311 --> 00:08:19,970
To me,

233
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,650
Marilyn Manson was a kind of cheap,

234
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,360
uh,

235
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,193
take off.

236
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:26,780
And Alice Cooper didn't have the staying
power that Alice seems to have had.
