1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,490
The more I read about the Gulag System in,

2
00:00:09,491 --> 00:00:11,550
in the USSR and what happened in China,

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:13,110
what happened in Nazi Germany,

4
00:00:13,111 --> 00:00:17,730
the more it became evident to me that
these weren't top down systems imposed by

5
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,370
tyrants on an unwilling
innocent population,

6
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:23,820
but decisions on the part of entire
cultures to go down a certain road.

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,190
Often the leaders were following,

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,710
which I would say it was
particularly the case with Hitler,

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,310
which isn't to deny him
his criminal culpability,

10
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:37,311
but Hitler was unbelievably good at
letting the crowd tell him what to say.

11
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,101
You know,

12
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:38,910
he was a,

13
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,060
he was a mirror for the crowd
and he was a good orator,

14
00:00:42,061 --> 00:00:43,620
but he paid attention to the crowd.

15
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:46,560
And so when he said something
that made everyone cheer,

16
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,370
you know,

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,910
they're dark hearts would come out in
the mob and cheer about something he said

18
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:53,340
that was say dramatic or vengeful.

19
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,510
Well then he'd say more of that and the
things that he said that were peaceful,

20
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:59,700
that produced no emotional
reaction from the crowd.

21
00:00:59,701 --> 00:01:00,900
He just said less of.

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,580
And so the crowd taught him over time
exactly what to sell them and that that

23
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:06,720
can be good in some sense.

24
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,130
If a leader does that carefully,

25
00:01:08,131 --> 00:01:12,450
that that means he's integrating what
the crowd wants with his style of

26
00:01:12,451 --> 00:01:12,991
leadership.

27
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:17,991
But it can be terrible if the mob is the
crowd and the mob is outraged and out

28
00:01:18,601 --> 00:01:19,434
for blood,

29
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,540
and that's what happened in Nazi Germany.

30
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,280
And so you can't blame it on Hitler.

31
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:24,540
That's just not reasonable.

32
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:28,920
It's distributed through
the entire population and
it's at the individual level

33
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:30,780
of analysis that's most significant.
