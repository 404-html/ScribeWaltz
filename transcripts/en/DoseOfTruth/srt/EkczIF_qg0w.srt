1
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:12,000
Three dogs after that says,

2
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:15,270
how should a manager use the preto
principle in his favorite work?

3
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:20,271
I find myself constantly focusing on the
bottom five 20% that causes 80 95% of

4
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:22,770
the team's poor performance.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:23,071
Oh,

6
00:00:23,071 --> 00:00:23,904
that's easy.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:25,380
The managerial literature,

8
00:00:25,381 --> 00:00:29,520
the solid managerial literature is
absolutely crystal clear on this.

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,380
Spend all your time with your highest
producers and put your lowest producers

10
00:00:34,381 --> 00:00:36,420
where they can do the
least amount of damage.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,070
The probability that as a manager you're
going to be able to solve the problems

12
00:00:41,071 --> 00:00:45,840
of the poorest five to 20%
of your work team is zero.

13
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:49,050
You just don't have the time or
the resources at your disposal.

14
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:54,410
So what you should jet definitely do
in order to increase performance is to

15
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:56,700
concentrate on your top performers.

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,560
I know that's not what managers do.

17
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:00,060
They do exactly what you say.

18
00:01:00,061 --> 00:01:04,890
They focus on the bottom five to 20% but
that's exactly the wrong thing to do as

19
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,724
a manager.

20
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:07,290
Focus on your best people.

21
00:01:07,291 --> 00:01:09,210
They're hyper productive
as you already know.

22
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,253
So,

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,303
um,

24
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:11,970
you know,

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,300
maybe you need to reconceptualize the
way that you're interacting with your

26
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:16,110
people,

27
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,990
but you should have regular conversations,

28
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:21,090
at least with those that
you think are outstanding.

29
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:22,350
Let them know that you really,

30
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,543
um,

31
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,110
what would you say that you're really
happy with their performance and see what

32
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:30,480
you can do to get obstacles
the hell out of their way.

33
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:32,160
Because as a manager,

34
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,300
essentially what you should be doing
is identifying the top performers and

35
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:39,300
they're doing everything you can to
clear out the obstacles in their path.

36
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,010
That's the right way to think about it.

37
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,320
And also to give yourself enough time
to develop a medium to longterm plan and

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,650
stop fighting fires on a day to day basis.

39
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:52,590
You need to at least 90 minutes a week
to think about where you want things to

40
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:54,450
be going into medium to long term.

41
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,620
So,

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:00,620
but I can't overemphasize the importance
of dealing with your top productivity.

43
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,233
You're top,

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,200
your highest,

45
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,120
your most productive people.

46
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,560
That's where all the gains are.

47
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,760
That's where all the games are.
