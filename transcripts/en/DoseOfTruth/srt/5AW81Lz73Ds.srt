1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:08,990
Oh,
the transhumanist would respond to that.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,100
You're just used to this idea of only
living 80,

3
00:00:13,101 --> 00:00:15,430
90 years and then you're done.
Uh,

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,850
that we would adjust to that.
Well,

5
00:00:16,851 --> 00:00:17,684
maybe

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,740
the other question would be who would be
the weed that would adjust to that?

7
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,840
Yes.
You would no longer okay to get there.

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:28,140
We would really no longer be human
there.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,030
The idea of the transhumanist and
singularitarian people is,

10
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,760
is truly,
you're not human anymore.

11
00:00:33,761 --> 00:00:37,570
We have brain,
like the cochlear implant for hearing is

12
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:40,280
a kind of brain transplant device.
Well,

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,940
they want to ramp that up and put chips
in your cortex and you'd hit said

14
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,230
essentially have Wikipedia in your
brain.

15
00:00:47,231 --> 00:00:50,490
It's for instant access and so and,
and so it,

16
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,410
it would truly bring new meaning to what
it means to be human.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:57,170
Right.
You could also argue that that's a form

18
00:00:57,171 --> 00:01:00,050
of death because if you transform
yourself,

19
00:01:00,051 --> 00:01:02,090
so without it,
you're unrecognizable.

20
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:05,150
Then what?
Where's the continuity with what you

21
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:06,740
once were?
You know,

22
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:09,830
this is one of the reasons I have some
real sympathy for many reasons.

23
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:12,650
I have many reasons for this,
but one of them that I have very much

24
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:13,820
sympathy for.
The idea,

25
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,780
the Christian idea that's that's
associated with the mortality of the

26
00:01:17,781 --> 00:01:21,710
resurrection of the body because the
Christians insisted that this is not

27
00:01:21,711 --> 00:01:25,790
some sort of abstract life like it's,
it's not uploaded into a computer.

28
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:29,060
It's not blowing out all of your
limitations.

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:29,810
Now,
you know,

30
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,990
you might ask what the resurrected body
would be and of course that's a

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,180
particularly,
that's a perfectly fine question,

32
00:01:35,181 --> 00:01:37,310
but it doesn't,
it doesn't.

33
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,260
That doesn't move you around the fact
that there was a question that was

34
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:48,530
really to be grappled with there because
what the Christians were trying to do

35
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:51,980
was to have their take and eat it too in
some sense and to say,

36
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:54,710
look,
there's some out salute utility to the

37
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:58,790
limitation that's imposed upon you by a
mortal frame.

38
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,920
Right.
That's the characteristic element of

39
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,720
being human and that perhaps there's a
way of having that in transcending it up

40
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:07,010
at the same time.
Now what that would look like is

41
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:07,844
obviously by,
right.

42
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,910
I deal with that and Evan's on her to
have a chapter on the soul and you know,

43
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,480
post Descartes,
Christians became more doulas before

44
00:02:15,481 --> 00:02:18,240
that they were more focused on the
physical resurrection of the body.

45
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,930
There are still some Christian sex today
who think that they'll physically be

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,560
resurrected but most more of them,
most of them are do list and it's just

47
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,600
your,
it's just this kind of nonphysical thing

48
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:31,440
that goes and,
and be and is with God and Jesus and so

49
00:02:31,441 --> 00:02:32,490
on.
Uh,

50
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:33,324
but,
but,

51
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:37,500
but they actually debate this
question of identity,

52
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:38,990
the problem with identity because he
say,

53
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:41,280
well,
if you're physically resurrected in

54
00:02:41,281 --> 00:02:42,990
heaven,
what's,

55
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,030
what's there?
How old are you?

56
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,250
And some of them actually have an
answer.

57
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:50,580
You're 30.
That's like the ideal age physically I

58
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:53,580
suppose mentally to be third and also
Jesus was 30

59
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:56,431
maybe.
Okay.

60
00:02:56,431 --> 00:02:57,310
So,
but,

61
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,090
but then the question is,
is know,

62
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,040
and I ask this question for the mindup
loaders and the transhumanist,

63
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:06,350
it's like there is no fixed self,
first of all,

64
00:03:06,351 --> 00:03:10,420
all your cells near the ad,
almost all the atoms in your body or

65
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,040
recycle about every decade or so.

66
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,560
So there is no defined physical self of
you.

67
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:18,460
You know that theses ship,
you replace all the wood and the ship,

68
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,390
we still call it.
It's the pattern structure.

69
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:23,920
That was Schrodinger's term,
right?

70
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,754
Yeah,
yeah,

71
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,300
yeah.
So,

72
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,400
okay,
so it's the pattern of information that

73
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:29,860
is your memories,
your memory cells,

74
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:30,880
memory cells.
Okay.

75
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,960
Yeah,
yeah.

76
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:32,830
Okay.
That's better.

77
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:35,320
But at what age?
You know,

78
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:38,680
because I have memories now that I
didn't have when I was 30 so what

79
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:42,220
happens if I'm resurrected at age 30
where's all the memories of my last,

80
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,560
I'm 63 now.
The last 33 years of memories of that.

81
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,160
I want those too.
And so just okay,

82
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:49,840
you can have all those memories,
but wait,

83
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,730
the memories I have now at 63 of when I
was 30 are very different than the

84
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:58,060
memories when I was 30 of of what I was
like at that time.

85
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,470
And so there's no fixed set of memories
even that represents you.

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,650
Cause those are constantly edited and
changed and reinterpret it.

87
00:04:05,651 --> 00:04:06,880
And it's like,
okay,

88
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:10,420
now I understand.
When I had that 10 years as a bike racer

89
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,600
in the 1980s I,
you know,

90
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:16,270
I was just sort of going through doing
my thing and now I see in context what

91
00:04:16,271 --> 00:04:18,730
that meant for my life.
But I didn't know it at the time.

92
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:22,240
That's true for everything we do.
That's why I always laugh when people

93
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,250
write memoirs in their twenties or
thirties.

94
00:04:24,251 --> 00:04:27,040
It's like how can you write a memoir?
You don't have no idea what you're doing

95
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,700
going now is going to meet in 30 years.
And so in religious,

96
00:04:30,701 --> 00:04:33,490
so both,
both scientific attempts at immortality

97
00:04:33,491 --> 00:04:35,920
mortality or the afterlife or whatever,
and religious,

98
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,470
they have the same problem.
Uh,

99
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,610
you know,
what is up there that's being

100
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:41,620
resurrected because there is no fixed
self.

101
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,900
It's a constantly dynamic changing
system.

102
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,410
And then there's one more problem that I
deal with the point of view self,

103
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:48,700
the Pov cells,
you know,

104
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,960
there's uni looking out through your
eyes and you Jordan go to sleep tonight.

105
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:55,410
You wake up tomorrow morning and you're
groggy for a few minutes but,

106
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,900
but your,
your point of view returns and you know

107
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:00,220
the,
the singularity people,

108
00:05:00,221 --> 00:05:00,641
they think,
well,

109
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:04,210
we'll copy all your memories and put
them in a computer and it will turn it

110
00:05:04,211 --> 00:05:06,850
on and you'll wake up and you'll,
you'll be looking out through the little

111
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:08,470
camera hold.
They're like Johnny Depp in

112
00:05:08,471 --> 00:05:11,080
transcendence and you'll be in there.
No,

113
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,650
I don't think so.
Why would your point of view all of a

114
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:19,330
sudden leap from your current body into
the computer in the same sense that

115
00:05:19,331 --> 00:05:22,930
instead of sacrificing your brain and
slicing it up and scanning,

116
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,140
this is the current thoughts scanning
every sinaps.

117
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,220
What if in a hundred years from now we
had a sophisticated Fmr I machine that

118
00:05:30,221 --> 00:05:34,200
could scan your brain and scan every
single synapse and reproduce it.

119
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,120
We had a computer big enough,
Moore's law doubling and so on.

120
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:41,980
It would be enough to just to reproduce
your entire connectome and turned it up,

121
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:45,730
but you're you Jordan Peterson,
he's still standing there right next to

122
00:05:45,731 --> 00:05:48,750
the computer and they turn it on.
You're not all of a sudden

123
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,230
the absolute,
well,

124
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,950
there's other problems with that too,
is that,

125
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:57,590
you know,
if I remember correctly,

126
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,160
you

127
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,790
have more neurons in your autonomic
nervous system then you have in your

128
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,900
central nervous system.

129
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,923
Well,

130
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,840
what are you going to do about this man?
And that isn't in your head,

131
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,300
not just your brain.
So you have an extended buddy,

132
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:16,420
so you ionics people,
they love up the head.

133
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:17,620
We're just going to clone your butt.
Okay,

134
00:06:17,621 --> 00:06:20,230
this is getting too complex,
but they really need the whole body.

135
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,670
Yes.
Well that's again,

136
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,030
that's the physical resurrection issue
is that the idea that,

137
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:28,100
and I think that you put your finger on
the floor in the,

138
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,190
in the,
in the,

139
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,230
in the new immortelle,
in the new immortality crowd.

140
00:06:32,231 --> 00:06:34,190
You know,
they think they really are [inaudible]

141
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,550
and they think of your consciousness is
something that's,

142
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,220
well,
they're confused about it in some sense

143
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:41,440
because they think of it as a kind of
soul,

144
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,680
which would be a pattern.
And that pattern is only instantiated in

145
00:06:44,681 --> 00:06:45,610
the brain.
It's like,

146
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,590
well,
physiologically that's just not the

147
00:06:47,591 --> 00:06:50,170
case.
It's like what about the hormones?

148
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:52,930
What about like there's a look,
there's a lot of things going on in the

149
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:57,130
brain that aren't easily reducible to
synaptic patterns,

150
