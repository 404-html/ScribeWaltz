1
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,610
So I was thinking the other day

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:12,753
about

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:14,853
numbers.

4
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:16,781
You know,

5
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:21,340
there are mathematicians who think
that there isn't anything more real,

6
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:22,180
the numbers.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,450
And that's an interesting proposition.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,800
I mean it's obviously the case that
once you invent or discover numbers that

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,750
that confers on you a tremendous power.

10
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:41,230
Who knows the limits of that power and

11
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,410
the claim that numbers are more real than
anything else is predicated in part on

12
00:00:48,781 --> 00:00:52,650
the fact that when you discover the marine
vent them and start to utilize them,

13
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,040
that your ability to operate
in the world expands immensely.

14
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:00,850
And,

15
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,050
and so that's one of the ways of judging
whether or not something is real is

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,690
whether or not when you use it,

17
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,070
that facilitates your means
of operating in the world.

18
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:13,733
Interestingly,

19
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:16,440
numbers are abstractions.

20
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,500
And so that raises another question,

21
00:01:19,501 --> 00:01:20,334
which is,

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:23,403
well,

23
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,090
what's more real?

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,930
The thing that's being abstracted
from or the abstractions.

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,371
And again,

26
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:34,480
that's not obvious.

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:35,860
Um,

28
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,290
and maybe the question of
more real isn't Germane.

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,420
Maybe it's a question of equal reality,

30
00:01:40,421 --> 00:01:44,860
but it's not obvious that abstractions
aren't real and you can make a damn

31
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:47,350
strong case that they're
more real than anything else.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,570
And so then you might ask yourself,

33
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,290
well then what are the
most real abstractions?

34
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,640
And so that's what I'm going
to start to talk about tonight.

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,410
I'm going to talk about it in
relationship to as many rules as I can

36
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,850
layout simultaneously.

37
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,800
I'll go through the rules first.

38
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:15,730
So rule one is stand up straight with
your shoulders back and rule two is treat

39
00:02:18,441 --> 00:02:23,441
yourself like you're someone
responsible for helping a number three,

40
00:02:24,291 --> 00:02:26,810
which is very tightly
associated with number two.

41
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,550
They're sort of variations on a theme is
make friends with those people who want

42
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,540
the best for you.

43
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,670
And by the way,

44
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:38,960
these last two rules aren't injunctions
designed to make your life easier.

45
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,680
They're actually injunctions designed
to make your life more difficult.

46
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,093
Um,

47
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,180
Kierkegaard said at one
point that his role in life,

48
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:52,280
given that everything was proceeding to
become easier and easier in all possible

49
00:02:52,281 --> 00:02:52,731
ways,

50
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:56,450
that there would come a time when
people would cry out for difficulty.

51
00:02:56,660 --> 00:03:00,220
And so that's partly how he
envisioned his role in the world.

52
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,990
Interestingly enough,

53
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,910
as a universal benefactor of mankind who
had strived to do nothing other than to

54
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:09,100
make life more difficult for everyone.

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,060
Right?

56
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,620
And so rule two and three are like that
because treat yourself as if you're

57
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:18,850
someone responsible for helping isn't
the same as be nice to yourself.

58
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,923
It's not that.

59
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,430
And to associate with people who want
the best for you means that they get to

60
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:26,050
demand the best from you.

61
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,300
And that's also not an easy thing.

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,750
Rule four is compare yourself to who you
were yesterday and not to someone else

63
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:35,403
is today.

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,390
And that's an injunction about envy,

65
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,830
right?

66
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,663
It's easy.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,920
You need people who you need things that
are above you because you need to do

68
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:46,570
something worthwhile with your life.

69
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:47,650
You need something to aim at.

70
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:52,330
But one of the consequences of that is
that you can become envious of people

71
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,740
that you believe have attained more
in a deserved or undeserved manner.

72
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,330
And that can make you better.

73
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,100
And so it's much better to
compare yourself to yourself
and to use yourself as

74
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:04,840
the target for improvement.

75
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,673
And comparison.

76
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,580
Rule five is don't let your children do
anything that makes you dislike them.

77
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:12,970
And the rule of thumb there
is if you dislike them,

78
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:18,030
then other people will and it's a bad
idea to allow your children to act in a

79
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:23,470
way that makes other children
dislike them or adults dislike them,

80
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,770
given that they're going to have to deal
with children and they're going to have

81
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:27,790
to deal with adults.

82
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:32,970
So your primary responsibility as a
parent is to help your child learn how to

83
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:38,281
behave so that the social world opens
up its arms to them and welcomes them at

84
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,370
every level and you've done your job.

85
00:04:42,371 --> 00:04:43,540
If you can manage that,

86
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,920
and it's not a simple thing to do,

87
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,130
rural six is put your house in perfect
order before you criticize the world and

88
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:56,221
that's not take no action for others
until you have your act together.

89
00:04:58,090 --> 00:04:59,650
That isn't what the rule means.

90
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,980
It means that bind your ambition with
humility and work on what's right in front

91
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:12,841
of you that you will suffer for if you
get wrong before you engage in the large

92
00:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,150
scale transformation of other people.

93
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:22,570
Rule seven is do what is meaningful
and not what is expedient.

94
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,970
And I would say in some sense,

95
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,500
in some sense,

96
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:30,160
that's the core ethos of the book,

97
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,680
not exactly because rule eight,

98
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:37,681
which is tell the truth or at least don't
lie as a necessary conjunction to that

99
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:40,120
are unnecessary additional element.

100
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,140
Because I don't think that you can pursue
what is meaningful without telling the

101
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:44,974
truth.

102
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:48,250
And the reason for that is if you don't
tell the truth or let's say if you lie,

103
00:05:48,251 --> 00:05:49,690
which is an easier way to think about it,

104
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,360
you corrupt the mechanisms,

105
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:57,361
the instinctual mechanisms that that
that manifest themselves as meaning and

106
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,420
then you can't trust them.

107
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:01,670
And that's a very bad idea.

108
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:07,010
So the fundamental reason to not
lie is because you corrupt your own

109
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:07,671
perceptions.

110
00:06:07,671 --> 00:06:10,400
If you lie and when you
corrupt your own perceptions,

111
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,200
then you can't rely on yourself.

112
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,880
And if you can't rely on yourself,

113
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:14,551
then well,

114
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:19,130
good luck to you because what are you
going to rely on in the absence of your

115
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:19,964
own judgment?

116
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:20,963
Here,

117
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,011
you've got nothing.

118
00:06:22,011 --> 00:06:22,430
If you,

119
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,140
if you lose that rule,

120
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,993
rule eight

121
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,663
is,

122
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:29,361
as I said,

123
00:06:29,361 --> 00:06:30,290
tell the truth or don't,

124
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,550
or at least don't lie.

125
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,593
Rule nine,

126
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,920
assume that the person that you're
listening to know something you don't.

127
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,790
And that's not so much a mark
of respect for the person,

128
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,820
although it is that it's a
mark of recognition of your
own unbearable ignorance.

129
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:46,760
You know,

130
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,760
one of the things you have to do in
life is decide whether you're more,

131
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,060
you have to make friends more with,

132
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:56,990
let me see,

133
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:57,530
let me just,

134
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,330
let me rephrase that properly.

135
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,540
You have to decide what's more important,

136
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,490
what you know or what you don't know.

137
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:05,961
First of all,

138
00:07:05,961 --> 00:07:07,520
there's a lot of what you don't know.

139
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,790
And so if you make friends with that,

140
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,050
if you decide that's important,

141
00:07:12,051 --> 00:07:15,290
then well that's a good thing because
you're going to be surrounded by what you

142
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:16,820
don't know your entire life.

143
00:07:16,821 --> 00:07:19,220
And so if you're appreciative of that,

144
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,650
then that's going to make
things go better for you.

145
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,843
But,

146
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,640
but the other element of that is,

147
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:26,811
well,

148
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:31,040
why should you be appreciative of what
you don't know and answer to that is,

149
00:07:31,041 --> 00:07:31,281
well,

150
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:31,791
you shouldn't.

151
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:36,680
If you're life is absolutely perfect in
every way you have exactly what you need

152
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:37,514
and want.

153
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,890
You've put everything in order around you,

154
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,300
then what you know is sufficient.

155
00:07:41,301 --> 00:07:46,301
But if you believe that things could
still be put right around you in your own

156
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:50,600
personal life and with regard to the
effect that you have another people,

157
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:54,500
then obviously what you don't yet know
is more important than what you do know.

158
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,280
And you should be paying attention to
find out what you don't know at every

159
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,300
possible moment.

160
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,990
And if you're fortunate when you have
a conversation with someone and you're

161
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,660
actually interested in what they say,

162
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:09,110
then even if they're not
very good at communicating,

163
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:12,560
even if they're awkward or even if
they display a certain amount of enmity

164
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:13,394
towards you,

165
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,420
there's always the possibility that
they might tell you something you don't

166
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:18,020
know,

167
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,850
in which case you can walk away from the
conversation less ignorant and corrupt.

168
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,640
Then you were when you
started the conversation.

169
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:29,690
And if your life isn't everything that
you would like it to be than being

170
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:34,691
slightly less ignorant and corrupt is
probably a good thing and so rule 10 is be

171
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:38,780
precise in your speech and that's,

172
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,430
that's an observation.

173
00:08:40,431 --> 00:08:45,431
I would say that that's a variant
of a new testament injunction,

174
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,873
which is,

175
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,680
or maybe a description of the nature of
the world which is knock and the door

176
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:54,050
will open and ask and you will receive,

177
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,140
which is a very strange theory let's say,

178
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,090
but which I would say is far more in
accordance with what we know about the

179
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:04,740
psychology of perception,

180
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,850
let's say.

181
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,230
Then you might imagine
because it is the case that

182
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:12,810
okay,

183
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,580
you don't get what you don't aim at.

184
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,470
You might get what you do a mat and
your aim might get better as you aim as

185
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:20,711
well,

186
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:22,000
which is something to consider.

187
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,123
Yeah.

188
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,190
If you specify the nature of the,

189
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,511
actually,

190
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:32,530
if you specify the nature of the being
that you want to bring into being,

191
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,860
then you radically increase the
probability that that's what will occur.

192
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:39,970
And of course you all know that because
you regard yourself at least to some

193
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:43,270
degree as active creative agents,

194
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:43,570
right?

195
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:48,570
Your fundamental attitude towards yourself
at at least in the manner that you

196
00:09:49,211 --> 00:09:54,160
act towards yourself is that you wake up
in the morning and you have a landscape

197
00:09:54,161 --> 00:09:59,161
of possibilities that lay themselves
open to you and you make choices between

198
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:03,760
those possibilities and determined in
consequence how the world is going to

199
00:10:03,761 --> 00:10:04,750
manifest itself.

200
00:10:04,751 --> 00:10:07,210
So you confront a field of potential.

201
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,740
That's a good way of thinking about it.

202
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:13,120
And through your choices you determine
which elements of that potential are

203
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:18,121
going to concretize them selves into
the real world and you are very unhappy

204
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,370
with yourself.

205
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,850
If you don't do that properly and
you're very unhappy with other people.

206
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:28,540
If they don't do that properly and you're
very unhappy with other people if they

207
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:33,541
don't treat you like that's what you're
like because part of what you demand

208
00:10:34,631 --> 00:10:39,631
from people let's say in terms of sheer
civility is that they act towards you is

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,470
if you're the locus of voluntary choice
in a world of potential and you are

210
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:45,940
braid each other for that as well.

211
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:48,790
If you have children and parents,

212
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,990
your parents will say to you,

213
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,960
if you're fortunate you're not
living up to your potential,

214
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:56,050
which is actually a compliment in a sense.

215
00:10:56,051 --> 00:11:01,051
Even though it's also a judgment and
the compliment is I know perfectly well

216
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,080
that you could be more than you are and
you'll hang your head if you have any

217
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:05,441
sense.

218
00:11:05,441 --> 00:11:09,340
And you'll think like you
think in relationship to
your own conscience that yes

219
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:13,240
I have a lot of potential that I'm
not fully realizing and that actually

220
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:17,710
constitutes a transgression
against the good and I don't,

221
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:21,370
I don't think I've ever met anyone
who doesn't believe that if you,

222
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:24,880
if you have a reasonable
conversation with them,

223
00:11:24,881 --> 00:11:27,580
it just seems self evident.

224
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:31,600
I mean maybe now and then you meet someone
who's narcissistically self satisfied

225
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:34,450
but then they're narcissistic
and that's not good.

226
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:34,991
That as a,

227
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:37,060
as a medium to long term strategy,

228
00:11:37,061 --> 00:11:39,580
that's a catastrophe
that ends in disaster.

229
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:40,301
You know,

230
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:41,260
it's a short term,

231
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:42,220
it protects people,

232
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:44,020
but long term it's,

233
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,640
it's not good in the least.

234
00:11:45,641 --> 00:11:47,650
And of course other people
know to appreciate it as well.

235
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:52,750
Rule 11 is don't bother children when
they're skateboarding and that's actually

236
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,820
a discussion of courage,

237
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,110
of encouragement more,

238
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:58,360
more specifically because I've,

239
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,610
I've been trying to
understand for example,

240
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,290
what role parents play in the lives of
their children and I would say this is a

241
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,124
role that,

242
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,730
that that is a fundamental importance
as well as attempting to guide your

243
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:17,041
children so that they act in a socially
desirable manner so that the world opens

244
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,070
itself up to them.

245
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,800
You also want to encourage them,

246
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,080
which is not the same as sheltering them.

247
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,970
It's not the same at all.

248
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:28,120
And to encourage someone
is to say something like,

249
00:12:28,121 --> 00:12:29,590
or to act out something like,

250
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,131
look,

251
00:12:30,131 --> 00:12:30,964
kid,

252
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,230
as you meet,

253
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,940
the world's already difficult because the
world isn't easy for children any more

254
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:37,121
than,

255
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,280
it's easy for adults that
the difficulties are,

256
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,570
they're not the same,

257
00:12:40,571 --> 00:12:42,100
their child's size difficulties,

258
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:43,720
but there are still difficulties.

259
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:49,560
The world is a very hard place and it's
a bitter place in many ways and it's not

260
00:12:50,381 --> 00:12:51,790
only a hard and bitter place.

261
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:56,230
It's also touched with betrayal and
malevolence and that's the fundamental

262
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:57,064
bottom line,

263
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,400
but there's something in you that is
capable of taking that full on and

264
00:13:03,731 --> 00:13:07,270
transcending it and that's encouragement.

265
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:07,931
You say,

266
00:13:07,931 --> 00:13:08,764
well,

267
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:13,770
as difficult as things are Europe to
the challenge and to interfere with

268
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,110
children when they're skateboarding,

269
00:13:17,111 --> 00:13:17,681
for example,

270
00:13:17,681 --> 00:13:18,514
when they're doing,

271
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,270
let's say in advisably dangerous things,

272
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:23,560
which kids of course do,

273
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,850
if they're skateboarding,

274
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,690
to interfere with that is to interfere
with the child's willingness to

275
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:36,550
voluntarily expose themselves to the
risks that they need to expose themselves

276
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:42,160
to in order to develop this sort of
competence that allows them to thrive in a

277
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,350
world they cannot be sheltered from.

278
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:50,760
And so to interfere with children when
they're taking necessary risks is not

279
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,510
love or empathy,

280
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:57,010
but cowardice on the part of parents
and it's deeply damaging to children.

281
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,440
And I can tell you as a
clinical psychologist,

282
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:04,470
I've never had a client come to
my office in all the hundreds in,

283
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,980
in all of the hundreds of encounters
I've had with people in my office,

284
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:13,810
I've never had a client say my
parents made me two independent,

285
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:15,790
right?

286
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,860
That hasn't happened once.

287
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:23,610
Right now my parents made me too dependent
or I conspired with my parents to

288
00:14:25,451 --> 00:14:27,550
perpetuate my dependence.

289
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,950
That happened all the time.

290
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,250
So there's a rule of thumb,

291
00:14:33,251 --> 00:14:34,330
which I think is a good one,

292
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,530
which I believe is often
applied to nursing homes by
people who work in nursing

293
00:14:38,531 --> 00:14:38,831
homes,

294
00:14:38,831 --> 00:14:40,630
which is of course a very difficult job.

295
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:45,370
And the rule is do not do anything
for anyone they can do for themselves.

296
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,850
And the reason for that is
that it's a form of theft,

297
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,051
right?

298
00:14:50,051 --> 00:14:50,411
You don't,

299
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,140
first of all,

300
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,680
you,

301
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,430
if you do something for someone and
it facilitates their movement forward,

302
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:58,490
then they moved forward
because you help them,

303
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:02,060
which is something I was very
careful about as a therapist.

304
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:05,480
I don't want to give my
clients advice first.

305
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,920
It might fail,

306
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,920
in which case they are
going to pay for my advice.

307
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,000
And second,

308
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,960
if it succeeds,

309
00:15:11,961 --> 00:15:14,640
then I get to be the successful one.

310
00:15:14,641 --> 00:15:17,660
And I don't want to steal
the success from my clients.

311
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,010
That's a bad idea.

312
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,170
I want to help them figure out what it
is that they should aim at and then help

313
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:26,210
plot out a strategy for attaining that.

314
00:15:26,211 --> 00:15:26,600
And,

315
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,051
but I,

316
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,360
I,

317
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,800
I want to ensure that it's their destiny,

318
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,870
not something I'm imposing.

319
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,620
And of course the imposition of that
sort of thing is the hallmark of a bad,

320
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,570
I would say therapeutic relationship,

321
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:41,420
but also a bad relationship period.

322
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:42,381
Right?

323
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:45,170
So one of the things you want
to do with your partners,

324
00:15:45,171 --> 00:15:45,831
your spouse,

325
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:46,221
your say,

326
00:15:46,221 --> 00:15:48,920
your husband or wife and
also with your children,

327
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:53,270
is to listen to them so that you can
figure out what their problems are and

328
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:56,120
figure out with them because they're
going to figure that out by communicating

329
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:59,960
and then perhaps aid them in
the development of a strategy.

330
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:04,730
But you have to ensure very carefully
that you're not imposing your own

331
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,480
structure in a manner that's going to
steal from them what's rightfully theirs.

332
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,030
So well,

333
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,040
so rule 11 is an injunction to
courage as the fundamental cause.

334
00:16:18,141 --> 00:16:18,651
You could say,

335
00:16:18,651 --> 00:16:18,801
well,

336
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,140
what's the antidote to
the catastrophe of life?

337
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,090
And one answer might be safety.

338
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:23,841
It's like,

339
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:24,111
well,

340
00:16:24,111 --> 00:16:24,381
you know,

341
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:24,800
look,

342
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,800
everyone's sensible enough to know that
a certain amount of provision for safety

343
00:16:29,811 --> 00:16:30,440
is,

344
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,310
is worthwhile.

345
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:34,940
You should probably wear your seat belts
when you're driving around in your car

346
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:37,700
because why take foolhardy risks.

347
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,480
But given that there
is no security in life,

348
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,100
in the final analysis,

349
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:48,140
then encouragement is a much
better medication than sheltering.

350
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,023
And so,

351
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,343
and that,

352
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,190
that's,

353
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:57,190
that's I think in keeping with the idea
that what life is essentially is not a

354
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:01,850
place to attain happiness or
even to aim for happiness,

355
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,940
even though you should be grateful
if someone comes along now and then,

356
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,280
but a call to something like adventure.

357
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,970
And I think that's the proper
way of conceptualizing it.

358
00:17:10,971 --> 00:17:13,400
Certainly if you go watch a story,

359
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:13,851
a movie,

360
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:14,870
you read a book,

361
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,891
something like that.

362
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:18,800
If you encounter a
narrative that's gripping,

363
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,220
whether it's a romance or
a classic adventure story,

364
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:25,880
then the element of it that's
gripping is the adventure.

365
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,050
And so to portray life is
an adventure in romance and,

366
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,330
and in the world is the
proper way to portray it.

367
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,730
And the way that you

368
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,770
facilitate the adventure
is through encouragement.

369
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:41,810
I had a client once,

370
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:42,621
I really liked him.

371
00:17:42,621 --> 00:17:43,520
He was a good guy.

372
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,403
He's smart guy,

373
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,100
good looking young guy,

374
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,110
had everything going for him.

375
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,830
You know,

376
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,740
he's good musician.

377
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:50,970
He was a talented athlete.

378
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,343
Um,

379
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:53,950
yeah,

380
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,300
but he hadn't been encouraged.

381
00:17:55,301 --> 00:17:56,134
I wouldn't say,

382
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:57,303
yeah.

383
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,880
He told me about his
relationship with his girlfriend.

384
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:00,330
He said,

385
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,163
Huh?

386
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,320
His girlfriend wanted to go
biking around southern Ontario.

387
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:12,160
She was about 19 or 20 and he thought
he might join her and when she went and

388
00:18:12,261 --> 00:18:13,430
talked to her parents,

389
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,300
they made every provision possible to
help her prepare for the journey to make

390
00:18:19,311 --> 00:18:20,630
sure her bike was in good shape,

391
00:18:20,631 --> 00:18:23,750
to make sure she had the right
equipment to help her plot out a route.

392
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,880
And when he went and
talked to his parents,

393
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:30,050
all they did was worried that he was
going to get hurt and like he might get

394
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:30,884
hurt because

395
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:31,930
yeah,

396
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,830
people get hurt,

397
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,443
but

398
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,250
okay.

399
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:38,160
They didn't understand that they were
choosing between the hurt that he might

400
00:18:38,161 --> 00:18:40,800
encounter by going out in the
world and having an adventure,

401
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:44,760
let's say with his girlfriend or the hurt
that he would encounter by staying at

402
00:18:44,761 --> 00:18:45,570
home,

403
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:50,160
cowering in his basement under the
protection of his over loving parents.

404
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:50,581
Well,

405
00:18:50,581 --> 00:18:53,160
his girlfriend ventured
bravely into the world.

406
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:53,791
You think,

407
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:53,941
well,

408
00:18:53,941 --> 00:18:56,490
which of those two things is
most likely to be damaging?

409
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,690
And their answer to that is,

410
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,141
well,

411
00:18:58,141 --> 00:19:00,230
his parents wouldn't
worry as much as if he,

412
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:05,070
if he was in the basement and that's
the wrong worry even because they should

413
00:19:05,071 --> 00:19:05,940
worry more,

414
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,643
not less.

415
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,590
So in rural 12 his pedicab,

416
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,640
when you encounter one
on the street and it's

417
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,073
oddly enough,

418
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,090
a meditation on fragility,

419
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:24,620
it's a discussion of what you do when
you don't know what to do and that's

420
00:19:24,631 --> 00:19:27,270
really when things have
gone badly for you.

421
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,860
When you face a terrible tragedy in your
own personal life or in your familiar

422
00:19:31,861 --> 00:19:33,840
life or perhaps even in
the life of your community,

423
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:36,450
when things come crowding
in and you too quickly,

424
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,160
in the case of a death in the family or
a terrible illness or the collapse of a

425
00:19:41,161 --> 00:19:46,161
dream or any of the things that can flip
your world upside down is how do you

426
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:47,041
cope with that?

427
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:52,041
And that chapter contains discussion
of the necessity of narrowing your

428
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,110
timeframe.

429
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:55,891
You know,

430
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:59,670
because sometimes the right way to
look at the world is across years and

431
00:19:59,671 --> 00:20:01,170
sometimes it's across months.

432
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:03,570
And when things are more out of control,

433
00:20:03,571 --> 00:20:05,520
perhaps it's across days.

434
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,290
And when things are really,

435
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:08,910
when you're really up against the wall,

436
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:11,880
it's across hours or even minutes.

437
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,770
And during those minutes
then you concentrate on
doing as well as you can with

438
00:20:16,771 --> 00:20:21,180
what's right in front of
you for the longest unit of
time that you can tolerate,

439
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,410
conceptualize it.

440
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,740
Maybe that's what you do
at someone's deathbed.

441
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,990
And while you're doing that
and suffering away madly,

442
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,100
then you also take the time to
appreciate everything you can.

443
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,420
That manifests itself,

444
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,790
that allows itself to be appreciated.

445
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,280
And so that's the metaphor of the cat,

446
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,300
I suppose.

447
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,220
And so that's the 12 rules.

448
00:20:41,221 --> 00:20:43,080
And I'll return to rule one,

449
00:20:43,081 --> 00:20:45,360
which is stand up straight
with your shoulders back.

450
00:20:45,361 --> 00:20:50,130
And I'm going to use it as a platform
for laying out the abstractions that I

451
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:53,160
talked to at the beginning of the lecture.

452
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:53,880
So.
