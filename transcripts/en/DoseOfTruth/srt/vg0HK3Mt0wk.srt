1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,350
Could you hazard a guess when you're up
is clamping down on speech critical of

2
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:13,680
Islam when you slam is causing
lots of problems with rape,

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:14,041
gangs,

4
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:14,641
terrorism,

5
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,020
and generally being a menace?

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,153
Why?

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,151
Well,

8
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:21,180
I suppose if there's,

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:22,903
um,

10
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,750
let's say if I was going
to oppose that statement,

11
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:28,321
I would say,

12
00:00:28,321 --> 00:00:31,470
well perhaps it's a propagandistic,

13
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:33,093
uh,

14
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,870
what would you call it,

15
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:39,870
conspiracy to blame what's happening
in Europe on Islamic immigrants?

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,540
I guess part of the problem is,

17
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:43,110
is that,

18
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,390
at least as far as I can tell,

19
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,420
the news has become
sufficiently unreliable because
it's so polarized that we

20
00:00:48,421 --> 00:00:50,070
can't really tell what's going on.

21
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:51,240
I mean,

22
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:56,240
I think the reason that Europe is clamping
down on speech critical of Islam is

23
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,770
partly the same reason that the entire
Western world is clamping down on speech.

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,760
That's critical of anything that
is associated with group identity,

25
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,670
which is pretty much any set
of ideas that unites people.

26
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:10,050
And it's,

27
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,460
it's a consequence of the collective
decision that we've made that

28
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,250
egalitarianism and,

29
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:18,120
uh,

30
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,200
conflict avoidance constitute the two
highest virtues and they Trump everything

31
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,760
else including free speech.

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:25,740
Now why that's happened?

33
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:27,331
It's very,

34
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,950
very difficult thing to say.

35
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:29,784
I mean,

36
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,660
um,

37
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,680
I suspect to some degree that it's a
consequence of women becoming involved in

38
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:35,700
the political system,

39
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,960
which is something that we've never
experienced before and women are more

40
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:40,794
agreeable

41
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,530
by nature then man and,

42
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,270
and variable people are,

43
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,790
are compassionate towards those,

44
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,540
they see a suffering and that
seems to include any minority,

45
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,910
especially when you combine that with
the kind of neo Marxist doctrine,

46
00:01:54,911 --> 00:01:58,140
the claims that anyone who
has an advantage swiped it.

47
00:01:58,141 --> 00:02:02,700
And I think in the Islamic situation
you'd get a real conflict there because

48
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,010
it's obviously the case that many Islamic
practices are not commensurate with

49
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:11,430
postmodern neo Marxist feminism let's say.

50
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,050
But they seem to get a free pass.

51
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:18,051
And I guess that's because the idea
that all cultures are equal trumps the

52
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,870
requirement for human rights for women.

53
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:22,750
And,

54
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,750
and maybe the other thing that's even
darker is that there's a fair bit of

55
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:33,021
revolutionary fervor in the more radical
end of the left political spectrum.

56
00:02:33,351 --> 00:02:37,620
And that radical server is devoted
towards tearing down the patriarchy.

57
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:40,200
And of course that's basically
Western civilization.

58
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:41,670
And so if,

59
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,880
because Islam isn't part
of Western civilization,

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,850
then it can be seen as an ally in that,

61
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,050
in that attempt.

62
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:49,590
Um,

63
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,850
that's what it looks like to me.

64
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,110
Um,

65
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,943
I also think,

66
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,340
you know,

67
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,360
that ignorance and,

68
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,010
and all of that contribute,

69
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,890
it isn't obvious that people who

70
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,630
are afraid of such things as Islamophobia
really understand anything about

71
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,200
Islam.

72
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,480
I wouldn't say I understand
anything about Islam,

73
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,070
even though I've read a fair bit about it,

74
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:13,450
it's very difficult to put yourself
inside a different belief system.

75
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:18,930
I'm somewhat apprehensive about Islam
because it looks to me like it's a

76
00:03:20,111 --> 00:03:25,111
totalizing system as well as a religion
and it's a totalizing system because

77
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,330
everything has to come under its purview,

78
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,970
including law and,

79
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,903
and,

80
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,490
um,

81
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,900
everything that goes along with that.

82
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,090
There's no separation
between church and state.

83
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:38,560
And so I don't see how that's commensurate
with a western moment of existence.

84
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:42,310
And I don't think people want to have
that conversation because they want to

85
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:42,551
say,

86
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:43,384
well,

87
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:43,931
no,

88
00:03:43,931 --> 00:03:46,180
everyone diverse as they are.

89
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:50,470
And important as that diversity is
apparently such that everyone has to be

90
00:03:50,471 --> 00:03:51,580
represented equally.

91
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:56,800
The diversity isn't really of anything
about anything fundamental and we can all

92
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:58,660
get along without a problem.

93
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,460
And,

94
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,293
um,

95
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,270
I'm afraid that that's
extraordinarily naive.

96
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,140
And then I suppose there's also an
element of something like Western guilt,

97
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:15,670
I guess perhaps for what has been
described as our imperialists past.

98
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,243
Um,

99
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,243
the,

100
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,410
there's been a very longterm assault

101
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,383
on,

102
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,830
on the,

103
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:24,870
what would you call moral

104
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,390
on the morality of the West.

105
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,530
We're often viewed as the rapers
and pillagers of the world.

106
00:04:31,531 --> 00:04:34,130
And that sort of goes along
with the environmentalist ethos.

107
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:38,520
And so I think we do have a
fair bit of guilt about that,

108
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,080
whether it's warranted or not.

109
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,340
Um,

110
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,850
I mean,

111
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,670
history is a bloody nightmare and
it doesn't matter where you look.

112
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,810
And I would say at least the West
has brought advantages along with its

113
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:49,890
disadvantages.

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:50,790
Um,

115
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,710
and I think that our attitude towards
individuality is fundamentally correct and

116
00:04:55,711 --> 00:04:56,970
absolutely vital.

117
00:04:56,971 --> 00:05:00,870
And I would also say that
the only countries in the
world that are essentially

118
00:05:00,871 --> 00:05:01,710
worth living in,

119
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,000
in any real sense are the ones that
are predicated on the Judeo Christian

120
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,470
tradition and manifested in
western the western body of laws.

121
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,843
So,

122
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,780
but there's still plenty of guilt
and there's plenty of people who,

123
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,131
well,

124
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:17,964
who are,

125
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,550
what contemptuous of being as we
discussed in the last question,

126
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:27,330
and also angry with the political system
because they're powerless or maybe

127
00:05:27,331 --> 00:05:30,030
they'd been hurt by
male authority figures.

128
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:30,930
Um,

129
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,340
and that happens very frequently.

130
00:05:32,341 --> 00:05:37,341
And so they have absolutely no trust
in higher in hierarchical structures.

131
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:42,981
And there you might add to that to certain
amount of laziness because the thing

132
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:46,620
about hierarchical structures is
that they impose values on people.

133
00:05:46,621 --> 00:05:49,350
And then in order to progress in
that value structure that you have to

134
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:51,480
discipline yourself and work hard,

135
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:55,830
and many of the radical leftists happened
to be very low in conscientiousness.

136
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:00,710
And so they don't in hard work and they
don't believe that people get to where

137
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:02,060
they're going by hard work.

138
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,830
And then,

139
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,341
well,

140
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,001
one other thing,

141
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:08,540
there's a group of people I think who
are basically personality disordered.

142
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:12,680
And those are the ones that have never
had a positive relationship with anything

143
00:06:12,681 --> 00:06:13,700
that was masculine.

144
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:17,840
And so whenever they see anything
masculine that has motive power,

145
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:20,240
and that would include
authority and competence,

146
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,500
not just power,

147
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,320
they assume that that's tyrannical.

148
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,770
And it's part of the postmodern
assumption that all power higher,

149
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,020
all hierarchies are hierarchies of power.

150
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,720
When the truth of the matter is,

151
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:35,720
is that hierarchies in the West are
usually hierarchies of authority and

152
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:36,554
competence.

153
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,371
And they're like,

154
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:40,760
they're oriented towards getting a
certain task done and they actually do get

155
00:06:40,761 --> 00:06:41,660
the task done,

156
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,670
but were dubious about our own ethical.

157
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,633
Um,

158
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,073
what would you say?

159
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,293
Integrity.

160
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:57,350
And I guess that's also why it's a
particular importance for people to try to

161
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,220
act on asleep.

162
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:00,440
Because if you don't act honestly,

163
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:04,280
and then you start to doubt your own
integrity and then when people come after

164
