1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,320
So the question was,
um,

2
00:00:01,820 --> 00:00:06,380
positive emotions mediated by dopamine.
When you're advancing towards something,

3
00:00:06,381 --> 00:00:08,060
say,
or when you have a cue that something

4
00:00:08,061 --> 00:00:11,390
good is about to happen,
what is the system that mediates

5
00:00:11,391 --> 00:00:13,730
positive emotion at the satiation level?

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:19,800
Yup.
Yup.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,560
Okay.
Okay.

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,290
Well,
let's start with the satiation issue

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,960
that seems most deregulated by
Serotonin.

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,160
The opiate issue is there are other
forms of specific reward that don't seem

11
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:36,920
to be merely motivated or merely
underpinned by dopamine.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,080
And the opiate system would be one of
those.

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,260
There's an oxytocin system as well.
So there are other biochemical systems

14
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:47,870
that are involved in more specific forms
of reward.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,200
But the thing that's common among
instances that make it appear that

16
00:00:55,341 --> 00:00:57,440
you're moving forward is the
dopaminergic element,

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:02,150
roughly speaking.
And then one of the things that happens

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,180
if you're higher in Serotonin because
you're more dominant,

19
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,130
is that you're more satiated all the
time.

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,150
That's why people who are low in the
dominance hierarchy with decreased

21
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:16,151
levels of Serotonin are more impulsive
and also more emotionally dysregulated.

22
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:18,980
They're more impulsive because,
hey,

23
00:01:18,981 --> 00:01:20,870
you take your positive thing when you
can get it.

24
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:22,800
Okay.

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,720
And so they're,
they're more dissatisfied.

26
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:28,650
They're more looking for anything that
will produce a positive outcome.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:34,260
And then they're also more likely to
experience diffused negative emotion.

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,740
Partly because their serotonin systems
are lower,

29
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,490
indicating their tenuous status in the
dominance hierarchy.

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,200
Meaning that everything they do that's
uncertain is far more dangerous.

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,670
So this is also why it's very difficult
often when you're trying to treat

32
00:01:51,671 --> 00:01:54,010
someone who's depressed.
Because you could say there's not much

33
00:01:54,011 --> 00:01:58,660
difference between being depressed and
existing in the biochemical state.

34
00:01:58,661 --> 00:02:01,540
That being at the bottom of the
dominance hierarchy would produce.

35
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,290
In fact they're the same thing.
Well then the question is,

36
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,760
are you depressed or are you just at the
bottom of a dominance hierarchy?

37
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,980
Because those are not that like the,
the symptomatology is very,

38
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:19,030
very similar.
But the cause and the cure are not the

39
00:02:19,031 --> 00:02:20,590
same.
You know,

40
00:02:20,591 --> 00:02:23,320
cause you might be at the bottom of the
dominant Turkey because you're just,

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,540
everything about your life is ruined.
So,

42
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:29,640
and of course your suffering.
Are you depressed?

43
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,370
No,
not exactly.

44
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,880
You just have nowhere to go.
So

45
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,830
other questions?
Yes.

46
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,450
Pursue Muller.
They don't produce this residence.

47
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,590
Okay.
So the question is,

48
00:02:51,591 --> 00:02:54,200
why don't,
why do people pursue rewards that don't

49
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:57,710
produce this resonance?
They don't have a value hierarchy.

50
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,090
So pleasure.
It's a good example.

51
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,640
Those kids that were brought there were
lost.

52
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,430
So they didn't,
they didn't have anywhere to go.

53
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:11,431
They didn't have an identity.
So they default to local pleasure,

54
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:16,120
and that's better than none.
Although the problem with local

55
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:18,550
pleasure,
wild as the narrative made clearer is

56
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:22,120
that you better look out if you're
impulsive because it's going to kick

57
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:24,910
back on your heart.
And the reason is you're only

58
00:03:24,911 --> 00:03:28,060
considering the immediate timeframe.
And the problem is,

59
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:31,070
is that things propagate across all the
timeframes.

60
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,250
And so just because something works
really well,

61
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:37,990
this second cocaine for example,
doesn't mean that it's a tenable

62
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:42,160
solution to the class of all problems.
So usually,

63
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:47,340
often people pursue local pleasure
because that's the best they can

64
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:48,640
imagine.

65
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,880
It's the best they've been taught.
They don't see another alternative.

66
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,650
So it could be ignorance.
It can be,

67
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,710
they don't want to adopt the
responsibility because part of the

68
00:03:56,711 --> 00:04:01,420
problem with working at every level of
the hierarchy simultaneously is that

69
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,740
it's,
it's,

70
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,890
well,
it's like dancing to a very complex

71
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:07,120
waltz,
let's say.

72
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:11,050
You have to be paying attention to a
very large number of things

73
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,470
simultaneously and doing things right.
It requires responsibility.

74
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,990
And so you know,
that's,

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,040
it's a pain.
It's a weight.

76
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,030
Part of the reason people drink alcohol
is to get rid of their responsibility.

77
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,080
I mean that's,
you know,

78
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,230
you hear people drink because they have
problems.

79
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:29,801
It's like,
yeah,

80
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:30,700
yeah,
no.

81
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,560
Some people drink because they're
anxious and alcoholics drink because

82
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,710
they're in withdrawal.
But young people drink because they're

83
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,010
sick and tired of being responsible
because it's annoying.

84
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,570
It's like,
so I'll drink enough.

85
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:46,990
I won't care about the medium to
longterm consequences because alcohol,

86
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:51,280
that's exactly what alcohol does.
It doesn't make you ignorant of the

87
00:04:51,281 --> 00:04:54,790
medium to longterm consequences,
but it makes you not care about them.

88
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:57,160
And partly it's because it dampens
anxiety,

89
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,220
so it dampens anxiety,
leaves your positive emotion circuits

90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,290
intact.
So then you can go out there and do

91
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,640
stupid,
fun things.

92
00:05:03,641 --> 00:05:05,260
And that's like,
that's a party really.

93
00:05:05,261 --> 00:05:07,660
Let's go do stupid fun things.
That's a party.

94
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:12,220
But the medium to longterm consequences
are,

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,050
it's risky.
It doesn't mean you shouldn't do it,

96
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,420
but it's risky.
So yeah,

97
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:22,720
they don't know better.
That's the answer I would say.

98
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,270
So yes.

99
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,180
Well,
if you're talking about responsibility,

100
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:33,430
it seems like that
balance of person to a certain frame.

101
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,540
Now that's why conservatives and
liberals don't get along

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,100
because conservatives do bind themselves
to a particular frame and they're

103
00:05:43,101 --> 00:05:46,790
conscientious and low and openness.
And the Liberals say,

104
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,070
doesn't that just bind you to a
particular frame?

105
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,390
And it's like,
yeah,

106
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,470
that that's,
it does.

107
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,470
And that's a problem.
So yes,

108
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:57,830
but in terms of being aware of the
multiple levels,

109
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,560
um,
it takes within a frame,

110
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:05,650
it takes a certain amount of tolerance
of the unbearable present for that to

111
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,450
reach the edge of that frame,
to force a person to see a different

112
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:13,250
frame.
Because that's something that sentence.

113
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,480
Yes.
And that's,

114
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:18,000
that's actually where I stopped today
because that's a,

115
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,660
that's exactly right.
So you're,

116
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,410
you're,
it's good because both the questions you

117
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,960
asked indicated that you're sort of at
the next step in the,

118
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,840
in the logic process.
Cause you asked about the relationship

119
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:28,170
between these frames with,
with,

120
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,500
you know,
in relationship to one another and that

121
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:31,810
is the next issue.
It's like

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,820
there's something about responsibility
and individuality,

123
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,500
but I'm curious about responsibility
implies a connection to other people.

124
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:39,800
Okay.

125
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,230
Well what are the things,
one of the things we are going to talk

126
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:46,310
about in the classes is how you address
the problem that you just described,

127
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:49,280
which is that this is the Peter Pan
Story,

128
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,310
roughly speaking is Peter Pan is this
magical boy pan means pan is the god of

129
00:06:55,161 --> 00:06:56,780
everything roughly speaking.
Right.

130
00:06:56,781 --> 00:07:01,610
And so it's not an accident that he has
the name Pat and he's the boy that won't

131
00:07:01,611 --> 00:07:04,700
grow up and he's magical.
Well that's because children are

132
00:07:04,701 --> 00:07:06,110
magical.
They can be anything.

133
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,270
They're nothing but potential.
And Peter Pan doesn't want to give that

134
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,320
up.
Why?

135
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,510
Well,
he's got some adults around them,

136
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:18,620
but the main adult is captain hook.
Well who the hell wants to grow up to be

137
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:19,454
captain?
Hark.

138
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,020
First of all,
you've got a hook.

139
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,920
Second year a tyrant and third you're
chased by the dragon of chaos with a

140
00:07:27,171 --> 00:07:28,970
clock in its stomach,
right?

141
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,860
The crocodile,
it's already got a piece of view.

142
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,470
Well that's what happens when you get
older.

143
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,850
Time has already got a piece of you and
eventually it's got a taste for you and

144
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:42,350
eventually it's going to eat you.
And so hook is so traumatized by that

145
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:47,351
that he can't help but be a tyrant.
And then Peter Pan looks out traumatized

146
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:48,890
Herc and says,
well no,

147
00:07:48,891 --> 00:07:50,930
I'm not sacrificing my childhood for
that.

148
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:53,930
So that's fine,
except he ends up killing in lost boys.

149
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,060
It never loud.
Well,

150
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:59,330
Neverland doesn't exist and who the hell
wants to be king of the lost boys?

151
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:03,620
And he also sacrifices the possibility
that to help it real relationship with a

152
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:06,020
woman,
because that's Wendy Wright and she's

153
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:10,670
kind of conservative middle class London
dwelling girl.

154
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,680
She wants to grow up and have kids and
have a life.

155
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:15,830
She accepts her mortality,
she accepts her maturity.

156
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,310
Peter Pan has to contend himself with
Tinkerbell.

157
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,040
She doesn't even exist.
She's like,

158
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:27,320
she's like the fairy of porn.
She doesn't exist.

159
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,280
She's the substitute for the real thing.
And so,

160
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,200
but the dichotomy that you're talking
about,

161
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:37,610
it's very tricky because there's a
sacrificial element in maturation,

162
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,700
right?
You have to sacrifice the pleura

163
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:45,701
potentiality of childhood for the
actuality of a frame.

164
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,170
And the question is,
well,

165
00:08:48,171 --> 00:08:49,280
why would you do that?
Well,

166
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:51,830
one reason is it happens to you whether
you do it or not,

167
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,380
you can either choose your damn
limitation

168
00:08:55,890 --> 00:09:00,890
or you can let it take you unaware when
you're 30 or even worse when you're 40

169
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,250
and then that is not a happy day.
You see,

170
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,590
I see people like this,
and I think it's more and more common in

171
00:09:07,591 --> 00:09:11,610
our culture because people can put off
Matt maturity without suffering and

172
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:12,570
immediate penalty.

173
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,540
But all that happens is the penalty
accrues.

174
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,820
And then when it finally hits,
it just wallops you.

175
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,400
Because when you're 25 you could be an
idiot.

176
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:24,150
It's no problem.
Even when you're out in a job search,

177
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:24,481
it's like,
well,

178
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:26,330
you don't have any experience in.
You're kind of clueless.

179
00:09:26,331 --> 00:09:26,651
It's,
yeah,

180
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:27,420
yeah,
you're young.

181
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,350
You know?
It's no problem.

182
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:30,030
We can,
that's what young people are like,

183
00:09:30,031 --> 00:09:31,680
but they're full of potential.
Okay,

184
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:35,790
well now you're the same person at 30
it's like people aren't so thrilled

185
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,000
about you at that point.
It's like what the hell have you been

186
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:39,750
doing for the last 10 years?
Well,

187
00:09:39,751 --> 00:09:42,280
I'm just as clueless as I was when I was
22 it's,

188
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,050
yeah,
but you're not 22 you're an old infant.

189
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,380
Right?
And that's an ugly thing and old infant.

190
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,320
So they,
the reason,

191
00:09:52,321 --> 00:09:57,321
part of the reason you choose your damn
sacrifice because the sacrifice is

192
00:09:57,691 --> 00:10:00,270
inevitable,
but at least you get to choose it.

193
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,110
And then there's something that's even
more complex than that in some sense is

194
00:10:04,111 --> 00:10:09,111
that the problem with being a child is
that all you are is potential and it's

195
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:12,000
really low resolution.
You could be anything but you're not

196
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:15,000
anything.
So then you go and you do adopt an

197
00:10:15,001 --> 00:10:17,370
apprenticeship,
roughly speaking,

198
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,550
and then you become at least you become
something.

199
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,730
And when you're something that makes the
world opened up to you again.

200
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,670
You know,
like if you're a really good plumber,

201
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:29,430
then you end up being far more than a
plumber,

202
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,080
right?
You end up being a good employer.

203
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,130
Not,
not that plumbers,

204
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,130
I'm not putting plumbers town.
It's like more power to plumbers.

205
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,630
They've saved more lives than doctors.
So hygiene,

206
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:41,240
right?
So you know,

207
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,650
if you're a really good plumber,
well then you have some employees,

208
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,610
you run a business,
you,

209
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,650
you,
you make you,

210
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,210
you train some other people,
you enlarge their lives.

211
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,800
You're kind of a pillar of the
community.

212
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:51,190
You,
you have your family.

213
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:52,320
It's,
you can,

214
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:56,490
once you pass through that narrow
training period,

215
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,880
which narrows you and constricts you and
develops you at the same time,

216
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:03,720
then you can come out the other end with
a bunch of new possibility at hell at

217
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:06,000
hand.
And you haven't talked about that.

218
00:11:06,001 --> 00:11:11,001
A thought that the proper part of the
proper path of development in the last

219
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,640
half of life was to rediscover the child
that you left behind as you were

220
00:11:16,981 --> 00:11:21,060
apprenticing.
And so then you get to be something and

221
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,120
regain that potential at the same time.
Very,

222
00:11:24,121 --> 00:11:25,470
very smart.
While he was very,

223
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,080
very smart.
So that's very wise,

224
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,480
very wise thing to know.
