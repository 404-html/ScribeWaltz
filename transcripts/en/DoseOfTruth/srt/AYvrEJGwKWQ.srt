1
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:11,840
There was one very important thing that
had happened to me when I was 16 years

2
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:12,111
old.

3
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:14,360
Even though I was almost an
unpopular kid in my school.

4
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,340
They voted me for two years in a row,

5
00:00:16,341 --> 00:00:18,140
the chairman of the programming committee,

6
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:22,670
which means I ran student assemblies
five days a week and I program to a week.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,630
Um,

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:25,340
so I was the emcee for these things.

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,990
And one day that you,

10
00:00:26,991 --> 00:00:30,110
did you manage that and
simultaneously be unpopular?

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:31,070
Uh,

12
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:32,060
that's a good question.

13
00:00:32,061 --> 00:00:33,850
I think my school had verily very,

14
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,180
my stool was school,

15
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:39,650
was founded by an Acolyte of John
Dewey and he was behind the scenes are

16
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:42,200
actually setting the school up and it,

17
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:42,681
you know,

18
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:44,930
schools have their popularity positions,

19
00:00:44,931 --> 00:00:45,471
president,

20
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:46,340
vice president,

21
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,031
secretary,

22
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:47,810
treasurer,

23
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:48,590
all of that.

24
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,680
But my school was clever enough to start
putting functional teams committees

25
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:56,160
together in your very
first days at school,

26
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,440
your very first days
of your freshman year.

27
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:00,310
Now when you,

28
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,510
when you have kids vote for president and
vice president the garden and vote for

29
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:07,000
the most popular kid in the
school as the precedent,

30
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:08,440
the second most popular kid,

31
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,340
his vice president,

32
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,560
the most popular girl as secretary,

33
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:13,540
and the most popular Jewish treasurer.

34
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,130
That's just the way it goes.

35
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,253
Um,

36
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,930
so I was never a line for
any of those positions.

37
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:20,700
I had no popularity whatsoever.

38
00:01:20,701 --> 00:01:21,151
In fact,

39
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:25,770
one of my classmates actually fired with
remarkable accuracy from only 23 of the

40
00:01:25,771 --> 00:01:28,260
way a soccer ball directly into my face.

41
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,153
And believe me,

42
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,080
it has a lot of force.

43
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:32,983
So 20 feet.

44
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,000
So,

45
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,680
but when it comes to functional positions,

46
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:39,140
like how do we run
these school assemblies?

47
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,810
The popular kids don't have a clue.

48
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,640
So if you bring them into a room,

49
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:44,840
if there arbitrarily,

50
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:45,381
for example,

51
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:46,610
assigned to a committee,

52
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,580
um,

53
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,430
they will all piss on their
little piece of territory.

54
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:55,380
They'll all stake out a position of some
kind just to establish their status in

55
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,214
the room.

56
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,780
And after 15 minutes of this,

57
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:01,660
when they've all said their piece and
it comes time to actually do something,

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,651
they're clueless.

59
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:03,431
They're silent,

60
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:04,660
they don't know what to do.

61
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,540
And if there's an unpopular geek like me,

62
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:10,920
who at that 20 minute mark
all of a sudden has an idea,

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,280
they will glom around you
even if they don't like you.

64
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,091
Right.

65
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,270
So,

66
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:15,590
so,

67
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,041
so yeah,

68
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:17,030
so competence can,

69
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:17,361
can,

70
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:17,840
can,

71
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,810
can step in where we're
popularity cannot go.

72
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:21,331
Yes,

73
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:21,920
you've got,

74
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,210
that's a very well put fray.

75
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:23,511
So,

76
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:27,920
so there I was the head of this
programming committee and one of the,

77
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:28,560
it became,

78
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,000
one of the juniors came to me and said,

79
00:02:30,001 --> 00:02:31,110
we're doing a dance.

80
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,490
We're,

81
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:32,791
you know,

82
00:02:32,791 --> 00:02:35,790
we're setting up a dance and
could you advertise it for us?

83
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,910
And he didn't realize just
how absurd that statement was.

84
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,420
If there's a dance or a
party of any kind in buffalo,

85
00:02:42,421 --> 00:02:42,811
New York,

86
00:02:42,811 --> 00:02:47,160
one of the first things you have to
realize about it is I am not just

87
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,023
disinvited.

88
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,160
I haven't decided to stay as
far away as humanly possible.

89
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,640
And yet they want me to
advertise this dance.

90
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,570
So Jordan,

91
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,410
I can't dance.

92
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:58,100
I am,

93
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,060
I can't do a box.

94
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,580
I can't do a Fox trot.

95
00:03:00,581 --> 00:03:01,540
I can't do a waltz.

96
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,830
I can't do any of those things,

97
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,250
but I went on stage and put some music
on the turn table and danced and I saw

98
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,650
the pupils dilating of the audience,

99
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:15,010
350 people who hated me and hated
me for two and a half years.

100
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:15,844
At that point,

101
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,260
their pupils were dilating,

102
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:18,460
their faces were melting.

103
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:23,730
I felt that pseudopod at the energy
coming to me and through me as if I were a

104
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:24,520
pipe.

105
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,560
I felt it going up to something
inside of me more or less,

106
00:03:27,561 --> 00:03:30,310
that had level that
utterly transmogrified it.

107
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:35,140
And I felt the energy being sent back
through every Lou that I was making and I

108
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:36,700
had an out of body experience.

109
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,870
I saw,

110
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,700
I thought I was on the ceiling.

111
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:44,940
I watched all of this from the ceiling
and apparently it looked like a loony

112
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:47,050
toon drawn on Lsd

113
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:52,870
as if Chuck Jones had been doing Tom
and Jerry after taking a very big hit of

114
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:53,560
acid.

115
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,850
It was one of the strangest,

116
00:03:54,851 --> 00:03:57,880
weirdest things you've ever
seen and when it was all over.

117
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,190
So that was my ecstatic experience.

118
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,090
When it was all over,

119
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,350
the audience did something.

120
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:03,660
It had never done in my days,

121
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:05,350
so that school and would never do again.

122
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:06,430
So long as I was there,

123
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:10,750
it surged to the photo on the stage and
as if it had practiced this act all its

124
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:11,350
life,

125
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:12,910
it picked me up off the stage.

126
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,530
It put me on its shoulders,

127
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,720
it carried me out of the auditorium,

128
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,550
and it carried me up the pathway to the
building above where we had our classes.

129
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,440
So that was my introduction.

130
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,540
Yeah.

131
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,090
And,

132
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,130
but this is stats,

133
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,070
crazy story,

134
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,600
right.

135
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,600
And this is three years after I'd gone
off after the ecstatic experience,

136
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,180
knowing that it was something vital.

137
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:34,421
I mean,

138
00:04:34,421 --> 00:04:35,800
I'd heard at the age of 14,

139
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,730
two years earlier,

140
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,730
I had heard that there was a book
called the varieties of the religious

141
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,564
experience.

142
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:43,030
And in those days we had no Amazon.

143
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,353
Um,

144
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,620
we had local bookstores and
local bookstores in Buffalo.

145
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:47,921
I mean,

146
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,754
give me a break.

147
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:49,773
Um,

148
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,840
but I finally found a copy at the
University of Buffalo Bookstore.

149
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:57,841
And it felt as if William James had been
laying out a series of examples of the

150
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,440
ecstatic experience,

151
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,580
um,

152
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,580
with all of its delusions
and hallucinations and all
the rest on the laboratory

153
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:06,610
bench.

154
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,140
And then saying to me,

155
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:08,771
look,

156
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:09,461
you're coming along,

157
00:05:09,461 --> 00:05:14,200
70 years later you're going to have
scientific tools that I did not have.

158
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,000
This is your job.

159
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,290
And it was my job,

160
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:19,270
not just as William James
was giving it to me,

161
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,960
cause something deep inside of me
was crying out to understand it.

162
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,230
And it probably was that the
privilege of social disconnection,

163
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,580
the privilege of social
deprivation because that
privilege made me sensitive and

164
00:05:33,581 --> 00:05:35,920
it's always made me
sensitive to group behavior.

165
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,250
So when I was in Moscow in 2005 lecturing
a group of quantum physicists from all

166
00:05:42,851 --> 00:05:43,540
over the world,

167
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,450
and why everything that you know
about quantum physics does wrong.

168
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,450
It's because there is no such
thing as an isolated particle.

169
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,340
Every particle is part of our herd,

170
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:51,970
a mob,

171
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:53,650
a group of some kind.

172
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:54,580
Um,

173
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,413
the,

174
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,850
a lot of quantum physicists
based on the idea that when you,

175
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,800
when you treat a Photon,

176
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,080
a single photon in a certain way,

177
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:05,650
when you split it into
here's how it's going to be,

178
00:06:05,651 --> 00:06:06,484
hey,

179
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,420
but if it's being measured,

180
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,010
that's not going to happen.

181
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:10,221
Well,

182
00:06:10,221 --> 00:06:10,851
guess what?

183
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:12,890
We're constantly taking
each other's measure.

184
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,850
Photons are constantly taking each of
those measure because they move in groups,

185
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:17,840
crowds and herds.

186
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,050
That's why I beam of sunshine
comes through your window,

187
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:23,600
not a photon of sunshine.

188
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,550
And when I finished the speech,

189
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:29,540
I was sure they were going to throw me
out of the conference because these are

190
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:31,100
all people committed deeply.

191
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,210
It's a quantum physics.

192
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,510
And instead they sat there beaming like
proud uncles and I could not figure out

193
00:06:37,881 --> 00:06:38,301
why.

194
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,350
And three years later,

195
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,720
my collaborator in quantum physics,

196
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:42,470
uh,

197
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,400
at the university,

198
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,470
at the college and the of log mathematics,

199
00:06:45,471 --> 00:06:47,720
so the Russian Academy
of Sciences in Moscow,

200
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,250
an email and he said,

201
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,110
doctor,

202
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,870
um,

203
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,590
use your cough.

204
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:55,550
Who ran that conference and gave you such
a hard time about your credit card has

205
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:56,600
just published a book.

206
00:06:56,601 --> 00:06:58,400
It's a new approach to quantum physics.

207
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,170
It's called constructive physics.

208
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,180
You have to get it immediately.

209
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:04,550
So I downloaded it from arcs of org.

210
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:08,720
I listened to it that afternoon on my
hour and a half walk through the park on

211
00:07:08,721 --> 00:07:12,980
my way to the cafe where I do all
my work and I got all excited.

212
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,750
Every social concept.

213
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:20,140
That means every concept that I had
given in this talk was in this book.

214
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,390
So Jordan,

215
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:27,470
I've had the privilege of proceedings
through life with this enormous advantage.

216
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,420
Social deprivation.
