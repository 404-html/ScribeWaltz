1
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:07,993
Alright,
so

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:11,730
postmoderns and we talked about it a
little bit,

3
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:13,560
we'll return to it.
Now we're going to talk a little bit

4
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:18,120
about Marxism.
I've got a quote here from mark's.

5
00:00:18,121 --> 00:00:21,060
The proletarians have nothing to lose,
but they're chains.

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:22,501
Uh,
well,

7
00:00:22,501 --> 00:00:25,740
that was pretty good for like 1880 or
1890 or whenever it was.

8
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:27,670
He wrote it.
Somewhere around that period of time it

9
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,870
turned out the proletarians had a lot
more to lose than their chains.

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,840
They had their lives and their families
to lose.

11
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,980
That was demonstrated and play as a
consequence of the,

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,940
what would you call it,
the sociological movements that were put

13
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:45,780
into place when the Marxist
presuppositions began to govern

14
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,480
societies like the Soviet Union.
So,

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,020
all right,
so let's take the same postmodernist

16
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:55,680
approach.
So here's some basic tenants of Marxism.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,500
It's Berge Lousy against proletariat and
the bourgeoisie year.

18
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,650
They're capitalists,
the property owners,

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,610
those sorts of people.

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,560
The proletariat,
the working class,

21
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:09,210
for all intents and purposes.
The basic idea is that history itself is

22
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:12,150
nothing but the,
what would you call it?

23
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:16,200
The documentation of the struggle of one
class against the other.

24
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,100
Okay.
No,

25
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,370
like,
that's wrong,

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,730
but it's okay because it's too simple.
Obviously.

27
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,780
It's obviously too simple.
There's all sorts of motivations that

28
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,500
people have.
Some of them are economic,

29
00:01:30,501 --> 00:01:33,160
some of them are associated with power.
Um,

30
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,820
but that's okay.
We will leave that.

31
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:37,470
Let's,
let's give the devil his due and say,

32
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:37,981
well,
yeah,

33
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:40,020
fair enough.
There is still a fair bit of tension

34
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:41,940
between the haves and the haves and the
have nots.

35
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:45,600
And maybe that was even more intense and
previous societies than it is now.

36
00:01:45,601 --> 00:01:48,060
And it's no,
there's no doubt that economics plays a

37
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:50,370
role in,
in virtually everything that human

38
00:01:50,371 --> 00:01:52,230
beings do in a fairly significant role.

39
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:53,063
So let,
let's,

40
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,310
let's accept that as a potential theory.
It's,

41
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:58,740
it's simple,
but maybe it's practically useful.

42
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:00,990
And then there's kind of an offshoot of
that theory,

43
00:02:00,991 --> 00:02:02,040
which is that,
well,

44
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,380
if you're a Marxist,
that means you have sympathy for the

45
00:02:04,381 --> 00:02:05,280
working class.
Right?

46
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,900
Because that's what you're saying all
the time.

47
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,711
It's like,
well,

48
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:09,600
the poor working class,
they're all oppressed.

49
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,730
The poor,
poor proletariat,

50
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,830
you know.
And then you're also saying,

51
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:15,720
well,
we're the good guys because we're

52
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:19,440
standing on the side of the oppressed.
And so then you might also ask what

53
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,980
you're marginalizing when you claim that
you're the good guys because one of the

54
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:26,280
things that you would be marginalizing
is all of the ways in which you're not

55
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:29,240
the good guys,
but we can leave that aside for a moment

56
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:31,970
to.
So there's the claims is that,

57
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,730
you know,
there's the working class against the

58
00:02:34,731 --> 00:02:35,600
ruling class.

59
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,250
Another claim is the ruling class is the
ruined class because they exploit the

60
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,120
working class basically stealing their
excess labor from them.

61
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,740
Um,
another very,

62
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,070
very,
uh,

63
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,520
what,
uh,

64
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,720
surfacely attractive claim that lacks
any reasonable justification,

65
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,070
you know,
because it's predicated the idea of the

66
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,610
world as a zero sum game.
And clearly the world is not a zero sum

67
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:06,010
game.
So when someone creates wealth,

68
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,400
when someone is wealthy,
it can be at least at times because they

69
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:11,710
created it,
not because they swiped it from someone

70
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,610
else.
I think,

71
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,740
you know,
you can think of someone like Bill Gates

72
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,960
or Steve Jobs is a good example of that.

73
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,773
Um,

74
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,600
you know,
they're,

75
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:24,600
they're what they produced pad and value
that far exceeded what they garnered as

76
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:27,910
a consequence of their production even
though what they garnered was fairly

77
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:29,920
substantial.
So anyways,

78
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:31,030
but we'll get,
like you said,

79
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:32,740
we're going to give the devil his due.
Okay.

80
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:36,250
It's the bourgeoisie against the
proletariat will accept that.

81
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,220
It's class warfare is the primary
historical mover.

82
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,230
No problem.
Now,

83
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:43,960
but here's what I'm not willing to give
away so easily.

84
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,740
Uh,
we have sympathy for the working class

85
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,440
primarily,
and we're good because of that.

86
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,440
No,
I'm not gonna just give that away.

87
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,810
So simply.
So let's investigate that a little bit.

88
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:57,190
Let's see if we can actually figure it
out.

89
00:03:57,191 --> 00:04:01,810
If that's true.
We'll say a use a pragmatic approach

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,390
because I'm a pragmatist.
I'm in the William James Sense.

91
00:04:05,391 --> 00:04:08,160
Ah,
uh,

92
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,660
or maybe you can think about it even
more deeply in anciently.

93
00:04:11,661 --> 00:04:13,700
Uh,
there's a statement in the New

94
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,110
Testament,
I think it's by their fruits,

95
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,880
you shall know the fine.
