1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:12,310
I've been struggling with an idea
recently that I was thinking maybe it'd be

2
00:00:12,311 --> 00:00:17,080
able to help me out with basically in
a recent interview you talked about how

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,910
myth is meant to reconcile
inherent contradictions in reality,

4
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:22,740
right?

5
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,740
But I'm sort of stuck
between two mythological or
psychoanalytic ideas that I

6
00:00:29,711 --> 00:00:31,180
think are both really important,

7
00:00:31,181 --> 00:00:35,080
but they seem to have a
inherent contradiction within
them that I've been trying

8
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:35,860
to figure out.

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,820
So on one hand you have this idea that
there's times in your life where you have

10
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:43,960
to identify things in yourself that
are insufficient or there's a problem

11
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,990
somehow that you have to kind of have a
controlled burn or like a Phoenix like

12
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:54,160
transformation where you discard part
of yourself that doesn't fit or is not

13
00:00:54,161 --> 00:00:54,994
working.

14
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,380
But then on the other hand,

15
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:57,930
you have talked about this,

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,720
this union idea where
as you become really,

17
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,740
when you get older,

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,780
you mature by reincorporating things
about yourself that you lost when you were

19
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,940
younger or that you know,

20
00:01:09,941 --> 00:01:12,880
you're trying to integrate your shadow
or you're trying to find parts of your

21
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:13,760
personality that,

22
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:17,650
that maybe you've been rejecting and
trying to figure out how to bring them

23
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:17,930
into,

24
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:18,820
into the folder.

25
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,653
And then the whole,

26
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,530
so he's got this quote that I really like,

27
00:01:21,531 --> 00:01:24,400
which is I'd rather be holding good.

28
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:24,791
Right?

29
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:25,270
Right.

30
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,781
So,

31
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:30,370
so on one hand you may identify something
as a problem and you want to get rid

32
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:31,330
of it or burn it off.

33
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,650
But then on the other hand,

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,140
it seems like the,

35
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:39,630
the path to being stronger is to figure
out how to put everything together.

36
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,391
So there's a,

37
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:43,210
there's a,

38
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:46,150
one of the things young wrote
about in his works on alchemy was,

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,200
um,

40
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,140
an explanation of the
prime l chemical dictum,

41
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,180
which was Solvay Coagula,

42
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,190
which meant dissolve and integrate.

43
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,933
Yeah.

44
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,341
Right.

45
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:56,671
So,

46
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:57,960
so imagine this,

47
00:01:57,961 --> 00:01:58,794
imagine that.

48
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:04,310
Imagine you had a fairly hostile father
who is not very well controlled in his

49
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:06,264
aggression,

50
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,770
decent person other than that,

51
00:02:08,771 --> 00:02:09,730
but let's say that,

52
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,440
and so your reaction is,

53
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,940
I'm never going to be aggressive.

54
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,970
And so you've built a like
a moral structure that's
part of your personality and

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,770
there's possibility floating around.

56
00:02:22,771 --> 00:02:23,521
Outside of that,

57
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,090
did you,

58
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,860
you've denied an ethical,

59
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,950
you've denied any ethical.

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,170
Okay,

61
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,003
what would you say?

62
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,300
You've stripped the idea of aggression
of any ethical utility whatsoever.

63
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,171
Okay,

64
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:37,010
so what happens?

65
00:02:37,011 --> 00:02:39,860
This burns off and then
that comes back up.

66
00:02:39,861 --> 00:02:41,180
Now you still have to integrate it.

67
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,650
So it's associated in
some sense with niches,

68
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:45,484
ideas,

69
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,460
morality as cowardice.

70
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Because one of nature's most trenchant
critiques of traditional morality,

71
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,373
let's say,

72
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,910
is that most of what passes
for morality isn't morality.

73
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,110
It's just cowardice.

74
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,170
It's not that I'm a good
person and I don't hurt you.

75
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,980
It's that I'm afraid to hurt you and
because I don't want to admit that I'm

76
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,910
afraid to hurt you.

77
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:12,160
Then I say I'm moral because then I can
mask my essential fear and cowardice in

78
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,840
a guise of morality.

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:18,610
And that happens far more often than you
would think because harmless and moral

80
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:20,140
are by no means the same thing.

81
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,810
So some of what you're burning off,

82
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,801
you can sit,

83
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,670
and this is where Freud was such a genius
I think is because he concentrated on

84
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:28,900
aggression in sexuality,

85
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,770
which are perhaps the two most difficult
parts of a personality to integrate.

86
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,053
So that,

87
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,253
um,

88
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:36,310
the,

89
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,143
the

90
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,290
hyper simplified morality stops you from
tapping into deeper recesses of your

91
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:48,574
psyche.

92
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,490
And it's partly because
there are primal forces.

93
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,940
It's not surprising that you don't
want to have anything to do with them,

94
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,510
that you stay away from situations where
they might make themselves manifest.

95
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:01,670
But the problem is by denying the
worst in yourself in that matter,

96
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,543
suppressing it,

97
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,680
you preclude the possibility of the
best because no one can be a good person

98
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,760
without integrating their
capacity for aggression.

99
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:13,000
Because without that
capacity for aggression,

100
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,680
you cannot say no.

101
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,720
Because no means,

102
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,040
if you really say it,

103
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:22,720
no means there isn't anything that you
can do to me that will make me change my

104
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,620
mind or,

105
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:27,580
or conversely it means I will play
for higher stakes than you will.

106
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,350
And unless you've got your
aggression integrated,

107
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,510
there isn't a chance you can say that.

108
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:35,081
And if you did,

109
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:38,800
no one would take you seriously
because they'd know it was just a show.

110
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,970
So one of the most useful
things that young did,

111
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:46,390
I think was to work on this idea of the
integration of the shadow because he was

112
00:04:46,391 --> 00:04:47,980
really interested in the idea of evil,

113
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,251
right?

114
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:53,200
Especially working with trying to parcel
out what happened in Nazi Germany and

115
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,430
during the Second World War.

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,850
What do you do with the part of you
that's aggressive and potentially

117
00:04:57,851 --> 00:04:58,371
malevolent?

118
00:04:58,371 --> 00:04:59,410
You just crush it.

119
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,690
That's the super ego
response in some sense.

120
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,040
You just put it behind you,

121
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:03,970
so to speak.

122
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,860
Is that a possibility or do you admit
to its existence and bring it into the

123
00:05:08,861 --> 00:05:09,694
game?

124
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,563
And that's

125
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,340
for,

126
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,210
for Freud.

127
00:05:13,211 --> 00:05:13,931
In some sense,

128
00:05:13,931 --> 00:05:18,580
morality was super ego clamping down
on the bed and there were fundamentally

129
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,414
opposed,

130
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,970
both young and Piaget
had a different idea.

131
00:05:21,971 --> 00:05:22,960
And I think they were right.

132
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:23,560
It's like,

133
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:23,831
no,

134
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:24,041
no,

135
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:27,280
you invite the bad guys I out to play.

136
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,310
And so you're an aggressive hockey player,

137
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,600
but it's disciplined
aggression that makes you,

138
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:38,200
gives you access to a whole source of
energy you wouldn't otherwise have.

139
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,150
And then with regards to sexuality,

140
00:05:40,151 --> 00:05:40,511
it's like,

141
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:40,900
well,

142
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,870
untrammeled promiscuity
doesn't constitute a virtue,

143
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,680
but neither does unavoidable virginity.

144
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,490
Right?

145
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:48,941
In fact,

146
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:52,840
I think that's worse because it
also masks itself with virtue.

147
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:53,771
It's like,

148
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:53,951
well,

149
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:55,330
you should be able to,

150
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,230
you should be to do things
that you wouldn't do.

151
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,093
That's uh,

152
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:04,060
that's like the definition
of a genuinely moral person.

153
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,620
They could do it,

154
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,403
but they don't.

155
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,870
That's not cowardice.

156
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,883
And so that's,

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,670
you burn off the things that get
in the way of that integration.

158
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:19,590
So when you say dissolve in integrate
yet to be a good way to sort of bring the

159
00:06:19,591 --> 00:06:24,591
two ideas together that the burning off
and the difficult processes necessary

160
00:06:25,111 --> 00:06:29,760
because the elements of yourself are
structured together in a rigid way that is

161
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,380
not working properly.

162
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:31,821
Yeah,

163
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:32,960
that's what happens to Japan.

164
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,220
Low in the belly of the whale.

165
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,260
He's so caught in his presuppositions
that he can't escape right in.

166
00:06:39,261 --> 00:06:41,150
So Pinocchio represents the new forest.

167
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,380
So it's very interesting.

168
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:43,550
So when You Watch Pinocchio,

169
00:06:43,551 --> 00:06:44,570
tried to rescue him.

170
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,740
The first thing Japan,

171
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:49,250
Oh does is Confuse Pinocchio with a
fish because he wants something to eat.

172
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:52,310
But Pinocchio is better than something
to eat because he could rescue him.

173
00:06:52,311 --> 00:06:53,570
So he doesn't need to eat.

174
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,770
And then Pinocchio wants to make a fire
in Japan objects because he's going to

175
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:58,850
burn up all the furniture.

176
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,300
So like we don't need the damn furniture
if we're getting out of the whale,

177
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,080
you know?

178
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,680
And so,

179
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,311
so Japan,

180
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:04,550
no,

181
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,510
and he's old.

182
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:05,931
So that,

183
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:06,190
that's,

184
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:06,980
that's the,

185
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,120
that's the rigid structure.

186
00:07:08,121 --> 00:07:11,570
That's the old year that has to die
off before the new year can be born.

187
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,010
It's a forest fire that allows for new
growth and that's how those things are

188
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,600
put together and to see,

189
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:18,890
and it's useful to know too,

190
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:20,360
because if you burn something off,

191
00:07:20,361 --> 00:07:20,841
you might think,

192
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:20,961
well,

193
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,040
there's nothing left.

194
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:22,641
It's like,

195
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:23,474
that's not true.

196
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,830
If it's dead wood,

197
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:28,730
then you have room for new growth and
you want to be doing that on a fairly

198
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,410
regular basis.

199
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:31,040
That's the,

200
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,060
that's that's the snake that sheds
its skin and transforms itself,

201
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:35,271
right?

202
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,030
That's,

203
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:38,190
that's the death and resurrection.

204
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,720
From a psychological perspective,

205
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:41,070
it's exactly the same idea.

206
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,290
Now we don't know the upper limit to that,

207
00:07:43,291 --> 00:07:43,531
right,

208
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:46,860
because we don't know what a person
would be like if they let everything that

209
00:07:46,861 --> 00:07:48,090
they could let go,

210
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,920
let go and only let in what was seemly,

211
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:53,754
let's say,

212
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,560
but you can see that.

213
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:56,310
It's funny,

214
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:59,580
we don't know that to some degree
you can see people very far.

215
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,850
You can see people start
to do that without,

216
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,560
that's not an rare experience.

217
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,720
And people improve very rapidly.

218
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,460
They can improve their lives very rapidly.

219
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:12,900
A lot of it's low hanging fruit.

220
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,430
Like if you just stopped doing really
stupid things that you know are stupid,

221
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:18,840
your life improves a lot.

222
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,100
So,

223
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,490
and it,

224
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,570
it frees you up.

225
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,220
It also means there's a,

226
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:28,100
there's an element there that's also
associated with pride because people tend

227
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,360
to take pride in who they are.

228
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:34,361
And that's a bad idea because that
stops you from becoming who you could be

229
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:35,990
because if you're proud of who you are,

230
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:38,510
you won't let that go when it's necessary.

231
00:08:38,511 --> 00:08:39,920
You won't step away from it,

232
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,611
you know?

233
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:43,100
And then you end up being your own parody,

234
00:08:43,101 --> 00:08:44,000
something like that.

235
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:45,970
That's also a very bad idea.

236
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,140
You want to be continually stepping
away from your previous self and so big.

237
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,180
And I guess part of that too is that you,

238
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,540
you have to decide,

239
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:54,781
you know,

240
00:08:54,781 --> 00:08:55,614
are,

241
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,910
are you order,

242
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,970
are you chaos or are you the
process that mediates between them?

243
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,980
And if you're the process
that mediates between them,

244
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:02,640
you,

245
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,560
you are the thing that transforms and
that's the right attitude for human being

246
00:09:07,561 --> 00:09:09,120
because that's what we are.

247
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,860
We're the thing that voluntarily
confronts chaos and transforms.

248
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,180
That's what we are.

249
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,250
And so for better or worse,

250
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,060
you know,

251
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,180
that's our deepest biological essence,

252
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:22,014
you might say.

253
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,500
And so you can let things go if you
know that there's more growth to come.
