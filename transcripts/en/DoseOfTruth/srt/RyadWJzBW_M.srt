1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,330
What happens when all people
get together in a group.

2
00:00:09,331 --> 00:00:09,661
You know,

3
00:00:09,661 --> 00:00:13,410
we talked about that last time when we
talked about Kierkegaard idea that as

4
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:15,090
soon as you get a bunch
of people together,

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,950
no matter how truthful they are,

6
00:00:16,951 --> 00:00:18,270
all as individuals,

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,360
instantly the crowd is
not a truthful thing.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:22,171
And you know,

9
00:00:22,171 --> 00:00:22,351
there,

10
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:22,760
there,

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,593
there are,

12
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,110
there are real reasons for that.

13
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:26,450
Real psychological reasons.

14
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:28,380
So there's the famous ash experiments,

15
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:30,030
I hope that those are
the right experiments.

16
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,850
A S C h about Lyme lakes,

17
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:33,151
you know,

18
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:37,520
so you draw two lines on the board and
they're the same length and you get the

19
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,453
crowd to,

20
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,060
you know,

21
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,210
collaborate with you and you ask some
poor sucker who doesn't know about the

22
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:43,044
game,

23
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:43,440
uh,

24
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,071
to play.

25
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,641
And you know,

26
00:00:44,641 --> 00:00:46,200
you ask one person and they say no,

27
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:47,940
those lines are different in length.

28
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:48,880
And you ask another person,

29
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,111
they say,

30
00:00:49,111 --> 00:00:49,330
well,

31
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:49,560
yeah,

32
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,790
they're quite different in length.

33
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,840
Then another person says,

34
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:52,531
yeah,

35
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:54,210
this sure I can see the
difference in length.

36
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:55,800
And then you ask the poor pigeon,

37
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:56,311
you know,

38
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,570
are they different in length?

39
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,613
And he says,

40
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:00,413
yes.

41
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,650
You know,

42
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,060
and you can understand why.

43
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,150
It's like if all those
other people are saying it,

44
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,320
there's either,

45
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,330
there's either something
wrong with all of them,

46
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,470
which seems unlikely,

47
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:12,870
or he's the victim of a conspiracy,

48
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,580
which is a little on the paranoid side,

49
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:17,070
but happens to actually
be true in this case.

50
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,120
Um,

51
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,460
or he's just not looking at it.

52
00:01:20,461 --> 00:01:20,731
Right.

53
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,391
And you might think,

54
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:21,541
well,

55
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,760
the humble thing to thank is he's wrong.

56
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,541
And so,

57
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:24,811
you know,

58
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:27,720
the fact that somebody might
go along with the crowd,

59
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:28,590
you know,

60
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:28,981
you can,

61
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:29,580
you can,

62
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,200
you can blame that on their,

63
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,470
on their ability to be
social and conventional,

64
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:38,460
which in many ways is a huge advantage
because if you are all antisocial and

65
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:39,420
unconventional,

66
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,110
you know,

67
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:40,943
I mean,

68
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:44,940
there'd be a good chunk of you in jail
and we certainly wouldn't be having this,

69
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:45,211
you know,

70
00:01:45,211 --> 00:01:45,871
delightful,

71
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,730
peaceful conversation that we're having.

72
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:47,971
So,

73
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:48,241
you know,

74
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,830
you don't want to
underestimate the utility of
conventionality to too much of a

75
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:53,664
degree.

76
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,051
Anyway,

77
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:55,884
so

78
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,110
there's this funny story I read once.

79
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,950
I don't think it's true,

80
00:01:59,951 --> 00:02:00,784
but it might be.

81
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,180
Whereas psychology class got together
and decided they'd play a trick on the

82
00:02:06,181 --> 00:02:07,014
professor.

83
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,260
And the trick was that he
would walk back and forth,

84
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:10,431
Hey,

85
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:10,770
and,

86
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,010
and the trick was that they wouldn't pay
any attention to them at all if he was

87
00:02:14,011 --> 00:02:15,150
on the left side of the room.

88
00:02:15,151 --> 00:02:15,391
You know,

89
00:02:15,391 --> 00:02:16,530
they talk a bit and look,

90
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:17,430
look up.

91
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,080
And if he was on the
right side of the room,

92
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:20,940
then they'd really focus
in and pay attention.

93
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,800
And the story goes that by the,

94
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:23,910
you know,

95
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,590
by several weeks of this little trick,

96
00:02:25,591 --> 00:02:27,600
they had them like lecturing
right beside the door,

97
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:27,811
you know,

98
00:02:27,811 --> 00:02:29,130
and he wouldn't move from that spot.

99
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,550
And so the reason I'm telling you that
is because it's pretty obvious that

100
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,210
people can respond to the cues
that a crowd is delivering.

101
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:36,751
You know,

102
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,160
when a good speaker does that,

103
00:02:38,161 --> 00:02:38,690
right?

104
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:42,420
So a good speaker does a variety of
things and one is the never talks to the,

105
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,250
to the crowd per se.

106
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:44,850
You know,

107
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:47,790
when you pick out specific individuals
and talk to them and they're sort of

108
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,380
reflective of the crowd,

109
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,690
and then you can tell if
everybody's understanding.

110
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:52,591
And,

111
00:02:52,591 --> 00:02:52,830
uh,

112
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:56,700
the other thing that a good speaker does
is pay attention to the damn responses

113
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:57,600
of the crowd.

114
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,320
Because you know,

115
00:02:59,321 --> 00:02:59,650
if,

116
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,080
if a lecture is really a dialogue,

117
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,140
even though the audience
is only emitting nonverbal,

118
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,610
the nonverbal elements
of the conversation,

119
00:03:09,611 --> 00:03:10,810
those nonverbal elements,

120
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,430
those damn things are important.

121
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,420
So you want to stay in touch
with the nonverbal communication.
