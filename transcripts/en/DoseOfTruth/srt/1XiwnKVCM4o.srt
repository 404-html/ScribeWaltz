1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,250
You your,
you wrote your amcap cause you want to

2
00:00:02,251 --> 00:00:03,480
go to medical school,
right?

3
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,990
And so now the envelope comes and you're
shaking away and the open and it's like

4
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:11,280
you got 25th percentile just like a
quarter of the people who take the test.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,380
Well what,
what does that mean?

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,730
Well this is Sir all blown to hell.
That's for sure.

7
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,940
And so God only knows how many of these
things are going to go to.

8
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,220
Maybe your study habits really need to
be,

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,460
you know,
you have to reconstitute yourself all

10
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,350
the way down to the level of your
habits.

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,210
It's,
it can be devastating news.

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,160
Now,
one of the ways to protect yourself

13
00:00:32,161 --> 00:00:35,430
against something like that,
it's like don't have one plan,

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,010
right?
If you're going to stake yourself on

15
00:00:38,011 --> 00:00:40,290
something,
you should throw a couple of alternative

16
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:43,320
scaffolds up beside you so that you have
somewhere to go.

17
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,180
You want to be a doctor?
Okay,

18
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,120
well you could be a nurse.
It's like it's not a doctor,

19
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:52,500
but it needs cutting your throat.
You're still doing 80% of what you

20
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,990
wanted to do.
So you want to and you want to think

21
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:56,580
about this during your whole life,
man,

22
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:01,110
if you're going to take a high risk,
you want to scaffold yourself and other

23
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:03,420
areas so that if it fails,
you don't bother them,

24
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:06,900
doesn't drop out and you die.
And it's also very much worth thinking

25
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,780
about with regards to setting up your
life in general.

26
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,060
It's like
if you concentrate solely on your

27
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:18,660
career,
you can get along way in your career and

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,720
I would say that that's a strategy that
a minority of men preferentially do that

29
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:26,370
that's all they do.
They worked like 70 80 hours a week.

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,680
They go flat out on their career.

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:33,900
They're staking everything on the small
probability of exceptional status in a

32
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,480
narrow domain.
But it's,

33
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,350
it's hard on them.
They don't have a life.

34
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,330
It's very difficult for them to have a
family.

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,330
They don't know how to take any leisure
activity like they get very one

36
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,730
dimension.
Now it may be that that unit

37
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:48,570
dimentionality is the price you have to
pay to be exceptional at one thing,

38
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,460
right?
Because if you're going to be something

39
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,820
like a genius level mathematician and
you want to do that for,

40
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,060
or a scientist say,
it's like you're in your lab,

41
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,210
you're in your lab all the time,
you're working 70 hours a week or 80

42
00:02:00,211 --> 00:02:01,620
hours a week,
you're smart,

43
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,780
you're dedicated,
you're unit dimensional.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,020
And that's how you get to beat all the
other people who are doing that.

45
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,710
It's the only way.
But the problem is you don't get a life.

46
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:13,380
Now,
if you love being a scientist and you

47
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:17,400
have that kind of focus of mind,
well first of all,

48
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:19,860
you're a rare person and second you're
going to pay for it,

49
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,840
but fine.
More power to you.

50
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,780
But,
but it's,

51
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:27,840
uh,
it's a risky business to do that.

52
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,120
You sacrifice a lot for it.
You know?

53
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:35,121
And I would say most often if you're
speaking about having a healthy life,

54
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,130
that isn't what you do.
You spread yourself out more.

55
00:02:38,131 --> 00:02:38,641
So,
you know,

56
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:41,550
you have a family,
you have some things that you do outside

57
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:43,680
of work that are meaningful to you and
useful.

58
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,170
You,
you have a network of friends.

59
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,940
Um,
that,

60
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,460
that those three things,
a loner for things,

61
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,800
a loner,
plenty to keep you well oriented.

62
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:54,930
And then if one of those things
collapses,

63
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,410
you know,
everything doesn't go now.

64
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,400
The,
the price you pay for that is,

65
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:03,310
the more you strive to optimize that
balance,

66
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:07,360
the less likely you are to be
fantastically successful at any single

67
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:08,140
one of them.

68
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,580
But you might have a very,
you know,

69
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:12,040
if you can consider your life as a
whole,

70
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,520
that might be a winning strategy.
One of the things,

71
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:17,290
Carl Young sad,
I really liked this.

72
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,170
He thought that men went after
perfection and when women went after

73
00:03:23,171 --> 00:03:25,150
wholeness,
so there are different,

74
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,630
they're different value.
Their did their different.

75
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:31,090
There's something different at the top
of the value hierarchy.

76
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,330
So perfection would be steak it all on
one thing and look for radical success.

77
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,320
Not all,
not that all men do that cause they

78
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:39,570
don't.
But we're,

79
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:43,180
we're talking about extremes and at
least with regards to the men that do

80
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,430
that,
the wholeness ideas more like,

81
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,264
well,
I want,

82
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,390
I want,
it's like I want one thing in my life to

83
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:54,240
be 150%
or I want five things in my life to be

84
00:03:54,241 --> 00:03:55,080
80%

85
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,980
well there,
there's a lot more richness in a life

86
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:03,790
where you have five things operating at
80% but you're not operating in any of

87
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:08,500
at any of them at 150% so,
and I really believe this because I've

88
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,830
watched men and women go through their
careers now for a long period of time.

89
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:15,760
And one of the things that,
there's lots of things that produce

90
00:04:15,761 --> 00:04:18,790
this,
but one of the things that I've noticed

91
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:22,660
is that mostly women in their thirties
bear bail out of unit dimensional

92
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,520
careers.
They won't do them.

93
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,880
They won't,
they won't put in the 80 hours a week

94
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:32,290
that they would have to put in in order
to dominate that particular area.

95
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:34,690
And it isn't.
The reason that they won't do it is

96
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:39,580
because they decide it's not worth it.
And no wonder because why would that be

97
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:41,830
worth it?
You have to ask yourself though.

98
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,930
It's like,
well you want to be an outstanding

99
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:45,280
scientist.
It's like okay,

100
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,610
really,
really that's what you want because that

101
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:50,050
means that's what you do.

102
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:51,460
Yeah.

103
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,940
Cause you're competing with other
people.

104
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,770
You know they're smart,
they're hardworking.

105
00:04:54,771 --> 00:04:58,130
And if you want to be at the top,
you have to be smarter and work harder

106
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,400
than any of them.
And working hard means working long

107
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,680
hours.
I mean it also means working diligently.

108
00:05:03,681 --> 00:05:07,700
But in the final analysis it's all also
an additive issue.

109
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:12,560
If I'm smart and hardworking and I can
crank out for 70 hours a week and you do

110
00:05:12,561 --> 00:05:15,800
it for 30 it's like until years,
I'm so far ahead of you,

111
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:20,480
you will never ever catch up.
So anyways,

112
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,990
and I think partly may be part of the
reason too that women are oriented that

113
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,800
way more than men.
I think there's two reasons.

114
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,870
One is socioeconomic status does not
make women more attractive on the mating

115
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:31,850
market,
but it does make men more attractive.

116
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,520
And the second is women's timeframe is
compressed,

117
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:35,600
right?

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,180
Cause guys can always say,
well I'll have kids later and they can

119
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:40,610
say that until they're like 80 whereas
women,

120
00:05:40,611 --> 00:05:41,660
it's like,
no way man,

121
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:45,230
you gotta get you gotta get it together
by the time were let's say 40 but really

122
00:05:45,231 --> 00:05:49,880
probably by 35 but definitely by 40
cause otherwise it ain't happening and

123
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:53,720
that's bloody dreadful.
Like the most unhappy people you ever

124
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:54,970
see.
Hmm.

125
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,440
No,
no.

126
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,060
One of the common roots to extreme
unhappiness is to want children and not

127
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,920
have the,
I wouldn't recommend that.

128
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,870
You know,
you see couples who were in their

129
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:09,650
thirties one couple in three over the
age of 30 has fertility problems.

130
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:14,120
That's defined as an inability to
conceive after one year of trying one in

131
00:06:14,121 --> 00:06:17,000
three,
it's worth thinking about because people

132
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,280
are very,
very unhappy if they want to have kids

133
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,450
and then they can't,
man,

134
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,820
you're in the medical mill for 10 years,
if that's,

135
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,740
if that's what happens to you.
So,

136
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,941
okay.
So anyways,

137
00:06:25,941 --> 00:06:26,774
back to this.

138
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,260
Okay.

139
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,510
I think what I'll do,
what time it is,

140
00:06:33,511 --> 00:06:36,150
it is it,
because I'd have to open up a whole new

141
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:39,090
can of worms so to speak,
to do the next part.

142
00:06:39,091 --> 00:06:42,960
So I think actually what I'm going to do
is just recap what we did and then stop.

143
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:46,260
Or maybe we can have some questions or
maybe we can call it an early day.

144
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,940
Okay,
so what,

145
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,290
what is the fundamental issue here?
What did we discuss today?

146
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,610
All right,
so you're in a frame and we've laid out

147
00:06:56,611 --> 00:06:58,410
its characteristics.
It has a goal in it,

148
00:06:58,411 --> 00:07:01,860
it has a current position and it has
rules for operating within it.

149
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,640
It governs your perceptions,
which is really critical thing to

150
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:09,000
understand and well governing your
perceptions.

151
00:07:09,001 --> 00:07:10,950
It's,
it tells you what's useful to you and

152
00:07:10,951 --> 00:07:12,690
what gets in your way.
But most importantly,

153
00:07:12,691 --> 00:07:14,490
it tells you what,
you don't have to pay attention to it.

154
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,560
So as long as your damn frame is
functional,

155
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,220
you can ignore most of the world.
And that means your stress level is way

156
00:07:20,221 --> 00:07:22,380
lower than it would normally be.
Okay.

157
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,600
So perception,
motivation,

158
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,520
all of that's integrated into those
frames.

159
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,520
And then the emotional element comes out
in that with it.

160
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:33,000
When you're within a frame,
things that move you forward and

161
00:07:33,001 --> 00:07:36,450
validate the framer positive and things
that get in your way and invalidate the

162
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:39,120
frame are negative and then the next
issue is,

163
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:42,300
well,
if your frame is invalidated,

164
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,030
exactly what does that mean?
And you can't answer that without

165
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,850
thinking about the hierarchy of frames
because if you're lucky,

166
00:07:47,851 --> 00:07:52,350
it just means your frame needs a minor
alteration that would be equivalent to

167
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,050
Piaget did in assimilation in some
sense.

168
00:07:55,051 --> 00:07:56,430
Right?
You can stay in the frame.

169
00:07:56,431 --> 00:08:01,350
You just make a small adjustment.
I think the Piaget idiom distinction

170
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:06,330
between assimilation and accommodation
is technically inaccurate because it's a

171
00:08:06,331 --> 00:08:08,040
continuum,
right?

172
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,100
I mean if I,
if I want to grab your pen,

173
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,700
I have a little frame that will enable
me to do that.

174
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:16,350
You say,
well I'm staying within the frame to

175
00:08:16,351 --> 00:08:18,540
move that out of the way,
but actually I'm not.

176
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:23,790
What I'm doing is doing a very,
I'm doing a small micro revolution in

177
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,650
the frame,
moving that to pick that up.

178
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:29,310
And so it's,
I think accommodation,

179
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:34,080
there's no hard distinction between
assimilation and accommodation.

180
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,910
It's a continuum.
So you'd say,

181
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:36,261
well,
if,

182
00:08:36,261 --> 00:08:38,520
if the top end of your map gets blown
out,

183
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:42,000
that requires accommodation.
And if it's just a little micro change

184
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:43,530
at the bottom,
that's assimilation.

185
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,450
But there's no,
there's no real difference between this

186
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,530
except for scale.
And there's kind of a continual scale,

187
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:52,290
not an absolute dichotomy.
So,

188
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,670
okay.
So anyways,

189
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,370
back to the back.
The emotion.

190
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:59,130
Okay,
something happens and it isn't what you

191
00:08:59,131 --> 00:09:00,990
wanted.
What does that mean?

192
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,480
Well,
it could mean anything.

193
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:07,920
What you do is you start trying to micro
adjust the frame at the highest level of

194
00:09:07,921 --> 00:09:10,860
resolution,
but then you might find that you can't

195
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:12,810
do that.
So you have to jump up to the next one.

196
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,570
You have to jump up to the next one,
you have to jump up to the next one.

197
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,500
And each time you do that,
the psychophysiological cost increases.

198
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,113
So,

199
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,083
okay.
So,

200
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:32,390
so we talked about the cost end of the
spectrum and then we also talked about

201
00:09:32,391 --> 00:09:35,180
the engagement end of the spectrum.
And so the idea would be,

202
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,920
well,
if you're,

203
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,950
if you're very much engaged,
say in

204
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,673
cool,
do that again.

205
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,090
If you find it very engaging to play
with your baby,

206
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:53,400
then you might be doing it in a way
that's an indicating that you're taking

207
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:56,430
good care of your family,
that you're being a good parent and that

208
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:58,590
you're being a good person all
simultaneously.

209
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,550
And there's rich meaning in that and
you're the systems that orient you with

210
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:03,960
regards to meaning are saying,
look,

211
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:08,400
you're doing this microaction in a way
that benefits the maintenance and maybe

212
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:11,070
even the expansion of all the frames
that exist above it.

213
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,660
And that's,
that's,

214
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,360
that's exactly what you want.
You want to be doing that all the time

215
00:10:15,361 --> 00:10:17,700
if you can.
And so that implies that you want to

216
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:22,701
delineate out a pretty well developed
value system so that you're not acting

217
00:10:23,431 --> 00:10:26,400
at odds with yourself.
And you also want to have that

218
00:10:26,401 --> 00:10:31,401
integrated within the broader society so
that society isn't existing towards you

219
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:35,310
as a continual obstacle and making your
life miserable.
