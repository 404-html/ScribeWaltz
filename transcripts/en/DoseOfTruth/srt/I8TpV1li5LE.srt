Dr peterson,

2
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:14,870
I'm considering going into the
education stream slash system.

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,550
Do you have any advice for me not to
become a mouthpiece for indoctrinating

4
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:20,480
young students?

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,593
Well,

6
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:27,710
one thing I would recommend is that
you don't write essays that you don't

7
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:28,544
believe in.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,710
I think that's a sin.

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:35,660
I think it's a sin to use your words
falsely and the reason for that,

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,740
like there's a good series of social
psychology experiments that show,

11
00:00:39,741 --> 00:00:44,210
like imagine that you bring someone into
a lab and you have them write an essay

12
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:48,470
about or fill out a questionnaire about
their political opinions so you get a

13
00:00:48,471 --> 00:00:52,760
baseline measure of their political
stance and then you ask them to write a

14
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,151
thousand words.

15
00:00:53,151 --> 00:00:54,770
Maybe they identify as right,

16
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:55,460
wait,

17
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:58,960
and then you get them to write a thousand
word essay on why a particular left

18
00:00:58,961 --> 00:01:00,740
wing position is true,

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,610
and then you have them come back in
two weeks and you give them the same

20
00:01:04,611 --> 00:01:08,930
political belief questionnaire they'll
tell have shifted quite radically towards

21
00:01:08,931 --> 00:01:09,764
the left.

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:14,060
And the reason for that is that people
don't think through their positions in

23
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:14,960
great detail,

24
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:19,460
and so if you get them to think through
a contract position in great detail,

25
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:22,040
then that starts to
become more convincing.

26
00:01:22,041 --> 00:01:27,041
And so if you go into a field like
education that's really pathologically

27
00:01:27,681 --> 00:01:30,200
overrun by the postmodern,

28
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:31,430
neo Marxist types,

29
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,330
you're going to experience a tremendous
amount of pressure to falsify your

30
00:01:35,331 --> 00:01:35,721
words.

31
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,550
You're going to be afraid
that if you don't do that,

32
00:01:37,551 --> 00:01:39,170
you're going to fail.

33
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:42,590
And maybe sometimes you will
be punished by a professor.

34
00:01:42,591 --> 00:01:44,510
But I would say in most circumstances,

35
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:48,800
I'm still optimistic enough to believe
that if you write a good essay that isn't

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,090
ideologically proper,

37
00:01:50,091 --> 00:01:51,550
you'll still get a good grade.

38
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:55,220
I guess I would say if you write a good
essay that's not ideologically proper

39
00:01:55,221 --> 00:01:56,360
and you don't get a good grade,

40
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,190
that's probably a good time to fight.

41
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:01,490
So because you either fight or capitulate,

42
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,820
right?

43
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,653
That's,

44
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,623
that's the.

45
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,030
That's the hard truth.

46
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,060
So I'm not saying it would be easy and
I would also say don't make unnecessary

47
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,271
enemies,

48
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:11,630
right?

49
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:11,990
You don't.

50
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,620
Everything doesn't have to be a battle.

51
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:13,911
Now.

52
00:02:13,911 --> 00:02:15,020
And then you're going to know that,

53
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,041
you know,

54
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:20,060
you'll hate writing the essay because
you have to sacrifice your soul in order

55
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:22,210
to put the words down and then you,

56
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:22,780
you,

57
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:27,080
you demand and warp your character and
you just don't recover easily from that.

58
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:28,280
So I would say,

59
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:29,030
don't do that,

60
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:29,570
man.

61
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:30,380
That's not good.
