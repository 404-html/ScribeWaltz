1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:09,960
You have written an
article on how to write,

2
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:12,190
can you do the same on how to speak?

3
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:14,860
I suppose I could,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,750
I could tell you a little bit about it.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
Um,

6
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,980
okay.

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:22,540
If you're going to speak about something,

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:24,790
you need to know a lot about it.

9
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:28,720
You need to know three or four times as
much as you're going to speak about at

10
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:29,111
minimum.

11
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:29,801
So first of all,

12
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,540
you have to do your background research.

13
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,230
You have to have multiple stories at
hand that you can use to illustrate your

14
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:38,290
point.

15
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,400
And you have to have a point,

16
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,180
you have to organize what you're
talking about around a problem.

17
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:47,710
So before I go on stage
to speak on my tour,

18
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,870
I always sit for half an hour,

19
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,230
some of which involves usually
about five minutes of anxiety.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,101
And I think,

21
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:54,934
okay,

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,880
there's a problem I'm
trying to address tonight,

23
00:00:57,881 --> 00:00:59,710
a central problem or a theme.

24
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:00,101
What is,

25
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,120
it might be courage,

26
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:02,440
it might be responsibility,

27
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:03,550
it might be meaning.

28
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,853
Um,

29
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,780
I think that serves as
an organizing principle.

30
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,040
So that would be the point.

31
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:14,610
And then basically I organize say a dozen
stories around that and I can kind of

32
00:01:15,011 --> 00:01:17,410
arrange them in it as a journey.

33
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,950
And it's a journey that
circles the main point.

34
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:25,270
And so I'm trying to explore it
to say what I think about courage,

35
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:25,691
let's say,

36
00:01:25,691 --> 00:01:29,860
but to take what I'm thinking
farther than I've taken it already.

37
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,660
And so then I can plot out,

38
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:32,291
you know,

39
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:37,060
little five minute stories that I
have that are associated with courage.

40
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,390
And then I can talk to the audience and
I would say talk about what you know,

41
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,810
use your personal experience
because that's not something
that you're actually a

42
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:50,381
master of.

43
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:51,850
You can bring in other material,

44
00:01:51,851 --> 00:01:56,140
but it has to be tied to the real
world through your own experience.

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,490
Otherwise it's not real.

46
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,390
It's also very good to speak
directly to the audience,

47
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:02,770
to the individuals in the audience.

48
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:04,900
Cause I'm always looking
at a single person,

49
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,940
one after another and focusing on them
and talking to them just like you'd have

50
00:02:09,941 --> 00:02:11,170
a conversation with someone.

51
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:13,540
And that way I can see if
they're following along.

52
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:15,910
And I'm always listening to the audience.

53
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,690
What I really like to hear from
the audience is no noise at all.

54
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,524
Silence.

55
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,820
Because if the audience,

56
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:22,391
especially,

57
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:22,661
you know,

58
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:24,910
if it's a couple of hundred or
a couple of thousand people,

59
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,250
if the audience is dead silent,

60
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,550
then I know that I'm on the right track.

61
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:32,043
And so

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,590
the other thing I would say
is you're telling stories.

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:45,160
So every fact that you relate or every
set of facts has to be tied to his story.

64
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,990
There has to be a meaningful output,

65
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:52,880
which is something like why is it
important to your life that you know this

66
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,510
fact?

67
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:57,140
How is it related to how you're going to
conduct yourself moving forward or how

68
00:02:57,141 --> 00:02:58,100
you're going to see the world.

69
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:00,070
So cause that's kind
of essence of meaning.

70
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:04,180
How does this fact change the way you
perceive the world or act in the world?

71
00:03:04,390 --> 00:03:05,890
That's the meaning of the fact.

72
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,870
And facts without meaning are dull.

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,310
So you need to know that.

74
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:11,650
You need to tell the truth.

75
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,880
That's for sure.

76
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:13,950
And,

77
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:14,783
and,

78
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:15,940
and,

79
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,590
and I mean for me,

80
00:03:17,591 --> 00:03:18,610
my talks are really,

81
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,290
they're an attempt to explore a set of
ideas in the most truthful way that I can

82
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:23,740
manage.

83
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,740
And that's also an adventure because
letting yourself speak freely about a

84
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:29,711
topic,

85
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,150
you don't always know
where it's going to go.

86
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:31,720
And so,

87
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,600
but that also hooks in the
audience because they're not,

88
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:36,340
they're along for the ride,

89
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:36,551
right?

90
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,390
And there's a risk.

91
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:39,250
The risk is you might
forget where you are,

92
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:40,300
you might lose the thread.

93
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,830
You might say something you regret,

94
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,300
you might get confused.

95
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,033
And it's this,

96
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,770
the talk should be a
process of exploration,

97
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:50,290
like a journey that you're
taking the audience along on.

98
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,180
It's the same when you're reading a novel,

99
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:57,181
like a great novel isn't exactly plotted
out from beginning to end to begin

100
00:03:57,191 --> 00:03:57,820
with.

101
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:02,820
The author is taking himself or herself
and you on an intellectual adventure

102
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:05,470
through the,

103
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:09,160
through the character development and
the characters have to be allowed to live

104
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,400
and to express themselves and
the novel needs to unfold.

105
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,930
It's like a color coy between
the conscious mind and
the unconscious source of

106
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:17,764
inspiration.

107
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:23,010
And the novel is actually a journey
through a characterological landscape.

108
00:04:23,531 --> 00:04:27,460
And the author's shouldn't know where
he or she is going to end up at the

109
00:04:27,461 --> 00:04:27,970
beginning.

110
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,630
Same with an artist and who's
who's writing a song or,

111
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,050
or,

112
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,570
or a piece of music or
a piece of visual art.

113
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,900
There has to be play and
exploration along the way.

114
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,170
And so you also don't want to deliver
an overprepared talk in my estimation,

115
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:44,770
or at least that's not how I do it.

116
00:04:44,771 --> 00:04:46,390
You want to have a theme,

117
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,540
you want to have a body of knowledge
from which you can draw on and then you

118
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,560
want to be actively exploring the
idea in front of the audience.

119
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,750
And that's very gripping for everyone,

120
00:04:55,751 --> 00:04:56,584
including you.

121
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,251
And so,

122
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:59,050
and you should learn
something from the talk.

123
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:01,210
It's an opportunity to think on your feet.

124
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,741
And anyways,

125
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:04,570
that's my style of lecturing.

126
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:05,440
Um,

127
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,190
it's,

128
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,310
it's a trapeze act without a safety net,

129
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:09,911
I would say.

130
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:14,590
And that's part of what makes it gripping
is that there's a high probability of

131
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:15,130
failure.

132
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,780
And I would say with any
performance that's going to be

133
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,473
gripping,

134
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,810
that on the edge of the seat gripping,

135
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:28,000
there has to be a high
probability of failure.

136
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,680
And that's why I don't speak with notes.

137
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:30,790
Um,

138
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,110
if you speak with notes,

139
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,220
which you might have to,

140
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,480
if you're a beginning speaker,

141
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
then you can not fail because
you can always read the notes.

142
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,663
And so there's a,

143
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,100
there's a net you'll fall in
the net but you won't die,

144
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,320
but you'll never do anything spectacular.

145
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,130
So that's the thing is if you're
going to do something spectacular,

146
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,300
you have to take the risk.

147
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:50,740
And if you're going to take the risk,

148
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:51,940
you have to think on your feet.

149
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:54,040
And then you also have to
have something to think about.

150
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:54,551
You have to be,

151
00:05:54,551 --> 00:05:56,050
have been working on this material.

152
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:56,231
You know,

153
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:59,540
I've been working on stuff
I talk about for 30 years,

154
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:01,610
for tens of thousands of hours.

155
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,170
And so have that reservoir
of knowledge I suppose.

156
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:06,801
And you know,

157
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:08,180
whenever I read something new,

158
00:06:08,181 --> 00:06:12,020
I'm slotting it into the node structure
that I use to generate my talks.

159
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:13,940
And I'm reading all the time.

160
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,860
And lots of the things I read,

161
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:16,730
I forget.

162
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,220
They're not relevant
to my central mission,

163
00:06:19,221 --> 00:06:20,600
whatever that happens to be.

164
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,490
It looks like it looks something like
the delineation of the relationship

165
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:27,560
between responsibility and meaning and,

166
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,980
and maybe responsibility
meaning and perception.

167
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:31,850
It's something like that.

168
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:36,110
And so I have a central concern
or deeper than that in some sense.

169
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:37,340
Um,

170
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,340
my central concern was how to ensure
personally that if I was tempted in a

171
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:48,830
situation like the situations that arose
in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany,

172
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:53,831
that I wouldn't fall prey to those
totalitarian systems and act in the re

173
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,320
reprehensible manner that
so many people acted in.

174
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:59,780
That's really been a
driving concern of mine.

175
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,420
And,

176
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:04,490
and that bleeds over into the relationship
between meaning and responsibility

177
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,324
and perception.

178
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,600
So there's a core set of problems that
I'm working on in every talk is an

179
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,490
attempt to further develop those.

180
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,590
So you also have to have a problem.

181
00:07:12,591 --> 00:07:13,424
You know,

182
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:15,891
you think,

183
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,011
well,

184
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:17,060
you don't want to have a problem.

185
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,391
It's like,

186
00:07:17,391 --> 00:07:17,571
yeah,

187
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:17,991
you do,

188
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:18,560
you want to,

189
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,160
you want to,

190
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,720
you've got problems anyways.

191
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,551
If you're alive,

192
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,420
you've got problems.

193
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,380
Pick one of them.

194
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:25,700
It can be your problem.

195
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:26,600
And that can be the problem.

196
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:29,090
You try to address whatever
that happens to be.

197
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:32,540
And then you have some to talk about
how am I going to address this problem?

198
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,160
How can this problem be addressed?

199
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,320
So you need to have a problem too.

200
00:07:36,321 --> 00:07:38,660
If you're going to talk just like you
need to have a problem if you're going to

201
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,970
write because the writing is an
attempt to solve the problem.

202
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:42,650
And so as they're talking,

203
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,420
if you're not trying to solve a problem,

204
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:46,070
what the hell are you doing talking?

205
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,930
Why should anyone care?

206
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,000
It's got to be a real problem to like,

207
00:07:50,001 --> 00:07:50,660
uh,

208
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,170
you know,

209
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,610
a nail biter of a problem,

210
00:07:52,611 --> 00:07:53,960
a dragon have a problem.

211
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:54,930
And if,

212
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,960
if it's a problem that
everyone else shares so much,

213
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:57,794
the better.

214
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,963
So,

215
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,260
and then you grapple with it.

216
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,130
So.
