1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,950
So today I'm going to tell you the
best three stories that I know.

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,220
I think these stories are
absolutely phenomenally
potent and the reason for that

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,730
is that I think they illustrate in an
extraordinarily powerful way the nature of

4
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:31,001
the processes that led
to the establishment of
Western democratic ideals.

5
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:37,760
Rosia Aly outta whose work I rely on
substantial substantially to make the

6
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,971
following argument has taken Western
academic culture to task in a manner that

7
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:47,990
hasn't fully been revealed yet.

8
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:50,750
He said that like all human cultures,

9
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:55,751
the West is parochial and narrow in its
viewpoint and although over the last 300

10
00:00:56,271 --> 00:01:00,210
years there's been a substantial amount
of cross cultural intermingling and a

11
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:03,530
potential broadening of
philosophical and religious horizon.

12
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,710
That broadening has not
been sufficiently complete.

13
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:16,730
If we build on the viewpoint that I've
been developing with you over the last

14
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:21,680
few courses and make the presupposition
that religious modes of thinking are

15
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,140
more phenomenological
than they are rational,

16
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:27,500
which means that they deal more
with what you experience say.

17
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:29,090
Then with the objective world.

18
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:32,360
If we look at our Keck religious
stories through that Lens,

19
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:37,250
then they can start to open up and
so given that I want to open up three

20
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:42,251
religious stories to you today too in
depth and one only in passing because

21
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:45,950
we'll return to it later.

22
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:53,410
I'll start with a Judaeo
Christian myth of genesis.

23
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,820
When I say myth,

24
00:01:55,821 --> 00:01:57,520
I don't mean untrue,

25
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,370
I mean a form of knowledge that's
narrative instructor and predicated on

26
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,350
presumptions that aren't empirical.

27
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,670
A myth describes processes
of transformation.

28
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,660
A myth describes the process whereby
elements of experience come into being and

29
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:12,494
transform.

30
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,610
The fundamental structural

31
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:23,030
elements of genesis are
the word of God and chaos

32
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,620
and Hebrew words for chaos and waste.

33
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:32,810
Our town for chaos and tow who
for waste and Tom in particular,

34
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:37,310
although tto who as well
are very interesting words
because you can track their

35
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:41,450
derivation historically and sometimes
if you can track the derivation of words

36
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:45,200
historically you can get some sense of
the culture mill you out of which the

37
00:02:45,201 --> 00:02:46,040
word spraying.

38
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,890
And we know what time at means because
we have written records of a story that

39
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:54,200
involves a character named ty Matt.

40
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,830
And timeout is a dragon who
lives at the bottom of the ocean.

41
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,190
In the oldest myth we have,

42
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,510
which is the Enuma Elish,

43
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,160
the Samarian creation myth,

44
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,200
Sumeria,

45
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,540
Babylon Acadia,

46
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,160
rightly regarded as the birthplace
of modern western civilization

47
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,190
in genesis two,

48
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:24,780
processes unite to produce being

49
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,560
the first of those processes are states,

50
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:31,670
is chaos represented by Taya Marto,

51
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,940
who the second of those
processes is logos.

52
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:40,530
And Logos is another word that has an
extraordinarily broad range of meaning.

53
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,240
It's generally

54
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:46,530
transcribed in the Christian
tradition has the word,

55
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:48,150
and it's identified with Christ,

56
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:52,290
which is a very peculiar identification
because it's the word of God that

57
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:54,030
creates order out of chaos.

58
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:54,931
And of course,

59
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:59,760
the word of God in Genesis is a phenomena
that predates the birth of Christ

60
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,640
infinitely from a classical
religious perspective.

61
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:09,770
So the fact that the two
beings are identified as of
great peculiarity and also

62
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:11,610
of great interest.
