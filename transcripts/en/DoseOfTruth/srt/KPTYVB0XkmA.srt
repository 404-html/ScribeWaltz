1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,900
So I was thinking the other day

2
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,073
about

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,173
numbers,

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:17,101
you know,

5
00:00:17,101 --> 00:00:21,660
there are mathematicians who think
that there isn't anything more real,

6
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,500
the numbers,

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,770
and that's an interesting proposition.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,080
I mean it's obviously the case that
once you invent or discover numbers that

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,100
that confers on you a tremendous power
and who knows the limits of that power

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,083
and

11
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:48,720
the claim that numbers are more real than
anything else is predicated in part on

12
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:52,930
the fact that when you discover them or
invent them and start to utilize them,

13
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:58,380
that your ability to operate
in the world expands immensely.

14
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,360
And so that's one of the ways of judging
whether or not something is real is

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,000
whether or not when you use it,

16
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,410
that facilitates your means
of operating in the world.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,073
Interestingly,

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,750
numbers are abstractions.

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,350
And so that raises
another question which is,

20
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,753
well,

21
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,440
what's more real?

22
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:33,590
The thing that's being abstracted from
or the abstractions and again that's not

23
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:38,610
obvious and maybe the question
of more real isn't Germane.

24
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:40,740
Maybe it's a question of equal reality,

25
00:01:40,741 --> 00:01:45,570
but it's not obvious that abstractions
aren't real and you can make a strong

26
00:01:45,571 --> 00:01:47,670
case that there are more
real than anything else,

27
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:49,890
and so then you might ask yourself,

28
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,610
well then what are the
most real abstractions?

29
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,960
And so that's what I'm going
to start to talk about tonight.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,730
I'm going to talk about it in
relationship to as many rules as I can

31
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,160
layout simultaneously.

32
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,110
I'll go through the rules first.

33
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,820
So rule one is stand up straight
with your shoulders back,

34
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,780
and rule two is treat yourself like
you're someone responsible for helping a

35
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,601
number three,

36
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,120
which is very tightly
associated with number two.

37
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,530
There are sort of variations on a theme
is make friends with those people who

38
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:32,850
want the best for you.

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,980
And by the way,

40
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:39,300
these last two rules aren't injunctions
designed to make your life easier.

41
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,990
They're actually injunctions designed
to make your life more difficult.

42
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,490
Character Guard said at one
point that his role in life,

43
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:52,620
given that everything was proceeding to
become easier and easier in all possible

44
00:02:52,621 --> 00:02:53,041
ways,

45
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,790
that there would come a time when
people would cry out for difficulty.

46
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,520
And so that's partly how he
envisioned role in the world,

47
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,290
interestingly enough,

48
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:07,120
as a universal benefactor of mankind who
would strive to do nothing other than

49
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:09,430
to make life more difficult for everyone.

50
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,390
Right?

51
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:14,950
And so rule two and three are like that
because treat yourself as if you're

52
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:19,150
someone responsible for helping isn't
the same as be nice to yourself.

53
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,253
It's not that.

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,790
And to associate with people who want
the best for you means that they get to

55
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,380
demand the best from you.

56
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,630
And that's also not an easy thing.

57
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,080
Rule four is compare yourself to who you
were yesterday and not to who someone

58
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,500
else is today.

59
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,720
And that's an injunction about envy,

60
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,160
right?

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:39,993
It's easy.

62
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:45,250
You need people who need things that
are above you because you need to do

63
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,900
something worthwhile with your life.

64
00:03:46,901 --> 00:03:47,980
You need something to a map,

65
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:52,630
but one of the consequences of that is
that you can become envious of people

66
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:57,070
that you believe have attained more
in a deserved or undeserved manner,

67
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,660
and that can make you better.

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,400
And so it's much better to
compare yourself to yourself
and to use yourself as

69
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:05,170
the target for improvement.

70
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:09,190
And comparison rule five is don't let
your children do anything that makes you

71
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,024
dislike them,

72
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,270
and the rule of thumb there
is if you dislike them,

73
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,710
then other people will,

74
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,440
and it's a bad idea to allow your
children to act in a way that makes other

75
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:23,770
children disliked them
or adults disliked them,

76
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,100
given that they're going to have to deal
with children and they're going to have

77
00:04:27,101 --> 00:04:28,120
to deal with adults.

78
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,300
So your primary responsibility as a
parent is to help your child learn how to

79
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:38,581
behave so that the social world opens
up its arms to them and welcomes them at

80
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:42,700
every level and you've done your job.

81
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:43,840
If you can manage that,

82
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,220
and it's not a simple thing to do.

83
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,460
Rule six is put your house in perfect
order before you criticize the world,

84
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:56,370
and that's not take no action for
others until you have your act together.

85
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,950
That isn't what the rule means.

86
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,310
It means that bind your ambition with
humility and work on what's right in front

87
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:11,230
of you that you will suffer
for if you get wrong,

88
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,470
before you engage in the large scale
transformation of other people.

89
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,870
Rule seven is do what is meaningful
and not what is expedient,

90
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,860
and I would say in some
sense in some sense,

91
00:05:26,861 --> 00:05:30,490
that's the core ethos of the book,

92
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,010
not exactly because rule eight,

93
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:38,011
which is tell the truth or at least don't
lie as a necessary conjunction to that

94
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:42,370
are unnecessary additional element
because I don't think that you can pursue

95
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:45,010
what is meaningful
without telling the truth,

96
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,580
and the reason for that is if you don't
tell the truth or let's say if you lie,

97
00:05:48,581 --> 00:05:49,990
which is an easier way to think about it,

98
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:52,690
you corrupt the mechanisms,

99
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:57,691
the instinctual mechanisms that that that
manifest as meaning and then you can't

100
00:05:59,121 --> 00:06:01,970
trust them and that's a very bad idea.

101
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:07,310
So the fundamental reason to not
lie is because you corrupt your own

102
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:08,001
perceptions.

103
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:10,700
If you lie and when you
corrupt your own perceptions,

104
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,180
then you can't rely on yourself
and if you can't rely on yourself,

105
00:06:14,181 --> 00:06:18,770
then well good luck to you because what
are you going to rely on in the absence

106
00:06:18,771 --> 00:06:20,180
of your own judgment?

107
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,340
Your you've got nothing.

108
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:22,760
If you,

109
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,440
if you lose that rule,

110
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:28,580
rule eight a is,

111
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:29,691
as I said,

112
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:30,620
tell the truth or don't,

113
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,880
or at least don't lie.

114
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:32,923
Rule nine,

115
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,250
assume that the person that you're
listening to know something you don't,

116
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:41,120
and that's not so much a mark
of respect for the person,

117
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:46,121
although it is that it's a
mark of recognition of your
own unbearable ignorance.

118
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,060
You know,

119
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,060
one of the things you have to do in
life is decide whether you're more.

120
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,360
You have to make friends more with.

121
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:57,320
Let me see.

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:57,860
Let me,

123
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,660
let me rephrase that properly.

124
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,870
You have to decide what's more important,

125
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,820
what you know or what you don't know.

126
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,291
First of all,

127
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,730
there's a lot of what you don't know,

128
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,120
and so if you make friends with that,

129
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,350
if you decide that's important,

130
00:07:12,351 --> 00:07:13,280
then well,

131
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:16,160
that's a good thing because you're going
to be surrounded by what you don't know

132
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:17,150
your entire life.

133
00:07:17,151 --> 00:07:19,550
And so if you're appreciative of that,

134
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,980
then that's going to make
things go better for you.

135
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,180
But,

136
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,970
but the other element of that is,

137
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,141
well,

138
00:07:27,141 --> 00:07:30,590
why should you be appreciative
of what you don't know?

139
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:31,371
And the answer to that is,

140
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:31,611
well,

141
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:36,500
you shouldn't if you're life is absolutely
perfect in every way you have exactly

142
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:37,640
what you needed and want.

143
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:41,600
You've put everything in order around
you then what you know is sufficient.

144
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:46,601
But if you believe that things could
still be put right around you in your own

145
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:50,150
personal life and with regard
to the effect that you have,

146
00:07:50,151 --> 00:07:50,984
another people,

147
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,080
then obviously what you don't yet know,

148
00:07:53,081 --> 00:07:56,450
it was more important than what you do
know and you should be paying attention

149
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,600
to find out what you don't
know at every possible moment.

150
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,130
And if you're fortunate,

151
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:05,390
when you have a conversation with someone
and you're actually interested in what

152
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:06,224
they say,

153
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,440
then even if they're not
very good at communicating,

154
00:08:09,441 --> 00:08:12,890
even if they're awkward or even if
they display a certain amount of enmity

155
00:08:12,891 --> 00:08:13,724
towards you,

156
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:17,720
there's always the possibility that
they might tell you something you don't

157
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:18,350
know.

158
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:23,150
In which case you can walk away from the
conversation less ignorant and corrupt

159
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,940
than you were when you
started the conversation.

160
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:29,360
And if your life isn't everything
that you would like it to be,

161
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,620
than being slightly less ignorant
and corrupt is probably a good thing,

162
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:39,280
and so the rule 10 years be precise
in your speech and that's that's an

163
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:45,041
observation I would say that that's a
variant of a new testament in junction

164
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:51,371
which is or maybe a description of the
nature of the world which is knock and

165
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:56,711
the door will open and ask and you will
receive which a very strange theory

166
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,643
let's say,

167
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,420
but which I would say is far more in
accordance with what we know about the

168
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:05,040
psychology of perception,

169
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,180
let's say,

170
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,560
than you might imagine
because it is the case that

171
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,880
you don't get what you don't aim at.

172
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,790
You might get what you do a mat and
your aim might get better as you aim as

173
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,061
well,

174
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:22,320
which is something to consider

175
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,510
if you specify the nature of the.

176
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:28,831
Actually.

177
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,850
If you specify the nature of the being
that you want to bring into being,

178
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,180
then you radically increased the
probability that that's what will occur.

179
00:09:36,181 --> 00:09:40,320
And of course you all know that because
you regard yourself at least to some

180
00:09:40,321 --> 00:09:43,590
degree as active creative agents,

181
00:09:43,591 --> 00:09:43,890
right?

182
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,890
Your fundamental attitude towards yourself
at at least in the manner that you

183
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:54,480
act towards yourself is that you wake up
in the morning and you have a landscape

184
00:09:54,481 --> 00:09:59,481
of possibilities that lay themselves
open to you and you make choices between

185
00:09:59,611 --> 00:10:04,080
those possibilities and determined in
consequence how the world is going to

186
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:05,070
manifest itself.

187
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,530
So you confront a field of potential.

188
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,220
That's a good way of thinking about it
and through your choices you determine

189
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,580
which elements of that potential are
going to concretize them selves into the

190
00:10:16,591 --> 00:10:21,591
real world and you are
very unhappy with yourself.

191
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,170
If you don't do that properly and
you're very unhappy with other people.

192
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,410
If they don't do that properly and
you're very unhappy with other people.

193
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:32,220
If they don't treat you like
that's what you're like.

194
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,640
Because part of what
you demand from people,

195
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,700
let's say in terms of sheer civility is
that they act towards you is if you're

196
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:45,300
the locus of voluntary choice in a world
of potential and you are braid each

197
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,260
other for that as well.

198
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:49,110
If you have children and parents,

199
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,310
your parents will say to you,

200
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,173
if you're fortunate,

201
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,310
you're not living up to your potential,

202
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,370
which is actually a compliment in a sense,

203
00:10:56,371 --> 00:11:01,371
even though it's also a judgment and
the compliment is I know perfectly well

204
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:05,400
that you could be more than you are and
you're hang your head if you have any

205
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:08,760
sense and you'll think like you think
in relationship to your own conscience,

206
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:09,660
that yes,

207
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,560
I have a lot of potential that are
not fully realizing and that actually

208
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:18,020
constitutes a transgression
against the good and I don't.

209
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,180
I don't think I've ever met
anyone who doesn't believe that.

210
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:22,043
If you.

211
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:25,200
If you have a reasonable
conversation with them,

212
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,900
it just seems self evident.

213
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:28,471
I mean,

214
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,920
maybe now and then you meet someone
who's narcissistically self satisfied,

215
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,770
but then they're narcissistic
and that's not good.

216
00:11:34,771 --> 00:11:35,270
That as a,

217
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,380
as a medium to longterm strategy,

218
00:11:37,381 --> 00:11:39,900
that's a catastrophe
that ends in disaster.

219
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:40,630
You know,

220
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:41,580
it's a short term.

221
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:42,540
It protects people,

222
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,200
but longterm it's.

223
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:45,960
It's not good in the least,

224
00:11:45,961 --> 00:11:47,970
and of course other people
don't appreciate it as well.

225
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:53,070
Rule 11 is don't bother children when
they're skateboarding and that's actually

226
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,120
a discussion of courage,

227
00:11:55,150 --> 00:12:00,150
of encouragement more more specifically
because I've been trying to understand,

228
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:01,024
for example,

229
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,620
what role parents play in the lives of
their children and I would say this is a

230
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:10,621
role that that that is a fundamental
importance as well as attempting to guide

231
00:12:12,191 --> 00:12:16,930
your children so that they
act in a socially desirable
manner so that the world

232
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,370
opens itself up to them.

233
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,100
You also want to encourage them,

234
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,380
which is not the same as sheltering them.

235
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,330
It's not the same at all.

236
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:29,920
And to encourage someone
is to say something like or
to act out something like,

237
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,461
look,

238
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:31,294
kid,

239
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,540
as you move,

240
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,260
the world's already difficult because
the world isn't easy for children anymore

241
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,440
than it's easy for adults.

242
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,900
The difficulties are they're not the same.

243
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,430
Their child's size difficulties,

244
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:44,050
but there are still difficulties.

245
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,890
The world is a very hard place and it's
a bitter place in many ways and it's not

246
00:12:50,711 --> 00:12:52,120
only a hard and bitter place.

247
00:12:52,121 --> 00:12:56,560
It's also touched with betrayal and
malevolence and that's the fundamental

248
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,394
bottom line,

249
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:02,730
but there's something in you that is
capable of taking that full on and

250
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:07,600
transcending it and that encouragement.

251
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:08,261
You say,

252
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:09,070
well,

253
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,290
as difficult as things are,

254
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,720
you're up to the challenge and to
interfere with children when they're

255
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:17,440
skateboarding.

256
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,011
For example,

257
00:13:18,011 --> 00:13:18,844
when they're doing,

258
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:23,890
let's say in advisably dangerous
things which kids of course do.

259
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,150
If they're skateboarding.

260
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:31,050
To interfere with that is to interfere
with the child's willingness to

261
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:36,880
voluntarily expose themselves to the
risks that they need to expose themselves

262
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:42,490
to in order to develop this sort of
competence that allows them to thrive in a

263
00:13:42,491 --> 00:13:44,650
world they cannot be sheltered from.

264
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:51,060
And so to interfere with children when
they're taking the necessary risks is not

265
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,840
love or empathy,

266
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,340
but cowardice on the part of parents
and it's deeply damaging to children.

267
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,740
And I can tell you as a
clinical psychologist,

268
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:04,790
I've never had a client come to
my office in all the hundreds in,

269
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,730
in,

270
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,280
in all of the hundreds of encounters
I've had with people in my office.

271
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:14,140
I've never had a client say my
parents made me to independent.

272
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,120
Right?

273
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,190
That hasn't happened once.

274
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:23,940
Right now my parents made me too dependent
or I conspired with my parents to

275
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,880
perpetuate my dependence.

276
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,250
That happened all the time.

277
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,580
So there's a rule of thumb,

278
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,660
which I think is a good one,

279
00:14:34,661 --> 00:14:38,860
which I believe is often
applied in nursing homes by
people who work in nursing

280
00:14:38,861 --> 00:14:39,131
homes,

281
00:14:39,131 --> 00:14:40,960
which is of course a very difficult job.

282
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,700
And the rule is do not do anything
for anyone they can do for themselves.

283
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,180
And the reason for that is
that it's a form of theft,

284
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:50,381
right?

285
00:14:50,381 --> 00:14:51,320
You don't first all,

286
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:51,800
if you.

287
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,760
If you do something for someone and
it facilitates their movement forward,

288
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,850
then they moved forward
because you help them.

289
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,390
Which is something I was very
careful about as a therapist.

290
00:15:02,391 --> 00:15:05,810
I don't want to give my
clients advice first.

291
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,220
It might fail,

292
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:11,300
in which case they are going to
pay for my advice and second,

293
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:12,320
if it succeeds,

294
00:15:12,321 --> 00:15:17,210
then I get to be the successful one and
I don't want to steal the success from

295
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,044
my clients.

296
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,340
That's a bad idea.

297
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:24,500
I want to help them figure out what it
is that they should aim at and then help

298
00:15:24,501 --> 00:15:29,501
plot out a strategy for attaining that
and but I want to ensure that it's their

299
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,130
destiny,

300
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,170
not something I'm imposing,

301
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,950
and of course the imposition of that
sort of thing is the hallmark of a bad,

302
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,900
I would say therapeutic relationship,

303
00:15:38,901 --> 00:15:41,780
but also a bad relationship period.

304
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:42,711
Right?

305
00:15:42,711 --> 00:15:45,500
So one of the things you want
to do with your partners,

306
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:49,250
your spouse or your say your husband
or wife and also with your children,

307
00:15:49,251 --> 00:15:53,600
is to listen to them so that you can
figure out what their problems are and

308
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:56,450
figure out with them because they're
going to figure that out by communicating

309
00:15:56,451 --> 00:16:00,290
and then perhaps aid them in
the development of a strategy,

310
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:05,060
but you have to ensure very carefully
that you're not imposing your own

311
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,740
structure in a manner that's
going to steal from them.

312
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,120
What's rightfully theirs,

313
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,843
so,

314
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:18,350
so rule 11 is an injunction to courage
as the fundamental because you could say,

315
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:19,101
well,

316
00:16:19,101 --> 00:16:21,440
what's the antidote to
the catastrophe of life?

317
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,420
And one answer might be safety.

318
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:24,171
It's like,

319
00:16:24,171 --> 00:16:24,411
well,

320
00:16:24,411 --> 00:16:24,710
you know,

321
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:29,570
look everyone sensible enough to know
that a certain amount of provision for

322
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,404
safety is,

323
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,640
is worthwhile.

324
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,240
You should probably wear your seat belts
when you're driving around in your car

325
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,000
because why take fool hardy risks,

326
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,810
but given that there
is no security in life,

327
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,930
in the final analysis than encouragement
is a much better medication than

328
00:16:47,751 --> 00:16:50,150
sheltering and so,

329
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:51,840
and that was,

330
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,400
that's,

331
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,400
that's I think in keeping with the idea
that what life is essentially is not a

332
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:03,140
place to attain happiness or even to aim
for happiness even though you should be

333
00:17:03,141 --> 00:17:05,240
grateful if someone
comes along now and then,

334
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,610
but a call to something like adventure.

335
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,270
And I think that's the proper
way of conceptualizing it.

336
00:17:11,271 --> 00:17:13,700
Certainly if you go watch a story,

337
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:14,280
a movie,

338
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,170
read a book,

339
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,221
something like that.

340
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:19,130
If you encounter a
narrative that's gripping,

341
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,550
whether it's a romance or
a classic adventure story,

342
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:26,210
then the element of it that's
gripping is the adventure,

343
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:31,400
and so to portray life as an adventure
in romance and and in the world is the

344
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:35,060
proper way to portray
it and the way that you

345
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:40,100
facilitate the adventure
is through encouragement.

346
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,140
I had a client once.

347
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:42,951
I really liked him.

348
00:17:42,951 --> 00:17:43,820
He was a good guy,

349
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:44,763
smart guy,

350
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,430
good looking young guy,

351
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:48,410
had everything going for him.

352
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,170
You know,

353
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,040
he's a good musician.

354
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,300
He was a talented athlete,

355
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,600
but he hadn't been encouraged.

356
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:56,434
I wouldn't say

357
00:17:58,030 --> 00:18:00,220
he told me about his
relationship with his girlfriend.

358
00:18:00,221 --> 00:18:01,054
He said

359
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:06,650
his girlfriend wanted to go
biking around southern Ontario.

360
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:12,490
She was about 19 or 20 and he thought
he might join her and when she went and

361
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,760
talked to her parents,

362
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:19,630
they made every provision possible to
help her prepare for the journey to make

363
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:20,930
sure her bike was in good shape,

364
00:18:20,931 --> 00:18:24,080
to make sure she had the right
equipment to help her plot out a route,

365
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,210
and when he went and
talked to his parents,

366
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:30,380
all they did was worried that he was
going to get hurt and like he might get

367
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:33,140
hurt because people get hurt,

368
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,240
but they didn't understand that they
were choosing between the hurt that he

369
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:41,120
might encounter by going out in
the world and having an adventure,

370
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,080
let's say with his girlfriend or the hurt
that he would encounter by staying at

371
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:45,890
home,

372
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:47,390
towering in his basement,

373
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,480
under the protection of
his over loving parents.

374
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:50,901
Well,

375
00:18:50,901 --> 00:18:53,450
his girlfriend ventured
bravely into the world.

376
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,111
You think,

377
00:18:54,111 --> 00:18:54,261
well,

378
00:18:54,261 --> 00:18:56,810
which of those two things is
most likely to be damaging?

379
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,010
And their answer to that is,

380
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:58,461
well,

381
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,510
his parents wouldn't
worry as much as if he.

382
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,280
If he was in the basement
and that's the wrong worry.

383
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:06,290
Even because they should worry more.

384
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,590
Not less so in rural 12,

385
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,750
his pedicab when you encounter one on
the street and it's a oddly enough,

386
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,410
a meditation on fragility.

387
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,970
It's a discussion of what you do when
you don't know what to do and that's

388
00:19:24,981 --> 00:19:27,590
really when things have
gone badly for you.

389
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:32,180
When you face a terrible tragedy in your
own personal life or in your familiar

390
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:34,160
life or perhaps even in
the life of your community.

391
00:19:34,161 --> 00:19:37,330
When things come crowding
in and you too quickly in,

392
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:37,780
in,

393
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,480
in the case of a death in the family or
a terrible illness or the collapse of a

394
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:45,260
dream or any of the things
that can flip your world.

395
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,360
Upside down is how do you cope with that.

396
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:52,361
And that chapter contains discussion
of the necessity of narrowing your

397
00:19:54,561 --> 00:19:55,400
timeframe.

398
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:59,990
Because sometimes the right way to
look at the world is across years and

399
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,890
sometimes it's across months and
when things are more out of control,

400
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:07,610
perhaps it's across days
and when things are really.

401
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,260
When you're really up against the wall,

402
00:20:09,261 --> 00:20:14,261
it's a car across hours or even minutes
and during those minutes then you

403
00:20:14,511 --> 00:20:16,940
concentrate on doing as well as you can.

404
00:20:16,941 --> 00:20:20,930
With what's right in front of you for
the longest unit of time that you can

405
00:20:20,931 --> 00:20:22,760
tolerate conceptualizing.

406
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,960
Maybe that's what you do at someone's
deathbed and while you're doing that and

407
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:28,310
suffering away madly,

408
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:32,420
then you also take the time to
appreciate everything you can.

409
00:20:32,421 --> 00:20:33,740
That manifests itself,

410
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:36,110
that allows itself to be appreciated.

411
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,600
And so that's the metaphor of the cat,

412
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,620
I suppose.

413
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:44,300
And so that's the 12 rules and I'll
return to rule one which is stand up

414
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:45,680
straight with your shoulders back,

415
00:20:45,681 --> 00:20:50,470
and I'm going to use it as platform
for laying out the abstractions that I

416
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:53,470
talked to at the beginning of the lecture.

417
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,660
So some of you might be familiar
with the central Dallas symbol.

418
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:04,010
It's a symbol of dao and
dow is a very strange word.

419
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:07,840
It doesn't have an easily
translatable single meaning,

420
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,790
at least in English.

421
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,470
It means a variety of things.

422
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:13,090
That means the path of life.

423
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:16,840
So that would mean that the path that you
take as you move forward through life,

424
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,210
but it would mean more
also the proper path.

425
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,141
So it's that.

426
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:21,520
It's the proper path through life.

427
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,620
So the idea dow is a symbol of reality
and one of the things that means is the

428
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:27,910
path you take through life,

429
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:32,911
and so there's an implicit idea there
that the fundamental reality of life is

430
00:21:32,921 --> 00:21:34,450
the path you take through life.

431
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,310
It's not a materialist idea,

432
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,810
it's a different kind of idea.

433
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,100
It's the idea that life is a journey while
we're mobile creatures and we're on a

434
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:46,480
journey and the best way to conceptualize
reality is as the place that you

435
00:21:46,481 --> 00:21:47,470
journey through,

436
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,730
and the question is,

437
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,241
well,

438
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:50,560
what are the elements?

439
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:53,990
What are the constituent elements of
the place that you journey through?

440
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,610
Because that's also part of Dow and the
Dallas believed that that's the Yin and

441
00:21:57,611 --> 00:21:58,061
Yang,

442
00:21:58,061 --> 00:22:02,530
and Yin is the black serpent because
those are two serpent's head to head that

443
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:04,210
make up the totality of the world,

444
00:22:04,211 --> 00:22:07,210
and the black serpent is Yin and Yang.

445
00:22:07,211 --> 00:22:08,560
Yin is feminine.

446
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,000
Classically speaking,

447
00:22:10,001 --> 00:22:11,200
from the Taoist perspective,

448
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:13,330
it's a symbolic representation.

449
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,420
It doesn't mean that women
are Yin and that men,

450
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,200
men aren't.

451
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,200
It's not that it's an attempt to use
sexual symbolism to represent a deeper

452
00:22:22,931 --> 00:22:23,920
underlying reality,

453
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,600
and Yang is masculine.

454
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,810
Urine is dark and night and there's a
white.in the black serpent and there's a

455
00:22:32,141 --> 00:22:33,640
black.in the white serpent.

456
00:22:33,641 --> 00:22:38,230
The serpent is the daytime and masculinity
and it's the interplay between those

457
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:42,400
two things that make up reality and
one can transform into the other at any

458
00:22:42,401 --> 00:22:43,210
moment,

459
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,760
and so that's the Taoist idea of reality,

460
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:50,140
and so there's Yin and Yang and they
make up the world and the question is

461
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,520
perhaps act question is,

462
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:51,881
well,

463
00:22:51,881 --> 00:22:53,710
what exactly does that mean?

464
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,360
Well,

465
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,680
it actually means something.

466
00:22:56,681 --> 00:23:00,910
It's a kind of abstraction and
it's actually an incredibly
helpful obstruction.

467
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,310
Once you understand the abstraction,

468
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:07,270
it might be the most real
abstraction there is.

469
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,810
So I'm going to lay out a
little bit on layout for you,

470
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:13,300
a little bit about what
these two domains refer to,

471
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:17,260
and then I'm going to make a case that
they're real and then I'm going to tell

472
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:19,510
you what it means that they're real.

473
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:25,470
So you could think of Yin as chaos.

474
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,830
Now we need to know what chaos is now.

475
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:33,730
Chaos is what God made the world
out of at the beginning of time.

476
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:36,390
So one of the things that chaos is this,

477
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:40,510
something like potential
and so you can imagine,

478
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,990
and this is not how we think as modern
people because we tend to think in a

479
00:23:43,991 --> 00:23:44,830
materialist way,

480
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,280
but it is how we act

481
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,360
and as I said already,

482
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:52,870
you act as if you confront potential and
you treat potential as if it's real and

483
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:59,720
if your attitude towards it confers
on you a certain moral obligation,

484
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,930
which is why you know what people mean
when they say you're not living up to

485
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,194
your potential.

486
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:08,120
No one ever says,

487
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,790
well what do you mean by potential?

488
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,040
Not unless they're being argumentative,

489
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:16,430
because you already know
and very few people say,

490
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,740
while I'm fully living up to my potential.

491
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:23,920
So you admit to the reality that
undergirds that conception that makes that

492
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:26,540
question and possibility immediately.

493
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,040
The potential is while
potential is the future.

494
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:34,280
That's part of it and we
believe in the future.

495
00:24:34,281 --> 00:24:35,570
We believe that it exists.

496
00:24:35,571 --> 00:24:38,390
Even though it isn't here
and it's not measurable.

497
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:38,870
It's.

498
00:24:38,870 --> 00:24:43,640
It only exists as a potential
set of realizable possibilities.

499
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,580
That's what the future is and
it's really what we contend with.

500
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,100
We don't really contend
with the present precisely.

501
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,120
We Orient Ourselves towards the future
and the future comes at us from every

502
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:55,490
direction and we we,

503
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,550
we decide as we encounter the future,

504
00:24:58,551 --> 00:25:03,290
which parts of it we're going to interact
with and how we're going to construct

505
00:25:03,291 --> 00:25:05,900
the present and the past as
a consequence of doing that,

506
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:10,370
and so part of chaos is potential
and that's the positive part.

507
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:13,460
It's like if you're in a bind,

508
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,380
what you look for is potential.

509
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,540
Is there another way of
conceptualizing this?

510
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,530
Do I have a different way of of acting?

511
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,150
Can I make another plan?

512
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,960
Is there something that I'm not taking
into account that would make this

513
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,700
terrible situation tolerable?

514
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:33,970
That's all an attempt to to call upon
potential and to use it to transfigure a

515
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:40,150
reality that's intolerable and maybe it's
intolerable because of the way you're

516
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,270
conceptualizing it.

517
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:41,631
Now.

518
00:25:41,631 --> 00:25:44,300
I'm not being naive about that.

519
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,650
I understand perfectly well that people
can find themselves so badly cornered in

520
00:25:48,651 --> 00:25:52,340
life that they're basically
done no matter what they do.

521
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:57,410
People obviously developed fatal illnesses
and they die and their businesses

522
00:25:57,411 --> 00:26:02,300
collapsed and genuinely terrible things
can happen to you that aren't your

523
00:26:02,301 --> 00:26:02,900
fault,

524
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,460
that you can't fix.

525
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,360
I'm not saying that you can just
gerrymander the world by changing your

526
00:26:08,361 --> 00:26:08,841
attitude.

527
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:10,250
It's not that straightforward,

528
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:15,910
but I am saying that you have a tremendous
ability to transform the landscape of

529
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:21,050
possibility that reveals itself in
front of you and that when things are

530
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:21,680
terrible,

531
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,450
that's your best bet.

532
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,940
It doesn't mean it will succeed.

533
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,650
It just means you don't have
a better option and so chaos.

534
00:26:30,651 --> 00:26:35,120
That potential is also something that
manifests itself in a terrible manner.

535
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:36,310
So imagine this.

536
00:26:36,311 --> 00:26:37,730
This is a good way of thinking about it.

537
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,910
So imagine that you have
an intimate relationship.

538
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,220
Let's say a marriage and the marriage
is predicated on trust and fidelity,

539
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,280
which is a variant of trust,

540
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,760
and that trust and fidelity
is an axiom of your memories.

541
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:57,481
You might think,

542
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:57,631
well,

543
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:58,470
what does that mean?

544
00:26:58,471 --> 00:26:59,070
It's like,

545
00:26:59,070 --> 00:26:59,520
well,

546
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,510
let's play it out.

547
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,720
Imagine you've been married for 10 years
and then your wife tells you that she

548
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:08,040
has had three affairs.

549
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:12,480
Each of them lasted three years and the
last one has lasted five years and it's

550
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:13,470
still ongoing.

551
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,090
Or maybe you discover that,

552
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,703
okay,

553
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,090
so then you might say,

554
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:18,630
well,

555
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:20,220
what happens then?

556
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:21,841
Well,

557
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:24,540
what happens is that everything
you thought was wrong.

558
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:25,651
Right,

559
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:30,000
and this is such an interesting thing
because it actually means you had the past

560
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,400
and you think the past is fixed.

561
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,660
It's done with.

562
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,190
That's why it's the past,

563
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,940
but all of a sudden you find out that
one of the things that you thought about

564
00:27:38,941 --> 00:27:43,560
the past and it happens to be a very
important thing wasn't true at all.

565
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,520
And so what that means is that whole
past that you thought was what it was,

566
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,650
wasn't what it was at all.

567
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:55,130
And so it transforms itself from an
actuality into potential and most of that

568
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:57,990
potential is negative.

569
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,800
Unless you're relieved that
your wife had an affair.

570
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:02,963
Well,

571
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,270
but that's an important consideration
because you know you can imagine a

572
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:11,271
situation where your marriage
is dreadfully unhappy and
you're just looking for

573
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:12,900
an excuse to leave.

574
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,060
It's possible that that revelation,

575
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,620
even though it would be shocking,

576
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,900
would also come with a fair bit of relief,

577
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,220
and so this potential,

578
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,370
the potential that manifests
itself even when it's unexpected,

579
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,750
it doesn't only necessarily
manifest itself in a negative guys,

580
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,040
it can also free,

581
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:29,840
you know,

582
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,680
and and if your marriage was unhappy,

583
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:33,270
even if you wanted to cling to it,

584
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:38,510
if your marriage wasn't happy and the
betrayal was revealed and you're divorced

585
00:28:39,121 --> 00:28:40,770
and you set yourself up in two years,

586
00:28:40,771 --> 00:28:42,540
you might be in a better
place than you were.

587
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,000
It's not a pathway I'm
recommending by the way.

588
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,760
I'm just saying that it's more
complicated than it looks.

589
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,030
That's the introduction
of chaos into order.

590
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,021
Right?

591
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,610
And the the,

592
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:58,760
the oldest story we have is something
like order is susceptible to disruption by

593
00:29:00,751 --> 00:29:04,110
chaos and the human.

594
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,870
That the fundamental demand that's made
on the human being is to contend with

595
00:29:09,871 --> 00:29:11,490
the chaos that disrupts order.

596
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,790
Not to live in order and
not to live in chaos,

597
00:29:14,791 --> 00:29:18,090
but to be able to contend with
the chaos that disrupts order.

598
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,010
And so when you encourage your children,

599
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:20,844
for example,

600
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,170
what you're doing is encouraging them
to become the masters of the chaos that

601
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:28,080
can disrupt order rather
than denizens of order,

602
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,750
which makes them tyrants
or Denisons of chaos,

603
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,820
which makes them nihilistic and hopeless.

604
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,070
So you train your children,

605
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,850
you encourage your children and yourself
and your partner if you have any sense

606
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:43,720
to be a master of emergent chaos
and to be able to contend with that.

607
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,153
And so,

608
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:50,330
so chaos has potential
and it's this disruptive.

609
00:29:50,810 --> 00:29:55,810
It's the capacity of the infinite world
to disrupt your finite considerations.

610
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:57,680
That's another way of looking at it.

611
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:02,690
Another way of looking at it is it's the
serpent in the garden of Eden and the

612
00:30:02,691 --> 00:30:06,650
reason that that story is set up the
way it is is because it's trying to

613
00:30:06,651 --> 00:30:11,651
represent that there is no place
that so bounded and secure,

614
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,650
even if it's set up by God himself that
doesn't have an agent of chaos inside

615
00:30:18,561 --> 00:30:19,250
it.

616
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:22,490
It's exactly the same idea that
the Dallas put forward with their,

617
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:24,620
with their symbolic representation.

618
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,110
It's just portrayed in a different manner.

619
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,703
The question is,

620
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,253
well,

621
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:35,450
what do you do in the garden given that
there's a snake in it and the answer to

622
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:40,451
that is something like you become the
master of snakes and so and that's a deep

623
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,040
idea.

624
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,970
That's the same idea as confronting
the dragon and getting the treasure.

625
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:51,320
That's the same idea as going to the
bottom of the ocean and rescuing your

626
00:30:51,321 --> 00:30:52,970
father from the belly of the whale.

627
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,130
It's the same idea and that's an element
in the greatest of stories in the

628
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:00,200
greatest of stories is heroic,

629
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,430
heroic story and the heroic story is to
voluntarily confront the unknown when it

630
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:08,870
manifests itself and together something
of value as a consequence and to share

631
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:09,740
it with the community.

632
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,850
There isn't a story that's more emblematic
of what it means to be human then

633
00:31:13,851 --> 00:31:14,510
that,

634
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:16,850
that that is us.

635
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,620
That's our best bet.

636
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:20,841
All right,

637
00:31:20,841 --> 00:31:22,340
so chaos.

638
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:27,290
Chaos is the catastrophe that
will suddenly enter your life.

639
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,820
Chaos is the flood.

640
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,230
That's definitely coming.

641
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:35,100
Chaos is the ever present possibility
of apocalypse in your personal life and

642
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,570
your familiar life and in
this broader social life,

643
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,260
right?

644
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:44,260
Chaos is the consequence of your finite
fragility existing in a world that's

645
00:31:44,481 --> 00:31:45,380
beyond you.

646
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,510
Chaos is potential.

647
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,370
Chaos is what lies before you.

648
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,020
Chaos is what you can call on when you
need something to rescue yourself from

649
00:31:54,021 --> 00:31:55,370
malfunctioning order.

650
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,950
It's a permanent element of existence.

651
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:00,170
Chaos is what you don't know.

652
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,650
Chaos is what's outside the fire.

653
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:06,290
Chaos is what's outside
the walls of your house.

654
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,260
Chaos is what's outside
the walls of your town.

655
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,860
Chaos is what's outside of
the borders of your country.

656
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,300
All of that is chaos and potential

657
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:19,993
order

658
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:27,270
order is where you are when what you're
doing is working in the manner that you

659
00:32:27,491 --> 00:32:28,324
intended,

660
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:29,531
okay?

661
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,240
It's a very specific definition.

662
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,460
How do you know that you
know what you're doing?

663
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,031
Well,

664
00:32:34,031 --> 00:32:36,490
you don't because you don't know what
you're doing because you don't know

665
00:32:36,491 --> 00:32:37,180
everything.

666
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:41,180
Everything you do is bounded by ignorance
while you still have to operate in the

667
00:32:41,181 --> 00:32:41,780
world,

668
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:46,780
and so what you do is you make finite
plans and the new execute plans and then

669
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:52,211
you execute strategies to to make
those plans manifest themselves,

670
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,890
and if the plan's manifest
themselves the way that you desired,

671
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:58,400
then you regard your
knowledge as sufficient.

672
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,330
That's your definition of truth and it's
the only definition of truth that you

673
00:33:02,331 --> 00:33:07,010
can use because you don't have everything
at hand and when you're aware what

674
00:33:07,011 --> 00:33:10,850
you're doing is working that's
order and you might think,

675
00:33:10,851 --> 00:33:11,001
well,

676
00:33:11,001 --> 00:33:16,001
I should just stay there because that's
a comfortable place to be and there's a

677
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:19,160
certain amount of truth to
that except for one thing.

678
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:20,773
If you've

679
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:28,820
defined a domain of order and
you stand in it and you wait,

680
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:34,730
the disorder will enter all by
itself because things aren't static.

681
00:33:34,731 --> 00:33:39,731
Things change all the time and your
attempt to bind yourself within a static

682
00:33:39,891 --> 00:33:44,891
structure is destined to fail because
everything around you is in flux and the

683
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:50,450
thing that you parceled out as permanent
will transform itself across time.

684
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:51,860
Here's an example.

685
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,080
Let's say you're a perfectly well adapted
11 year old and it's actually possible

686
00:33:57,081 --> 00:34:00,200
to meet 11 year old children are often
very delightful because they're like

687
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:01,160
adult children,

688
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:02,780
they're not teenagers.

689
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,690
They're like they're.

690
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:08,930
They're the most mature form of children
and they can be really delightful

691
00:34:08,931 --> 00:34:13,931
people and then like three years later
you hate them and and the reason for that

692
00:34:14,751 --> 00:34:15,860
is that of course,

693
00:34:15,861 --> 00:34:17,150
as soon as they hit puberty,

694
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,090
which is the emergence of chaos into the,

695
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:23,000
into the already developed
childhood structures,

696
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:26,990
really the emergence of sexuality into
a structure that didn't have to adapt to

697
00:34:26,991 --> 00:34:30,050
sexuality and maybe even the emergence
of aggression to some degree,

698
00:34:30,051 --> 00:34:31,280
but mostly sexuality.

699
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,730
If the child maintains only the 11 year
old personality by the time they're 16,

700
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,920
they're no longer a
delightful 11 year old.

701
00:34:39,921 --> 00:34:43,850
There are very immature 16 year old and
the reason that I'm pointing that out is

702
00:34:43,851 --> 00:34:47,570
because just because something works for
you now doesn't mean it's going to work

703
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:51,890
for you five years from now and
so in order to remain stable,

704
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:53,480
you can't be stagnant.

705
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:54,860
They're not the same thing.

706
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,170
Stability is a dynamic,

707
00:34:57,910 --> 00:34:59,870
not a not something static,

708
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,750
and so not only do you
have to be where you are,

709
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,410
but you have to be going to where you're
going and you have to be participating

710
00:35:06,411 --> 00:35:07,940
in both of those things actively,

711
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,540
so it's stability plus transformation
and I would say that manifests itself.

712
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:17,450
You know when you're there because
that manifests itself as meaningful.

713
00:35:17,570 --> 00:35:19,940
That's actually the instinct of meaning,

714
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:24,500
which is an instinct and perhaps the
deepest instinct is precisely the instinct

715
00:35:24,501 --> 00:35:27,560
that tells you when were you
are a sufficiently stable,

716
00:35:27,561 --> 00:35:32,090
but you're transforming yourself at a
sufficient rate to keep up with everything

717
00:35:32,091 --> 00:35:35,330
that's changing and you know that
because if you're at your job,

718
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,770
you might say to yourself,

719
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:37,741
well,

720
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:38,940
my job is really secure,

721
00:35:38,941 --> 00:35:41,910
but it's not very
challenging and you think,

722
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:42,380
well,

723
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,680
why do you care about that?

724
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,890
It's very secure and
the answer to that is,

725
00:35:46,891 --> 00:35:47,071
well,

726
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:48,180
if it's not challenging,

727
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,010
it's deadening in a sense,

728
00:35:50,011 --> 00:35:50,221
right?

729
00:35:50,221 --> 00:35:51,570
The spirit goes out of it.

730
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,860
If it's not challenging,

731
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:55,890
you need to be challenged and why is that?

732
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:56,281
Well,

733
00:35:56,281 --> 00:35:56,791
the answer is,

734
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:57,390
well,

735
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:01,920
tomorrow is coming and whoever you are
now isn't enough for tomorrow and so

736
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,300
today you also have to be preparing for
tomorrow and next week and next year,

737
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:10,650
and if your job isn't challenging than
it isn't doing that for you and you find

738
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,371
it deadening,

739
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:12,360
not meaningful,

740
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:16,920
and the reason for that is that it
violates your most essential instinct and

741
00:36:16,921 --> 00:36:21,921
your most essential instinct
is the instinct for meaning
and it signifies that.

742
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:26,370
It actually signifies that you have the
balance between chaos and order right

743
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:27,601
deeply,

744
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:28,434
right?

745
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:32,010
Which is why it's the most fundamental
of instincts because chaos in order are

746
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:33,840
the most real of things.

747
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,580
All right,

748
00:36:35,581 --> 00:36:40,320
so you have the chaos that surrounds
you and in some some sense infinite in

749
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:41,154
scope,

750
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,860
and then you have the
order that you produce,

751
00:36:43,861 --> 00:36:46,440
which is your mastery of it.

752
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:46,920
Well,

753
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,570
let's take order apart for a minute.

754
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:52,320
We want to think about the
structure of order and bill,

755
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:55,500
and I'm not saying that chaos
is bad in order as good.

756
00:36:55,501 --> 00:36:56,550
I'm not saying that at all.

757
00:36:56,551 --> 00:36:58,050
That's not the right way to look at it.

758
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,213
It's the balance.

759
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,010
It's the balance between them
that's of crucial importance.

760
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:02,830
They just take.

761
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,950
They exist as superordinate categories.

762
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,920
Whether you liked them or not
is really not that relevant.

763
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,720
They're they're,

764
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,870
they're fundamental constituent
elements of reality.

765
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,610
You might say,

766
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:14,881
well,

767
00:37:14,881 --> 00:37:16,170
what's your evidence for that?

768
00:37:16,171 --> 00:37:20,400
And I can tell you one piece of evidence
which I won't go into for for very much

769
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,234
time.

770
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:24,870
You have two hemispheres
and each in your brain,

771
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,970
the brain is composed of two hemispheres,

772
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,880
which implies something about
the nature of the world,

773
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,050
given that your brain is hypothetically
adapted to the structure of the world.

774
00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:37,950
It's not just your brain because
animal brains have the same fundamental

775
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:38,941
structure,

776
00:37:38,941 --> 00:37:43,440
this bifurcated structure and the
bifurcation indicates that there's two

777
00:37:43,441 --> 00:37:47,340
fundamental realities because otherwise
why would you need a bifurcated

778
00:37:47,341 --> 00:37:52,170
structure or maybe you needed triune
brain or one that's divided into four,

779
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:53,400
but that isn't what you have.

780
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:58,500
You have one that's divided into two and
if your working definition of reality

781
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,700
is scientific,

782
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:00,781
biological,

783
00:38:00,781 --> 00:38:01,560
let's say,

784
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:06,300
then your definition of reality is
reality is that which shapes life.

785
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:10,500
You can't actually do better than
that from a Darwinian perspective,

786
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:15,690
and if the reality that shaped life
produced a bifurcated representational

787
00:38:15,691 --> 00:38:16,500
structure,

788
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,450
then that implies that the proper way
to represent reality and perhaps that

789
00:38:21,451 --> 00:38:25,710
reality itself is in fact bifurcated and
I believe it's bifurcated in the manner

790
00:38:25,711 --> 00:38:30,150
I just described and the neurological
evidence for that is actually quite

791
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:30,984
overwhelming.

792
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,640
It's come from multiple sources,

793
00:38:32,641 --> 00:38:33,600
some of them Russian,

794
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:35,010
some of them American.

795
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,760
That's where most of
the work has been done.

796
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:41,650
Your left hemisphere is specialized for
operation in those situations that you

797
00:38:41,651 --> 00:38:43,120
know and understand,

798
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:47,320
and your right hemisphere is specialized
for operation in those situations that

799
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:49,810
you neither know nor understand,

800
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,060
and the proper way to orient yourself
in life is to get the balance between

801
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:57,640
those two sets of operations correct,

802
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,130
and the way that manifests itself in
your subjective experiences as meaningful

803
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:03,964
engagement.

804
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,380
And so that's not a bad first pass.

805
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,600
What would you say?

806
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,930
Justification for the view that these
two domains are the most real domains.

807
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:19,031
Okay,

808
00:39:19,031 --> 00:39:19,930
so order.

809
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,063
What is order?

810
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,253
Well,

811
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,420
if you just sit there and do nothing,

812
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,190
that will be chaos.

813
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,533
Why?

814
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:28,811
Well,

815
00:39:28,811 --> 00:39:29,580
because you'll.

816
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,730
You'll suffer and die.

817
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,200
That's what will happen.

818
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,470
So without action on your part.

819
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,590
Deterioration in death is a certainty.

820
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:39,670
Okay,

821
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,780
so you need to act.

822
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,760
While when we built on an action
platform been where the consequence of

823
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:53,780
3 billion years of evolution for action,

824
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:55,341
action,

825
00:39:55,341 --> 00:40:00,341
movement forward in the face of
necessity is the prime dictum of life.

826
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,270
That's a good way of thinking about it.

827
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,160
Were embodied action.

828
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,580
What do you have to do when you act?

829
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:08,480
Well,

830
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,021
at minimum,

831
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:11,180
you have to do whatever
keeps you able to act.

832
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,530
These are truisms,

833
00:40:12,531 --> 00:40:12,771
right?

834
00:40:12,771 --> 00:40:13,370
I mean,

835
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,630
you have to have something to eat.

836
00:40:14,631 --> 00:40:16,400
You have to have some fresh water.

837
00:40:16,401 --> 00:40:17,660
You need some shelter,

838
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:18,440
right?

839
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,890
You need some companionship.

840
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,990
You need a sexual partner,

841
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,730
you need children,

842
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,440
you need play.

843
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,880
You need to be touched,

844
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:30,550
and I mean,

845
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:32,690
I actually mean need by the way.

846
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,570
People deprived to play go insane.

847
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,010
People who aren't touched,

848
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,023
die.

849
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,590
These things are necessary.

850
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:39,831
Well,

851
00:40:39,831 --> 00:40:42,110
assuming that survival
itself is necessary,

852
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,190
but we'll start with that.

853
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:48,020
We'll start with the assumption that just
sitting there and suffering and dying

854
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:50,180
is not the right solution.

855
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:51,350
Okay?

856
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,850
So you have to act in the world,

857
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:58,010
you have to act in the world that in a
manner that stops you from deteriorating

858
00:40:58,011 --> 00:40:59,390
and dying at minimum,

859
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:04,670
and that means that you have to address
the problems that are intrinsic to that

860
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,593
destiny.

861
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,210
Now you have all sorts
of systems that evolved,

862
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:09,680
have evolved to help you do that.

863
00:41:09,681 --> 00:41:12,590
Motivational systems we have
to eat so you get hungry.

864
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,680
You have to find water in and consume it.

865
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:16,670
So you get thirsty,

866
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:17,780
you get lonely,

867
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:18,920
you get curious.

868
00:41:18,921 --> 00:41:19,754
There's there's,

869
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:22,760
there's specialized biological
systems that are very,

870
00:41:22,761 --> 00:41:23,594
very old.

871
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,500
You get aggressive,

872
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:25,460
you get afraid,

873
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:25,780
you,

874
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,990
you suffer pain,

875
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,120
all those specialized systems for all
of those unit directional systems of

876
00:41:32,121 --> 00:41:34,910
orientation in the and they
help you figure out what to do.

877
00:41:34,970 --> 00:41:35,870
So when you're hungry,

878
00:41:35,871 --> 00:41:37,540
it's time to eat and
when you're thirsty it's,

879
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,510
it's time to drink.

880
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:39,380
And when your lonesome,

881
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:41,600
it's time to seek out some companionship.

882
00:41:41,601 --> 00:41:45,050
And you have specialized
systems that help you do that,

883
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,760
but they're not enough because,

884
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:48,021
well,

885
00:41:48,021 --> 00:41:48,950
they're not very bright.

886
00:41:48,951 --> 00:41:50,180
That's one way of looking at it.

887
00:41:50,181 --> 00:41:53,630
They're kind of uni dimensional and you
also have the problem of organizing all

888
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:53,931
of them.

889
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:54,261
It's like,

890
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:54,381
well,

891
00:41:54,381 --> 00:41:57,440
you have to eat now and you have to
drink now and you need a companion.

892
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:01,190
It's probably time to play and you have
to do something about shelter and there

893
00:42:01,191 --> 00:42:02,300
isn't just you right now.

894
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:05,630
There's you now and tomorrow and
next week and a year from now,

895
00:42:05,810 --> 00:42:06,920
five years from now,

896
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:11,450
so you have to plan across all those
stretches of time and there isn't just you

897
00:42:11,451 --> 00:42:12,410
now in the future,

898
00:42:12,411 --> 00:42:16,880
you there's you plus your family and your
community and so all of that has to be

899
00:42:16,881 --> 00:42:18,890
taken into account while you're plotting.

900
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:21,350
Your movement forward is very,

901
00:42:21,351 --> 00:42:22,161
very complicated.

902
00:42:22,161 --> 00:42:26,270
You have all these problems to solve
simultaneously and your motivational

903
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:26,780
systems,

904
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,231
anger,

905
00:42:27,231 --> 00:42:31,490
hunger and so forth can help you
solve one of those problems now,

906
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,070
but not all of them permanently.

907
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:38,270
That requires higher cognitive function
and that's part of what drove the

908
00:42:38,271 --> 00:42:41,300
evolution of our complex
cognitive systems.

909
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:45,350
That's how do you propagate the game
across time in a complex environment.

910
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:49,460
The left hemisphere operates when,

911
00:42:49,461 --> 00:42:49,880
where,

912
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,420
when,

913
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:55,130
what you're doing works and so a lot of
what you do during your life is to keep

914
00:42:55,131 --> 00:42:57,080
your right hemisphere off.

915
00:42:58,190 --> 00:43:00,470
People don't like it
going on accidentally.

916
00:43:00,471 --> 00:43:02,180
It's the home of negative emotion.

917
00:43:02,181 --> 00:43:04,490
It's the home of pain and anxiety.

918
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:08,390
It's the thing that turns on and freezes
you in your tracks when something that

919
00:43:08,391 --> 00:43:13,391
you deeply did not expect happens and it
prepares you to deal with the onslaught

920
00:43:13,401 --> 00:43:14,660
of what you didn't expect.

921
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:20,740
Now it's not all bad news because to
use the right hemisphere in a judicious

922
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:25,970
manner is also something that
adds intrigue and interest
in artistic expression

923
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,400
and all sorts of positive
things to your life.

924
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,120
So because potential is not only negative,

925
00:43:32,121 --> 00:43:33,140
it's also positive.

926
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:34,040
It can be,

927
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,040
it can be dealt with in ways that are
deeply enriching and meaningful order.

928
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:41,541
Okay,

929
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:42,920
so you have to do something.

930
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,250
Otherwise the consequences are dire.

931
00:43:47,450 --> 00:43:48,201
To do something,

932
00:43:48,201 --> 00:43:49,580
you have to value something.

933
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,000
It's a definitional issue because to do
something is to act out the proposition

934
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:57,350
that the thing you're doing,

935
00:43:57,620 --> 00:43:58,490
the thing you're aiming at,

936
00:43:58,491 --> 00:44:03,110
let's say is preferable to the thing you
have and preferable means you'll do it

937
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:04,910
so those things are tied
together so tightly.

938
00:44:04,911 --> 00:44:06,800
You can't disentangle them.

939
00:44:07,370 --> 00:44:08,203
If you say,

940
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,040
I'm aiming at x,

941
00:44:10,041 --> 00:44:11,360
but I don't value it,

942
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:14,580
then there's something wrong with the
way that you're conceptualizing the

943
00:44:14,581 --> 00:44:19,581
statement because to aim at something
and to work to bring it into existence is

944
00:44:20,091 --> 00:44:21,380
the same as valuing it,

945
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,341
and if you say,

946
00:44:22,341 --> 00:44:22,551
well,

947
00:44:22,551 --> 00:44:23,390
I don't value it,

948
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:24,890
then something's out of kilter.

949
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:29,030
Either you're acting out a false hood
or you don't know what you're talking

950
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:29,480
about.

951
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:33,060
It's one of those two things and you
meet people like that are deeply confused

952
00:44:33,061 --> 00:44:33,550
there.

953
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:38,550
Their action patterns and their
verbal self representation don't Mesh,

954
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:42,660
but that doesn't mean that
they're critics of value.

955
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,000
It just means that
they're deeply confused,

956
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:48,360
so you have to act or you suffer.

957
00:44:48,390 --> 00:44:49,201
In order to act,

958
00:44:49,201 --> 00:44:53,100
you have to have a value structure
because to act you have to value one thing

959
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,030
more than another,

960
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:57,840
which means that you have to
inhabit a structure of value.

961
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,213
You have to,

962
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,953
okay,

963
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,170
so you need a structure value because
it's the antidote to catastrophe.

964
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:08,483
Now,

965
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,760
if you act out a structure
of values socially,

966
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,650
which you will because you're social,

967
00:45:13,890 --> 00:45:17,940
you're not going to pursue your aims
in isolation because you're not.

968
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,000
You're not a solitary animal.

969
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:22,650
You're a social animal,

970
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,270
you're a tribal animal,

971
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,250
deeply tribal.

972
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,630
We live in groups.

973
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:28,950
We live in families,

974
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:30,000
we live in communities.

975
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:35,180
We live in large societies were social
at every level of analysis and we've been

976
00:45:35,671 --> 00:45:39,630
social for as long as we've been primates,

977
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:41,310
so maybe that's,

978
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:45,390
that's at least 6 million years
and it might be more like $60,

979
00:45:45,391 --> 00:45:46,200
million years.

980
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:48,150
It's really a long time,

981
00:45:48,930 --> 00:45:51,840
so it's not an arbitrary
social construction.

982
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:52,861
It's far,

983
00:45:52,861 --> 00:45:53,940
far deeper than that.

984
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:58,230
Now what happens when you act out
a structure of value in this social

985
00:45:58,231 --> 00:45:59,064
environment,

986
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,480
you produce a hierarchy inevitably.

987
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:04,591
Well,

988
00:46:04,591 --> 00:46:05,490
let's think it through.

989
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,533
Why?

990
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:07,381
Well,

991
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:11,130
let's say that you say that one thing
is more worth doing than another,

992
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,900
whatever it happens to me,

993
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,350
and then you tell a bunch of people
about what you're doing and they decided

994
00:46:16,351 --> 00:46:18,960
that they're going to come along and
help you do this thing that's valuable

995
00:46:18,961 --> 00:46:23,490
because they also think it's valuable and
maybe you get 20 people together to do

996
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:24,270
this thing.

997
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:27,930
Whatever it happens to me and the first
thing you discover is that some of the

998
00:46:27,931 --> 00:46:30,780
people are way better at doing whatever
it is that they're doing than other

999
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:31,614
people.

1000
00:46:32,310 --> 00:46:36,240
So and that and who knows why that is
because it depends on what you chose to

1001
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:36,750
do.

1002
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:37,021
You know?

1003
00:46:37,021 --> 00:46:41,340
If you chose a then it would
be a different group of
people who were good at it.

1004
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:42,540
Then if you chose B,

1005
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,400
because people differ in their abilities,

1006
00:46:44,401 --> 00:46:48,810
but one thing you will not escape
from if you make an organization to do

1007
00:46:48,811 --> 00:46:53,811
something valuable is the brute fact
that it will be a minority of the people

1008
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,590
who are good at doing it.

1009
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,630
And there's actually a law.

1010
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:01,140
It's called price's law
and it's a real law.

1011
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:06,580
Even governs the size of cities and the
massive stars and the heights of plants

1012
00:47:06,901 --> 00:47:07,650
in the jungle.

1013
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,140
It just doesn't govern human interactions.

1014
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:14,460
And price's law says that the square root
of the number of people engaged in an

1015
00:47:14,461 --> 00:47:15,001
enterprise,

1016
00:47:15,001 --> 00:47:16,140
we'll do half the work.

1017
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,080
So if you have 10 people doing something,

1018
00:47:19,081 --> 00:47:20,460
three of them will do half the work,

1019
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,410
but if you have 100
people doing something,

1020
00:47:22,411 --> 00:47:24,180
then 10 of them will do half the work.

1021
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,950
And if you have 10,000 people
doing something than 100
of them will do half the

1022
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,793
work.

1023
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:30,820
And uh,

1024
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:35,680
you know how wealth distributes itself
such that a minority of people have most

1025
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:36,514
of the money.

1026
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:40,690
Twelve 85 richest people in the world
have as much money as the bottom two and a

1027
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:41,524
half billion.

1028
00:47:41,590 --> 00:47:42,640
It's something like that.

1029
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:43,660
And everybody goes,

1030
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:44,494
oh my God,

1031
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,550
the one percent.

1032
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:46,600
It's like,

1033
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:46,721
well,

1034
00:47:46,721 --> 00:47:47,231
first of all,

1035
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,370
you're all the one percent.

1036
00:47:48,371 --> 00:47:53,050
So get over yourself because
you're know western European,

1037
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,730
roughly speaking and by world
current world standards.

1038
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,590
And certainly by historical standards,

1039
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,990
you're all well ensconced
in the one percent.

1040
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,910
So if that's a problem,

1041
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:08,200
well it's a problem for all of
you and some of you might be,

1042
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:08,920
you know,

1043
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:09,880
richer than that,

1044
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:12,820
but that doesn't mean all of
you aren't in the same boat.

1045
00:48:12,910 --> 00:48:13,743
Fundamentally,

1046
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:19,150
the fact that wealth aggregates in the
hands of a small number of people is part

1047
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:21,490
of the general expression of price's law.

1048
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,250
There's nothing special about
the distribution of money.

1049
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:29,170
You see the same thing in every creative
domain mean how many of you have have

1050
00:48:29,171 --> 00:48:30,260
recorded a

1051
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:32,920
gold record?

1052
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:37,940
How many looks like zero up?

1053
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:38,860
There's one,

1054
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:39,700
one person,

1055
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,211
okay,

1056
00:48:40,211 --> 00:48:41,890
there's 850 people in here.

1057
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,380
So there's one in the thousands.

1058
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:44,950
So that's one 10th of one percent,

1059
00:48:44,951 --> 00:48:45,784
something like that.

1060
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:48,550
How many of you have
written a piano concerto?

1061
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:50,590
Uh,

1062
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:55,570
how bout painted a painting that's
hanging in a national museum?

1063
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:57,311
Oh look,

1064
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:58,420
it's none of view again,

1065
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,530
right?

1066
00:48:59,530 --> 00:48:59,831
Well,

1067
00:48:59,831 --> 00:49:03,070
and how many of you have been a
member of a professional sports team?

1068
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:04,991
Okay,

1069
00:49:04,991 --> 00:49:06,520
look up one one.

1070
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:07,720
So that's one in 10,000.

1071
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:08,051
Well,

1072
00:49:08,051 --> 00:49:09,310
you get the point here.

1073
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:09,600
Well,

1074
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,271
if there was a couple,

1075
00:49:10,271 --> 00:49:10,600
there is.

1076
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:10,871
Okay.

1077
00:49:10,871 --> 00:49:14,680
So looks like it's easier to be a
member of a professional sports team

1078
00:49:16,210 --> 00:49:20,110
or my or my audience is is
biased the samples biased,

1079
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:21,370
but,

1080
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:22,210
but it is the case.

1081
00:49:22,211 --> 00:49:25,810
If you look at high levels of creative
achievement of the sort of just described

1082
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,650
that they characterize it
staggering minority of people.

1083
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:35,070
And so the rule is is that you produce
a value system which you better produce

1084
00:49:36,161 --> 00:49:39,490
because otherwise you suffer
and die and it isn't only that,

1085
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,150
only that.

1086
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:40,870
It's like,

1087
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:41,200
look,

1088
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,990
here's something else you all
know as far as I can tell,

1089
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:50,710
we start with the idea that there's an
intrinsic chaotic element to life and

1090
00:49:50,711 --> 00:49:55,711
that includes the inevitability of
suffering and malevolence betrayal at the

1091
00:49:55,961 --> 00:49:57,460
hands of yourself and other people.

1092
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,580
So that's the baseline.

1093
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:03,670
And that's intolerable in many ways
because life is in many ways intolerable.

1094
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:04,780
And the question is,

1095
00:50:04,781 --> 00:50:04,901
well,

1096
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,150
what do you do in the face of
something that's intolerable?

1097
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,940
And the answer is when you try to
find something that justifies it,

1098
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:10,151
right?

1099
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:14,680
You want to have something that gets you
the hell out of bed in the morning and

1100
00:50:14,681 --> 00:50:19,630
not just any old morning but a morning
when your father has Alzheimer's disease

1101
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,410
and your daughter has an incurable illness
because you need something to get out

1102
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:25,360
of bed for in those mornings too,

1103
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:30,500
and that better be the that you found in
life and if the purpose is going to be

1104
00:50:30,501 --> 00:50:32,960
such that it gets you out
of bed in those mornings,

1105
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:37,940
it better be a pretty damn noble purpose
because otherwise why would you bother?

1106
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,520
And so not only do you
need a value structure,

1107
00:50:40,521 --> 00:50:44,390
you need one that's of sufficient tension,

1108
00:50:44,391 --> 00:50:45,224
let's say,

1109
00:50:45,290 --> 00:50:50,290
or sufficient value or sufficient
nobility so that it's worth suffering for

1110
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:54,440
because you're going to suffer and you
better have something that makes the

1111
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:55,880
suffering justifiable.

1112
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:59,510
And so not only do you need the value
structure so that you don't just

1113
00:50:59,511 --> 00:51:00,710
deteriorate and die.

1114
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,060
You need the value structure so that
when the flood comes in your life as it

1115
00:51:05,061 --> 00:51:05,900
certainly will,

1116
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,980
that you have built a vessel that will
sustain you through the catastrophe.

1117
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:13,760
And that's not this pursuit of happiness.

1118
00:51:14,150 --> 00:51:16,040
It's not even the pursuit of security,

1119
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,330
it's none of that.

1120
00:51:17,810 --> 00:51:22,810
It's the orientation that you've managed
to produce in your own life towards a

1121
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:27,830
higher good that's so high that it's
worth bearing the burden of being to

1122
00:51:27,831 --> 00:51:28,664
produce.

1123
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,340
You implement that in the world.

1124
00:51:31,341 --> 00:51:32,450
You produce a hierarchy.

1125
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:34,221
Now you might say,

1126
00:51:34,221 --> 00:51:35,054
well,

1127
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,080
and then you have the problem of hierarchy
and the problem of hierarchy is a

1128
00:51:39,081 --> 00:51:42,920
very few people are going to be very
good at whatever that hierarchy does and

1129
00:51:42,921 --> 00:51:45,140
then you have the second
problem with hierarchy,

1130
00:51:45,141 --> 00:51:49,250
which is the problem I just laid out
when I asked you about your spectacular

1131
00:51:49,251 --> 00:51:52,610
levels of attainment and
found out that they were very.

1132
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:54,500
It was very unlikely.

1133
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,110
I'm not saying that you haven't
attained worthwhile things.

1134
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:58,160
That's not my point.

1135
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:03,350
My point is is that very high levels of
attainment or extraordinarily rare and

1136
00:52:03,351 --> 00:52:04,820
that's an inevitability.

1137
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:08,570
As soon as you decide that something's
worth doing to inevitabilities,

1138
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:13,430
people stack up at the top minority of
people stack up at the top and take most

1139
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:14,390
of the proceeds,

1140
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:17,240
whatever they happen to be
or deserve them or earn them,

1141
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:18,051
whatever.

1142
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:18,381
However,

1143
00:52:18,381 --> 00:52:22,280
I don't care how you conceptualize it and
almost everybody else stacks up at the

1144
00:52:22,281 --> 00:52:23,114
bottom,

1145
00:52:23,570 --> 00:52:26,990
and so the problem with hierarchies
is that even though they're necessary,

1146
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:30,650
they tend to produce a situation where
most people stack up at the bottom,

1147
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:34,310
and so that's the next thing
that we have to contend with.

1148
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,030
You can't get rid of the hierarchies
because if you get rid of the hierarchies,

1149
00:52:38,031 --> 00:52:40,610
there's no value structure and
if there's no value structure,

1150
00:52:40,611 --> 00:52:42,560
not only do you deteriorate and die,

1151
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:47,390
you want to deteriorate and die
and that's not a good solution.

1152
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,220
But if you do generate a hierarchy,

1153
00:52:49,221 --> 00:52:51,980
then you have the
problem of the hierarchy.

1154
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:56,690
And the problem is the hierarchy is
that it will dispossess most people now,

1155
00:52:56,691 --> 00:53:00,080
to the degree that the
postmodernists have something to say,

1156
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,660
that's what they say is hierarchies,

1157
00:53:02,661 --> 00:53:03,560
dispossessed,

1158
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:04,281
okay.

1159
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:09,281
And then we can look at that clearly and
carefully and we can say that doesn't

1160
00:53:09,651 --> 00:53:10,730
mean a,

1161
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:15,290
that hierarchies themselves are corrupt
or that we can dispense with them,

1162
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:20,150
but it also doesn't mean that we have
no moral obligation to the dispossessed.

1163
00:53:20,870 --> 00:53:21,291
And we say,

1164
00:53:21,291 --> 00:53:21,411
well,

1165
00:53:21,411 --> 00:53:24,170
how do we deal with that politically,

1166
00:53:24,470 --> 00:53:26,280
conceptually and the
way we deal with that,

1167
00:53:26,281 --> 00:53:27,031
at least in part,

1168
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:31,650
is to produce a political spectrum that
ranges from left to right that deals

1169
00:53:31,651 --> 00:53:34,020
with hierarchy and the problems
that hierarchies caused.

1170
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:39,000
So one of the things that you can
reliably assume about someone who's on the

1171
00:53:39,001 --> 00:53:44,001
right is that they will be patriotically
in favor of the current hierarchy or

1172
00:53:45,871 --> 00:53:47,640
even more abstractly,

1173
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,350
they're in favor of the idea of
hierarchy itself and you say,

1174
00:53:52,351 --> 00:53:52,531
well,

1175
00:53:52,531 --> 00:53:57,531
more power to the people on the right
because you need hierarchies so they

1176
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:58,584
should support them.

1177
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:00,810
But then you have to take the
people on the left who say,

1178
00:54:00,811 --> 00:54:01,051
yeah,

1179
00:54:01,051 --> 00:54:04,680
but what about the people who are
dispossessed by the hierarchy?

1180
00:54:05,010 --> 00:54:06,330
And what you have to say to them is,

1181
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:07,283
yeah,

1182
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,570
we actually have to do
something about that.

1183
00:54:09,930 --> 00:54:10,441
And you think,

1184
00:54:10,441 --> 00:54:12,060
well how do we do something about that?

1185
00:54:12,061 --> 00:54:16,800
And the answer is we don't actually know
because there's no permanent solution

1186
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,980
to the problem of
dispossession by the hierarchy.

1187
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,590
We don't know how to fix it.

1188
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:23,731
Say,

1189
00:54:23,731 --> 00:54:23,941
well,

1190
00:54:23,941 --> 00:54:25,070
we could flatten hierarchies.

1191
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:27,960
It's like not without
disrupting the value structure.

1192
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:30,360
That's a price you don't want to pay.

1193
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,081
Well,

1194
00:54:31,081 --> 00:54:33,240
we can take from the top
and put it at the bottom.

1195
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:34,074
It's like,

1196
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,473
yes,

1197
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:38,850
hypothetically we could,

1198
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,820
but it turns out that when
you try that in practice,

1199
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:42,871
it's very,

1200
00:54:42,871 --> 00:54:47,871
very easy to rapidly go too far and
then what you end up with not is less

1201
00:54:48,811 --> 00:54:50,040
dispossessed.

1202
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,400
You end up with no one who has anything
and that's not a good solution to the

1203
00:54:56,161 --> 00:54:58,200
problem of scarcity,

1204
00:54:58,590 --> 00:54:59,130
right?

1205
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:03,510
To make everyone equally
dead or equally starving,

1206
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:07,890
which is essentially what the communist
states did across the entirety of the

1207
00:55:07,891 --> 00:55:12,891
20th century is not the proper way
to address the problem of hierarchy.

1208
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,350
Now it has to be addressed
even if you're on the right,

1209
00:55:16,351 --> 00:55:17,880
because here's one thing that happens.

1210
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,580
Hierarchies tend to Ossify,

1211
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:21,091
you know,

1212
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:23,610
because what happens is
that the people at the top,

1213
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:25,140
maybe they got there by merit,

1214
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,700
but it's easy for them to Gerrymander
the system so they can stay there without

1215
00:55:29,701 --> 00:55:30,534
merit.

1216
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:34,200
Or perhaps their children can stay
there without merit or they can.

1217
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:38,970
Or the hierarchy becomes corrupt so that
people who only use tyranny and power

1218
00:55:38,971 --> 00:55:39,804
can climate,

1219
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:43,020
and so you don't have a hierarchy
of competence and value anymore.

1220
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:46,560
You have a hierarchy of brute
power which looks like a tyranny,

1221
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,430
so there's all sorts of
ways that hierarchies can
deteriorate and we have to be

1222
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,040
awake to ensure that that doesn't occur.

1223
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:54,323
Also,

1224
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:59,790
if the hierarchy gets so steep that
everybody stacks up at zero and no one can

1225
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:00,624
climb it,

1226
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,620
which is basically the definition of
a malfunctioning tyranny than all the

1227
00:56:04,621 --> 00:56:06,990
people at the bottom rightly think,

1228
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:07,411
well,

1229
00:56:07,411 --> 00:56:11,370
why don't we just destroy the game
because we're already at zero?

1230
00:56:11,430 --> 00:56:13,380
So what the hell do we have to lose?

1231
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,400
And so one of the things that you want
to do if you're a sensible conservative,

1232
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,690
is make sure that the hierarchy
maintains its routing and competence,

1233
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,900
that it's transparent and that it's
climate double because otherwise it will

1234
00:56:27,131 --> 00:56:31,060
ossify in steepen and then
it will destroy itself.

1235
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,290
And if you're a conservative and you
value stability and the hierarchy,

1236
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:39,640
then you don't want to set up a situation
where the most likely outcome is that

1237
00:56:39,641 --> 00:56:41,140
the hierarchy destroys itself.

1238
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:44,560
So so we can be intelligent about this.

1239
00:56:44,561 --> 00:56:45,041
We could say,

1240
00:56:45,041 --> 00:56:45,760
look,

1241
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,690
don't be thinking.

1242
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:49,420
You can get rid of hierarchies
they've been around.

1243
00:56:49,421 --> 00:56:50,680
This is why I wrote chapter one.

1244
00:56:50,681 --> 00:56:52,060
I talked about lobsters.

1245
00:56:52,890 --> 00:56:57,890
The reason I talked about them is because
not only is the hierarchical structure

1246
00:56:59,021 --> 00:57:01,900
itself as a permanent
feature of existence,

1247
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,720
at least a third of a billion years old,

1248
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:09,820
which by the way means that you
cannot attribute it to capitalism,

1249
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:13,540
the free market or the
corrupt patriarchal west,

1250
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,170
unless you're willing to make the
case that all three of those elements

1251
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:21,640
contributed to the existence of
dominance hierarchies among crustaceans,

1252
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,650
which seems highly unlikely.

1253
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:24,400
So,

1254
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:26,230
and this is actually something that's,

1255
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,550
that you can think about it as an idea
that's actually directed towards the

1256
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:32,080
productive left.

1257
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:35,230
If you want to help the dispossessed,

1258
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:40,770
don't blame the existence of hierarchies
on capitalism because it's wrong.

1259
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,800
It's wrong that the problem
is way deeper than that.

1260
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,710
And here's something else that's
very interesting about capitalism,

1261
00:57:47,930 --> 00:57:49,870
couple of things you might consider,

1262
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:51,243
you know,

1263
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,980
we have become spectacularly
wealthy since 18,

1264
00:57:53,981 --> 00:57:54,670
95,

1265
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:55,090
right?

1266
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:58,330
First in the West Icelands
at classic example.

1267
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,510
I mean you guys are so much more wealthy
than you were a hundred years ago that

1268
00:58:01,511 --> 00:58:03,250
it's absolutely impossible to believe.

1269
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:07,450
And so that's first happened in the west
to exponential economic growth starting

1270
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:08,620
in about 1895.

1271
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:09,700
There's a long tail.

1272
00:58:09,701 --> 00:58:09,911
I mean,

1273
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:11,290
people were improving before that,

1274
00:58:11,291 --> 00:58:12,860
but it really kicked in around 18,

1275
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,270
95 and first happened in the west and
now it's happening everywhere in the

1276
00:58:16,271 --> 00:58:16,840
world.

1277
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:17,920
I don't know if you know this,

1278
00:58:17,921 --> 00:58:18,754
but you know,

1279
00:58:20,590 --> 00:58:25,000
the UN set a goal in 2000 to have the
level of absolute poverty in the world by

1280
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,230
2015,

1281
00:58:26,650 --> 00:58:30,010
which is the fastest rate of
economic growth ever recorded.

1282
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,380
We attained it in 2012,

1283
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,380
three years ahead of the
most optimistic projections.

1284
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:36,461
Right?

1285
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:40,480
And so people are being lifted out of
poverty at a rate that has never been seen

1286
00:58:40,481 --> 00:58:44,830
in the history of the world hooked to
the power grids provided with cell phones

1287
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,480
provided with free,

1288
00:58:46,530 --> 00:58:51,010
with access to fresh water provided
with access to medications that decrease

1289
00:58:51,011 --> 00:58:52,000
child mortality.

1290
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:54,130
Like if you look at the statistics,

1291
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,550
there are so many things getting better
so fast you cannot even believe it.

1292
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:58,750
And that's,

1293
00:58:58,750 --> 00:59:03,750
and here's the consequences as far
as as far as the data indicate of the

1294
00:59:03,761 --> 00:59:05,410
operation of the free market system,

1295
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,600
which does produce inequality.

1296
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,613
That's the thing,

1297
00:59:09,190 --> 00:59:10,390
but as far as I can tell,

1298
00:59:10,391 --> 00:59:15,391
the only system that has ever produced
wealth and as law or has every system

1299
00:59:16,091 --> 00:59:17,380
produces inequality,

1300
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:21,010
but the only system we
know of that produces,

1301
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:24,830
produces wealth and
inequality is the free market.

1302
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:28,190
So here's a question for
everyone left and right.

1303
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:31,910
How many units of inequality will you
tolerate to produce one unit of wealth?

1304
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:34,610
And if the answer is zero,

1305
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:37,250
then you've gone too far.

1306
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:40,790
You're outside the
appropriate political debate.

1307
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:42,530
That's the wrong answer.

1308
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:47,660
And if you try to impose that all there
will be as mayhem because the price we

1309
00:59:47,661 --> 00:59:50,570
pay for wealth is inequality.

1310
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:56,270
Now that doesn't mean that you can let
inequality run to its ultimate extreme

1311
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,980
because then you run
into the other problem,

1312
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,570
which is the monopoly problem.

1313
00:59:59,571 --> 01:00:00,590
You've all played monopoly.

1314
01:00:00,591 --> 01:00:03,230
I presume what happens
in every monopoly game,

1315
01:00:04,580 --> 01:00:05,750
if you lay it out,

1316
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:09,650
everyone stacks out at zero
up at zero except one person.

1317
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:10,041
Now,

1318
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:11,420
if you play it 50 times,

1319
01:00:11,421 --> 01:00:14,990
you'll find that it's hardly ever the
same person because it's basically a game

1320
01:00:14,991 --> 01:00:17,630
of chance and there's a fair
bit of chance by the way,

1321
01:00:17,631 --> 01:00:19,700
operating in the distribution
of money in the world.

1322
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,720
It's not all chance,

1323
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:21,950
but there's a fair bit of chance.

1324
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:26,420
But the logical conclusion to a hierarchy
that can play itself out totally is

1325
01:00:26,421 --> 01:00:29,450
that one person has everything
and everyone else has nothing.

1326
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:32,300
Obviously that's not a useful outcome.

1327
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:33,733
So,

1328
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:35,080
so you know,

1329
01:00:35,081 --> 01:00:38,210
in the way there are ways that
we fix that in our society.

1330
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:42,710
We have progressive tax policies and
you can argue about their utility,

1331
01:00:42,711 --> 01:00:46,700
but that's one way of
rectifying it potentially.

1332
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:50,000
Another way of rectifying is
that we don't have one game,

1333
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:52,220
right in a pluralistic society,

1334
01:00:52,430 --> 01:00:53,001
we have many,

1335
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:56,930
many games that people can play and so
if you can't be a successful lawyer,

1336
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:00,050
then maybe you could be a successful
plumber and if you can't be a successful

1337
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:00,560
plumber,

1338
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,540
maybe you can run this small
restaurant or you know,

1339
01:01:02,541 --> 01:01:04,070
there's a diversity of games.

1340
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:06,170
And so that's a good way of,

1341
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,700
of allowing,

1342
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:12,290
of increasing the robustness of the
system so that you don't get hierarchies

1343
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:16,280
that are so steep that they
collapsed in upon themselves.

1344
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:20,390
And so those are sophisticated approaches
and perhaps your other approaches to.

1345
01:01:20,391 --> 01:01:21,920
But it's an intractable problem.

1346
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:23,330
It says in the New Testament,

1347
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,660
it's one of the things you'd swear would
be edited out because it's such a harsh

1348
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,673
statement.

1349
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:28,280
Uh,

1350
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:30,080
the poor will be with us always.

1351
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:30,850
Well,

1352
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:31,940
what's that in reference to?

1353
01:01:31,941 --> 01:01:34,220
It's also in reference
to the matthew principle,

1354
01:01:34,370 --> 01:01:39,370
which is another new testament statement
and happens to be an economic axiom to

1355
01:01:39,741 --> 01:01:43,310
those who have everything more will
be given from those who have nothing.

1356
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,630
Everything will be taken.

1357
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:49,280
That's the structure of the world and
you can't lay it at the feet of the West.

1358
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:51,170
It's the structure of the world.

1359
01:01:51,560 --> 01:01:55,040
Now that means we have to contend with
it and it's not an easy thing to contend

1360
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:58,880
with and part of the reason that we have
a continual political dialogue and that

1361
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:03,170
we need to have a continual political
dialogue is to make sure that our

1362
01:02:03,171 --> 01:02:06,230
hierarchies exist and remain intact,

1363
01:02:06,410 --> 01:02:10,820
but don't become so steep and corrupt
that they destroy themselves and you need

1364
01:02:10,821 --> 01:02:12,050
a left and a right for that,

1365
01:02:12,590 --> 01:02:17,590
and if that means the left half has
to admit that hierarchies are not only

1366
01:02:18,021 --> 01:02:22,890
necessary but valuable and the right has
to admit that despite their necessity

1367
01:02:22,891 --> 01:02:23,670
and value,

1368
01:02:23,670 --> 01:02:27,570
they tend to stack people up at the
bottom and that actually constitutes a

1369
01:02:27,571 --> 01:02:28,530
continual problem.

1370
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:30,090
You see that in.

1371
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:37,290
You see that in the old testament because
one of the things that happens in the

1372
01:02:37,291 --> 01:02:42,180
old testament is Israel struggles
up to state and empire status.

1373
01:02:42,181 --> 01:02:43,080
Six Times.

1374
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,850
It struggles out of the chaos,

1375
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,410
up to empire status,

1376
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,270
and then it gets corrupt.

1377
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,310
It loses the way.

1378
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:53,370
It isn't balancing things
between chaos and order properly.

1379
01:02:53,780 --> 01:02:57,660
The kings get arrogant is so to the
people and they forget their relationship

1380
01:02:57,661 --> 01:02:58,494
with God.

1381
01:02:58,500 --> 01:02:59,880
That's another way of thinking about it,

1382
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,560
and then a profit comes up and says,

1383
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,740
you aren't paying enough attention
to the widows and the orphans.

1384
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:09,390
You better look out because
that displeases God and the
Israelites who are stiff

1385
01:03:09,391 --> 01:03:13,140
necked and arrogant think
what's God going to do to us,

1386
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:17,850
which is not a very wise way of thinking
and so they don't take the steps

1387
01:03:17,851 --> 01:03:21,960
necessary to rectify their deviation
from the proper path and they get

1388
01:03:22,050 --> 01:03:27,050
absolutely flattened and the consequences
of that last for generations like

1389
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:28,830
seven generations,

1390
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:32,910
and then they struggle their way up to
something approximating empire status

1391
01:03:32,911 --> 01:03:35,550
again and exactly the same thing happens.

1392
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:40,380
They forget and they collapse and
there's six stories like that in the Old

1393
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:40,980
Testament.

1394
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,810
It's all documented by a man named
Northrop Frye who is a Canadian literary

1395
01:03:45,811 --> 01:03:47,790
critic who wrote a couple
of books on the Bible.

1396
01:03:47,791 --> 01:03:50,460
One called the great code and the
other called words with power,

1397
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:52,020
which I would highly recommend.

1398
01:03:52,230 --> 01:03:54,390
It's an analysis of the
Bible as literature.

1399
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,690
Brilliant for those of you who might
be interested in union thinking,

1400
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,420
fries thinking is a nice adjunct,

1401
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:01,970
so alright,

1402
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:02,873
so,

1403
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:05,700
so that's the nature of the world.

1404
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:08,130
Order chaos and order,

1405
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:11,190
and your goal is to keep those,

1406
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:15,330
the relationship between those two
things optimized and you do that by doing

1407
01:04:15,331 --> 01:04:16,111
what's meaningful,

1408
01:04:16,111 --> 01:04:17,400
not what's expedient.

1409
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:22,640
That's rule six and you ensure that you
have the world construed properly by

1410
01:04:23,910 --> 01:04:25,140
following rule number eight,

1411
01:04:25,141 --> 01:04:27,900
which is tell the truth
or at least don't lie.

1412
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:28,910
You don't want a path.

1413
01:04:28,910 --> 01:04:29,580
All the guys,

1414
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:33,660
the instinct that orients you in the
world and you will pathologize it by

1415
01:04:33,870 --> 01:04:35,520
engaging in habitual deceit,

1416
01:04:35,730 --> 01:04:38,430
and the reason you do that is
when you practice something,

1417
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:43,170
you build structures that specialize in
that and then they run automatically.

1418
01:04:43,350 --> 01:04:44,970
So if you're living a lie,

1419
01:04:45,180 --> 01:04:47,070
which is a very common
thing for people to do,

1420
01:04:47,220 --> 01:04:50,400
then you're building
neurological mechanisms that
view the world through that

1421
01:04:50,401 --> 01:04:52,050
lie and once they're built,

1422
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:55,200
they're you and good luck unbuilding them.

1423
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:56,071
It's very,

1424
01:04:56,071 --> 01:04:56,761
very difficult.

1425
01:04:56,761 --> 01:05:00,600
That's in part what happens to people
who are addicted by the way they build

1426
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,760
mechanisms of search,

1427
01:05:03,210 --> 01:05:07,680
neurological structures that are focused
on the drug and those systems are alive

1428
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,460
and all they want is the drug and they're,

1429
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,041
they're not.

1430
01:05:11,041 --> 01:05:12,450
It's not psychological.

1431
01:05:12,451 --> 01:05:13,260
Exactly.

1432
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:14,820
It's psychophysiological.

1433
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:20,150
Don't build structures of
cognition predicated on
deception because you will pay

1434
01:05:20,591 --> 01:05:21,424
for it.

1435
01:05:21,430 --> 01:05:25,240
And so if you're going to guide your
life with the orientation of the instinct

1436
01:05:25,241 --> 01:05:25,960
of meaning,

1437
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:30,430
then you have to be very careful with
what you say and write and think because

1438
01:05:30,431 --> 01:05:32,980
every time you say or
write or think something,

1439
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:36,820
you build a little neurological structure
that specialized for that and it

1440
01:05:36,821 --> 01:05:39,130
participates in this parsing of the world.

1441
01:05:39,670 --> 01:05:41,380
So all right,

1442
01:05:48,060 --> 01:05:49,170
chaos and order.

1443
01:05:49,470 --> 01:05:51,600
Then you can say the
order orders a hierarchy.

1444
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:53,010
Okay,

1445
01:05:53,010 --> 01:05:54,240
so here's the next question.

1446
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:59,820
Next two questions is order a hierarchy

1447
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,890
and then a subsidiary question would be,

1448
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:05,840
if order is a hierarchy,

1449
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,430
what's what?

1450
01:06:07,431 --> 01:06:11,720
Either what is at the top of the hierarchy
or what should be at the top of the

1451
01:06:11,721 --> 01:06:12,554
hierarchy.

1452
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:14,630
The hierarchy is a structure value.

1453
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:18,800
So that's the question is what
should be of ultimate value.

1454
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:20,330
Okay.

1455
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:22,280
So now we're going to take
that apart a little bit.

1456
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:23,780
The first thing I would say,

1457
01:06:23,781 --> 01:06:26,660
his order is not a hierarchy.

1458
01:06:28,070 --> 01:06:29,930
Order is a set of hierarchies.

1459
01:06:31,290 --> 01:06:32,300
That's a different thing.

1460
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:33,883
So

1461
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:36,950
I'll tell you how to think about that.

1462
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:37,730
I think.

1463
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:42,730
So imagine you have a child and
they're playing soccer and uh,

1464
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:45,800
your child is a pretty good soccer player.

1465
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:47,810
No,

1466
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:48,860
I'll tell you a different story.

1467
01:06:50,060 --> 01:06:51,170
This actually happened.

1468
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:56,480
So I'm going to tell you a story about
hockey and I'm since I'm Canadian.

1469
01:06:56,810 --> 01:06:57,351
What the hell?

1470
01:06:57,351 --> 01:06:58,790
I might as well tell you
a story about hockey.

1471
01:06:59,210 --> 01:07:00,043
Um,

1472
01:07:00,530 --> 01:07:01,760
my son played hockey.

1473
01:07:01,761 --> 01:07:02,690
He still plays hockey.

1474
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:07,900
He's a pretty good hockey player and
my wife and I used to go watch him play

1475
01:07:07,971 --> 01:07:08,630
hockey.

1476
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:12,050
There was an arena just down the
street from us and there was a nice

1477
01:07:12,051 --> 01:07:13,280
neighborhood league there.

1478
01:07:13,281 --> 01:07:18,170
And so they'd start the kids into teams
and then they let them play a few demo

1479
01:07:18,171 --> 01:07:23,171
games and if any team was getting stomped
flat or any other team was winning too

1480
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:24,254
much,

1481
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:26,070
then they'd rebalance the teams.

1482
01:07:26,071 --> 01:07:29,930
So that they were
approximately equal in skill.

1483
01:07:30,590 --> 01:07:32,390
So that was the sorting of the teams.

1484
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:33,411
So,

1485
01:07:33,411 --> 01:07:34,244
um,

1486
01:07:35,120 --> 01:07:35,800
and then they,

1487
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:40,250
then they were on their teams and then
they'd play 15 games during the regular

1488
01:07:40,251 --> 01:07:40,551
season.

1489
01:07:40,551 --> 01:07:41,480
They didn't have a little tournament,

1490
01:07:41,481 --> 01:07:44,210
see who won and it was really good.

1491
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,650
It was good friendly league.

1492
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:48,680
And so my son's team was in,

1493
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:50,840
I think it was the championship game,

1494
01:07:50,841 --> 01:07:51,980
if I remember correctly.

1495
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:53,473
And uh,

1496
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:58,430
there's one kid on his team who is
the best player on the team by quite a

1497
01:07:58,431 --> 01:07:58,940
margin,

1498
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,211
you know,

1499
01:07:59,211 --> 01:08:00,740
he was very fast on his feet.

1500
01:08:01,370 --> 01:08:02,030
He could,

1501
01:08:02,030 --> 01:08:03,830
he could skate rings
around a lot of the kids.

1502
01:08:03,831 --> 01:08:04,940
He was good at stick handling.

1503
01:08:04,941 --> 01:08:05,930
He was a good hockey player.

1504
01:08:06,860 --> 01:08:07,910
But um,

1505
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:09,890
he had some problems.

1506
01:08:09,891 --> 01:08:10,724
This kid,

1507
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:13,910
one problem was he wouldn't pass the puck.

1508
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:15,651
Now you think,

1509
01:08:15,651 --> 01:08:15,771
well,

1510
01:08:15,771 --> 01:08:18,350
why the hell should you pass the park
if you're the best hockey player?

1511
01:08:18,351 --> 01:08:19,700
Which is pretty much what he thought.

1512
01:08:20,210 --> 01:08:21,080
And the answer is,

1513
01:08:21,081 --> 01:08:21,914
well,

1514
01:08:22,970 --> 01:08:23,990
you're part of a team,

1515
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:25,100
right?

1516
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,170
You want to be the best
person on the team,

1517
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,410
fair enough and you want
to win the hockey game.

1518
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:36,160
But you also want to what make
your team mates better players.

1519
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:37,813
How's that?

1520
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:40,160
Maybe you even want to meet
the people on other teams,

1521
01:08:40,161 --> 01:08:41,390
better players I knew,

1522
01:08:41,391 --> 01:08:43,130
now I know that's going
a little bit too far,

1523
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:48,230
but you certainly want to make your
teammates better players and you might

1524
01:08:48,231 --> 01:08:48,441
think,

1525
01:08:48,441 --> 01:08:49,400
well why would you do that?

1526
01:08:49,400 --> 01:08:54,380
Because if there are better than maybe
you won't be the best while that's a bone

1527
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:57,170
headed way of looking at the
world because first of all,

1528
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:59,660
if you amp up the competition around you,

1529
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:04,790
maybe that'll motivate you to be even
better and it's a hell of a way to win by

1530
01:09:04,791 --> 01:09:06,200
making everyone else lose.

1531
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:08,420
That's not much of a victory.

1532
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,400
And so if you have any sense,

1533
01:09:10,790 --> 01:09:12,440
you pass the damn park.

1534
01:09:12,770 --> 01:09:14,060
Even if you're the better player,

1535
01:09:14,061 --> 01:09:16,250
especially you especially do that.

1536
01:09:16,251 --> 01:09:18,800
Let's say you've got a
comfortable two goal lead,

1537
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:24,820
well then maybe you can risk taking the
time away from that specific game to

1538
01:09:26,361 --> 01:09:27,560
build up the confidence,

1539
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:30,020
confidence and ability of your teammates.

1540
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,770
And then maybe everybody thinks that
you're a bit of a leader and they make you

1541
01:09:33,771 --> 01:09:34,604
team captain.

1542
01:09:34,850 --> 01:09:37,340
Not even so much because
you're the best hockey player,

1543
01:09:37,341 --> 01:09:38,174
but because.

1544
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:39,021
Well,

1545
01:09:39,021 --> 01:09:39,854
because why?

1546
01:09:40,550 --> 01:09:41,420
That's the question.

1547
01:09:41,540 --> 01:09:41,841
Okay.

1548
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:46,250
So we're watching the game and it's pretty
exciting and it's real close game and

1549
01:09:46,251 --> 01:09:51,251
it's like three to three and it's a minute
left and now their team zips down the

1550
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:54,350
nice and scores and really brilliant goal.

1551
01:09:54,530 --> 01:09:59,530
And so my son's team loses except that
they were in the championship and it was

1552
01:10:00,051 --> 01:10:00,980
a really good game.

1553
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:04,790
So you know whether or not they
lost is not all that obvious.

1554
01:10:04,791 --> 01:10:05,870
They lost that game,

1555
01:10:06,230 --> 01:10:06,861
but you know,

1556
01:10:06,861 --> 01:10:09,590
there's a broader context
to take into consideration.

1557
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:10,131
Okay.

1558
01:10:10,131 --> 01:10:11,900
So this kid,

1559
01:10:13,220 --> 01:10:18,220
the star goes off the ice and he takes
his hockey stick and he smashes it onto

1560
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:21,740
the cement and he's all angry
because as far as he was concerned,

1561
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:22,910
he was robbed.

1562
01:10:23,030 --> 01:10:27,330
And maybe that's because of his useless
teammates who he didn't really spend any

1563
01:10:27,331 --> 01:10:28,880
time helping by the way.

1564
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:33,140
And maybe it's because the referees were
unfair and who the hell knows why but

1565
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:38,141
it wasn't fair and his idiot farther
rushes over to him and consoles him in on

1566
01:10:40,641 --> 01:10:45,641
his loss and supports them in his notion
that he was robbed and I thought you

1567
01:10:48,890 --> 01:10:50,780
unspeakable son of a bitch

1568
01:10:55,000 --> 01:11:00,000
because he was an arrogant narcissist
and it was way more important to him that

1569
01:11:01,121 --> 01:11:06,121
he had a son who was a star then that
he had a son who is a good person

1570
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:11,000
and that's absolutely inexcusable.

1571
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:13,310
He made the wrong choice.

1572
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:18,650
He sacrificed his son Soul in part to
help them save face for a hockey game.

1573
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,540
That's not acceptable.

1574
01:11:25,130 --> 01:11:25,431
Okay?

1575
01:11:25,431 --> 01:11:26,900
So here's what you tell your children.

1576
01:11:29,350 --> 01:11:30,850
It doesn't matter whether you win or lose,

1577
01:11:30,851 --> 01:11:32,080
it matters how you play the game.

1578
01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:36,910
And so that's what the father should have
told the son and he should have meant

1579
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:37,390
it.

1580
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:38,051
And even better,

1581
01:11:38,051 --> 01:11:39,520
he should have known what it meant.

1582
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:43,930
But who knows what that means because
you tell your children that and maybe

1583
01:11:43,931 --> 01:11:47,830
they're not so happy because they lost
a game and they look at you like you're

1584
01:11:47,831 --> 01:11:48,664
an alien.

1585
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:49,811
And they think,

1586
01:11:49,811 --> 01:11:49,961
well,

1587
01:11:49,961 --> 01:11:51,190
what the hell do you mean by that?

1588
01:11:51,191 --> 01:11:56,110
Because obviously it matters whether you
win and it does matter whether you win.

1589
01:11:56,350 --> 01:11:58,450
So what is it that you
mean when you say that?

1590
01:11:58,800 --> 01:11:59,800
And your kid asks,

1591
01:11:59,801 --> 01:11:59,921
well,

1592
01:11:59,921 --> 01:12:00,880
what do you mean by that?

1593
01:12:00,881 --> 01:12:02,050
And you go,

1594
01:12:02,230 --> 01:12:02,531
well,

1595
01:12:02,531 --> 01:12:03,430
I don't know what it means,

1596
01:12:03,431 --> 01:12:04,900
but it's a good rule.

1597
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:09,970
So what do you mean by that?

1598
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,440
Here's what you mean.

1599
01:12:13,150 --> 01:12:14,540
And it relates to rule five,

1600
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:15,740
which is don't make your.

1601
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:18,800
Don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them because other

1602
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:19,880
people will dislike them.

1603
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:23,600
That and you don't want other people to
dislike your children unless you want

1604
01:12:23,601 --> 01:12:26,720
your children to inhabit a world
where everyone dislikes them.

1605
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:30,770
And maybe you do because you don't like
your children and maybe you don't like

1606
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:34,130
your children because you let them behave
in ways that makes you not like them.

1607
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:37,760
And so the way you take revenge is by
not correcting them so that other people

1608
01:12:37,761 --> 01:12:40,670
will punish them because you don't
have the courage to discipline them.

1609
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:43,100
And if you think that
people don't play that game,

1610
01:12:43,101 --> 01:12:46,550
then you don't know much about people
because they play that game all the time.

1611
01:12:47,810 --> 01:12:48,141
All right?

1612
01:12:48,141 --> 01:12:48,974
So

1613
01:12:51,190 --> 01:12:52,630
it matters how you play the game.

1614
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:54,190
It doesn't matter whether you win or lose.

1615
01:12:54,340 --> 01:12:55,420
Let's take that apart.

1616
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:55,631
Well,

1617
01:12:55,631 --> 01:12:56,650
so the first thing is,

1618
01:12:56,950 --> 01:13:00,850
and this goes back to the idea of the
hierarchy is order a hierarchy and the

1619
01:13:00,851 --> 01:13:01,750
answer is no,

1620
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,120
it's a set of all hierarchies.

1621
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:06,010
Or You could say it's the,

1622
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:10,670
it's the set of all possible
hierarchies because you know in,

1623
01:13:10,671 --> 01:13:12,220
in a society at a given time,

1624
01:13:12,490 --> 01:13:13,840
there's hierarchies that function.

1625
01:13:13,841 --> 01:13:14,890
But that transforms.

1626
01:13:14,891 --> 01:13:16,600
And then there's new
hierarchies that function.

1627
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:21,010
The specifics of the hierarchies change,

1628
01:13:21,220 --> 01:13:23,650
but the fact of the hierarchies remains.

1629
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:28,780
And so you can imagine a hierarchy as
a metal structure that consists of a

1630
01:13:28,781 --> 01:13:30,790
multitude of possible hierarchies.

1631
01:13:31,420 --> 01:13:33,310
And that's going to
change as life continues.

1632
01:13:33,311 --> 01:13:38,311
And so what you want for your children
is not to be the master of hierarchy you

1633
01:13:38,411 --> 01:13:42,310
want for your children to be the master
of the set of all possible hierarchies,

1634
01:13:43,750 --> 01:13:45,350
because then no matter how things change,

1635
01:13:45,351 --> 01:13:47,140
they're ready say,

1636
01:13:47,141 --> 01:13:47,291
well,

1637
01:13:47,291 --> 01:13:50,260
how is it that you get
ready for things to change?

1638
01:13:50,261 --> 01:13:54,160
And the answer is play so that
people will invite you to play.

1639
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:55,751
Right?

1640
01:13:55,751 --> 01:13:56,620
And there's a rule for,

1641
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:57,450
for,

1642
01:13:57,450 --> 01:13:58,283
for children,

1643
01:13:58,390 --> 01:13:59,470
for raising children,

1644
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:00,281
and it really,

1645
01:14:00,281 --> 01:14:01,114
it's a rule.

1646
01:14:01,330 --> 01:14:03,190
One of the things you can
do with your children.

1647
01:14:03,430 --> 01:14:06,910
This is something good for men because
men are more likely to do this than

1648
01:14:06,911 --> 01:14:07,270
women.

1649
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:08,470
Although women can do it too,

1650
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:10,030
but men are more likely to do it.

1651
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:13,810
It's good for children to
engage in rough and tumble play,

1652
01:14:14,410 --> 01:14:15,243
play fighting.

1653
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:16,331
First of all,

1654
01:14:16,331 --> 01:14:19,780
if you have children and you've
played with them physically,

1655
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:21,940
you know that they absolutely love it.

1656
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:27,360
They will rough and tumble play with you
until you are completely exhausted and

1657
01:14:29,141 --> 01:14:32,440
they're not even vaguely ready to quit.

1658
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,220
They have an inexhaustible
hunger for it and they like it.

1659
01:14:36,610 --> 01:14:38,470
They like to be pushed to the edge.

1660
01:14:39,310 --> 01:14:42,220
So I knew this when I was a new father,

1661
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:45,340
partly because I read work
by a man named Jaak Panksepp,

1662
01:14:45,730 --> 01:14:46,630
who was a genius,

1663
01:14:46,950 --> 01:14:48,410
an effect of neuroscientists,

1664
01:14:48,411 --> 01:14:50,080
one of the world's great neuroscientists,

1665
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:52,390
perhaps the world's
greatest neuroscientists,

1666
01:14:52,391 --> 01:14:54,580
although there's four or five
people that might compete with him.

1667
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:57,550
He wrote a book called
affective neuroscience,

1668
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:58,630
emotional neural science,

1669
01:14:58,631 --> 01:15:00,190
which is a work of real genius.

1670
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,920
He discovered the play circuit in
mammals because there's a separate place

1671
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:04,691
circuit in mammals,

1672
01:15:04,691 --> 01:15:05,800
a specialized circuit,

1673
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:10,570
and he did a lot of work on rats and
showing that in order for a rat to become

1674
01:15:10,571 --> 01:15:12,730
socialized because rats are highly social,

1675
01:15:12,940 --> 01:15:16,690
they had to engage in iterative
bouts of rough and tumble play.

1676
01:15:17,200 --> 01:15:18,400
And here's a cool thing.

1677
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,050
It's a ridiculously cool thing.

1678
01:15:20,051 --> 01:15:20,884
So,

1679
01:15:21,090 --> 01:15:25,330
and this has to do in some sense with the
postmodern critique of the patriarchal

1680
01:15:25,331 --> 01:15:26,164
tyranny.

1681
01:15:26,290 --> 01:15:29,560
So if you take two juvenile rats,

1682
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:30,963
males,

1683
01:15:31,930 --> 01:15:32,763
and

1684
01:15:34,060 --> 01:15:36,910
you imagine you give them
an opportunity to play.

1685
01:15:37,060 --> 01:15:40,270
So you throw two of them into a little
player in and you let them wrestle,

1686
01:15:40,930 --> 01:15:41,763
okay?

1687
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,710
The next time that you bring
them to the same place,

1688
01:15:45,340 --> 01:15:48,670
you can measure how much work they'll
do to open the door to the arena,

1689
01:15:49,180 --> 01:15:51,220
how many times they'll push a button,

1690
01:15:51,370 --> 01:15:53,530
say to open the door or how hard,

1691
01:15:53,531 --> 01:15:57,970
how hard they'll pull if you tie a string
spring to their tail and so you can

1692
01:15:57,971 --> 01:16:01,580
get an estimate of their
motivation because the more
motivated they are to play

1693
01:16:01,581 --> 01:16:01,641
at,

1694
01:16:01,641 --> 01:16:06,641
the harder they'll work and rats will
work really hard to play so you know that

1695
01:16:06,941 --> 01:16:07,960
they want to play.

1696
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:11,530
I mean assuming that you're willing to
accept the fact that if you work for

1697
01:16:11,531 --> 01:16:11,921
something,

1698
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:12,600
you want it.

1699
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,290
It's like an operational definition,

1700
01:16:14,620 --> 01:16:16,090
so rats will work to play.

1701
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:22,410
Now if you let the rats out in the play
arena and one rat is 10 percent bigger

1702
01:16:22,781 --> 01:16:23,614
than the other,

1703
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:25,060
then that rat will win.

1704
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:26,171
You might say,

1705
01:16:26,171 --> 01:16:26,321
well,

1706
01:16:26,321 --> 01:16:27,280
what does winning mean?

1707
01:16:27,490 --> 01:16:29,620
Rats wrestle like people wrestle.

1708
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:34,090
They even pin each other and they
manifest play behavior to begin with,

1709
01:16:34,091 --> 01:16:35,350
like dogs playing in a park.

1710
01:16:35,351 --> 01:16:37,060
You know how a dog looks
when it wants to play.

1711
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,130
Sort of hunkers down a little bit.

1712
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,720
It looks up at you like expectancy
expectedly kind of moved back and forth,

1713
01:16:43,721 --> 01:16:44,500
which is like,

1714
01:16:44,500 --> 01:16:45,333
okay human,

1715
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:49,090
I'm ready to play and if you have
any sense and you know how to play,

1716
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,360
then you look at the dog and you sort of
go like this and the dog goes like this

1717
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:57,570
and you cuff the dog not too hard and
the dog bites you not too hard and then

1718
01:16:57,611 --> 01:16:59,710
you can play and you're
both happy with that.

1719
01:16:59,711 --> 01:17:04,630
And kids can do that with dogs because
kids understand dogs and dogs and kids

1720
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:05,291
knew how to play.

1721
01:17:05,291 --> 01:17:07,000
If if your dog can play,

1722
01:17:07,001 --> 01:17:08,920
then you should not own a dog.

1723
01:17:09,200 --> 01:17:10,640
You're not smart enough to own a dog.

1724
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:12,500
So it's true.

1725
01:17:13,310 --> 01:17:15,320
And if you have a dog that can't play,

1726
01:17:15,440 --> 01:17:16,730
then don't have a kid.

1727
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:18,313
Right?

1728
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:24,433
It's true.

1729
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:30,980
Stupidest dog I ever saw was owned
by a psychologist that was really

1730
01:17:30,981 --> 01:17:31,814
embarrassing.

1731
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,090
So okay,

1732
01:17:35,091 --> 01:17:39,500
so you put the rat to rats together and
there's the 10 percent bigger route and

1733
01:17:39,501 --> 01:17:43,580
there's the 10 percent smaller rat and
the 10 percent bigger rat stomps the

1734
01:17:43,581 --> 01:17:44,840
small rat and pins him.

1735
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:46,340
So he went.

1736
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:52,420
And so now you're a postmodernist doing
the experiment and you say powerful,

1737
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:55,160
tyrannical rat dominates hierarchy.

1738
01:17:55,910 --> 01:17:56,510
Really?

1739
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:56,901
Really?

1740
01:17:56,901 --> 01:18:00,170
That's what you conclude and
to experiment and you're.

1741
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:02,780
And it looks correct because powerful,

1742
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:06,020
dominant rat dominated and one,

1743
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:06,920
it's like,

1744
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:07,753
okay,

1745
01:18:09,150 --> 01:18:09,481
cep,

1746
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:10,314
for one thing,

1747
01:18:11,490 --> 01:18:13,050
rats live with rats.

1748
01:18:13,240 --> 01:18:18,240
No wonder they're not
psychopathic individuals
wandering from isolated community

1749
01:18:18,241 --> 01:18:19,200
die slated community.

1750
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,180
They know all the other rats and that
means they have to keep playing with them.

1751
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:30,170
And the rules for playing with someone
30 times are not the same as the rules

1752
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:32,430
for playing with someone once.

1753
01:18:33,090 --> 01:18:38,040
So Pang sap had the rats play
repeatedly and what he observed was,

1754
01:18:38,041 --> 01:18:38,311
okay,

1755
01:18:38,311 --> 01:18:40,470
now the next time you
put those rats together,

1756
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:42,330
the situation's a little different.

1757
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:47,190
The little rat comes bouncing out
and does the playful dog thing too.

1758
01:18:47,191 --> 01:18:48,024
The big rat.

1759
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,760
So now the rule is you're
the little rat you lost.

1760
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:53,760
You have to be the creature
that invites to play.

1761
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,080
That's now your status.

1762
01:18:55,290 --> 01:18:57,750
So you bounced around and you
know the big rats all cool.

1763
01:18:57,751 --> 01:18:59,370
And he's smoking a cigarette
and doesn't want to,

1764
01:18:59,800 --> 01:19:00,660
doesn't want to play,

1765
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:03,120
but they'll flick it away
at some point and think,

1766
01:19:03,121 --> 01:19:03,541
all right,

1767
01:19:03,541 --> 01:19:04,530
what the hell you know?

1768
01:19:04,860 --> 01:19:08,520
And so then he gets in it and so neat
can stomp the little route again because

1769
01:19:08,521 --> 01:19:09,420
he's a bigger rat.

1770
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:14,460
If the big Grad doesn't let the little
rat win 30 percent of the time across

1771
01:19:14,461 --> 01:19:15,480
repeated play boats,

1772
01:19:15,481 --> 01:19:17,430
then the little rat won't
ask him to play anymore.

1773
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,003
You think,

1774
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:20,991
well,

1775
01:19:20,991 --> 01:19:23,300
if you think about you
don't think so what?

1776
01:19:23,330 --> 01:19:23,871
You don't think.

1777
01:19:23,871 --> 01:19:26,720
Why did Jaak Panksepp waste
his time studying play in rats?

1778
01:19:26,721 --> 01:19:27,021
You Think,

1779
01:19:27,021 --> 01:19:27,711
oh my God,

1780
01:19:27,711 --> 01:19:29,150
that's an absolute miracle.

1781
01:19:29,510 --> 01:19:33,410
Because it shows you that there's an
ethic of fairplay that emerges as a

1782
01:19:33,411 --> 01:19:35,480
consequence of repeated bouts of play.

1783
01:19:35,510 --> 01:19:37,100
Even among rats.

1784
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,230
It's so basic.

1785
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:40,430
It isn't even human.

1786
01:19:40,670 --> 01:19:41,503
That ethic,

1787
01:19:41,540 --> 01:19:44,270
they ethic of fairplay
is deeper than human.

1788
01:19:44,810 --> 01:19:45,770
It's real.

1789
01:19:46,190 --> 01:19:49,670
And it's the ethic that
governs iterated interactions.

1790
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:52,280
And it's not just in rats
that we've seen this.

1791
01:19:52,281 --> 01:19:53,080
So you know,

1792
01:19:53,080 --> 01:19:54,920
chimpanzees are pretty damn brutal.

1793
01:19:55,070 --> 01:19:56,690
They're way more brutal than you think.

1794
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,591
And they're really,

1795
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:58,424
really strong.

1796
01:19:58,430 --> 01:20:00,920
Maybe six times as
strong as an adult male.

1797
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,290
Now there's the estimates vary,

1798
01:20:03,291 --> 01:20:07,200
but there are plenty strong enough to
tear you to bits and that happens now and

1799
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:12,090
then people have chimps for pets and they
become adults and it's like don't mess

1800
01:20:12,091 --> 01:20:17,091
with the chimp because it'll tear you to
pieces and so and chimps are brutal and

1801
01:20:17,851 --> 01:20:22,350
this is interesting because they're our
closest relatives and so Jane Goodall

1802
01:20:22,351 --> 01:20:26,580
discovered in the 19 seventies that
rats or tribe or chimps are tribal.

1803
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:31,560
They live in tribal groups like we do and
they have a territory that's the known

1804
01:20:31,561 --> 01:20:34,290
territory and there's a
perimeter that's the unknown.

1805
01:20:34,291 --> 01:20:37,680
That's chaos and other
chimpanzees inhabit the chaos.

1806
01:20:37,890 --> 01:20:42,890
Foreign Chimpanzees and the juvenile
chimps patrol the perimeters in groups of

1807
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:44,334
four or five,

1808
01:20:44,490 --> 01:20:45,690
and if they spy us,

1809
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:48,180
a foreign chimp or two of them,

1810
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,310
if they outnumber them
because they can't count,

1811
01:20:50,311 --> 01:20:52,110
but they have a sense of quantity.

1812
01:20:52,530 --> 01:20:55,140
If five chimps come
across to foreign chimps,

1813
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:59,190
they will tear them to bits and
I actually mean that literally.

1814
01:20:59,490 --> 01:21:02,430
That's what they do and chimps also hunt.

1815
01:21:02,610 --> 01:21:06,240
They hunt colobus monkeys and they
weigh about 40 pounds and they're quite

1816
01:21:06,241 --> 01:21:08,400
carnivorous and they will eat them alive.

1817
01:21:08,401 --> 01:21:08,631
Well,

1818
01:21:08,631 --> 01:21:09,464
they're screaming,

1819
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:14,700
so there isn't a lot of empathy
regulating chimp aggression,

1820
01:21:14,880 --> 01:21:18,270
which is something to think about when
you think about human beings because it's

1821
01:21:18,271 --> 01:21:21,120
not obvious what regulates our
aggression and you might think,

1822
01:21:21,121 --> 01:21:21,301
well,

1823
01:21:21,301 --> 01:21:23,100
it's your conscience and like,

1824
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:23,910
yeah,

1825
01:21:23,910 --> 01:21:26,970
maybe it's your conscience
and maybe it's something else.

1826
01:21:27,180 --> 01:21:27,871
You read the book,

1827
01:21:27,871 --> 01:21:30,690
have you read the rape
of Nanking for example,

1828
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,190
and you'll start wondering very,

1829
01:21:32,191 --> 01:21:35,010
very rapidly about whether people
have any conscience at all.

1830
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:40,310
So that's a story of absolutely
atrocious Japanese behavior in China at,

1831
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:44,160
at the beginning of World War
II and it's a horrifying book.

1832
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:45,630
So read it with caution,

1833
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:47,100
but it's very instructive.

1834
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,500
So anyways,

1835
01:21:49,501 --> 01:21:50,334
the chimps,

1836
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:53,790
the chimps are very brutal
creatures and so you might think,

1837
01:21:53,791 --> 01:21:54,600
well,

1838
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:57,810
let's look at a chimp hierarchy because
chimps have dominance hierarchies in

1839
01:21:57,811 --> 01:21:57,931
there.

1840
01:21:57,931 --> 01:21:59,370
Basically male dominated,

1841
01:21:59,371 --> 01:22:02,760
although there are lots of
powerful female chimps say,

1842
01:22:02,761 --> 01:22:03,031
okay,

1843
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:05,010
who becomes the dominant chimp?

1844
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,990
And the answer might be,

1845
01:22:07,050 --> 01:22:08,700
and this would be the postmodern answer,

1846
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:14,060
the most powerful tyrannical brutal
chimp rules because it's power that moves

1847
01:22:15,541 --> 01:22:16,500
you up the hierarchy.

1848
01:22:16,850 --> 01:22:19,740
It's like that happened
sometimes among chimps,

1849
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,110
but you know what happens to tyron chimps,

1850
01:22:23,010 --> 01:22:28,010
they have an off day and to
subordinate chimps each three quarters,

1851
01:22:29,041 --> 01:22:34,041
the size gang up to make a one and a half
super chimp and then they tear him to

1852
01:22:34,441 --> 01:22:35,274
pieces.

1853
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:36,720
Right?

1854
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,190
So here's the rule.

1855
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:41,760
If you're a chimp
tyrants meet bloody ends.

1856
01:22:42,690 --> 01:22:47,690
So how do you conduct yourself as a
chimp if you want to be at the top of the

1857
01:22:47,941 --> 01:22:52,110
hierarchy and have preferential access
to the things that being at the top of

1858
01:22:52,111 --> 01:22:57,111
the hierarchy would give you and
answer is engage in mutually reciprocal

1859
01:22:57,631 --> 01:22:59,670
interactions with your peers.

1860
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,890
The chimps that rise to the top,

1861
01:23:01,891 --> 01:23:06,010
that stay there stable and also have
the most stable functioning by the way,

1862
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:10,570
are the ones that have friends that are
long term and permanent and engage in

1863
01:23:10,571 --> 01:23:12,910
reciprocal interactions not
only with their friends,

1864
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:14,950
but also with the females and the infants.

1865
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:16,960
And so even among chimps,

1866
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,720
patriarchal tyranny,

1867
01:23:19,930 --> 01:23:24,760
a is not the norm and B is not the
proper motive approaching the situation,

1868
01:23:25,270 --> 01:23:28,060
and so that speaks to a broader ethic.

1869
01:23:28,061 --> 01:23:31,750
The same kind of ethic that is spoken
to with regards to the rat studies have

1870
01:23:31,751 --> 01:23:35,680
play behavior and you can see this sort
of thing throughout the animal kingdom.

1871
01:23:36,210 --> 01:23:36,640
There's A.

1872
01:23:36,640 --> 01:23:40,750
There's a pattern of reciprocal
interaction that seems to stabilize social

1873
01:23:40,751 --> 01:23:43,360
animals that isn't
predicated on brute force.

1874
01:23:43,510 --> 01:23:45,310
Now maybe the simpler the animal,

1875
01:23:46,390 --> 01:23:48,460
the more it's predicated on brute force,

1876
01:23:48,610 --> 01:23:53,170
but we are by no means simple animals
and the idea that our hierarchies are

1877
01:23:53,171 --> 01:23:54,790
fundamentally tyrannical.

1878
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:56,380
The patriarchy,

1879
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:01,710
which is a word that nobody who thinks
carefully should ever use casually.

1880
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:05,620
That term is predicated
on the idea that a,

1881
01:24:05,621 --> 01:24:07,600
that are hierarchies are tyrannical,

1882
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:08,740
which they aren't.

1883
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:13,150
Although they can become that way and
be that the most reliable means to

1884
01:24:13,151 --> 01:24:17,980
attaining status within a hierarchy is
through the expression of power and both

1885
01:24:17,981 --> 01:24:19,930
of those things are wrong.

1886
01:24:21,130 --> 01:24:22,120
They're wrong.

1887
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:22,931
And nonetheless,

1888
01:24:22,931 --> 01:24:26,440
that's the primary theory of the
social sciences and the humanities,

1889
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:27,910
and enough of that,

1890
01:24:28,180 --> 01:24:28,500
we've,

1891
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:33,500
we have enough data to indicate that
none of that's sufficiently sophisticated

1892
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,390
to constitute a reasonable
explanation of the world.

1893
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,780
So we should dispense with
it as fast as possible.

1894
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:45,520
All it's doing is dividing us into tribes
and it's not solving the problems that

1895
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:47,620
it's hypothetically intended to solve.

1896
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,203
So,

1897
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:56,521
okay,

1898
01:24:56,521 --> 01:25:00,690
so now back to the question.

1899
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:01,553
So

1900
01:25:04,590 --> 01:25:06,000
there isn't that hierarchy.

1901
01:25:06,360 --> 01:25:10,740
There's a set of hierarchies
and it's like the set of games.

1902
01:25:11,070 --> 01:25:15,240
So here's what you're telling your child
when you say it doesn't matter whether

1903
01:25:15,241 --> 01:25:16,074
you win or lose,

1904
01:25:16,230 --> 01:25:17,610
it matters how you play the game.

1905
01:25:17,640 --> 01:25:20,700
What you're telling them
is life is not a game.

1906
01:25:22,080 --> 01:25:24,570
It's not even a sequence
of the same games.

1907
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,300
It's multiple sequences
of different games.

1908
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:33,030
And if you want to be a successful
player in the set of multiple sequence of

1909
01:25:33,031 --> 01:25:34,020
different games,

1910
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,660
then you have to adopt
a higher order ethic.

1911
01:25:37,410 --> 01:25:41,580
And you don't subordinate that ethic
to victory in any one game ever.

1912
01:25:42,540 --> 01:25:46,940
So you put the manner in which
you play above your victory in,

1913
01:25:47,190 --> 01:25:48,360
in each instance.

1914
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:53,280
And the reason that that produces the
best possible outcome for you is that you

1915
01:25:53,281 --> 01:25:55,710
get invited to play the
largest number of games.

1916
01:25:56,670 --> 01:25:58,410
And so let's go back to rule five.

1917
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,260
Don't let your children do anything
that makes you dislike them.

1918
01:26:01,650 --> 01:26:01,921
Okay?

1919
01:26:01,921 --> 01:26:03,060
So let's say you like your.

1920
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:06,890
Let's say you love your children
and you want the best for them.

1921
01:26:07,460 --> 01:26:09,260
You detach yourself and a
little bit and you think,

1922
01:26:09,261 --> 01:26:10,094
well,

1923
01:26:10,820 --> 01:26:12,470
I'm not going to be around forever.

1924
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:16,130
And they're going to deal with
a lot of different people,

1925
01:26:17,420 --> 01:26:18,440
single people,

1926
01:26:18,890 --> 01:26:19,790
like individuals,

1927
01:26:20,150 --> 01:26:21,170
groups of people,

1928
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:23,690
children and adults.

1929
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:29,140
And what they have to be prepared for is
to interact with that set of people in

1930
01:26:29,301 --> 01:26:30,500
the best possible manner.

1931
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:31,880
Because.

1932
01:26:31,880 --> 01:26:32,750
And so what do you want?

1933
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:32,961
Well,

1934
01:26:32,961 --> 01:26:34,850
let's say your child's two,

1935
01:26:34,970 --> 01:26:38,600
and it's still pretty egocentric
because children two year olds are quite

1936
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:39,434
egocentric.

1937
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:40,970
They can't share yet.

1938
01:26:41,150 --> 01:26:45,140
They don't really learn how to share
in any technical sense till were about

1939
01:26:45,141 --> 01:26:45,974
three.

1940
01:26:46,070 --> 01:26:47,570
It's hard for them to learn to share

1941
01:26:50,480 --> 01:26:51,410
between two and four.

1942
01:26:51,411 --> 01:26:53,330
They learn to share and to play.

1943
01:26:53,660 --> 01:26:56,090
And the way they learn
is by at least in part,

1944
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:58,610
by engaging in reciprocal
interactions with their parents.

1945
01:26:58,970 --> 01:26:59,121
Now,

1946
01:26:59,121 --> 01:27:00,230
what is it that it.

1947
01:27:00,380 --> 01:27:01,040
What is it?

1948
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:04,880
That's your job when you're
socializing a child who's two to four,

1949
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:08,240
you have to do it between the
ages of two and four by the way,

1950
01:27:08,510 --> 01:27:11,150
because if you don't manage
it by the time they're four,

1951
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:14,390
then you might as well give up
because it isn't going to happen.

1952
01:27:14,810 --> 01:27:18,590
And the literature on antisocial behavior
in children is crystal clear on this

1953
01:27:18,591 --> 01:27:19,424
point.

1954
01:27:19,460 --> 01:27:23,570
If your child's antisocial
at for you failed.

1955
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:26,060
And there isn't anything
that can be done about it.

1956
01:27:26,510 --> 01:27:27,770
It's a dismal literature.

1957
01:27:27,771 --> 01:27:28,604
And believe me,

1958
01:27:28,820 --> 01:27:33,710
psychologists and sociologists
and anthropologists and
criminologists have tried

1959
01:27:33,711 --> 01:27:38,711
for like six decades to figure out how
to remediate antisocial behavior in older

1960
01:27:39,201 --> 01:27:42,470
children and adolescents
and they haven't managed it.

1961
01:27:43,340 --> 01:27:44,173
So.

1962
01:27:44,630 --> 01:27:47,000
So two between two and four is crucial.

1963
01:27:49,500 --> 01:27:52,650
You want to help your child become the
sort of person that other children want

1964
01:27:52,651 --> 01:27:53,484
to play with.

1965
01:27:54,180 --> 01:27:57,960
And the reason you want to do
that is because from four onward,

1966
01:27:57,990 --> 01:28:00,750
other children are the primary
agents of socialization.

1967
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:04,140
And so if your children are
accepted by other children,

1968
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:07,410
then they're on their way because
other children will socialize them.

1969
01:28:07,411 --> 01:28:09,180
It doesn't mean you're
not important as a parent,

1970
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:13,980
but it means they find their peers who
are at the same developmental level as

1971
01:28:13,981 --> 01:28:18,270
them and they start to reciprocally
socialize one another and they do that

1972
01:28:18,271 --> 01:28:19,104
through play.

1973
01:28:19,230 --> 01:28:23,550
And so if you've prepared your
child to be a great play companion,

1974
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:26,520
then you can just stand
back and let it happen.

1975
01:28:26,521 --> 01:28:28,770
And you have to be around
when something breaks down.

1976
01:28:28,950 --> 01:28:30,480
When the system doesn't work properly,

1977
01:28:30,481 --> 01:28:31,890
you have to be there as a resource.

1978
01:28:32,070 --> 01:28:35,640
But basically you can sort of push
them out onto the playground and say,

1979
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:36,301
you know,

1980
01:28:36,301 --> 01:28:37,134
you know what to do.

1981
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:42,140
Go play and play is of absolutely crucial
importance as documented by people

1982
01:28:43,561 --> 01:28:44,670
like John Piaget.

1983
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:50,240
So you're trying to make your child
maximally attractive as a play partner.

1984
01:28:50,551 --> 01:28:55,140
And the ethic there is while the world
is made out of a sequence of hierarchies

1985
01:28:55,141 --> 01:28:56,460
that transform.

1986
01:28:57,000 --> 01:29:01,260
And so you want your child to be
the sort of person who's invited.

1987
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:06,380
Participate in what ever hierarchy
organizes itself and how and what should a

1988
01:29:07,711 --> 01:29:11,130
child be like to do that
while they have to be.

1989
01:29:11,190 --> 01:29:12,330
Be Reciprocal.

1990
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,790
Take turns right.

1991
01:29:15,060 --> 01:29:16,800
You don't always get to pick the game.

1992
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:19,290
You have to find out what
other people want to do.

1993
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:21,300
They have to want to play too.

1994
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:26,450
Like there's all these sophisticated
ethical rules that go around play and you

1995
01:29:26,581 --> 01:29:29,580
know if you're playing with some of you
have played with kids that aren't fun to

1996
01:29:29,581 --> 01:29:30,414
play with,

1997
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:31,560
well what do they like?

1998
01:29:31,920 --> 01:29:33,510
If something doesn't go their way,

1999
01:29:33,511 --> 01:29:34,350
what happens?

2000
01:29:34,920 --> 01:29:39,360
They have an emotional outburst so they
revert to the behavior of a ill prepared

2001
01:29:39,361 --> 01:29:40,194
two year old.

2002
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:41,670
They have a temper tantrum.

2003
01:29:41,671 --> 01:29:42,780
They burst into tears.

2004
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,970
They thrashed around on the floor.

2005
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:48,270
It's not fun because when you play,

2006
01:29:48,360 --> 01:29:51,510
if you don't lose some times
that no one else ever wins,

2007
01:29:51,660 --> 01:29:53,910
so who the hell is going to
play with someone like that?

2008
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,120
A downtrodden victim,

2009
01:29:57,121 --> 01:29:57,960
that's all.

2010
01:29:58,050 --> 01:29:58,883
It's not.

2011
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,380
No kid with any sense is
going to put up with that.

2012
01:30:01,410 --> 01:30:01,830
All they do,

2013
01:30:01,830 --> 01:30:03,390
and this is exactly what kids are like,

2014
01:30:04,200 --> 01:30:09,200
if they find out that their potential
play partner is a whiny two year old,

2015
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,930
even though therefore they just start
playing and they go find another kid,

2016
01:30:13,320 --> 01:30:14,700
that's exactly what happens,

2017
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:16,770
and so if you want that for your kid,

2018
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,590
then make sure that they're whiny
and bitter every time they lose.

2019
01:30:19,770 --> 01:30:24,000
A good way to do that is to never let
them lose at anything so they don't get

2020
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:24,870
any practice.

2021
01:30:24,900 --> 01:30:25,111
Well,

2022
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:26,370
I don't want my kid to lose.

2023
01:30:26,371 --> 01:30:28,200
It's wrong.

2024
01:30:28,740 --> 01:30:29,573
You don't want to.

2025
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:33,510
You don't want your kid to lose
in an unsophisticated manner.

2026
01:30:34,020 --> 01:30:35,310
That's not the same thing at all.

2027
01:30:35,311 --> 01:30:38,940
And if you think the way you accomplish
that is by never having your kid lose,

2028
01:30:38,941 --> 01:30:40,260
then well then,

2029
01:30:42,070 --> 01:30:43,000
well then we're back to the.

2030
01:30:43,001 --> 01:30:44,860
You shouldn't even own a dog problem.

2031
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:53,083
All right,

2032
01:30:53,270 --> 01:30:54,800
so then you might take apart.

2033
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:58,160
What does it mean to be
a desirable play partner?

2034
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:00,200
Assuming you're gonna play reciprocal,

2035
01:31:00,201 --> 01:31:02,960
repeated games across all
sorts of different contexts.

2036
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:04,040
Well,

2037
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:04,480
there's a,

2038
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:06,440
there's a whole aspect
that emerges from that.

2039
01:31:07,060 --> 01:31:09,650
See Nature back in the late 18 hundreds.

2040
01:31:09,651 --> 01:31:13,070
He was the first person to kind of caught
onto this sort of thing because until

2041
01:31:13,071 --> 01:31:13,790
then,

2042
01:31:13,790 --> 01:31:18,620
people tended to think of morality as
something that was invented rationally and

2043
01:31:18,621 --> 01:31:20,660
then imposed from the top down,

2044
01:31:21,410 --> 01:31:25,430
but nature being a very intelligent
observer noted that well,

2045
01:31:25,431 --> 01:31:26,660
that wasn't really the case.

2046
01:31:26,810 --> 01:31:31,810
There was a ethic already built into
human interactions that we all acted out,

2047
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:35,510
but that we didn't really
understand very well.

2048
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:37,220
So here's a way to think about that.

2049
01:31:38,090 --> 01:31:43,090
So imagine you're watching a wolf
pack and wolves compete for dominance.

2050
01:31:43,820 --> 01:31:47,900
And so the way they do that is they
basically have a play fight about it.

2051
01:31:47,930 --> 01:31:49,670
Now it's this fairly serious play fight.

2052
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:54,050
And so two wolves that are engaged in
a dominance dispute will sort of sand

2053
01:31:54,051 --> 01:31:55,400
sideways to each other.

2054
01:31:55,910 --> 01:31:57,020
You know how cats do that?

2055
01:31:57,021 --> 01:32:00,430
Do you ever watched two caps
fight cats stand sideways,

2056
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:01,151
think,

2057
01:32:01,151 --> 01:32:01,241
well,

2058
01:32:01,241 --> 01:32:03,250
why does it cat stand
sideways when it's fighting?

2059
01:32:03,940 --> 01:32:07,810
It's because a sideways cat is
a bigger cat than a hand on cat.

2060
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,890
So the cat's trying to intimidate the
other cat so it stand sideways and it

2061
01:32:11,891 --> 01:32:13,930
puffs itself up including its tail.

2062
01:32:14,260 --> 01:32:18,140
And the reason it does that is so that
it looks bigger because one cat isn't.

2063
01:32:18,380 --> 01:32:19,630
Cats don't want to fight,

2064
01:32:20,350 --> 01:32:23,350
they want to threaten
until one cat backs down.

2065
01:32:23,380 --> 01:32:27,730
And so they puff themselves up and they
make horrible noises and they face off

2066
01:32:27,731 --> 01:32:28,564
against each other,

2067
01:32:28,600 --> 01:32:32,290
but they don't want to fight because
the two cats that are fighting my damage

2068
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:32,621
each other,

2069
01:32:32,621 --> 01:32:34,630
then a third cat comes in and like wins.

2070
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,130
It's a stupid strategy.

2071
01:32:36,490 --> 01:32:37,450
So it's,

2072
01:32:37,460 --> 01:32:37,731
it is.

2073
01:32:37,731 --> 01:32:38,230
It's so.

2074
01:32:38,230 --> 01:32:41,350
Most animals don't like to fight
because they might damage to themselves.

2075
01:32:41,351 --> 01:32:42,730
And then another interloper.

2076
01:32:42,731 --> 01:32:43,211
We'll just,

2077
01:32:43,211 --> 01:32:46,840
when it's a stupid strategy and human
beings are quite a bit like that.

2078
01:32:46,841 --> 01:32:49,570
We do a lot of posturing
and defensive display,

2079
01:32:49,571 --> 01:32:50,860
an aggressive display and all that.

2080
01:32:50,861 --> 01:32:52,420
But we don't fight very often for the,

2081
01:32:52,450 --> 01:32:53,440
for the same reasons.

2082
01:32:53,441 --> 01:32:56,770
And it's only when those other mechanisms
breakdown that we actually fight.

2083
01:32:58,180 --> 01:32:59,013
So

2084
01:33:04,440 --> 01:33:06,900
what happens in a wolf dispute is this,

2085
01:33:07,050 --> 01:33:12,050
the wolves square off and they amp up
the threats in the hope that one of the

2086
01:33:14,101 --> 01:33:15,540
wolves will back the hell down.

2087
01:33:15,690 --> 01:33:18,540
Because what'll happen is the
wolf will chicken out one of them.

2088
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:20,070
And then when it does,

2089
01:33:20,071 --> 01:33:22,800
it rolls over and shows its neck.

2090
01:33:23,490 --> 01:33:24,323
Why?

2091
01:33:24,690 --> 01:33:24,871
Well,

2092
01:33:24,871 --> 01:33:26,250
because when wolves hunt,

2093
01:33:26,700 --> 01:33:28,260
they go for the neck generally,

2094
01:33:28,261 --> 01:33:30,720
like wolves are quite cruel
creatures in some sense.

2095
01:33:30,721 --> 01:33:33,780
And they'll actually
eat moose standing up.

2096
01:33:34,050 --> 01:33:35,640
But generally speaking,

2097
01:33:35,641 --> 01:33:36,510
if they can manage it,

2098
01:33:36,511 --> 01:33:39,150
they go for the throat and
they'll bring the animal down.

2099
01:33:39,540 --> 01:33:42,750
And so what the wolf
is basically saying is,

2100
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,390
well you scared me half to death.

2101
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:46,790
I'm a useful move.

2102
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:48,240
I'm a useless moose.

2103
01:33:48,570 --> 01:33:50,220
You might as well tear up my neck.

2104
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:52,140
And other wolf says,

2105
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:52,951
yeah,

2106
01:33:52,951 --> 01:33:55,800
you're pretty detestable and
you're kind of like a moose,

2107
01:33:56,040 --> 01:34:00,720
but I might need you to hunt tomorrow
so I know I can tear out your neck,

2108
01:34:00,721 --> 01:34:01,554
but I won't.

2109
01:34:01,680 --> 01:34:06,300
And then the defeated Wolf stands up and
he's not very happy and he's kind of a

2110
01:34:06,301 --> 01:34:07,230
low status wolf,

2111
01:34:07,231 --> 01:34:09,270
but at least he's still got his neck.

2112
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:14,220
And the victor wolf gets to be high
status wolf and he gets to go hunting with

2113
01:34:14,221 --> 01:34:15,600
his partner the next day.

2114
01:34:16,170 --> 01:34:17,010
And so you might think,

2115
01:34:17,011 --> 01:34:17,191
well,

2116
01:34:17,191 --> 01:34:22,191
wolves have a complex procedural morality
and morality is don't tear the neck

2117
01:34:23,881 --> 01:34:24,780
out of your,

2118
01:34:25,170 --> 01:34:28,920
out of the out of the creature
you defeat that's wrong.

2119
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:29,911
And then you might say,

2120
01:34:29,911 --> 01:34:30,061
well,

2121
01:34:30,061 --> 01:34:32,130
that's the rule that will follow,

2122
01:34:32,370 --> 01:34:35,400
but that's wrong because wolves don't
follow rules because wolves don't have

2123
01:34:35,401 --> 01:34:39,060
rules because they don't have language
and they don't think not like us.

2124
01:34:39,300 --> 01:34:41,520
They act like they have rules.

2125
01:34:42,150 --> 01:34:44,520
They act so that if you watch them act,

2126
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,460
you could label what
they're doing with the rule.

2127
01:34:48,270 --> 01:34:50,130
That's how we got our rules.

2128
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:52,860
That's how we got our rules.

2129
01:34:53,460 --> 01:34:56,820
We acted out and ethic and then we.

2130
01:34:58,070 --> 01:35:00,290
And then we coded it in stories.

2131
01:35:00,890 --> 01:35:03,230
That's what our religious
stories are there.

2132
01:35:03,231 --> 01:35:08,150
The consequence of us watching what it
is that we do when we act ethically and

2133
01:35:08,151 --> 01:35:12,260
then transforming that into a story and
everyone's intent on that story exists

2134
01:35:12,261 --> 01:35:14,960
absolutely intent on the
story of good versus evil,

2135
01:35:14,961 --> 01:35:15,350
let's say,

2136
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:16,760
because that's the fundamental story.

2137
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,740
And why do you want to watch that story?

2138
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:22,190
Because you want to know how to be the
victor in the set of all possible games.

2139
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:25,790
And that's what that story's about
and that's what movies are about.

2140
01:35:25,791 --> 01:35:26,870
And that's what books are about,

2141
01:35:26,871 --> 01:35:28,700
announced what religious
narratives are about.

2142
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:32,720
That's what everything that grips
us at a literary level is about.

2143
01:35:32,990 --> 01:35:36,680
And the reason that it grips this is
because that's what the world is made of

2144
01:35:36,770 --> 01:35:38,270
and that's what we need to know.

2145
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:40,280
So then you might think.

2146
01:35:40,460 --> 01:35:41,960
So here's something to think about.

2147
01:35:43,040 --> 01:35:45,710
I'll give you a symbolic
representation of this.

2148
01:35:45,711 --> 01:35:46,370
Okay?

2149
01:35:46,370 --> 01:35:48,200
So there's this idea in Christianity,

2150
01:35:48,890 --> 01:35:52,190
and I'm not talking about this
from a religious perspective,

2151
01:35:52,690 --> 01:35:53,090
okay,

2152
01:35:53,090 --> 01:35:57,470
I'm talking about this
from an anthropological
perspective or a biological

2153
01:35:57,471 --> 01:35:59,180
perspective or a

2154
01:36:01,760 --> 01:36:05,180
that'll do an anthropological or a
bylaw or psychological perspective.

2155
01:36:05,360 --> 01:36:10,360
So there's this idea in Christianity that
Christ is Christ is the king of kings.

2156
01:36:12,640 --> 01:36:12,860
Okay?

2157
01:36:12,860 --> 01:36:14,150
So I'm going to take that apart.

2158
01:36:15,050 --> 01:36:16,780
So imagine that you have a hierarchy,

2159
01:36:17,270 --> 01:36:18,103
whatever it is,

2160
01:36:18,260 --> 01:36:19,610
and there's someone at the top of it.

2161
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:24,020
And so that person has the attributes
necessary to be at the top of that

2162
01:36:24,021 --> 01:36:24,854
hierarchy.

2163
01:36:24,860 --> 01:36:29,420
And maybe it's a hockey team and you go
home and you tell a story about how the

2164
01:36:29,421 --> 01:36:33,800
best hockey player on your team played
while they were being the best hockey

2165
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:34,460
player.

2166
01:36:34,460 --> 01:36:35,660
It's a little hero narrative,

2167
01:36:36,300 --> 01:36:40,460
so little fragment of a hero
narrative and maybe it's hockey,

2168
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:41,593
soccer,

2169
01:36:41,720 --> 01:36:42,553
plumbing,

2170
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:43,423
law,

2171
01:36:43,640 --> 01:36:44,473
business,

2172
01:36:44,570 --> 01:36:45,290
art.

2173
01:36:45,290 --> 01:36:46,520
There's all these hierarchies.

2174
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:50,030
And then there's the thing
that's at the top of all of them.

2175
01:36:50,930 --> 01:36:54,830
And the thing that's all the at the top
of all of them has something in common.

2176
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:59,420
That's whatever it is that's in common
across all the things that are at the

2177
01:36:59,421 --> 01:37:00,254
top.

2178
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:01,850
So imagine this,

2179
01:37:01,851 --> 01:37:02,121
okay,

2180
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:03,380
so you could think about this.

2181
01:37:03,920 --> 01:37:08,570
Imagine that you're a novelist and you
want to distill some characters and you

2182
01:37:08,571 --> 01:37:11,950
want the good evil character because
what the hell good is your book without a

2183
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,880
good evil character and you want a good,

2184
01:37:13,881 --> 01:37:16,090
good character because
the same problem applies.

2185
01:37:16,220 --> 01:37:20,090
You don't want to just tell
a story about some guy's Day,

2186
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:21,201
right?

2187
01:37:21,201 --> 01:37:21,891
You don't want to say,

2188
01:37:21,891 --> 01:37:22,520
well,

2189
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:27,520
John woke up at six and then he smacked
his lips four times in blank 20 times

2190
01:37:29,060 --> 01:37:32,840
and then he swung his feet over across
the bed and walked into the bathroom.

2191
01:37:33,050 --> 01:37:34,820
Because who cares about any of that?

2192
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:39,650
You don't need to know that because you
know how to move your mouth and cough

2193
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:41,090
and walk to the bathroom.

2194
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:42,320
It's not helpful.

2195
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:44,060
You want to distillation.

2196
01:37:44,061 --> 01:37:47,570
You want the novelist who have watched
a bunch of people and abstracted out

2197
01:37:47,571 --> 01:37:52,100
someone who's good in a way that's good
across a bunch of people and you want

2198
01:37:52,101 --> 01:37:56,610
him to have abstracted out someone who's
evil that's abstracted across a bunch

2199
01:37:56,611 --> 01:37:57,381
of evil characters,

2200
01:37:57,381 --> 01:37:59,100
so you see that in hamlet for example.

2201
01:37:59,101 --> 01:38:03,480
You see that Dostoevsky where the where
the characters are bigger than life and

2202
01:38:03,481 --> 01:38:07,140
you want them bigger than life because
you want it distilled so that you can

2203
01:38:07,141 --> 01:38:09,810
learn from it and what you're
learning is that ethic.

2204
01:38:10,680 --> 01:38:10,981
Okay,

2205
01:38:10,981 --> 01:38:13,890
so that imagine that you
have 100 hierarchies,

2206
01:38:13,891 --> 01:38:15,240
just mundane hierarchies.

2207
01:38:15,660 --> 01:38:18,990
Then you take the people at the top of
all those hierarchies and say that you

2208
01:38:18,991 --> 01:38:20,520
group them into groups of 10.

2209
01:38:21,490 --> 01:38:21,760
Okay,

2210
01:38:21,760 --> 01:38:24,810
so you take 10 admirable
people and then you say,

2211
01:38:24,811 --> 01:38:25,021
well,

2212
01:38:25,021 --> 01:38:28,020
we're going to average across them and
we're going to come out with the most ad

2213
01:38:28,310 --> 01:38:31,140
with a compass it admirable person made.

2214
01:38:31,141 --> 01:38:32,130
Out of those 10,

2215
01:38:32,670 --> 01:38:33,900
you have 100 to begin with.

2216
01:38:34,350 --> 01:38:36,150
So let's say you have a
thousand to begin with.

2217
01:38:36,151 --> 01:38:38,610
You distill them to 100 admirable people.

2218
01:38:38,790 --> 01:38:40,580
Then you take that hundred
admirable people in,

2219
01:38:40,581 --> 01:38:42,090
you distill them into 10.

2220
01:38:43,460 --> 01:38:47,680
Then you take those 10 admirable people
and you distill them into one and what

2221
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:51,450
that one is is what's admirable across
the entire set of admirable people.

2222
01:38:52,830 --> 01:38:55,260
That's a divine figure
in a mythological story.

2223
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:57,330
That's what it is.

2224
01:38:57,690 --> 01:38:59,130
And so the Christian ideas,

2225
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:02,010
Christ is the king of kings
and that's what it means.

2226
01:39:02,190 --> 01:39:06,330
You go into a cathedral and the
cathedral is across by the way,

2227
01:39:06,830 --> 01:39:11,490
and the cross is the place where suffering
is accepted and the cross is a dome

2228
01:39:11,491 --> 01:39:11,880
over it.

2229
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:12,900
Then that's the sky.

2230
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:13,891
Okay?

2231
01:39:13,891 --> 01:39:18,180
So there's an idea in the cathedral and
the idea is that the place of the cross,

2232
01:39:18,181 --> 01:39:19,710
which is where suffering occurs,

2233
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:21,690
is the center of the universe,

2234
01:39:22,050 --> 01:39:22,950
which is the Dome,

2235
01:39:23,090 --> 01:39:26,460
and then you look up at the Dome and
you see this figure staring down at you.

2236
01:39:27,090 --> 01:39:30,900
That's the king of kings and
that's how to behave in the world.

2237
01:39:32,010 --> 01:39:33,600
That's what that image represents.

2238
01:39:34,350 --> 01:39:34,921
And you think,

2239
01:39:34,921 --> 01:39:35,754
well,

2240
01:39:35,970 --> 01:39:36,803
what does it mean?

2241
01:39:36,810 --> 01:39:37,021
Well,

2242
01:39:37,021 --> 01:39:42,021
here's a way of unpacking it and this is
associated with its associated with the

2243
01:39:43,261 --> 01:39:47,040
idea of how to behave across the
set of all possible hierarchies.

2244
01:39:48,060 --> 01:39:48,181
Well,

2245
01:39:48,181 --> 01:39:49,014
what should you do?

2246
01:39:49,230 --> 01:39:49,501
Well,

2247
01:39:49,501 --> 01:39:50,610
according to rule one,

2248
01:39:51,180 --> 01:39:53,610
you should stand up straight
with your shoulders back.

2249
01:39:54,570 --> 01:39:54,960
Okay?

2250
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,580
Now the people who have been,

2251
01:39:56,850 --> 01:39:59,310
some of the people who've
been criticizing me say,

2252
01:39:59,670 --> 01:39:59,851
well,

2253
01:39:59,851 --> 01:40:01,860
because I pointed out
that hierarchies exist.

2254
01:40:01,860 --> 01:40:02,850
I'm justifying them.

2255
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:08,410
It's like pointing out that something
exists is not the same as justifying it.

2256
01:40:09,360 --> 01:40:14,190
It's just pointing out that it exists
and pointing out that it exists without

2257
01:40:14,191 --> 01:40:14,851
justifying.

2258
01:40:14,851 --> 01:40:19,650
It is certainly not saying that the way
to attain dominance in a hierarchy is

2259
01:40:19,651 --> 01:40:20,670
through power.

2260
01:40:20,970 --> 01:40:22,980
Was the other thing that
I've been criticized for,

2261
01:40:23,130 --> 01:40:24,720
which is not what I'm saying.

2262
01:40:25,080 --> 01:40:25,561
In fact,

2263
01:40:25,561 --> 01:40:26,394
I'm not saying that.

2264
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:27,030
No,

2265
01:40:27,030 --> 01:40:28,800
I'm not even saying that a little bit.

2266
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:31,500
It's exactly the opposite
of what I'm saying.

2267
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:32,221
Say,

2268
01:40:32,221 --> 01:40:32,511
well,

2269
01:40:32,511 --> 01:40:34,500
what if you stand up straight
with your shoulders back?

2270
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:36,570
Isn't that a powerful stance?

2271
01:40:37,080 --> 01:40:37,950
And the answer is,

2272
01:40:38,550 --> 01:40:38,791
well,

2273
01:40:38,791 --> 01:40:39,810
actually no.

2274
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,600
A powerful stance is this,

2275
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:43,643
right?

2276
01:40:43,830 --> 01:40:43,981
Well,

2277
01:40:43,981 --> 01:40:45,630
not really because I'm
not very good at it,

2278
01:40:45,631 --> 01:40:48,600
but if I knew what I was doing,

2279
01:40:48,601 --> 01:40:53,170
this would be it and I put myself sideways
so I'm not much of a target and I'm

2280
01:40:53,171 --> 01:40:54,130
ready for attack.

2281
01:40:54,610 --> 01:40:54,941
Okay,

2282
01:40:54,941 --> 01:40:56,410
that's not this dance.

2283
01:40:57,250 --> 01:40:58,510
This dance is different.

2284
01:40:58,840 --> 01:40:59,470
Right,

2285
01:40:59,470 --> 01:41:01,330
and that that isn't this dance either.

2286
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,610
This is a defensive crouch.

2287
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:06,250
This is what happens if
you're depressed and anxious,

2288
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:06,851
right?

2289
01:41:06,851 --> 01:41:07,900
This dance is,

2290
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:11,830
I'm willing to take what
the world throws at me.

2291
01:41:12,670 --> 01:41:13,001
Right in.

2292
01:41:13,001 --> 01:41:17,200
That might be the trials and tribulations
that are associated with the hierarchy

2293
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,420
because that's a tough
battle in and of itself,

2294
01:41:19,690 --> 01:41:23,500
but it also might be all the terrible
unknown things that are going to come your

2295
01:41:23,501 --> 01:41:24,250
way.

2296
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:29,050
What's the right attitude is stand the
hell up with some courage and take it

2297
01:41:29,800 --> 01:41:32,710
right voluntarily with courage,

2298
01:41:32,830 --> 01:41:36,100
so it's actually a stance
of maximal vulnerability,

2299
01:41:37,030 --> 01:41:39,640
vulnerability adopted voluntarily.

2300
01:41:40,750 --> 01:41:42,370
That's what the crucifix represents.

2301
01:41:42,790 --> 01:41:43,623
Just so you know,

2302
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:48,520
it represents the willingness to take on
the suffering of the world voluntarily,

2303
01:41:48,670 --> 01:41:49,900
the whole thing,

2304
01:41:50,830 --> 01:41:53,890
and that's associated with whatever
at the top of the hierarchy.

2305
01:41:53,890 --> 01:41:58,890
So the idea is the best possible strategy
that you have to be successful across

2306
01:42:00,281 --> 01:42:04,720
the set of all possible hierarchies is
to maximally accept the fact that your

2307
01:42:04,721 --> 01:42:05,200
vote,

2308
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:08,980
that you're vulnerable to accept
that as the price of being,

2309
01:42:09,970 --> 01:42:11,320
and that's the essential message.

2310
01:42:11,490 --> 01:42:15,310
It's not only the message of Christianity
by the way you see this sort of idea

2311
01:42:15,311 --> 01:42:20,311
expressed in all sorts of
religious structures in the
daoists to return to them

2312
01:42:21,610 --> 01:42:21,851
say,

2313
01:42:21,851 --> 01:42:22,031
well,

2314
01:42:22,031 --> 01:42:23,920
where should you be in the world?

2315
01:42:24,070 --> 01:42:27,730
The world is made out of the catastrophe
of chaos and the tyranny of order.

2316
01:42:28,270 --> 01:42:29,950
Where do you stand in that place?

2317
01:42:29,951 --> 01:42:34,330
And the answer is with one foot
in chaos and one foot in order.

2318
01:42:35,110 --> 01:42:36,580
That's the line down the middle.

2319
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:37,810
That's the Tao.

2320
01:42:37,900 --> 01:42:38,770
That's the way,

2321
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:40,390
that's the point of meaning.

2322
01:42:40,570 --> 01:42:43,270
It's the same place that's
at the center of a cathedral.

2323
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:44,590
It's the same idea.

2324
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:50,250
You stand there because you're secure
because you have tradition and the power

2325
01:42:51,461 --> 01:42:56,380
of your civilization behind you and you
have one foot in chaos because that's

2326
01:42:56,381 --> 01:42:57,850
not enough and never will be,

2327
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:03,700
and the instinct that puts you there is
the instinct of meaning and you can use

2328
01:43:03,701 --> 01:43:07,210
that as a guide and it's a
deep neurological instinct.

2329
01:43:07,570 --> 01:43:09,400
It's not some EPA phenomena.

2330
01:43:10,240 --> 01:43:14,740
It's the most real thing there is as far
as I can tell and associated with that

2331
01:43:14,741 --> 01:43:16,360
as a certain attitude towards life,

2332
01:43:16,361 --> 01:43:20,890
which is to venture courageously
out into the unknown,

2333
01:43:21,040 --> 01:43:23,110
is to put yourself on the line,

2334
01:43:23,140 --> 01:43:23,710
right,

2335
01:43:23,710 --> 01:43:25,600
to heed the call of adventure,

2336
01:43:25,900 --> 01:43:29,050
to risk yourself voluntarily.

2337
01:43:29,530 --> 01:43:30,940
You have no choice anyways,

2338
01:43:32,350 --> 01:43:32,621
right?

2339
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:34,840
Because you're in this all the way.

2340
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:37,360
There's no out that isn't death.

2341
01:43:38,800 --> 01:43:40,690
The full catastrophe is at your feet.

2342
01:43:41,800 --> 01:43:43,870
You can't evade or escape that,

2343
01:43:44,410 --> 01:43:48,460
but what you can do is choose how it
is that you're going to confront it,

2344
01:43:49,300 --> 01:43:53,090
and so rule one is to stand up straight
with your shoulders back and to

2345
01:43:53,091 --> 01:43:53,781
manifest,

2346
01:43:53,781 --> 01:43:56,630
and this is the thing that's
so amazing about this,

2347
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:57,400
I think,

2348
01:43:57,400 --> 01:44:02,400
and that what lands are kind of ultimate
reality to the idea of positioning

2349
01:44:03,561 --> 01:44:04,520
yourself properly.

2350
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:05,953
You might say,

2351
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:07,963
well,

2352
01:44:08,390 --> 01:44:13,390
let's presume that you're
a very pessimistic person
or a very realistic person,

2353
01:44:16,340 --> 01:44:17,173
and you say,

2354
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:17,601
well,

2355
01:44:17,601 --> 01:44:19,610
what's the fundamental reality of life?

2356
01:44:19,640 --> 01:44:19,941
You say,

2357
01:44:19,941 --> 01:44:20,121
well,

2358
01:44:20,121 --> 01:44:21,650
it's suffering and malevolence.

2359
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:23,631
It's like,

2360
01:44:23,631 --> 01:44:24,464
okay,

2361
01:44:24,740 --> 01:44:28,220
it's a hard argument to forestall,

2362
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:32,240
but I don't think it's true.

2363
01:44:32,780 --> 01:44:33,351
It's true,

2364
01:44:33,351 --> 01:44:34,130
but it's not.

2365
01:44:34,130 --> 01:44:35,540
It's not the final truth.

2366
01:44:36,260 --> 01:44:37,340
The final truth is,

2367
01:44:37,520 --> 01:44:39,890
despite the fact that that's true,

2368
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:45,640
the ability of the human spirit to prevail
is more powerful than death and evil.

2369
01:44:50,260 --> 01:44:51,220
That's the truth,

2370
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,650
and you know that you know that,

2371
01:44:53,651 --> 01:44:54,430
first of all,

2372
01:44:54,430 --> 01:44:58,030
you know that because you're ashamed
that you're not everything you could be.

2373
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:03,940
You know that because the people that you
admire are people who manifest courage

2374
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:08,200
in the diarist of straights and you
know that as well because when you meet

2375
01:45:08,201 --> 01:45:10,660
people like that and you're not like that,

2376
01:45:10,930 --> 01:45:12,040
they shame you.

2377
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:15,310
That speaks to your
deepest possible instinct.

2378
01:45:15,311 --> 01:45:19,780
You know what you could be and you know
too that you see people contend with

2379
01:45:19,781 --> 01:45:24,310
situations that are so difficult that
it's truly a miracle that they can contend

2380
01:45:24,311 --> 01:45:25,144
with them.

2381
01:45:25,300 --> 01:45:25,511
You know,

2382
01:45:25,511 --> 01:45:26,500
when I think of people,

2383
01:45:26,650 --> 01:45:26,771
well,

2384
01:45:26,771 --> 01:45:28,600
I think the people who
work in funeral homes,

2385
01:45:28,601 --> 01:45:29,680
that's a good example.

2386
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:30,760
That's hard,

2387
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:32,260
right?

2388
01:45:32,260 --> 01:45:37,030
That's death and grief every day and
it's not something that you can avoid.

2389
01:45:37,540 --> 01:45:38,650
It's like it's right there.

2390
01:45:38,651 --> 01:45:40,210
It's as real as it can possibly be.

2391
01:45:40,480 --> 01:45:41,830
I'll tell you a story about that.

2392
01:45:42,820 --> 01:45:47,820
Had a client who was very afraid of being
alive and she wanted to sleep all the

2393
01:45:50,531 --> 01:45:54,190
time and she took sleeping pills and all
sorts of other things so that she could

2394
01:45:54,340 --> 01:45:59,340
evade the burden of being conscious and
she was a very good dreamer and she.

2395
01:46:01,120 --> 01:46:04,180
She wasn't doing well in university
and she had a dream one night that

2396
01:46:06,130 --> 01:46:10,120
Gypsy told her that she was actually
lucid during her dreams by the way,

2397
01:46:10,121 --> 01:46:14,140
and she could ask her dream characters
what they meant and they would tell her,

2398
01:46:14,290 --> 01:46:16,990
which was something I'd never
seen anyone else manage.

2399
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:18,243
In any case,

2400
01:46:18,280 --> 01:46:22,060
she jumped up this gypsy that she met in
the forest and the Gypsy told her that

2401
01:46:22,061 --> 01:46:22,990
unless she learned to,

2402
01:46:23,650 --> 01:46:25,540
unless she could learn to
work in a slaughter house,

2403
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:29,440
she never finished her degree
and so she told me that story.

2404
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:30,790
I don't know if you know this,

2405
01:46:30,791 --> 01:46:35,590
but the classic treatment for people who
are afraid of things is to expose them

2406
01:46:35,591 --> 01:46:37,000
to what they're afraid of.

2407
01:46:37,480 --> 01:46:41,320
Which is a good lesson if you have
children because you want to expose your

2408
01:46:41,321 --> 01:46:43,840
children to challenges because
that makes them stronger.

2409
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:45,460
It has to be done voluntarily,

2410
01:46:45,461 --> 01:46:48,220
but if you have posttraumatic
stress disorder,

2411
01:46:48,221 --> 01:46:53,221
let's say you're the of a vicious sexual
assault by a stranger and two years

2412
01:46:53,431 --> 01:46:55,320
later you have posttraumatic
stress disorder.

2413
01:46:56,100 --> 01:47:00,120
The most effective treatment is to get
you to relive the experience in as much

2414
01:47:00,121 --> 01:47:04,140
vivid detail as you possibly can and
experience all the emotions that occurred

2415
01:47:04,141 --> 01:47:06,200
while it was happening and if the.

2416
01:47:06,470 --> 01:47:07,470
If you do that,

2417
01:47:07,471 --> 01:47:09,630
the more upset you get when you do that,

2418
01:47:09,631 --> 01:47:10,680
if you do it voluntarily,

2419
01:47:10,681 --> 01:47:13,380
the faster you get better and
the longer you stay better,

2420
01:47:14,160 --> 01:47:17,970
and so it's a general rule of thumb in
psychotherapy is if someone's avoiding

2421
01:47:17,971 --> 01:47:18,570
something,

2422
01:47:18,570 --> 01:47:20,040
find out what they're avoiding,

2423
01:47:20,760 --> 01:47:25,200
break it into manageable pieces and have
them voluntarily expose themselves to

2424
01:47:25,201 --> 01:47:27,300
it and they will be cured.

2425
01:47:27,600 --> 01:47:29,110
And that's the dragon fight in,

2426
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:30,570
in clinical practice,

2427
01:47:30,870 --> 01:47:35,670
find what you most want to what you most
need will be found where you least want

2428
01:47:35,671 --> 01:47:37,320
to look right.

2429
01:47:37,350 --> 01:47:38,640
That's a hell of a statement.

2430
01:47:40,170 --> 01:47:43,350
So she told me this dream and I thought,

2431
01:47:43,440 --> 01:47:43,651
well,

2432
01:47:43,651 --> 01:47:48,240
I don't know how to arrange for
you to work in a slaughter house.

2433
01:47:48,241 --> 01:47:49,710
That doesn't seem like very.

2434
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:51,420
She wouldn't eat meat by the way.

2435
01:47:51,421 --> 01:47:52,980
She wouldn't go into a butcher store.

2436
01:47:53,130 --> 01:47:57,480
I took her into a butcher store once and
she had a very catastrophic reaction.

2437
01:47:57,481 --> 01:47:59,550
She couldn't handle it anyways.

2438
01:48:01,110 --> 01:48:01,531
I said,

2439
01:48:01,531 --> 01:48:01,820
well,

2440
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,540
we can arrange the slaughterhouse thing.

2441
01:48:03,541 --> 01:48:07,590
Why don't you go away and for a while and
come back in a week and see if you can

2442
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:09,060
come up with an alternative.

2443
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,141
So,

2444
01:48:10,141 --> 01:48:10,710
uh,

2445
01:48:10,710 --> 01:48:12,090
she came back and she said,

2446
01:48:12,360 --> 01:48:13,710
I want to see an embalming.

2447
01:48:14,910 --> 01:48:15,451
And I thought,

2448
01:48:15,451 --> 01:48:16,284
Oh God,

2449
01:48:16,680 --> 01:48:17,250
okay,

2450
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:18,990
how the hell am I going to arrange that?

2451
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:21,570
So I phoned a couple of
funeral homes and I said,

2452
01:48:21,571 --> 01:48:21,781
look,

2453
01:48:21,781 --> 01:48:26,781
I've got this person who's really afraid
of death and she had this dream and I

2454
01:48:27,601 --> 01:48:28,890
told them the story and they said,

2455
01:48:28,980 --> 01:48:29,813
no problem,

2456
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:31,133
bring her in.

2457
01:48:31,270 --> 01:48:34,770
And so I wasn't looking
forward to this by the way.

2458
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:36,030
Um,

2459
01:48:36,030 --> 01:48:38,430
so we went and she was very,

2460
01:48:38,431 --> 01:48:41,580
very nervous because she certainly
didn't think she could handle that.

2461
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,830
And as I said already,

2462
01:48:43,831 --> 01:48:45,510
I wasn't exactly thrilled about it either,

2463
01:48:45,511 --> 01:48:46,111
but in,

2464
01:48:46,111 --> 01:48:47,130
for a pound in,

2465
01:48:47,131 --> 01:48:47,791
for a penny in,

2466
01:48:47,791 --> 01:48:48,900
for a pound as they say.

2467
01:48:49,170 --> 01:48:49,711
So anyways,

2468
01:48:49,711 --> 01:48:54,000
we went to the funeral parlor and they
showed us around and we asked a bunch of

2469
01:48:54,001 --> 01:48:54,691
questions like,

2470
01:48:54,691 --> 01:48:56,730
how the hell did they
cope with their jobs?

2471
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:58,320
Because that's just a mystery to me.

2472
01:48:58,321 --> 01:48:59,101
And they said,

2473
01:48:59,101 --> 01:48:59,281
well,

2474
01:48:59,281 --> 01:49:02,460
it was actually really useful for them
to guide people through the process of

2475
01:49:02,461 --> 01:49:06,150
grief and that their experience was
that that had given them a renewed

2476
01:49:06,151 --> 01:49:07,440
appreciation for life,

2477
01:49:07,441 --> 01:49:08,940
which is well

2478
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:13,590
that would account for why they were able
to do it because it seems like a very

2479
01:49:13,591 --> 01:49:14,250
hard job.

2480
01:49:14,250 --> 01:49:19,250
And so we went into this room and watch
this embalming and I was about eight

2481
01:49:20,851 --> 01:49:22,130
feet away from this small room.

2482
01:49:22,131 --> 01:49:24,570
It's a pretty gruesome
operation as you might imagine.

2483
01:49:24,900 --> 01:49:25,733
And uh,

2484
01:49:25,800 --> 01:49:29,110
my client was sitting beside me and
I was watching her and watching the

2485
01:49:29,111 --> 01:49:30,000
embalming as well.

2486
01:49:30,270 --> 01:49:33,150
And for the first while she
was just looking to the side,

2487
01:49:34,020 --> 01:49:34,590
which was,

2488
01:49:34,590 --> 01:49:39,590
I'm not here and I certainly can't handle
that and no bloody wonder literally.

2489
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:40,771
And so.

2490
01:49:40,771 --> 01:49:42,720
But then she would take the odd glance,

2491
01:49:42,721 --> 01:49:45,420
say she'd go like this and then look away.

2492
01:49:45,630 --> 01:49:47,770
And then as the minutes by,

2493
01:49:47,771 --> 01:49:48,970
but fairly rapidly,

2494
01:49:49,240 --> 01:49:53,440
she was spending more time watching and
less time looking away until she was

2495
01:49:53,441 --> 01:49:54,910
finally doing nothing but watching.

2496
01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:59,050
And then at some point she asked if she
could come in and put her hand on the

2497
01:49:59,051 --> 01:49:59,500
body,

2498
01:49:59,500 --> 01:50:03,280
and so they gave her a glove and she did
that and then she went and sat down and

2499
01:50:03,370 --> 01:50:07,660
she was quite quiet about all this
and quite quiet afterwards as well.

2500
01:50:07,720 --> 01:50:09,820
So what did she discover?

2501
01:50:10,730 --> 01:50:10,870
Well,

2502
01:50:10,870 --> 01:50:12,580
she didn't discover the death was,

2503
01:50:12,760 --> 01:50:13,660
wasn't horrible.

2504
01:50:14,770 --> 01:50:18,910
She didn't discover that and she didn't
discover the death wasn't terrifying

2505
01:50:19,510 --> 01:50:20,770
because it certainly was.

2506
01:50:21,310 --> 01:50:24,160
But what she did discover was that she
was a hell of a lot tougher than she

2507
01:50:24,161 --> 01:50:24,994
thought,

2508
01:50:25,180 --> 01:50:25,540
and,

2509
01:50:25,540 --> 01:50:28,330
and much quicker than
she would have believed.

2510
01:50:28,570 --> 01:50:30,550
And she went away thinking,

2511
01:50:31,120 --> 01:50:31,953
Huh,

2512
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:34,083
look at that.

2513
01:50:34,630 --> 01:50:37,600
I did the thing I was
most afraid of doing.

2514
01:50:37,601 --> 01:50:38,800
And here I am.

2515
01:50:39,790 --> 01:50:43,030
Not only am I not more damaged than I was,

2516
01:50:43,270 --> 01:50:44,980
I'm actually better than I was.

2517
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:48,700
And so from then on she
had a reference point.

2518
01:50:48,701 --> 01:50:49,360
Right?

2519
01:50:49,360 --> 01:50:50,500
Which is an interesting thing.

2520
01:50:50,501 --> 01:50:54,280
I think this is why primordial
people initiate their,

2521
01:50:54,310 --> 01:50:55,450
especially their young men,

2522
01:50:55,451 --> 01:50:57,520
because it sort of happens
automatically with young women.

2523
01:50:57,910 --> 01:51:00,520
They expose their young men to
something absolutely terrifying,

2524
01:51:00,850 --> 01:51:02,650
genuinely terrifying.

2525
01:51:02,820 --> 01:51:04,090
So for the rest of their lives,

2526
01:51:04,091 --> 01:51:08,140
they know the difference between what's
actually terrifying and what's just sort

2527
01:51:08,141 --> 01:51:11,320
of normal catastrophe because
you really need to know that,

2528
01:51:11,380 --> 01:51:11,860
right?

2529
01:51:11,860 --> 01:51:15,220
Because you need to know that you can
prevail and one of the things she learned

2530
01:51:15,221 --> 01:51:20,221
as a consequence of that exposure was
that she could prevail despite the

2531
01:51:21,011 --> 01:51:22,150
realities of life.

2532
01:51:22,410 --> 01:51:22,811
Of course,

2533
01:51:22,811 --> 01:51:25,990
that's what you want to teach
your children mostly by example,

2534
01:51:26,590 --> 01:51:30,340
is that they can prevail
despite the realities of life.

2535
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:30,941
Of course,

2536
01:51:30,941 --> 01:51:34,450
that also means that you have to have
admitted to what the realities of life

2537
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:34,990
are.

2538
01:51:34,990 --> 01:51:36,910
But the thing that's so
interesting about that.

2539
01:51:37,390 --> 01:51:38,650
Here's another story.

2540
01:51:39,040 --> 01:51:42,250
So you know the story of King
Arthur and the holy grail.

2541
01:51:44,510 --> 01:51:48,530
The holy grail is the ultimate value that
it's a symbol of whatever the ultimate

2542
01:51:48,531 --> 01:51:49,364
value is.

2543
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:53,150
And King Arthur assembles is nights
around the round table and it's a round

2544
01:51:53,151 --> 01:51:55,460
table because they're all equal.

2545
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,470
Despite the fact that they have a king,

2546
01:51:57,920 --> 01:52:01,670
they sit as equals at the round table and
they all decided to go off to seek for

2547
01:52:01,671 --> 01:52:02,504
the holy grail.

2548
01:52:03,650 --> 01:52:06,920
It's either the cup that Christ
drank out of at the last supper,

2549
01:52:06,921 --> 01:52:08,750
the cup that held his blood on the cross.

2550
01:52:08,780 --> 01:52:09,860
It's one of those two things.

2551
01:52:10,060 --> 01:52:10,881
It doesn't really matter.

2552
01:52:10,881 --> 01:52:13,550
It's a symbol of what's redemptive.

2553
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:14,870
That's what the holy grail is,

2554
01:52:15,380 --> 01:52:17,630
so it's a representation
of the ultimate value.

2555
01:52:18,350 --> 01:52:23,350
The question is where do you go to seek
out what's of ultimate value and answer

2556
01:52:23,351 --> 01:52:23,780
in,

2557
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:28,280
in the tail of of King Arthur and the
holy grail is that each night entered the

2558
01:52:28,281 --> 01:52:32,900
forest when they began their search at
the place that looks darkest to them.

2559
01:52:35,080 --> 01:52:40,080
So that's the thing is that it's necessary
if you're going to stand up straight

2560
01:52:40,421 --> 01:52:45,410
with your shoulders back to
confront the darkness of the world,

2561
01:52:45,411 --> 01:52:46,244
head on,

2562
01:52:46,730 --> 01:52:51,730
to take responsibility for the tragedy
of existence and for for malevolence.

2563
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:53,210
That's what it means.

2564
01:52:53,540 --> 01:52:57,140
That's the what the Christian injunction
to take the sins of the world onto

2565
01:52:57,141 --> 01:53:00,230
yourself means it means
it's your bloody problem,

2566
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:03,410
and to confront Satan in
the desert is the same idea,

2567
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:07,640
is that not only do you have to take on
the tragedy of the world as if it's your

2568
01:53:07,641 --> 01:53:08,570
responsibility,

2569
01:53:08,990 --> 01:53:12,710
but you have to contend with the spirit
of malevolence while you're doing so,

2570
01:53:13,100 --> 01:53:14,030
and it's in doing that,

2571
01:53:14,031 --> 01:53:15,290
that you find your destiny.

2572
01:53:15,470 --> 01:53:20,470
That's where you find the highest of
possible values and that's the call and

2573
01:53:20,610 --> 01:53:23,330
that's the call to the nobility
of being because you might think,

2574
01:53:23,331 --> 01:53:23,780
well,

2575
01:53:23,780 --> 01:53:27,050
what could possibly justify
your life more thoroughly?

2576
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:31,670
What could make you the best player
of all possible games than to take the

2577
01:53:32,240 --> 01:53:37,240
tragedy of the world onto your shoulders
and to fight with all your ability

2578
01:53:40,280 --> 01:53:43,040
against the malevolence in your own heart.

2579
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:45,953
Thank you.

2580
01:53:56,420 --> 01:53:58,160
The first one I'll choose here.

2581
01:53:58,400 --> 01:54:00,410
Thank you for coming to speak with us.

2582
01:54:00,470 --> 01:54:01,820
What do you think of Iceland?

2583
01:54:10,120 --> 01:54:10,953
Well,

2584
01:54:11,410 --> 01:54:12,243
first of all,

2585
01:54:12,580 --> 01:54:13,810
thank you all for coming.

2586
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:18,970
It's quite remarkable to see so many
people come out for such a serious

2587
01:54:18,971 --> 01:54:19,870
conversation.

2588
01:54:19,990 --> 01:54:22,030
It isn't exactly what you'd expect.

2589
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:23,613
So,

2590
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:24,503
um,

2591
01:54:24,850 --> 01:54:28,720
everyone has been ridiculously
hospitable to me and my family.

2592
01:54:29,400 --> 01:54:30,233
Um,

2593
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:32,080
we've seen some beautiful things.

2594
01:54:32,081 --> 01:54:33,160
We were at the blue lagoon,

2595
01:54:33,161 --> 01:54:34,360
which was very impressive.

2596
01:54:34,660 --> 01:54:39,660
We went to the house today where Gorbachev
and Reagan met in 1996 and that was

2597
01:54:40,600 --> 01:54:41,440
very interesting.

2598
01:54:41,441 --> 01:54:45,400
I went and saw some rare manuscripts
at the university this morning,

2599
01:54:45,910 --> 01:54:50,910
a lager and his crew of people have been
very organized and you have a beautiful

2600
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:58,510
little capital city that's extraordinarily
impressive and you've produced this

2601
01:54:58,511 --> 01:55:03,511
amazing venue and your country is
cruising along on all cylinders and it's a

2602
01:55:05,471 --> 01:55:06,460
hell of an achievement.

2603
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:08,320
So that's what I think.

2604
01:55:08,340 --> 01:55:08,500
I,

2605
01:55:08,500 --> 01:55:11,470
I think that almost all the time
when I come to a European country,

2606
01:55:13,930 --> 01:55:15,490
it's amazing how well it works.

2607
01:55:15,491 --> 01:55:15,731
I mean,

2608
01:55:15,731 --> 01:55:16,720
it's a harsh place,

2609
01:55:16,721 --> 01:55:17,230
you know,

2610
01:55:17,230 --> 01:55:18,063
it's,

2611
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:22,870
you made a lot of what you have and it
looks to me like it's just getting better

2612
01:55:23,410 --> 01:55:28,410
and so it's peaceful and productive and
civilized and beautiful and hospitable

2613
01:55:29,740 --> 01:55:30,573
and

2614
01:55:32,440 --> 01:55:33,273
good for you.

2615
01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:35,560
And thank you for inviting me.

2616
01:55:38,830 --> 01:55:40,900
I'm this one.

2617
01:55:41,500 --> 01:55:46,500
The next one is regarding
the headpieces on you.

2618
01:55:48,080 --> 01:55:48,750
Um,

2619
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:50,550
when such an article is written,

2620
01:55:51,630 --> 01:55:56,630
what is your interpretation of the costs
or further potential explanations are

2621
01:55:59,281 --> 01:56:00,750
there for this phenomenon?

2622
01:56:02,400 --> 01:56:02,731
Well,

2623
01:56:02,731 --> 01:56:03,564
I think there's,

2624
01:56:04,290 --> 01:56:05,123
you know,

2625
01:56:05,220 --> 01:56:07,680
we could start with what I
might be contributing to it

2626
01:56:15,830 --> 01:56:16,020
now.

2627
01:56:16,020 --> 01:56:17,250
One thing I've had to learn,

2628
01:56:17,251 --> 01:56:22,080
I've had some interactions with
public exposure for probably

2629
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:29,900
15 years because I worked a little bit
with a public television station in

2630
01:56:30,450 --> 01:56:32,310
Ontario before all this blew up.

2631
01:56:36,910 --> 01:56:40,480
My producer who was someone
who was very much on my side.

2632
01:56:40,481 --> 01:56:45,481
So I worked for a public affairs show
first of all as irregular panelist and

2633
01:56:46,391 --> 01:56:48,460
then as a columnist for a couple of years.

2634
01:56:51,100 --> 01:56:52,090
My producer,

2635
01:56:52,180 --> 01:56:53,380
who is the level headed guy

2636
01:56:55,030 --> 01:56:58,390
well versed in what worked
well in panel discussions,

2637
01:56:59,610 --> 01:57:04,610
told me to be very careful
about controlling my proclivity
towards anger because

2638
01:57:07,211 --> 01:57:08,980
it doesn't play very well publicly.

2639
01:57:10,180 --> 01:57:11,013
And so

2640
01:57:12,810 --> 01:57:13,090
no,

2641
01:57:13,090 --> 01:57:16,510
I kept trying to learn the doctrine
of minimal necessary force.

2642
01:57:16,540 --> 01:57:17,373
I mean,

2643
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:20,890
I think that aggression is a
good thing if it's controlled.

2644
01:57:21,580 --> 01:57:23,530
I think it's a good antidote to fear.

2645
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:27,160
I think it's one of the things that can
help you maintain your ground in the

2646
01:57:27,161 --> 01:57:28,450
face of resistance,

2647
01:57:28,930 --> 01:57:31,270
but it has to be applied very,

2648
01:57:31,271 --> 01:57:36,271
very judiciously and it isn't obvious
that I always do that as well as I might

2649
01:57:37,690 --> 01:57:37,900
end.

2650
01:57:37,900 --> 01:57:42,760
If you're going to deal with difficult
and dangerous and contentious issues,

2651
01:57:42,790 --> 01:57:45,850
then you're going to get
punished for your failures.

2652
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:49,360
And so I'm trying to learn too

2653
01:57:51,550 --> 01:57:53,710
detach myself and to not,

2654
01:57:53,711 --> 01:57:54,544
not in a,

2655
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,510
not in an I don't care way,

2656
01:57:57,060 --> 01:57:57,480
no,

2657
01:57:57,480 --> 01:58:02,480
but in a watchful way and to keep all of
that under control as much as possible

2658
01:58:02,921 --> 01:58:07,900
and to use minimal necessary force and
it's hard to learn to do that well.

2659
01:58:08,530 --> 01:58:11,110
And so to the degree that I don't do that,

2660
01:58:11,470 --> 01:58:16,000
then I instigate more
opposition than I might.

2661
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:22,230
Now I have a hard time with that to some
degree because I do find some of what I

2662
01:58:22,391 --> 01:58:23,224
have been,

2663
01:58:23,920 --> 01:58:25,270
let's say opposing,

2664
01:58:26,960 --> 01:58:27,793
um,

2665
01:58:31,660 --> 01:58:32,500
what would you say

2666
01:58:34,320 --> 01:58:35,153
it,

2667
01:58:35,170 --> 01:58:36,550
it makes me deeply,

2668
01:58:37,120 --> 01:58:40,210
it disturbs me deeply and
makes me unhappy and ashamed.

2669
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:45,160
That's particularly the case when I see
what's happening at the universities.

2670
01:58:46,330 --> 01:58:51,070
I'm not impressed by what's happening in
the social sciences and the humanities.

2671
01:58:51,370 --> 01:58:53,380
I'm not impressed with the postmodernists.

2672
01:58:54,220 --> 01:58:57,850
I'm not impressed with the Marxists and
I'm certainly not impressed with the

2673
01:58:57,851 --> 01:59:02,851
people or the theories that juxtapose
the two in this particularly ideological

2674
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:10,440
brew that's been fermenting say since
the 19 sixties and so it's not easy to

2675
01:59:11,291 --> 01:59:13,450
maintain equanimity in the face of that,

2676
01:59:13,451 --> 01:59:16,830
but it doesn't matter because
it's still necessary to.

2677
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:21,840
Do you think their ideology has permeated
all of media or because not all of it?

2678
01:59:24,730 --> 01:59:25,210
Yeah,

2679
01:59:25,210 --> 01:59:27,250
I mean that's the other thing is that,

2680
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:29,020
and this is why dealing now,

2681
01:59:29,680 --> 01:59:32,050
now we can turn to what the
media might bring to this.

2682
01:59:32,051 --> 01:59:32,770
Well,

2683
01:59:32,770 --> 01:59:33,603
ideological,

2684
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:35,770
ideological pre commitments.

2685
01:59:35,770 --> 01:59:40,770
That's certainly the case and
inability to see anything other than in

2686
01:59:41,201 --> 01:59:42,400
politicized terms.

2687
01:59:42,401 --> 01:59:46,150
Like I don't view that what I'm
doing as fundamentally political.

2688
01:59:46,620 --> 01:59:46,980
Actually.

2689
01:59:46,980 --> 01:59:51,980
In fact I don't view the battle that's
raging in the idiation substructure of

2690
01:59:52,331 --> 01:59:54,100
our society is fundamentally political.

2691
01:59:54,101 --> 01:59:55,600
I think it's deeper than political.

2692
01:59:55,601 --> 01:59:59,740
It's at least philosophical
and it's probably theological,

2693
02:00:00,160 --> 02:00:04,360
but the but the people
who've been pillaring me,

2694
02:00:04,361 --> 02:00:07,480
let's say who tend to be the
postmodern neo marxists types,

2695
02:00:07,481 --> 02:00:11,920
or at least leading in that direction
cannot conceptualize anything that isn't

2696
02:00:12,040 --> 02:00:14,110
political in their world.

2697
02:00:14,111 --> 02:00:15,850
There isn't anything that isn't political.

2698
02:00:16,030 --> 02:00:18,370
One of the things that you might consider,

2699
02:00:18,371 --> 02:00:19,001
for example,

2700
02:00:19,001 --> 02:00:20,320
is you know,

2701
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:26,580
I've been perhaps represented as
an as an advocate of free speech,

2702
02:00:28,931 --> 02:00:33,931
and of course there's a lot of debate
about what free speech really is from the

2703
02:00:34,991 --> 02:00:39,991
radical leftist types and here's something
that you have to understand from the

2704
02:00:40,570 --> 02:00:43,810
collectivist perspective that
dominates the radical left.

2705
02:00:44,110 --> 02:00:47,350
There is no such thing as free speech.

2706
02:00:48,130 --> 02:00:49,720
It's not that they oppose it,

2707
02:00:50,510 --> 02:00:53,290
it's that it isn't a move in their game.

2708
02:00:53,590 --> 02:00:54,880
It doesn't exist.

2709
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:56,860
So if you stand up and say,

2710
02:00:57,730 --> 02:01:00,820
I'm manifesting my
opinion as an individual,

2711
02:01:01,510 --> 02:01:06,510
then that's not a acceptable move
because you aren't an individual.

2712
02:01:08,890 --> 02:01:13,890
You're an Avatar of your dominant
group and whatever you otter,

2713
02:01:15,010 --> 02:01:19,180
regardless of why you think you're
honoring it or regardless of whether you

2714
02:01:19,181 --> 02:01:24,181
think it's your individual opinion is
nothing but a power move in your dominance

2715
02:01:25,271 --> 02:01:28,600
hierarchy and so it's not
like they oppose free speech.

2716
02:01:28,601 --> 02:01:33,370
It's that it doesn't exist in their
conceptual framework and so that's one of

2717
02:01:33,371 --> 02:01:38,371
the things that drives and they hit
pieces because I do believe in the

2718
02:01:38,960 --> 02:01:39,793
individual

2719
02:01:40,400 --> 02:01:44,330
and I do believe in free speech and
I do believe in a world outside the

2720
02:01:44,331 --> 02:01:45,530
conceptual realm,

2721
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:50,740
all sorts of propositions that aren't
part and parcel of the postmodernist slash

2722
02:01:51,471 --> 02:01:55,610
neo Marxist game and they're
not very happy with that.

2723
02:01:56,370 --> 02:02:01,370
I'm not playing by the rules and so
they don't know what to do about that.

2724
02:02:02,030 --> 02:02:05,150
The simplest thing to do
is to call me far right,

2725
02:02:05,151 --> 02:02:08,120
are all right because then they can.

2726
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:08,990
First of all,

2727
02:02:08,990 --> 02:02:11,390
that's an evil category and
that dispenses with that,

2728
02:02:11,391 --> 02:02:15,140
but it also means they don't
have to contend with any
of my arguments and that's

2729
02:02:15,141 --> 02:02:15,974
convenient,

2730
02:02:16,160 --> 02:02:21,160
so it's easier to demonize
than it is to contend.

2731
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:27,470
So it doesn't seem to help them
because the more they scream,

2732
02:02:27,590 --> 02:02:31,370
the more people that actually listen
to you hear that are not far right.

2733
02:02:31,720 --> 02:02:32,750
You're not all thrive.

2734
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:34,400
And they stopped believing them.

2735
02:02:35,150 --> 02:02:35,600
Well,

2736
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:36,530
that's the other thing.

2737
02:02:36,740 --> 02:02:40,050
I've talked with my wife about
this because it's been in been.

2738
02:02:40,070 --> 02:02:44,810
It's produced a lot of tension in our
family because it's very stressful.

2739
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:45,620
I mean,

2740
02:02:45,620 --> 02:02:46,580
for all sorts of reasons,

2741
02:02:46,581 --> 02:02:47,660
but that's certainly one of them,

2742
02:02:48,160 --> 02:02:48,440
you know,

2743
02:02:48,440 --> 02:02:48,771
I mean,

2744
02:02:48,771 --> 02:02:53,771
it's certainly not the case that when I
read a headpiece that I'm very pleased

2745
02:02:54,561 --> 02:02:57,200
about it and I'm often
quite worried about it.

2746
02:02:57,201 --> 02:02:58,970
Like the New York Times piece,

2747
02:02:58,971 --> 02:02:59,521
for example,

2748
02:02:59,521 --> 02:03:01,880
is a good example and it's idiot.

2749
02:03:02,190 --> 02:03:03,023
Um,

2750
02:03:03,230 --> 02:03:04,070
what would you call it?

2751
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:05,173
Um,

2752
02:03:05,240 --> 02:03:08,030
insistence that I was promoting,

2753
02:03:08,540 --> 02:03:09,320
you know,

2754
02:03:09,320 --> 02:03:14,320
monogamy with the weapons of the
state of all the insane ideas.

2755
02:03:14,721 --> 02:03:15,230
I mean,

2756
02:03:15,230 --> 02:03:19,670
who the hell believes that
it's like some isis guys.

2757
02:03:20,000 --> 02:03:20,840
That's about it.

2758
02:03:20,870 --> 02:03:21,310
So,

2759
02:03:21,310 --> 02:03:21,780
so it's an,

2760
02:03:21,780 --> 02:03:26,780
it's a completely absurd accusation
and it certainly bore no resemblance to

2761
02:03:27,051 --> 02:03:28,280
anything that I meant.

2762
02:03:29,090 --> 02:03:29,691
But you know,

2763
02:03:29,691 --> 02:03:34,691
it's a powerful media organization and
lots of people warned me in the immediate

2764
02:03:34,971 --> 02:03:35,860
aftermath of that,

2765
02:03:35,890 --> 02:03:40,400
that it would be my downfall and
including people who were less,

2766
02:03:40,650 --> 02:03:42,320
they weren't fearful people.

2767
02:03:42,321 --> 02:03:43,910
And so it's very stressful.

2768
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:45,830
So one question is,

2769
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:46,011
well,

2770
02:03:46,011 --> 02:03:47,990
should I be doing
interviews like that at all?

2771
02:03:47,991 --> 02:03:52,100
Because one of the things I thought
is no written interviews only live

2772
02:03:52,101 --> 02:03:52,934
interviews,

2773
02:03:53,090 --> 02:03:54,440
only the whole thing.

2774
02:03:54,830 --> 02:03:57,590
So the one today you had is the last one.

2775
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:59,270
Well see,

2776
02:03:59,271 --> 02:04:00,550
I don't know because the,

2777
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:02,990
there's another side of it
which is decide you laid out.

2778
02:04:02,991 --> 02:04:05,930
It's like this happened with the,

2779
02:04:06,290 --> 02:04:09,830
some of you have seen the channel for
interview that I did with Kathy Newman.

2780
02:04:11,620 --> 02:04:16,620
Thank you.

2781
02:04:18,650 --> 02:04:19,640
You know when that was,

2782
02:04:19,790 --> 02:04:24,740
I would say that was a stressful interview
and I would say that the two weeks

2783
02:04:24,741 --> 02:04:27,560
after the interview we're
also very stressful because,

2784
02:04:28,560 --> 02:04:29,393
you know,

2785
02:04:29,420 --> 02:04:32,930
first of all there was the interview
and I thought they just cut it to seven

2786
02:04:32,931 --> 02:04:35,090
minutes and pillory me
and leave it at that.

2787
02:04:36,050 --> 02:04:38,790
But they it to seven
minutes and pilloried me.

2788
02:04:38,791 --> 02:04:40,710
And then they posted the whole interview,

2789
02:04:40,711 --> 02:04:41,850
which just shocked me,

2790
02:04:42,120 --> 02:04:43,770
but here's the shocking thing.

2791
02:04:44,550 --> 02:04:47,940
The people who posted that
interview thought it went well.

2792
02:04:49,830 --> 02:04:51,120
That's why they posted it.

2793
02:04:51,150 --> 02:04:51,721
They didn't think,

2794
02:04:51,721 --> 02:04:52,291
oh my God,

2795
02:04:52,291 --> 02:04:53,160
this is contentious.

2796
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:53,941
We better put it out,

2797
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:54,481
believe me.

2798
02:04:54,481 --> 02:04:56,460
They didn't think that that
is not what they thought.

2799
02:04:56,490 --> 02:04:57,480
They thought it went fine.

2800
02:04:57,870 --> 02:05:01,980
And so then there was this overwhelming
response to it and that was completely

2801
02:05:01,981 --> 02:05:02,814
unexpected.

2802
02:05:03,030 --> 02:05:05,190
And then the counter response was,

2803
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:09,810
Peterson's army of alt right
trolls is victimizing Kathy Newman.

2804
02:05:10,650 --> 02:05:11,780
And that was.

2805
02:05:12,170 --> 02:05:14,430
That was the response of her employers,

2806
02:05:14,460 --> 02:05:15,540
the technical response,

2807
02:05:15,541 --> 02:05:16,540
because that's what they publish.

2808
02:05:16,541 --> 02:05:19,230
They said we had to call the
police to evaluate the threat.

2809
02:05:19,530 --> 02:05:20,363
It's like,

2810
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:21,301
well,

2811
02:05:21,301 --> 02:05:25,170
so what anybody can call in
police to evaluate a threat.

2812
02:05:25,320 --> 02:05:28,950
It doesn't mean that the threat justified
police intervention or that there was

2813
02:05:28,951 --> 02:05:29,784
a threat.

2814
02:05:30,030 --> 02:05:32,100
It just meant that that's
how you responded to it.

2815
02:05:32,190 --> 02:05:34,380
And then they spun the
victim narrative for Kathy,

2816
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:36,960
which was I think reprehensible.

2817
02:05:36,961 --> 02:05:37,770
Given that.

2818
02:05:37,770 --> 02:05:40,350
I don't know what Kathy Newman is exactly,

2819
02:05:40,530 --> 02:05:42,000
but she's not a bloody victim.

2820
02:05:42,270 --> 02:05:43,590
She's not powerless.

2821
02:05:43,680 --> 02:05:47,190
She's one of the most powerful women in
the United Kingdom and she has a salary

2822
02:05:47,191 --> 02:05:48,870
that's commensurate with that and good,

2823
02:05:49,050 --> 02:05:49,621
good for her.

2824
02:05:49,621 --> 02:05:50,730
That's absolutely fine,

2825
02:05:50,880 --> 02:05:53,130
but you don't get to have
that and also be a victim.

2826
02:05:53,580 --> 02:05:55,440
It's not the right way to play the game.

2827
02:05:56,100 --> 02:06:01,100
And so then a whole bunch of newspapers
laid out the story that poor Kathy was

2828
02:06:01,801 --> 02:06:05,220
being trolled by my legion of all right,

2829
02:06:05,340 --> 02:06:06,450
angry people,

2830
02:06:07,050 --> 02:06:09,090
but then the numbers started to mount,

2831
02:06:09,480 --> 02:06:09,731
you know,

2832
02:06:09,731 --> 02:06:12,510
an after it was like 4 million people.

2833
02:06:12,750 --> 02:06:16,530
It got the whole troll argument got hard
to sustain unless you think there are

2834
02:06:16,531 --> 02:06:17,364
like,

2835
02:06:17,460 --> 02:06:21,300
well now it's perhaps 30 million people
have watched either the whole thing or

2836
02:06:21,570 --> 02:06:22,650
major clips from it.

2837
02:06:22,651 --> 02:06:23,610
Maybe it's more than that.

2838
02:06:23,611 --> 02:06:27,510
It's hard to sustain the old troll
argument when it's 30 million people,

2839
02:06:27,990 --> 02:06:28,830
but it was very.

2840
02:06:28,920 --> 02:06:31,990
I thought that narrative was going
to prevail for a while that you know,

2841
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:32,431
oh,

2842
02:06:32,431 --> 02:06:36,330
she got victimized and it was all these
terrible people that went after her.

2843
02:06:36,331 --> 02:06:37,350
But that collapsed.

2844
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:38,820
But it's very stressful.

2845
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:39,893
But,

2846
02:06:41,300 --> 02:06:42,460
and this is something that I've,

2847
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:43,220
I've learned,

2848
02:06:43,220 --> 02:06:47,240
so I've been obsessing about another
statement in the New Testament for about

2849
02:06:47,241 --> 02:06:47,931
two years.

2850
02:06:47,931 --> 02:06:49,010
I've been trying to figure it out,

2851
02:06:49,011 --> 02:06:49,440
and it's,

2852
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:53,390
it's the statement that you should turn
the other cheek and that's a tough one,

2853
02:06:53,391 --> 02:06:53,661
man,

2854
02:06:53,661 --> 02:06:54,494
because.

2855
02:06:54,920 --> 02:06:55,251
Well,

2856
02:06:55,251 --> 02:06:56,120
because first of all,

2857
02:06:56,121 --> 02:06:57,230
who wants to do that?

2858
02:06:57,380 --> 02:06:59,870
Because you want to
explode in righteous anger.

2859
02:06:59,871 --> 02:07:01,610
At least you want to defend yourself.

2860
02:07:01,611 --> 02:07:03,230
You want to do one of those things.

2861
02:07:03,870 --> 02:07:05,630
So what the hell does that mean?

2862
02:07:06,230 --> 02:07:08,150
And partly what it means is

2863
02:07:12,250 --> 02:07:13,180
if you're attack

2864
02:07:14,870 --> 02:07:15,980
and you're innocent,

2865
02:07:16,370 --> 02:07:17,121
and and look,

2866
02:07:17,121 --> 02:07:20,150
I'm not saying I'm like globally
innocent or anything like that,

2867
02:07:21,140 --> 02:07:26,140
but I'm not guilty of the accusations
that are levied at me or at least I not

2868
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:31,280
guilty in the manner that the
accusations would indicate.

2869
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:37,060
If you're being attacked and you're
not guilty of the accusations,

2870
02:07:37,061 --> 02:07:38,560
then the attacks

2871
02:07:40,480 --> 02:07:44,980
say more about the attacker
then their intended target.

2872
02:07:46,330 --> 02:07:46,721
And so,

2873
02:07:46,721 --> 02:07:49,750
so far I've been able to
withstand the attacks.

2874
02:07:50,380 --> 02:07:54,400
And the consequence of that is that it
said more about the attackers then about

2875
02:07:54,401 --> 02:07:55,234
meat.

2876
02:07:55,870 --> 02:07:56,890
And then the question is,

2877
02:07:56,891 --> 02:08:01,891
can I tolerate that because
it's still very stressful and

2878
02:08:04,090 --> 02:08:06,910
I very a waiver on that back and forth.

2879
02:08:07,300 --> 02:08:11,700
And then of course the other issue is
is that some people in the media of

2880
02:08:11,710 --> 02:08:12,341
pilloried me,

2881
02:08:12,341 --> 02:08:13,540
but many haven't.

2882
02:08:14,010 --> 02:08:14,341
You know,

2883
02:08:14,341 --> 02:08:18,070
there've been very many thoughtful people
that have written thoughtful pieces

2884
02:08:18,071 --> 02:08:18,700
about me.

2885
02:08:18,700 --> 02:08:21,760
There's a Canadian
consortium of 200 newspapers,

2886
02:08:22,000 --> 02:08:23,230
the post media group,

2887
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:24,670
and they came out.

2888
02:08:24,730 --> 02:08:28,810
The entire group came out in favor
of my stance in relationship to bill

2889
02:08:28,811 --> 02:08:30,130
[inaudible] in Canada,

2890
02:08:30,131 --> 02:08:31,570
which was a speech,

2891
02:08:31,620 --> 02:08:35,130
a speech piece of legislation
that compelled speech and so

2892
02:08:38,280 --> 02:08:39,030
well,

2893
02:08:39,030 --> 02:08:39,863
so,

2894
02:08:40,830 --> 02:08:41,620
so far,

2895
02:08:41,620 --> 02:08:42,900
same with the protests.

2896
02:08:43,350 --> 02:08:45,360
When people come out
to protest against me.

2897
02:08:45,420 --> 02:08:50,420
The first video that went viral was a
protest at the University of Toronto and

2898
02:08:51,150 --> 02:08:54,190
after the protest was over that the pro,

2899
02:08:54,680 --> 02:08:55,770
the anti free speech,

2900
02:08:55,771 --> 02:09:00,771
people at the protests took the microphone
away in and blasted white noise and

2901
02:09:01,051 --> 02:09:04,770
made it impossible for anyone to speak
even though it was an open mic event.

2902
02:09:06,910 --> 02:09:11,910
So that got broadcast and then about
two hours after the event I went down to

2903
02:09:12,031 --> 02:09:12,870
talk to the cops.

2904
02:09:12,871 --> 02:09:15,360
To see if anybody had been
hurt or anything like that,

2905
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:17,460
and then on the way back
into the university,

2906
02:09:17,461 --> 02:09:22,461
I go to Costco and buy half a dozen
like radical types and about 30 of their

2907
02:09:24,121 --> 02:09:28,440
hangers on and then there's a crowd of
people that I would say we're probably

2908
02:09:28,441 --> 02:09:33,030
supporting me that that gathered around
me and they went after me and videotaped

2909
02:09:33,031 --> 02:09:38,031
all of it on their cell phones and then
they posted that and the idea was that

2910
02:09:39,270 --> 02:09:40,500
that was going to do me in,

2911
02:09:41,070 --> 02:09:46,070
but what happened was the comments were
a 100 to one in favor of what I was say.

2912
02:09:46,830 --> 02:09:51,540
So that was another example where the
protests were more damaging to the

2913
02:09:51,541 --> 02:09:53,310
protestors then they were to me,

2914
02:09:53,340 --> 02:09:56,820
and that's been luckily fortunately,

2915
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,680
miraculously all of that,

2916
02:09:59,010 --> 02:10:00,120
a recurrent pattern.

2917
02:10:01,110 --> 02:10:06,110
And so the question is whether or not
I can tolerate it and whether my family

2918
02:10:06,901 --> 02:10:07,681
can tolerate it.

2919
02:10:07,681 --> 02:10:08,514
And so far,

2920
02:10:09,420 --> 02:10:09,810
look,

2921
02:10:09,810 --> 02:10:12,210
if you're trying to do
something difficult,

2922
02:10:12,240 --> 02:10:15,690
let's say the right amount
of controversy isn't zero.

2923
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:21,210
The question is how much controversy
can you handle and how much of the mud

2924
02:10:21,211 --> 02:10:22,410
that's thrown will stick.

2925
02:10:22,411 --> 02:10:25,770
And then how much of it deserves
to stick all of those things.

2926
02:10:25,771 --> 02:10:28,410
You go to scour your conscience
under those circumstances.

2927
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:29,893
But

2928
02:10:32,620 --> 02:10:34,250
so I've been fortunate.

2929
02:10:35,240 --> 02:10:39,500
It seems like you've taken
on this dragon voluntarily.

2930
02:10:39,680 --> 02:10:42,290
It seems like from the beginning
you've known that this,

2931
02:10:42,530 --> 02:10:43,071
for example,

2932
02:10:43,071 --> 02:10:43,904
when you

2933
02:10:45,020 --> 02:10:49,040
spoke up against a
biddle see 16 in Canada,

2934
02:10:49,041 --> 02:10:52,250
you knew that this might become tough.

2935
02:10:53,150 --> 02:10:58,150
Well Guide taught people to negotiate
in my clinical practice for a long time.

2936
02:10:58,580 --> 02:10:58,821
You know,

2937
02:10:58,821 --> 02:11:00,050
I've had lots of clients,

2938
02:11:00,410 --> 02:11:05,410
many of those clients were female and
the are the goal in my consulting with

2939
02:11:07,311 --> 02:11:10,670
them was to double or triple
their salary within five years.

2940
02:11:11,570 --> 02:11:14,840
And so that wasn't
necessarily the only goal.

2941
02:11:14,841 --> 02:11:16,160
We discussed all sorts of goals,

2942
02:11:16,161 --> 02:11:17,390
but that was often one.

2943
02:11:17,930 --> 02:11:22,370
And so I was very accustomed to organizing
people to negotiate and there's,

2944
02:11:22,371 --> 02:11:23,480
if you want to negotiate,

2945
02:11:23,481 --> 02:11:24,620
there's a couple of rules.

2946
02:11:25,220 --> 02:11:28,520
The first rule is you
have to be able to say no.

2947
02:11:30,020 --> 02:11:34,970
And what no means is there isn't anything
you can do to me to get me to do that.

2948
02:11:35,660 --> 02:11:36,830
That's what no means.

2949
02:11:36,920 --> 02:11:37,131
Now,

2950
02:11:37,131 --> 02:11:37,821
like you can be.

2951
02:11:37,821 --> 02:11:40,340
You can have different degrees
of seriousness about no,

2952
02:11:40,341 --> 02:11:42,410
but if you're going to
negotiate with your boss,

2953
02:11:42,411 --> 02:11:44,420
say for a substantial raise,

2954
02:11:45,830 --> 02:11:47,810
no means if I don't get it,

2955
02:11:47,811 --> 02:11:48,890
then I will leave.

2956
02:11:48,950 --> 02:11:52,010
That's fundamentally and
leaving will cost you more than.

2957
02:11:52,190 --> 02:11:53,090
It's not a threat,

2958
02:11:53,120 --> 02:11:53,953
right?

2959
02:11:54,080 --> 02:11:58,880
It has to be the observation that me
leaving will cost you substantially more

2960
02:11:59,000 --> 02:12:01,340
than giving me the rates.

2961
02:12:01,520 --> 02:12:05,480
You have to be in a position to make that
case or you don't win the negotiation.

2962
02:12:05,481 --> 02:12:09,800
And so I always put my clients in a
position where if they went and asked for

2963
02:12:09,801 --> 02:12:10,634
something,

2964
02:12:10,700 --> 02:12:14,180
they were in a position to win because
we didn't go and ask before that.

2965
02:12:14,990 --> 02:12:17,810
So when I made the video
criticizing bill c 16,

2966
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:21,680
I thought I'm not abiding by
this damn piece of legislation.

2967
02:12:21,980 --> 02:12:22,813
And then I thought,

2968
02:12:22,880 --> 02:12:23,091
well,

2969
02:12:23,091 --> 02:12:25,040
what does it mean that I'm not?

2970
02:12:25,730 --> 02:12:26,563
And I thought,

2971
02:12:27,830 --> 02:12:28,041
well,

2972
02:12:28,041 --> 02:12:29,720
I had multiple sources of income.

2973
02:12:29,721 --> 02:12:30,620
So I was reading.

2974
02:12:30,890 --> 02:12:35,120
I was reasonably positioned to
tolerate a fair bit of push back.

2975
02:12:35,660 --> 02:12:35,901
I mean,

2976
02:12:35,901 --> 02:12:37,030
I could've gotten wiped out.

2977
02:12:37,031 --> 02:12:38,480
You had things gone sideways,

2978
02:12:38,481 --> 02:12:42,770
but it would have been difficult to
take me out completely and I thought

2979
02:12:44,360 --> 02:12:47,540
there's no way I'm abiding
by this piece of legislation.

2980
02:12:47,900 --> 02:12:48,590
I was willing,

2981
02:12:48,590 --> 02:12:53,090
I thought through the
negative consequences now I
didn't of course think that

2982
02:12:53,091 --> 02:12:56,960
any of this would happen because this is
just completely preposterous and no one

2983
02:12:56,961 --> 02:12:58,370
could have possibly foreseen it,

2984
02:12:58,371 --> 02:12:59,204
but.

2985
02:12:59,720 --> 02:13:03,890
So I would say there were certain
things I faced in doing that,

2986
02:13:03,891 --> 02:13:08,891
but I couldn't have foreseen the
absolutely explosive consequences.

2987
02:13:10,370 --> 02:13:11,780
I'm not unhappy that I did it.

2988
02:13:11,781 --> 02:13:12,680
I would do it again.

2989
02:13:13,190 --> 02:13:14,300
I am still doing it.

2990
02:13:14,301 --> 02:13:15,134
I suppose.

2991
02:13:15,530 --> 02:13:16,363
So,

2992
02:13:18,690 --> 02:13:19,310
um,

2993
02:13:19,310 --> 02:13:22,790
which of your 12 rules
do you break most often?

2994
02:13:32,640 --> 02:13:37,380
I could probably still be better
at listening to people I like.

2995
02:13:37,381 --> 02:13:38,430
I have these,

2996
02:13:38,500 --> 02:13:39,333
um,

2997
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:40,770
I do interviews with people.

2998
02:13:40,771 --> 02:13:43,140
I call them discussions because
they're not really interviews.

2999
02:13:43,980 --> 02:13:46,440
Probably they're not interviews
because I talked too much,

3000
02:13:47,250 --> 02:13:49,020
so I had to call them discussions.

3001
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:54,330
But I would say the most common criticism
of those discussions is that I'm in,

3002
02:13:54,480 --> 02:13:59,480
I interrupt the people that I'm
discussing things with and until the

3003
02:13:59,671 --> 02:14:02,910
conversation probably a
little bit more towards me,

3004
02:14:03,150 --> 02:14:07,530
my thinking then there is now part of
that I think is my natural tendency

3005
02:14:07,531 --> 02:14:11,940
towards like I've always talked a
lot ever since I was like three,

3006
02:14:12,510 --> 02:14:13,343
like

3007
02:14:14,310 --> 02:14:15,150
continually.

3008
02:14:15,450 --> 02:14:16,110
So it's,

3009
02:14:16,110 --> 02:14:16,650
I'm there,

3010
02:14:16,650 --> 02:14:17,760
I'm verbally fluent,

3011
02:14:17,800 --> 02:14:18,330
you know,

3012
02:14:18,330 --> 02:14:20,700
it's part of my nature and extroverted.

3013
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:22,433
But

3014
02:14:24,310 --> 02:14:26,080
you can always get better at listening,

3015
02:14:26,620 --> 02:14:27,453
you know?

3016
02:14:27,460 --> 02:14:29,430
And so I can listen and,

3017
02:14:29,860 --> 02:14:31,810
and I practiced that
because I'm a therapist.

3018
02:14:31,811 --> 02:14:33,160
But I would say that's probably the rule.

3019
02:14:33,161 --> 02:14:34,420
I break that rule nine,

3020
02:14:34,421 --> 02:14:37,120
like assume that the person you're
listening to know something you don't.

3021
02:14:37,140 --> 02:14:42,140
It's like I'm not as good at that yet as
I could be because I wouldn't get that

3022
02:14:44,170 --> 02:14:45,700
criticism if I was like,

3023
02:14:45,701 --> 02:14:47,170
it's not every comment or anything.

3024
02:14:47,171 --> 02:14:50,230
It's probably like every 20th
comment or every 30th comment,

3025
02:14:50,231 --> 02:14:51,040
but it's.

3026
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:51,791
But it's still,

3027
02:14:51,791 --> 02:14:52,690
it's consistent.

3028
02:14:52,691 --> 02:14:54,400
And so every time I have
an interview I think,

3029
02:14:54,401 --> 02:14:54,671
okay,

3030
02:14:54,671 --> 02:14:56,410
I'm going to try to shut
up a little bit more.

3031
02:14:57,130 --> 02:15:00,490
But then I get excited about
what's happening and you know,

3032
02:15:00,760 --> 02:15:02,950
and talk too much.

3033
02:15:08,190 --> 02:15:09,770
One thing related to that,

3034
02:15:10,790 --> 02:15:15,140
sometimes you seem to go off on a tangent.

3035
02:15:15,141 --> 02:15:16,850
When you're discussing something,

3036
02:15:16,880 --> 02:15:18,770
you go into a,

3037
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,250
you know,

3038
02:15:19,250 --> 02:15:20,900
something related to it,

3039
02:15:21,240 --> 02:15:24,440
then you come back to a
greater structure of things.

3040
02:15:24,700 --> 02:15:25,533
Um,

3041
02:15:25,690 --> 02:15:30,690
do you have you laid all this out before
you say it or do you just go from one

3042
02:15:32,390 --> 02:15:36,560
topic to another and they somehow
relate together and become whole?

3043
02:15:37,140 --> 02:15:37,640
Um,

3044
02:15:37,640 --> 02:15:38,090
both.

3045
02:15:38,090 --> 02:15:38,580
Both.

3046
02:15:38,580 --> 02:15:39,170
Yeah.

3047
02:15:39,170 --> 02:15:42,080
But so before I do a talk,

3048
02:15:42,260 --> 02:15:43,093
like I have to,

3049
02:15:43,280 --> 02:15:45,350
I think about the talk
all day before I do it,

3050
02:15:45,380 --> 02:15:47,150
like not 100 percent of the time,

3051
02:15:47,151 --> 02:15:47,530
but it's,

3052
02:15:47,530 --> 02:15:52,340
it's in my mind all the time and what
I'm trying to get as the basic narrative

3053
02:15:52,730 --> 02:15:55,610
and it's something you can only
use a metaphor to describe it.

3054
02:15:55,611 --> 02:16:00,611
So imagine you wanted to cross a swamp
and there were stones under the surface.

3055
02:16:01,700 --> 02:16:04,640
You need to know where the stones are
to get from one side of the swamp to the

3056
02:16:04,641 --> 02:16:05,240
other.

3057
02:16:05,240 --> 02:16:07,310
And so then that's what
I do in my imagination,

3058
02:16:07,311 --> 02:16:07,581
I think,

3059
02:16:07,581 --> 02:16:07,821
okay,

3060
02:16:07,821 --> 02:16:12,821
well there's this area I have to traverse
and there's stepping stones along the

3061
02:16:13,221 --> 02:16:13,820
way.

3062
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:15,560
I need to know where they're located.

3063
02:16:16,220 --> 02:16:19,520
And so that might be like 12
points or something like that.

3064
02:16:19,850 --> 02:16:21,110
That's the rough path.

3065
02:16:21,620 --> 02:16:26,620
And then I have a whole corpus of stories
that fit each of those points and then

3066
02:16:29,291 --> 02:16:31,810
I can choose how I'm going
to weave those together.

3067
02:16:32,170 --> 02:16:34,220
But I have to remember where I'm going.

3068
02:16:34,630 --> 02:16:35,111
If I'm.

3069
02:16:35,111 --> 02:16:35,944
Well,

3070
02:16:35,980 --> 02:16:38,170
like if I'm healthy and
functioning properly,

3071
02:16:38,171 --> 02:16:41,860
then I can go way out on a
tangent and I can still remember,

3072
02:16:42,280 --> 02:16:42,671
Oh yes,

3073
02:16:42,671 --> 02:16:46,060
I have to tie that back to this
point and move to the next step.

3074
02:16:46,360 --> 02:16:47,193
So it's,

3075
02:16:47,500 --> 02:16:48,040
I like,

3076
02:16:48,040 --> 02:16:50,770
I think it's like jazz
improvisation essentially,

3077
02:16:50,771 --> 02:16:51,011
you know,

3078
02:16:51,011 --> 02:16:52,660
you have the melody and it,

3079
02:16:52,661 --> 02:16:56,920
it has to organize the melody has
to organize all the improvisation.

3080
02:16:57,310 --> 02:17:00,100
And then I have all these
stories that I know,

3081
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:01,630
but I,

3082
02:17:01,630 --> 02:17:06,630
every time I tell this story I try to
vary it so that it brings in something I

3083
02:17:06,671 --> 02:17:07,720
haven't brought in before.

3084
02:17:07,721 --> 02:17:08,710
Integrate something,

3085
02:17:09,280 --> 02:17:09,491
you know,

3086
02:17:09,491 --> 02:17:11,710
like what are the things I
was trying to do tonight,

3087
02:17:12,160 --> 02:17:16,300
I've been trying to figure out for a
long time is how to integrate the idea of

3088
02:17:16,301 --> 02:17:21,301
the good player of games with the idea
of voluntarily shouldering you're the

3089
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:23,530
catastrophe of life.

3090
02:17:23,710 --> 02:17:25,510
I know those are the same thing,

3091
02:17:25,990 --> 02:17:30,640
but it's not obvious why and I'm
still not completely obvious to me,

3092
02:17:30,700 --> 02:17:35,380
but I know that the connection exists
and I got a fair bit of fairways tonight

3093
02:17:35,381 --> 02:17:39,070
farther than I had at stacking
those concepts on top of each other.

3094
02:17:39,370 --> 02:17:43,630
So the other thing I'm always trying
to do is to take each of these sets of

3095
02:17:43,631 --> 02:17:47,230
ideas and to weave them
together more tightly,

3096
02:17:47,650 --> 02:17:50,980
but also to push them
further in their development.

3097
02:17:51,760 --> 02:17:52,350
So.

3098
02:17:52,350 --> 02:17:54,310
And you've been doing that on this tour.

3099
02:17:54,490 --> 02:17:58,300
Have you been developing your ideas?

3100
02:17:58,450 --> 02:17:58,691
Go.

3101
02:17:58,691 --> 02:17:59,524
Absolutely,

3102
02:17:59,740 --> 02:18:00,281
absolutely.

3103
02:18:00,281 --> 02:18:00,760
There's.

3104
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:03,250
You can't give an
effective lecture without.

3105
02:18:03,910 --> 02:18:04,743
So

3106
02:18:06,730 --> 02:18:08,920
you don't deliver a talk to an audience.

3107
02:18:10,180 --> 02:18:10,571
First of all,

3108
02:18:10,571 --> 02:18:13,510
it's not app talk second,

3109
02:18:13,511 --> 02:18:14,590
you don't deliver it.

3110
02:18:15,490 --> 02:18:15,881
Third,

3111
02:18:15,881 --> 02:18:18,550
it isn't an audience
like all of that's wrong.

3112
02:18:20,140 --> 02:18:25,140
You talk to individuals in the audience
one at a time and they're representative

3113
02:18:25,841 --> 02:18:26,381
of the whole,

3114
02:18:26,381 --> 02:18:28,090
but you're not talking to the audience.

3115
02:18:28,091 --> 02:18:29,590
If you're afraid of public speaking,

3116
02:18:29,591 --> 02:18:29,871
it's [inaudible].

3117
02:18:29,871 --> 02:18:31,120
You're talking to the audience.

3118
02:18:31,121 --> 02:18:31,540
It's like,

3119
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:32,291
forget about that.

3120
02:18:32,291 --> 02:18:33,280
You just talked to people.

3121
02:18:33,460 --> 02:18:34,420
You know how to do that,

3122
02:18:35,680 --> 02:18:40,680
and then you're not delivering a talk
because then it's a canned product.

3123
02:18:41,711 --> 02:18:44,830
You muscle just hand people pieces
of paper that they could read.

3124
02:18:45,550 --> 02:18:46,450
It's more efficient.

3125
02:18:46,660 --> 02:18:47,590
Why not do that?

3126
02:18:48,820 --> 02:18:53,820
What you're doing if you address people
properly is that you involve them in the

3127
02:18:56,171 --> 02:19:01,171
process of furthering exploration
of important concepts and you think,

3128
02:19:01,691 --> 02:19:01,990
well,

3129
02:19:01,990 --> 02:19:02,770
how can you do that?

3130
02:19:02,770 --> 02:19:04,750
Because they're sitting there passively.

3131
02:19:04,751 --> 02:19:05,584
It's like,

3132
02:19:05,650 --> 02:19:05,831
well,

3133
02:19:05,831 --> 02:19:06,790
you're not passive.

3134
02:19:07,550 --> 02:19:08,710
You're not verbal,

3135
02:19:09,100 --> 02:19:10,780
but when you're not passive,

3136
02:19:10,781 --> 02:19:11,740
like I listened,

3137
02:19:12,370 --> 02:19:14,680
I listened to whether or not
everyone's rustling around.

3138
02:19:15,700 --> 02:19:16,750
If you're rustling around,

3139
02:19:16,751 --> 02:19:20,110
then I'm not balancing
chaos in order to properly.

3140
02:19:20,740 --> 02:19:21,640
You're not gripped.

3141
02:19:23,140 --> 02:19:23,740
If you're.

3142
02:19:23,740 --> 02:19:25,420
If I can hear noise in the audience,

3143
02:19:25,421 --> 02:19:26,254
it's not right.

3144
02:19:26,560 --> 02:19:30,590
I watched one by one and I see sometimes
they're shaking their head like this.

3145
02:19:30,770 --> 02:19:31,820
Sometimes they're nodding.

3146
02:19:32,000 --> 02:19:33,560
Sometimes they look confused.

3147
02:19:34,070 --> 02:19:35,930
If if people look confused,

3148
02:19:35,931 --> 02:19:36,171
I think,

3149
02:19:36,171 --> 02:19:36,321
well,

3150
02:19:36,321 --> 02:19:37,430
I haven't got that right.

3151
02:19:37,431 --> 02:19:40,100
I have to be watching people and
seeing that they're understanding,

3152
02:19:40,101 --> 02:19:43,850
they're following along
and that indication that
they're following along helps

3153
02:19:43,851 --> 02:19:45,620
me figure out if I'm in the right place,

3154
02:19:45,650 --> 02:19:50,650
and so there's a dynamic that goes
along with it and so all of that,

3155
02:19:50,960 --> 02:19:53,900
and that's what you're doing if
you engage the audience properly,

3156
02:19:53,901 --> 02:19:57,200
is you shouldn't be talking about things
you don't know enough about to talk

3157
02:19:57,201 --> 02:19:57,830
about.

3158
02:19:57,830 --> 02:19:59,090
So if you have to read your notes,

3159
02:19:59,091 --> 02:19:59,924
it's like,

3160
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:00,411
sorry,

3161
02:20:00,411 --> 02:20:03,110
you don't know enough to talk
about that because you need notes.

3162
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:03,651
Now.

3163
02:20:03,651 --> 02:20:05,600
Maybe when you're first starting
to talk about something,

3164
02:20:05,601 --> 02:20:06,231
you need notes,

3165
02:20:06,231 --> 02:20:08,090
but if you need notes,

3166
02:20:08,450 --> 02:20:09,560
you haven't prepared enough.

3167
02:20:09,800 --> 02:20:12,560
You should know like 10 times
as much about the topic.

3168
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:14,570
Then you're going to
talk about in the talk.

3169
02:20:15,140 --> 02:20:15,561
Otherwise,

3170
02:20:15,561 --> 02:20:16,400
who the hell are you?

3171
02:20:17,090 --> 02:20:18,140
And so while right,

3172
02:20:18,141 --> 02:20:18,601
I mean you're.

3173
02:20:18,601 --> 02:20:19,850
You're supposed to be the authority,

3174
02:20:19,851 --> 02:20:24,851
so you need to know these things and
so and then knowing these things,

3175
02:20:25,971 --> 02:20:29,300
you want to stretch them
further because when you're.

3176
02:20:29,990 --> 02:20:32,930
This is a theater and lecture theater.

3177
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:34,370
Theater is drama,

3178
02:20:35,660 --> 02:20:36,860
so why is it a lecture?

3179
02:20:36,861 --> 02:20:37,610
Theater?

3180
02:20:37,610 --> 02:20:39,170
[inaudible] lecture is drama.

3181
02:20:39,680 --> 02:20:40,850
What's the drama?

3182
02:20:41,180 --> 02:20:43,460
Drama delivering a talk.

3183
02:20:43,880 --> 02:20:44,713
No,

3184
02:20:45,140 --> 02:20:46,350
there's no drama in that.

3185
02:20:46,351 --> 02:20:47,810
A tape recorder can do that.

3186
02:20:48,770 --> 02:20:53,770
The drama is to engage with the ideas
actively in real time and to discover with

3187
02:20:55,251 --> 02:21:00,140
the audience what the consequences
and that's what makes a novel great.

3188
02:21:00,140 --> 02:21:00,741
For example,

3189
02:21:00,741 --> 02:21:04,190
the reason that Dostoyevsky novel is
great is because Dostoevsky did not know

3190
02:21:04,191 --> 02:21:05,600
where he was going when he started.

3191
02:21:06,380 --> 02:21:07,400
He had problems,

3192
02:21:07,460 --> 02:21:07,761
you know,

3193
02:21:07,761 --> 02:21:09,650
like crime and punishment
is a great example.

3194
02:21:09,651 --> 02:21:12,470
He wanted to explore the relationship
between crime and punishment.

3195
02:21:12,710 --> 02:21:13,580
He didn't think,

3196
02:21:14,060 --> 02:21:14,271
well,

3197
02:21:14,271 --> 02:21:15,170
I'm a postmodern,

3198
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:16,040
neo marxists tonight.

3199
02:21:16,041 --> 02:21:19,100
I have a solution to the problem of crime
and punishment and I'm going to write

3200
02:21:19,101 --> 02:21:22,160
a novel describing what
the right solution is.

3201
02:21:22,520 --> 02:21:23,031
He thought,

3202
02:21:23,031 --> 02:21:23,880
here's a problem,

3203
02:21:23,881 --> 02:21:24,121
man.

3204
02:21:24,121 --> 02:21:25,310
This is a major problem.

3205
02:21:25,490 --> 02:21:30,260
I'm going to divide myself into 10
characters and I'm going to have a war and

3206
02:21:30,261 --> 02:21:32,390
I'm going to see what prevails,

3207
02:21:32,540 --> 02:21:34,460
and he takes you along
on that voyage and it's.

3208
02:21:34,970 --> 02:21:37,820
That's what makes Dostoevsky
different than Ayn rand.

3209
02:21:38,210 --> 02:21:39,043
For example,

3210
02:21:39,140 --> 02:21:43,430
because Ayn rand already knew who the
good guys and the bad guys were and maybe

3211
02:21:43,431 --> 02:21:45,050
she was right and maybe she wasn't.

3212
02:21:45,440 --> 02:21:49,430
Doesn't matter what matters is that
what she did wasn't literature.

3213
02:21:49,700 --> 02:21:51,920
It was just sophisticated propaganda,

3214
02:21:52,350 --> 02:21:52,610
you know,

3215
02:21:52,610 --> 02:21:53,180
like it,

3216
02:21:53,180 --> 02:21:56,150
it taps into literature upon occasion,

3217
02:21:56,180 --> 02:21:57,013
but,

3218
02:21:57,110 --> 02:21:58,580
but she knew where she was going.

3219
02:21:58,581 --> 02:22:00,230
Whereas Dusky Dostoevsky,

3220
02:22:00,680 --> 02:22:05,030
he discovered it along the way and so
he takes you along on the journey and

3221
02:22:05,031 --> 02:22:08,180
that's any great artists does that
takes you along in the journey.

3222
02:22:08,420 --> 02:22:12,200
That's why it's so rare vivifying to
encounter anything that's genuinely

3223
02:22:12,201 --> 02:22:17,201
artistic is because you're along for
the conflict between chaos and order and

3224
02:22:17,871 --> 02:22:21,890
that's way more interesting than
having a talk delivered to you.

3225
02:22:22,160 --> 02:22:24,980
Is it possible that that
journey might lead to a bad.

3226
02:22:25,350 --> 02:22:30,350
In some cases you've spoken of Hitler
when he was speaking to audiences and he

3227
02:22:30,481 --> 02:22:35,481
was listening to the audiences and
that and he started to find what really

3228
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:37,770
engaged them and made them,

3229
02:22:38,350 --> 02:22:39,183
um,

3230
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:39,840
yeah,

3231
02:22:39,840 --> 02:22:40,673
excited.

3232
02:22:41,000 --> 02:22:41,833
He was saying,

3233
02:22:41,910 --> 02:22:46,230
is it possible that you might get
it wrong because of that dynamic?

3234
02:22:46,410 --> 02:22:46,651
Oh,

3235
02:22:46,651 --> 02:22:47,291
definitely.

3236
02:22:47,291 --> 02:22:51,810
And it's a terrible threat to
get it wrong because you know,

3237
02:22:52,650 --> 02:22:53,260
in,

3238
02:22:53,260 --> 02:22:54,450
in rule three,

3239
02:22:54,630 --> 02:22:56,940
make friends with the people
who want the best for you.

3240
02:22:58,080 --> 02:23:01,020
There are other rules that were associated
with that that I didn't write about.

3241
02:23:01,050 --> 02:23:04,760
Like make friends with people with own.

3242
02:23:04,930 --> 02:23:05,250
No.

3243
02:23:05,250 --> 02:23:05,880
Let's see.

3244
02:23:05,880 --> 02:23:07,350
Be Very careful with who.

3245
02:23:07,680 --> 02:23:11,280
Be Very careful about who
you share good news with.

3246
02:23:11,640 --> 02:23:16,640
That was one rule and another rule was
be very careful about whom you share bad

3247
02:23:16,741 --> 02:23:17,574
news with.

3248
02:23:18,660 --> 02:23:20,520
And those are sort of
hallmarks of friendship.

3249
02:23:20,910 --> 02:23:21,451
If you have friends,

3250
02:23:21,451 --> 02:23:22,680
you can tell good news too.

3251
02:23:22,860 --> 02:23:25,350
You know what it's like to tell good
news to someone that you shouldn't tell.

3252
02:23:25,351 --> 02:23:26,184
Good news too.

3253
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:30,150
It's like they're not
happy about your good news.

3254
02:23:30,220 --> 02:23:32,760
There are bitter about it and
they'll show it in some way.

3255
02:23:32,761 --> 02:23:35,080
Maybe they'll trump your good
news or they won't listen.

3256
02:23:35,080 --> 02:23:38,880
Or they'll bring up another topic or
they're secretly angry or whatever.

3257
02:23:38,881 --> 02:23:42,270
You walk away from sharing the good news
thinking you should have kept your damn

3258
02:23:42,271 --> 02:23:44,580
mouth shut and that's not a good sign.

3259
02:23:44,940 --> 02:23:45,773
And then.

3260
02:23:45,840 --> 02:23:48,990
But some people you can tell good news
too and they'll be happy because they

3261
02:23:48,991 --> 02:23:51,840
have enough sense to know
that life's to catastrophe.

3262
02:23:51,841 --> 02:23:53,130
And if something good happened to you,

3263
02:23:53,131 --> 02:23:53,821
then hooray.

3264
02:23:53,821 --> 02:23:54,121
You know,

3265
02:23:54,121 --> 02:23:57,630
because and then bad
news is the same thing.

3266
02:23:57,631 --> 02:24:00,750
It's like if you tell bad news to someone,

3267
02:24:00,930 --> 02:24:02,790
they need to let you suffer,

3268
02:24:03,330 --> 02:24:03,601
right?

3269
02:24:03,601 --> 02:24:06,660
They shouldn't make you feel better quick
because they're upset because you're

3270
02:24:06,661 --> 02:24:07,080
upset,

3271
02:24:07,080 --> 02:24:07,590
none of that.

3272
02:24:07,590 --> 02:24:08,670
They just have to take it.

3273
02:24:08,880 --> 02:24:09,713
And that's hard.

3274
02:24:10,140 --> 02:24:11,370
So the,

3275
02:24:12,910 --> 02:24:15,240
I think I forgot what the
hell the question was here.

3276
02:24:16,320 --> 02:24:19,170
I'm getting tired so I'm
losing my ability to go back

3277
02:24:21,200 --> 02:24:25,680
where you may get it wrong when
you're interacting with the audience.

3278
02:24:25,740 --> 02:24:26,573
Yes.

3279
02:24:27,820 --> 02:24:28,653
Look

3280
02:24:30,640 --> 02:24:33,730
what Hitler did was
this far as I can tell,

3281
02:24:34,140 --> 02:24:35,500
and I've talked to politicians who've,

3282
02:24:35,570 --> 02:24:38,470
who've built grassroots political
parties about how they did it too.

3283
02:24:39,070 --> 02:24:39,903
So

3284
02:24:41,590 --> 02:24:43,300
the audience talks to you when you,

3285
02:24:43,510 --> 02:24:44,590
when you deliver,

3286
02:24:44,770 --> 02:24:45,190
when you,

3287
02:24:45,190 --> 02:24:45,850
when you,

3288
02:24:45,850 --> 02:24:50,380
when you speak publicly and they talk
to you with their emotional reactions,

3289
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:56,340
and then you can learn how to say what
produces a given emotional reaction,

3290
02:24:57,730 --> 02:24:59,260
especially if that's what you want.

3291
02:24:59,261 --> 02:24:59,820
If you want,

3292
02:24:59,820 --> 02:25:00,041
say,

3293
02:25:00,041 --> 02:25:01,900
control over the crowd or maybe you want,

3294
02:25:02,680 --> 02:25:05,470
you want to harness
the anger of the crowd.

3295
02:25:05,471 --> 02:25:07,570
Let's say [inaudible]
your own motivations.

3296
02:25:08,800 --> 02:25:10,210
What were Hitler's motivations?

3297
02:25:10,900 --> 02:25:12,520
Here's the psychoanalytic answer.

3298
02:25:13,480 --> 02:25:15,310
If you cannot understand the motivations,

3299
02:25:15,430 --> 02:25:18,130
look at the consequences
and infer the motivation.

3300
02:25:19,120 --> 02:25:20,140
What's the consequence?

3301
02:25:20,320 --> 02:25:25,060
Hitler blows his brains out in a bunker
under Berlin when Europe is on fire.

3302
02:25:26,170 --> 02:25:29,680
What was the motivation
as suicidal apocalypse?

3303
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:31,840
That's the motivation.

3304
02:25:32,530 --> 02:25:34,690
How do you generate as
suicidal apocalypse?

3305
02:25:34,860 --> 02:25:35,760
You a mad it.

3306
02:25:36,430 --> 02:25:38,830
How do you get the crowd to go along?

3307
02:25:39,280 --> 02:25:42,640
You speak in that manner and you watch
for the emotional response and when you

3308
02:25:42,641 --> 02:25:44,440
get the anger that you're after,

3309
02:25:44,650 --> 02:25:49,420
you facilitate it and you let your
imagination dwell on that and you become a

3310
02:25:49,421 --> 02:25:54,421
master of that and that's what Hitler did
and it wasn't like the Germans weren't

3311
02:25:54,491 --> 02:25:56,560
angry and they had their reasons.

3312
02:25:56,980 --> 02:25:58,990
World War One was brutal.

3313
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:03,970
They lost the Versailles treaty was
a catastrophe in the 19 twenties.

3314
02:26:04,030 --> 02:26:09,030
Every decent hardworking German lost all
of their savings in hyperinflation and

3315
02:26:11,141 --> 02:26:14,530
the entire country was threatened
by a radical leftist revolution.

3316
02:26:15,400 --> 02:26:19,510
It was rough and people were not happy
and many of them had been terribly

3317
02:26:19,511 --> 02:26:21,040
brutalized by world war one,

3318
02:26:21,220 --> 02:26:25,840
so there was no shortage of anger to
capitalize on and Hitler was just the guy

3319
02:26:26,050 --> 02:26:27,190
annoyed as he was,

3320
02:26:27,191 --> 02:26:28,024
for example,

3321
02:26:28,060 --> 02:26:32,230
that he was rejected from art school
three times despite despite having a fair

3322
02:26:32,231 --> 02:26:33,430
bit of artistic talent.

3323
02:26:33,940 --> 02:26:38,940
He had his reasons for resentment and
anger and hatred and that's just a tiny

3324
02:26:40,211 --> 02:26:41,044
part of it.

3325
02:26:41,140 --> 02:26:41,501
Yes.

3326
02:26:41,501 --> 02:26:43,150
These things can go terribly wrong.

3327
02:26:43,830 --> 02:26:44,620
It depends,

3328
02:26:44,620 --> 02:26:46,570
at least in part on what you're aiming at.

3329
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:49,930
People ask me what I'm
aiming at and I would say,

3330
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:51,430
I mean who knows,

3331
02:26:51,431 --> 02:26:51,731
right?

3332
02:26:51,731 --> 02:26:56,680
Because you don't know yourself and I
don't know myself not to the final depths,

3333
02:26:57,310 --> 02:26:59,920
but I think what I'm aiming at,

3334
02:27:01,180 --> 02:27:04,810
I'm hoping is exactly
what I say I'm aiming at.

3335
02:27:04,840 --> 02:27:09,840
I hope that what I'm aiming
at is to tell people stories

3336
02:27:12,880 --> 02:27:17,880
and provide them with
clinical intervention in
information that's derived from

3337
02:27:18,101 --> 02:27:23,101
the best literature and science that I
know so that they can be fortified in

3338
02:27:23,981 --> 02:27:28,660
their ability to contend with tragedy
and malevolence and the reason that I'm

3339
02:27:28,661 --> 02:27:29,494
doing that.

3340
02:27:29,590 --> 02:27:32,380
As far as I'm concerned is because
when I wrote my first book,

3341
02:27:32,381 --> 02:27:33,550
which was maps of meaning,

3342
02:27:34,090 --> 02:27:36,310
the audio version of
which is out next week,

3343
02:27:36,311 --> 02:27:37,144
by the way,

3344
02:27:37,420 --> 02:27:42,230
I think it'll be easier to understand
because it's red and the intonation is all

3345
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:43,073
there.

3346
02:27:43,330 --> 02:27:48,330
I concluded after studying the
psychological dynamics of the Cold War,

3347
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:54,870
that the only proper medication
to tyrannical collectivism
was the sovereignty

3348
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:00,580
of the individual and
that as a consequence,

3349
02:28:00,610 --> 02:28:03,190
the sovereign individual
needed to be strengthened.

3350
02:28:03,820 --> 02:28:07,840
That that was the path forward was
least harm and most potential good.

3351
02:28:08,350 --> 02:28:13,350
And I think that's what I'm doing my
evidence for that is that I've been doing

3352
02:28:13,361 --> 02:28:14,680
it for 30 years.

3353
02:28:15,250 --> 02:28:19,300
I taught courses based on that at
Harvard and at the University of Toronto

3354
02:28:19,570 --> 02:28:20,740
consistently.

3355
02:28:21,470 --> 02:28:25,880
The lectures were made into a television
program in Toronto that was popular.

3356
02:28:26,210 --> 02:28:29,840
The lecturers became
explosively popular online.

3357
02:28:30,050 --> 02:28:35,050
Everybody can see what I'm saying as
far as I can tell and apart from the hip

3358
02:28:35,241 --> 02:28:35,930
pieces,

3359
02:28:35,930 --> 02:28:38,240
which are perhaps valid criticisms,

3360
02:28:38,241 --> 02:28:39,470
although I don't believe so.

3361
02:28:39,950 --> 02:28:40,783
Um,

3362
02:28:41,360 --> 02:28:45,920
the overwhelming evidence as far as I
can tell is that it's having a positive

3363
02:28:45,921 --> 02:28:46,754
consequence.

3364
02:28:47,180 --> 02:28:47,391
So,

3365
02:28:47,391 --> 02:28:48,224
and I'm hoping,

3366
02:28:48,260 --> 02:28:51,050
and I have people watching
me and criticizing me,

3367
02:28:51,051 --> 02:28:52,700
like friends of mine in my family,

3368
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:55,580
trying to make sure that this
all works and so hopefully

3369
02:28:57,320 --> 02:29:00,560
I'm not doing something that isn't good.

3370
02:29:01,730 --> 02:29:02,563
We'll see.

3371
02:29:02,720 --> 02:29:03,553
But yes.

3372
02:29:07,720 --> 02:29:11,380
Thanks.

3373
02:29:13,700 --> 02:29:14,290
The last,

3374
02:29:14,290 --> 02:29:15,400
last question,

3375
02:29:16,060 --> 02:29:18,580
what did you think of
the last star wars movie?

3376
02:29:23,650 --> 02:29:24,220
I've gone,

3377
02:29:24,220 --> 02:29:26,710
I don't know if I saw
the last star wars movie,

3378
02:29:26,890 --> 02:29:29,350
but I saw one of the last.

3379
02:29:29,560 --> 02:29:33,250
I've probably seen three of the last
five star wars movies I would say,

3380
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:37,000
and I thought they were all the same
movie as the First Star Wars movie.

3381
02:29:37,690 --> 02:29:38,523
So,

3382
02:29:38,680 --> 02:29:39,513
um,

3383
02:29:39,910 --> 02:29:40,990
so I haven't,

3384
02:29:41,740 --> 02:29:43,300
they haven't been my cup of tea.

3385
02:29:43,301 --> 02:29:46,750
Let's say I'm having said that,

3386
02:29:46,751 --> 02:29:47,740
it's obvious that,

3387
02:29:48,450 --> 02:29:48,730
you know,

3388
02:29:48,730 --> 02:29:49,900
the superhero movies,

3389
02:29:49,901 --> 02:29:51,070
the star wars movies,

3390
02:29:51,071 --> 02:29:52,240
the star trek movies,

3391
02:29:52,540 --> 02:29:57,540
the fantastic success that marvel in
particular has had with their Superhero

3392
02:29:58,150 --> 02:29:58,380
Pantheon.

3393
02:29:58,380 --> 02:30:00,850
Like those are the most expensive
artifacts that people make a,

3394
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:01,541
those movies.

3395
02:30:01,541 --> 02:30:02,860
That's something to really think about.

3396
02:30:02,861 --> 02:30:03,131
You know,

3397
02:30:03,131 --> 02:30:05,290
people put $200,000,000
into a movie like that.

3398
02:30:05,350 --> 02:30:07,210
It's not the most expensive thing we make,

3399
02:30:07,211 --> 02:30:08,620
but it's bloody well up there.

3400
02:30:08,621 --> 02:30:09,454
I can tell you,

3401
02:30:09,660 --> 02:30:12,370
and it's pretty interesting
to realize as well,

3402
02:30:12,380 --> 02:30:16,100
but making the special effects
for those movies which,

3403
02:30:16,170 --> 02:30:17,920
which is a form of artificial reality,

3404
02:30:17,921 --> 02:30:18,341
let's say,

3405
02:30:18,341 --> 02:30:22,690
is part of what's driving computational
sophistication forward because the big

3406
02:30:22,691 --> 02:30:26,470
processors are being used most
intensively to render reality.

3407
02:30:26,890 --> 02:30:31,890
And so whatever's happening in those
movies is something far more significant

3408
02:30:32,291 --> 02:30:33,310
than you might think.

3409
02:30:33,700 --> 02:30:38,700
I think it all speaks to the unquenchable
power of mythology and its proclivity

3410
02:30:40,121 --> 02:30:43,750
to manifest itself in a
multitude of forms and,

3411
02:30:44,260 --> 02:30:44,920
and,

3412
02:30:44,920 --> 02:30:48,010
and to be in t eternally
compelling to people.

3413
02:30:48,011 --> 02:30:52,420
And so generally that seems to
be a really good thing to me.

3414
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:56,920
So I mean the Harry Potter series I think
is a better example than the star wars

3415
02:30:56,921 --> 02:30:58,150
series because I think that,

3416
02:30:59,260 --> 02:31:04,260
I think that the star wars series
is a bit too consciously contrived.

3417
02:31:05,740 --> 02:31:10,740
Whereas the Harry Potter series is
genuinely to my way of thinking anyways,

3418
02:31:10,931 --> 02:31:12,880
is it genuine intuitive production?

3419
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:14,380
Um,

3420
02:31:14,380 --> 02:31:16,570
and rolling got her mythology.

3421
02:31:16,780 --> 02:31:17,710
She so good at that.

3422
02:31:17,711 --> 02:31:18,640
I just can't believe it.

3423
02:31:18,641 --> 02:31:20,520
It's just absolutely unbelievable.

3424
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:22,710
And you think of the consequences of that.

3425
02:31:22,711 --> 02:31:27,711
She wrote seven books about wizards like
teenage wizards and child wizards and

3426
02:31:28,831 --> 02:31:33,831
magical castle threatened by giant snakes
and portrayed the battle between good

3427
02:31:33,931 --> 02:31:37,470
and evil on a landscape of
chaos and order and sold.

3428
02:31:37,740 --> 02:31:42,740
I don't know what's her empire worth in
terms of total financial consequences?

3429
02:31:43,051 --> 02:31:43,884
It would be.

3430
02:31:44,780 --> 02:31:46,590
It's in the tens of billions of dollars.

3431
02:31:46,591 --> 02:31:47,424
Certainly.

3432
02:31:47,610 --> 02:31:50,280
She got all these kids
to read 600 page books.

3433
02:31:50,281 --> 02:31:53,070
They produced all these movies
that were fantastically expensive.

3434
02:31:53,340 --> 02:31:55,650
Everybody read them and
went and watched them.

3435
02:31:55,651 --> 02:31:56,210
It's like,

3436
02:31:56,210 --> 02:31:57,220
and what do you see there?

3437
02:31:57,221 --> 02:32:00,390
It's dying and resurrecting
hero fights is satanic.

3438
02:32:00,391 --> 02:32:04,200
Figure and attains final victory
through death and resurrection.

3439
02:32:04,670 --> 02:32:05,503
So like,

3440
02:32:06,000 --> 02:32:06,211
you know,

3441
02:32:06,211 --> 02:32:08,850
and it wasn't contrived
that came out of the story.

3442
02:32:09,510 --> 02:32:10,343
And so

3443
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:15,240
the mythologies seeps in no matter what.

3444
02:32:15,340 --> 02:32:16,173
And it's,

3445
02:32:16,260 --> 02:32:16,741
I think,

3446
02:32:16,741 --> 02:32:18,240
and this is something I learned from you,

3447
02:32:18,270 --> 02:32:20,460
is that it's time for us to understand it.

3448
02:32:21,480 --> 02:32:24,720
We can't just live by it
unconsciously anymore.

3449
02:32:24,970 --> 02:32:27,900
We have to understand that
as well as living by it.

3450
02:32:28,530 --> 02:32:30,930
And that's the task of the 21st century.

3451
02:32:31,200 --> 02:32:32,460
That's what it looks like to me.

3452
02:32:33,300 --> 02:32:34,980
So if we understand it,

3453
02:32:34,981 --> 02:32:39,090
then maybe we can fortify ourself
against collectivist ideology,

3454
02:32:39,091 --> 02:32:39,924
for example.

3455
02:32:39,930 --> 02:32:42,390
I'm hoping because that's a bad pathway.

3456
02:32:43,050 --> 02:32:48,050
So you were able to turn that question
into a very good final words somehow.

3457
02:32:48,570 --> 02:32:49,050
Good.

3458
02:32:49,050 --> 02:32:50,160
So thank you.

3459
02:32:50,161 --> 02:32:50,971
Thank you very much.

3460
02:32:50,971 --> 02:32:53,130
Thank

3461
02:32:53,140 --> 02:32:53,350
you.
