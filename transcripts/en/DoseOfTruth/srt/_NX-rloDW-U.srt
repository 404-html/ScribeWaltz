1
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:11,980
Jobs are just disappearing.
Now let's ask the question.

2
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:15,580
Is there anything that could be done
about that?

3
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,810
Well,
your Western society is tried very hard

4
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:24,811
with a number of environmental
environmentally based interventions,

5
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:30,450
early childhood education.
By the way that you said the.

6
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:34,540
The literature in organizational
psychology is very clear.

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:39,040
The winter jury is equally clear in
educational psychology.

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,410
Oh yeah.
Well the relationship between Iq and

9
00:00:41,411 --> 00:00:45,430
learning is more powerful than the
relationship between Iq job performance,

10
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:48,550
that that's right,
which is kind of common sense or matches

11
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:50,480
are common sense,
but you know,

12
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,560
if you put a bunch of variables into a
regression equation to predict academic

13
00:00:55,871 --> 00:01:00,871
achievement and you have all these
variables and teacher quality variables

14
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:06,211
and cognitive variables of the students
and what you find is the teacher

15
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,720
variables and the quality of the school
variables to gather barely account for

16
00:01:13,661 --> 00:01:16,090
10 percent and I know,
I know.

17
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,500
It's terrible.
It was terrible.

18
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:20,270
You know what I told?
He's the guy who ran admissions at

19
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:21,920
Harvard.
I taught at Harvard for a while.

20
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:24,410
His name was dean with law and he is a
really smart guy.

21
00:01:24,411 --> 00:01:26,300
I really liked the,
and you know,

22
00:01:26,301 --> 00:01:29,480
he was,
let's say he was on the right side of

23
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:33,740
the human race and he was really trying
to figure out how to run the admissions

24
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:37,730
policy at Harvard so that it did the
best for everyone concerned and he had

25
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:41,150
run an interesting series of analysis
that I don't believe he ever published.

26
00:01:41,151 --> 00:01:45,320
And one of them was um,
well let's say you segregate the Harvard

27
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:48,110
population into the relatively low Iq
kids.

28
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:51,330
So maybe they only have an Iq of 130,
you know,

29
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,310
and the relatively high Iq kids who were
pushing up towards 160.

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:02:00,730
So you are two competing hypotheses.
Fair one would be that the lower Iq kids

31
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,150
come to Harvard,
this remarkable environment and they,

32
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,500
and they and they,
they thrive because of the high

33
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:14,501
educational quality so well that they
close the gap between them and the one

34
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:16,760
60 kids.
And that's just completely,

35
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,520
completely wrong.
What happens is you put both those

36
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,440
groups,
they're both very,

37
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,680
very highly selected,
but some,

38
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,723
you know,
in this,

39
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,910
in a sort of superman rage
intellectually.

40
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:31,100
And what happens is the gap just gets
bigger and bigger as they progress

41
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:34,970
through university.
And it's a dreaded example of that,

42
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:37,550
uh,
matthew principle that the economists

43
00:02:37,551 --> 00:02:41,480
talk about,
which is no to those who have more will

44
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:43,270
be given.
And from those who have nothing,

45
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:44,420
everything will be taken.
