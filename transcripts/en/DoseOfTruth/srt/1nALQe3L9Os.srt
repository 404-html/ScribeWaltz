1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,240
After the big ideas thing,
a act came into my classes and tape maps

2
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:16,820
of meaning and made 1330 minutes,
uh,

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,770
TV shows out of them.
And that was pretty interesting.

4
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:24,300
And they were broadcast and kind of
evanescent because at that point they

5
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,340
weren't put on the web.
So they're broadcast,

6
00:00:26,341 --> 00:00:27,740
they pretty much disappear.
Right.

7
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:30,930
And um,
so,

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:31,920
so,
so,

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,880
so fine.
So,

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,260
and I got some degree of,
what would you say I got?

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:40,980
I was exposed,
my ideas were exposed to a large number

12
00:00:40,981 --> 00:00:42,930
of people,
tens of thousands of people as a

13
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,780
consequence of that.
And that seemed to go pretty well.

14
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,660
And so then youtube came along and I
thought,

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,990
well,
I don't know what this is,

16
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:54,460
this youtube thing,
you know,

17
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:59,730
the comments section makes you like,
what would you say wary about being

18
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,920
human?
I would say generally speaking,

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,110
and you know,
there was a lot of,

20
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:09,090
well there were a lot of things that it
would be easy to be contemptuous of on

21
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:12,330
Youtube,
like the canonical cute cat videos.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:17,280
But I'm actually not so contemptuous of
that or the interesting animal videos

23
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:21,090
because I think they actually speak to a
part of people that's actually quite

24
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:22,440
good.
We like cats,

25
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:24,600
we like dogs,
we think animals are kind of cool.

26
00:01:24,601 --> 00:01:26,430
And you know,
we take a break and look at,

27
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:30,240
look at something that's pleasant and
cute and maybe that's not so bad.

28
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:33,540
It's not serious,
but it's certainly not malevolent.

29
00:01:33,541 --> 00:01:36,840
And that's something.
So I thought,

30
00:01:36,841 --> 00:01:39,780
okay,
well I'll find these old videos I did

31
00:01:39,781 --> 00:01:44,310
for Tvo and I'll put them up on youtube
and maybe I'll just take my classes.

32
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:47,760
And so I set up because I have this
theory that if it's worth doing,

33
00:01:47,761 --> 00:01:50,340
it's worth doing badly.
Which you know,

34
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,010
it's true,
but it's also true that if it's worth

35
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:54,210
doing,
it's worth doing well.

36
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,330
You just need to know when to apply
those two principles.

37
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:01,050
And if you're loath to do something and
procrastinating,

38
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,910
then sometimes it's better to do it
badly.

39
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:05,130
And I thought,
well I can't get a whole production

40
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:07,920
studio up and running and cause I just
don't have the time.

41
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:12,921
I'll get an IPAD and learn to use it.
And get an level ear mic and just set

42
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,720
the thing up or maybe have a student
film it.

43
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:20,721
And so I did that for a couple of years
for my personality class in this maps of

44
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:23,240
meaning class,
which is the class where I outlined this

45
00:02:23,241 --> 00:02:25,200
sorts of ideas that I just described to
you.

46
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:26,880
And,
uh,

47
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,880
last April I noticed that I'd had a
million views and about 15,000

48
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:33,210
subscribers,
you know,

49
00:02:33,211 --> 00:02:34,980
and I thought,
Huh,

50
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,570
million views,
hey,

51
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,780
that's an actually a lot of views.
It's like if I,

52
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,020
I've never write a scientific paper
that's been read a million times,

53
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,360
no one has,
that just never happens.

54
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,550
Right.
That's happened zero times.

55
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:50,250
If it,
if you have a paper that's cited,

56
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,990
you know,
someone else refers to it and one of

57
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,450
their scientific papers a hundred times,
it's like,

58
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,720
that's a home run and a thousand times
is a miracle.

59
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,100
So,
and then if you write a book,

60
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:00,641
you know,
there's,

61
00:03:00,641 --> 00:03:03,580
I think 1.2 million books published last
year,

62
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,090
something like that.
And I think 500 of them sold more than a

63
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:09,820
hundred thousand copies.
So that's a sea of books,

64
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:10,141
right?
It's,

65
00:03:10,141 --> 00:03:14,580
it's an ocean of books and all of them
fail really.

66
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:16,240
So,
so many of them fail that you might as

67
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:19,930
well never write a book because the
probability that it will fail is like

68
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:24,190
99.99%.
And that would be very depressing if it

69
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:27,490
wasn't the case that that's the case for
anything creative you ever do.

70
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,700
So it's just baseline probability.
But I thought,

71
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:32,380
well,
if I wrote a book and it sold a million

72
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:33,071
copies,
man,

73
00:03:33,071 --> 00:03:34,600
I'd be out dancing in the street.

74
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,100
Uh,
probably not.

75
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,080
But you know,
you get the idea.

76
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,230
So what does it mean to have a million
youtube views?

77
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,970
Well,
who the hell knows?

78
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,163
Right?
I mean,

79
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,060
we don't have metrics for that.
We don't know what sort of influence

80
00:03:47,061 --> 00:03:49,180
that's having.
We don't know anything about that.

81
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,220
We don't know whether we should take it
seriously or,

82
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,220
or if it's or who you're talking to or
anything.

83
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,540
But I thought,
well,

84
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,930
still it's a million then that's a lot.
And I thought,

85
00:03:58,931 --> 00:03:59,860
well,
maybe this is,

86
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:04,150
this is more serious thing than I
initially envisioned.

87
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,380
And then I really thought about it and I
thought,

88
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:08,890
okay,

89
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,090
oh,
I get it.

90
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,670
Here's a hypothesis.
You know,

91
00:04:12,671 --> 00:04:16,870
back in the medieval times and before if
you wanted to book someone had to copy

92
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:20,110
it by hand.
And so there weren't any books and they

93
00:04:20,111 --> 00:04:21,700
were very expensive.
And so,

94
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,630
and then Gutenberg came along and
invented the movable type press and it

95
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:28,960
was like poof.
Books were inexpensive and everybody

96
00:04:28,961 --> 00:04:31,450
could have them and not like was that
was a major revolution,

97
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:33,100
right?
It within 400 years,

98
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,730
almost everyone in the western world and
then very rapidly,

99
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:39,400
almost everyone in the entire world was
literate.

100
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,300
He could read silently even,
which was something that before that was

101
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:46,660
reserved for a very small number of
people because most people read out loud

102
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,110
when they read it all.
So that was a massive revolution.

103
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:52,960
And then I thought,
wait a minute,

104
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:57,961
maybe youtube is a Gutenberg revolution
because it allows the spoken word to

105
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:03,220
have the same reach and longevity as a
book

106
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,570
for the first time in human history,
spontaneous speeches can reach an

107
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:15,331
infinite audience for eye for an
unspecified duration of time.

108
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:17,110
Well,
that's a whole new thing.

109
00:05:17,111 --> 00:05:19,120
That's a,
that's an entirely new thing.

110
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:23,440
And maybe it's easier for people to
listen than it is for them to read.

111
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,371
You know?
I mean,

112
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:27,490
I'd rather read than listen cause I can
read way faster than I can listen.

113
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:31,320
But people will listen to a youtube
video at twice the normal speed,

114
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,790
sometimes more.
So you can circumvent that.

115
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:38,791
And then also with a youtube video,
if you convert it into a podcast,

116
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:40,540
let's say,
which I'll get to to a moment,

117
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,310
you all of a sudden have way more time
than you used to have because you can

118
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:48,340
listen to a podcast while you're doing
other things.

119
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,190
So you can do mundane,
the mundane things that you have to do

120
00:05:51,191 --> 00:05:53,500
from day to day,
like commute and so on.

121
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,070
But you can listen to a podcast.
And I've found that my,

122
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,330
my young students are now listening to
podcasts instead of music.

123
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,430
And that's really something,
you know,

124
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:07,370
because music of course,
it's been an unbelievably dynamic

125
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:12,371
cultural force for maybe the,
the primary artistic cultural force for

126
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,360
what maybe maybe since the 1950s
anyways.

127
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,900
And that's being supplanted to some
degree by podcasts.

128
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,600
And that's really something.
And then it also turns out that people

129
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:28,601
have an appetite for long,
detailed podcasts that are deep and

130
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,560
informative.
It's like,

131
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:32,810
who the hell would've guessed that?
Like no one.

132
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,660
It's it.
It just sorta came out of nowhere.

133
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,131
And so I thought,
well,

134
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:39,110
maybe this is worth taking seriously.
