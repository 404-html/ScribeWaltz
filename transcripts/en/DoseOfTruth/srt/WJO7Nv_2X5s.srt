1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:03,670
I'll turn to the story.

2
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:06,270
So the first problem,

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,021
as I mentioned,

4
00:00:07,021 --> 00:00:08,850
is a complexity problem.

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,670
Things are just too complicated to get a
handle on and that actually has serious

6
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:18,480
consequences because what happens to
everyone eventually is that their lives

7
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:20,190
become so complicated that they die.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,290
So and that and that and many terrible
things can happen to you on the way to

9
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:29,430
dying as well that are
complex complexity related,

10
00:00:29,431 --> 00:00:29,731
right?

11
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:32,220
You can develop a serious illness
that you can't get a handle on.

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,330
You can hit a,

13
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,223
uh,

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,820
what would you call an impasse in your
relationship that you cannot get past and

15
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:39,121
see?

16
00:00:39,121 --> 00:00:41,820
No way out of that happens
to people quite frequently.

17
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,290
People who are suicidal,

18
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:43,891
for example,

19
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:46,290
they often feel like they've
been backed into a corner,

20
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,780
that they have no options,

21
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:49,800
they have no good options,

22
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,180
no matter which way they turn.

23
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,510
There's something terrible to face
and they can't see any way out of it.

24
00:00:55,110 --> 00:01:00,110
And sometimes that's more true than you'd
like to think because we also tend to

25
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,750
like to think that people's problems
are primarily psychological,

26
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,020
but they're not not.

27
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,000
That's one thing you learned quite
rapidly as a clinician is that most of the

28
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:11,250
time people don't come to you
because they have mental illness.

29
00:01:11,251 --> 00:01:13,920
They come to you because they have
a complexity management problem.

30
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,390
Their lives have got out of hand on
them and they don't know how to get them

31
00:01:18,391 --> 00:01:19,560
back under control.

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:22,200
And so all sorts of things can do that.

33
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:24,320
And then of course that can
make you anxious or depressed.

34
00:01:24,321 --> 00:01:25,860
It can trigger all sorts of illnesses,

35
00:01:25,861 --> 00:01:30,861
but the fundamental problem is still
that things have got beyond you and that

36
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:35,130
actually has a psychophysiological
costs that isn't merely psychological.

37
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,910
You have a limited
amount of capacity from,

38
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,300
from,

39
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,900
from a resource perspective to
deal with emergent complexity.

40
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:43,981
You just,

41
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,180
it's just not enough of you.

42
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,043
You just,

43
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,711
you'll,

44
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:51,711
you'll exhaust your psychophysiological
resources if you get into a situation

45
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,100
that's too complex.

46
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:56,030
Well that's what this,

47
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,110
that's what the idea of chaos represents.

48
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,770
It represents that underlying complexity
that can manifest itself at any time.

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,360
And it can manifest itself.

50
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:03,931
For example,

51
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:04,764
if you're,

52
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,600
if you wake up in the
morning and you know,

53
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,760
you feel an ache of some sort and
perhaps it's nothing and you ignore it,

54
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:16,020
but it gets worse and you end up going
to the hospital and you find out perhaps

55
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:17,131
for example,

56
00:02:17,131 --> 00:02:20,100
that you have pancreatic cancer and
you're going to live for six months.

57
00:02:20,101 --> 00:02:21,270
And that's the end of that.

58
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,590
And so it's,

59
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,370
it's,

60
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,940
it's,

61
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,750
it's at that moment that you break through
the thin ice that everyone walks on

62
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:31,740
and you see what's underneath and
what's underneath is the ineradicable

63
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,240
complexity of life.

64
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,130
And that's chaos.

65
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:38,640
That's now it's taken people a long,

66
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:43,641
long time to get a grip
on this conceptuals,

67
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,451
what would you call it?

68
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,710
Conceptual Schema.

69
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:48,870
And,

70
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,950
and human beings have done it mostly
with image and story before they've been

71
00:02:52,951 --> 00:02:54,990
able to do it in any articulated manner.

72
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,100
And so there are a set of images
that represent this underlying chaos.

73
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,680
And one of them is the
dragon of chaos that,

74
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:03,670
that precisely,

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,910
that that's the dragon that
the hero goes out to confront.

76
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,350
That's the symbol of the unknown.

77
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,000
It's the thing that lurks underneath.

78
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:13,240
It's the thing that also guards
treasured because in the unknown there's

79
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:15,290
possibility also the,

80
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:15,920
the,

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,890
the water that was there,

82
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,170
we talked about in the
Mesopotamian creation myth,

83
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,330
the water that's there at the beginning,

84
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,470
um,

85
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:27,450
both the salt and the fresh water
is often a symbol of pre cosmo,

86
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:28,330
Garnett chaos.

87
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,290
Um,

88
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,550
often people have dreams.

89
00:03:30,551 --> 00:03:31,300
For example,

90
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,400
some of you have had this dream,

91
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,890
I suspect you'll dream that you're
in a house that you know well,

92
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:39,850
and all of a sudden you discover a new
room or a set of new rooms or maybe a set

93
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,830
of rooms in the basement
and often the rooms are,

94
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,420
are,

95
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,950
are not well organized
and they're full of water.

96
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,450
Those are very common things.

97
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:51,040
And what that means is that you've
broken through the constraints of your

98
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,840
conscious self understanding
to a new domain of,

99
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,090
of possibility,

100
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:00,790
but a new domain that needs
a tremendous amount of work.

101
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:01,211
It says,

102
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:01,331
well,

103
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,320
here's the new part of you,

104
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:04,090
but it's not well developed.

105
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:04,650
Theirs,

106
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,110
theirs,

107
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:05,943
it's flooded.

108
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,930
It's flooded with chaos essentially.

109
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,280
And it's water.

110
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:14,281
I think partly because chaos is not
only what you fall into when you're not

111
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:15,101
expecting it,

112
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:19,210
but it's also the unknown
that you confront forthrightly
and generate new things

113
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:19,571
out of.

114
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:21,040
And water is a symbol of life,

115
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:22,170
especially in the desert.

116
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:22,721
And of course,

117
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:24,820
water life is dependent on water,

118
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:29,821
and so water's a natural symbol to utilize
when you're talking about something

119
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,441
that's life giving,

120
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:33,970
but also potentially deadly,

121
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,350
cause a little bit of water.

122
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:36,281
Well that's a drink,

123
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,091
but a lot of water,

124
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:37,990
that's a shipwreck.
