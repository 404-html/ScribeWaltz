1
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:11,470
Now this occurrence is extending
over a protracted period of time.

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,510
And as the elder gods are threatened,

3
00:00:13,511 --> 00:00:16,720
they're also breeding and
mating and producing new forms,

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,070
and they produce a great,

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:20,470
great grandson whose name is Marta.

6
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:20,891
Now,

7
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,380
Marta has a lot of very
interesting attributes.

8
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,010
The attributes are described in the
Enuma Elish in the following manner.

9
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:32,011
So this is what Mark's father sees
when his wife Damn Kina gives birth to

10
00:00:32,441 --> 00:00:33,274
Marduk.

11
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:34,540
So when he,

12
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:36,400
who's Marnix father saw his son,

13
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:37,540
he rejoiced,

14
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:38,350
he beamed,

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,270
his heart was filled with joy.

16
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:45,760
He distinguished him and conferred
upon him double equality with the gods.

17
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:46,001
Okay,

18
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,690
so that's the first indication that
whatever Martech represents is something

19
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:53,620
that's elevated beyond the normal
status of a primordial density,

20
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:59,020
so that he was highly
exalted and surpassed them in
everything artfully arranged

21
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:00,040
beyond comprehension,

22
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,890
where his members not fit
for human understanding,

23
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,830
hard to look upon for his eyes,

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,350
forward his ears when his lips move,

25
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:09,790
fire blazed forth.

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,650
Each of his four years grew large and
likewise his eyes to see everything he was

27
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:17,680
exalted among God's
surpassing was his form.

28
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,540
His members were gigantic.

29
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,190
He was surpassing in height.

30
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,191
Mary Youtube,

31
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:23,980
Mary you to one of his names,

32
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,120
son of the son,

33
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:26,260
God the son,

34
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:27,460
God of the Gods.

35
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,680
Okay.

36
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,150
Complex bit of poetry.

37
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:32,380
It says a bunch of things.

38
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:32,801
It says,

39
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:33,340
well,

40
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,670
whatever Martech is is
the offspring of the gods.

41
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:41,320
Whatever Marta is is characterized
by heightened awareness,

42
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:41,531
right?

43
00:01:41,531 --> 00:01:43,690
Because he has four years and
four eyes and they're large.

44
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,090
Whatever Martech is characterized by as
the status that surpasses that of his

45
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:49,924
father's.

46
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,880
Whatever he's characterized by is
associated with the power of speech,

47
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:55,541
real power.

48
00:01:55,541 --> 00:01:57,520
Because when he speaks fire spurts,

49
00:01:57,521 --> 00:02:00,190
fourth mark is also huge.

50
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,360
But more importantly,

51
00:02:01,361 --> 00:02:04,090
he's associated in this
particular poem with the Sun.

52
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:05,470
Why is that?

53
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:05,801
Well,

54
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:07,390
the sun dominates consciousness,

55
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:07,690
right?

56
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,400
Because we're conscious during the day.

57
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,070
Most of our brain is visual cortex.

58
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,630
So we're visual creatures.

59
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,320
So when the sun rises
is when the day begins.

60
00:02:17,321 --> 00:02:19,690
So martech is also
associated with whatever.

61
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:21,280
Danny dominates the day,

62
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,050
and that's the daddy of consciousness.

63
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:25,210
And there's more to the story of the Sun,

64
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,540
right?

65
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,930
Because the sun is also something
that rises and sets repeatedly.

66
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:33,820
And that means that the daddy
that dominates consciousness
is characterized by a

67
00:02:33,821 --> 00:02:35,080
cyclical nature.

68
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,861
That's a son.

69
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:36,640
Myth.

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,050
Sunrises in the morning,

71
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,520
renewed as a consequence of fighting a
terrible battle in the night with the

72
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:45,190
enemies of everything that's
associated with consciousness.

73
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,840
A Classic Solar Myth.

74
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:56,440
So absolute entire Matt give
rise to the world of the gods,

75
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:02,160
the activity of the world of Gods
reawakens tie amat she decides to destroy

76
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,454
everything,

77
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,200
but at that moment,

78
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,860
the gods give birth to Marduk.

79
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:08,231
Now,

80
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,430
that's a typical Motif,

81
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:13,030
which is that the hero's always
born at the time of maximal crisis.

82
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,170
And the reason for that is,

83
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,004
in part,

84
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,963
it's simple.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,690
Look,

86
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:21,040
if your culture is dealing well with
the forces of the unknown so that

87
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:22,330
everything is static,

88
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:23,021
static,

89
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:24,100
but productive,

90
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,740
so that problems themselves don't arise,

91
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,180
there's no reason for the hero,

92
00:03:28,181 --> 00:03:28,421
right?

93
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,040
There's no reason to confront the unknown.

94
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,640
It's only when crisis backends that
the birth of the hero is necessary.

95
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,110
Marduk constitutes the birth of the hero.
