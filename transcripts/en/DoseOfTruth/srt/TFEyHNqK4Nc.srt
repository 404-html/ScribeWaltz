1
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,370
Like I've often thought of rep
of marriage as a wrestling match,

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:10,910
right?

3
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:11,601
If you're lucky,

4
00:00:11,601 --> 00:00:14,180
the person that you marry
is someone you contend with.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,470
It's not exactly,

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't think it's exactly,

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,620
it's not tranquil.

8
00:00:18,621 --> 00:00:19,454
Precisely.

9
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,020
You know,

10
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,190
you might have noticed
that some of you and,

11
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,590
but,

12
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,680
but the thing is if you have
something to contend against,

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,230
then that strengthens you and,

14
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,070
and that's actually better than
having nothing to contend against.

15
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:39,071
And so Jacob is the person who's also
strengthened by the necessity of this

16
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:44,870
contending and that that seems to be
the proper relationship with God or the

17
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:47,720
angel is that contending the battling,

18
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:48,440
right.

19
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,250
Rather than some sort of kind of loose,

20
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,040
weak statement of belief.

21
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,151
I mean,

22
00:00:56,151 --> 00:00:58,310
I'm not trying to denigrate
that to any great degree.

23
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:01,700
It just doesn't seem like the
right motive conceptualization,

24
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:01,911
right?

25
00:01:01,911 --> 00:01:03,020
Because human beings aren't,

26
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,910
aren't like that were
contentious creatures.

27
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,510
And that's actually seems to be something
that meets with God's favor in this

28
00:01:11,511 --> 00:01:12,141
situation.

29
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:16,400
So especially given that that's actually
what he names the while the whole

30
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:21,401
kingdom of the chosen people is the idea
is that that's composed of those who

31
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,360
contend with God.

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,740
So that's,

33
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:27,170
that's a hell of an idea
that that's for sure.
