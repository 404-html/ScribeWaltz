1
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,960
I'm fascinated by the idea of faith,

2
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:11,520
what faith means.

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:12,060
Uh,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,120
Jacob listens to a voice and believes it.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,433
Um,

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,020
he probably heard other voices.

7
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:21,840
Why did he believe this one?

8
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,740
Um,

9
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,573
why,

10
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:24,240
what,

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,240
there must have been an a priori sort of
functional necessity for him to believe

12
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:34,350
the voice that told him
one thing or another.

13
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:34,780
And,

14
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,980
and I think that that's a string that
runs through the Bible and then through

15
00:00:37,981 --> 00:00:38,850
the New Testament,

16
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:39,301
I'm,

17
00:00:39,301 --> 00:00:40,860
we are expected as well.

18
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,510
I confess I'm a Christian,

19
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:42,960
I'm,

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,880
I act like I believe God is real.

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:45,750
And,

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:50,250
and so there is this a
call of faith and also the,

23
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:52,800
in every hero's story we,

24
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,830
we see now there is always a moment in
that story where the hero must believe

25
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,830
something beyond the
evidence that is before them,

26
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:03,570
which is to say they must
take a leap of faith.

27
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,560
So I'm wondering if you could just kind
of unpack that experience of faith and

28
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:12,030
the understanding of how a human being
makes the choice to believe one thing or

29
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:12,750
another.

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,111
God,

31
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,250
that's a great question.

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,000
I mean,

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,833
I,

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,830
is this still on,

35
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,040
is this still working?

36
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,940
Good.

37
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:21,420
Okay.

38
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:21,721
Okay,

39
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:22,410
good.

40
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:23,243
Um,

41
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,233
I don't,

42
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,980
I don't precisely know the answer that
it's a very peculiar thing because we

43
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:30,090
think many things,

44
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:35,091
or you could say many voices appear in
our minds because when Nisha took day

45
00:01:35,821 --> 00:01:36,181
cards,

46
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:38,160
I think therefore I am
a part can you said,

47
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:38,311
well,

48
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:40,110
it isn't so obvious that there's an eye,

49
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,840
first of all that it's a unity,

50
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,020
like a not our tra unity
transparent unto itself,

51
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:49,800
which of course the psychoanalysts
picked up in a big way and then he wasn't

52
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,520
sure that it was the eye who
thought in some causal manner.

53
00:01:53,521 --> 00:01:53,851
He said,

54
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:54,241
well no,

55
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,830
it's more like thoughts.

56
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,180
It's something like thoughts appear in
the phenomenal field and maybe you choose

57
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:01,950
between the more maybe they possess you.

58
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,720
Like there's lots of other
ways of thinking about it.

59
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,110
It isn't exactly obvious to me why we
choose to take one pathway rather than

60
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:14,391
another when so many of them
could offer themselves to us.

61
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:15,180
You know,

62
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,630
people tend to talk about that
as something like conscience,

63
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:19,820
right?

64
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,990
And now maybe it's that

65
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,920
it's got to have something to do.

66
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:34,921
I think it's an endless regress
because you can always ask why the,

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,960
why any assumption became primary.

68
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,270
But I'll put that aside for a moment.

69
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:44,050
It seems to me to have
something to do with your aims.

70
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:45,820
You know,

71
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:50,820
that you're more likely to listen to a
voice that is in keeping with your most

72
00:02:51,701 --> 00:02:52,960
fundamental aims.

73
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:54,670
And then the question is,

74
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,830
where do your most
fundamental aims come from?

75
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:58,930
And from what I've been
able to determine it,

76
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,760
I'll speak psychologically again,

77
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,800
is that to begin with,

78
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:07,690
you're a con can't tonation of rather
primitive subpersonalities Hungary,

79
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:10,780
one's tired ones upset
one's laughing ones.

80
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,950
You can see that in babies,

81
00:03:11,951 --> 00:03:12,130
you know,

82
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,110
they cycle through those
states very rapidly.

83
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,183
There's a,

84
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:16,200
uh,

85
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,640
infantile unity above all that,

86
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:19,960
but it doesn't have control,

87
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,853
right?

88
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,720
And so then the developing individual
has to figure out how to integrate those

89
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,490
primitive subpersonalities
into a unified personality.

90
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,440
At the same time,

91
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:36,640
they integrate the unified
personality into a social unity.

92
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,260
So it's partly individual integration,

93
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,600
but it's fed by social forces.

94
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:46,840
I mean even when you watch
an infant breastfeed,

95
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:51,790
it's established a relationship with its
mother and there's a reciprocity that's

96
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,200
already at play there.

97
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,800
So then that underlying multiplicities
starts to form itself into a unity.

98
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,580
And then the question,

99
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:04,810
and I would say that's something like
that's something like the emergence of

100
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:05,540
the,

101
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:06,820
the individual out of,

102
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,310
out of the the titans.

103
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,320
That's a reasonable way
of thinking about it.

104
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,720
Like a sovereign out of the titans.

105
00:04:13,721 --> 00:04:14,710
It's something like that.

106
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:20,610
But then there's another division which
seems to me to parallel parallel the the

107
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,030
cane enabled division.

108
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:25,780
It's that that integration can be oriented
towards something that's positive,

109
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:30,460
but it can also be oriented towards
something that's negative and that's the

110
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:33,010
split of the world into
good and evil I think.

111
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:37,240
And then it looks like you're navigating
between those and I can only account

112
00:04:37,241 --> 00:04:39,010
for that with something like choice,

113
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,330
like I think the free choice,

114
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,850
even though I don't understand it,

115
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,010
I'm unwilling to deny the existence
of free choice merely because I don't

116
00:04:48,011 --> 00:04:52,870
understand it because it looks
to me like that's how people act.

117
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:54,370
That's how the expect to be treated.

118
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,050
And that societies who,

119
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:00,160
that that structure themselves
in accordance with the
idea that people have free

120
00:05:00,161 --> 00:05:01,960
choice actually work.

121
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:04,330
Now that doesn't prove
that there's free choice,

122
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:06,190
but people have been
arguing about that forever.

123
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,024
So,

124
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,231
but it looks to me,

125
00:05:08,231 --> 00:05:10,930
so those are two possible
means of integration.

126
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:15,640
And then I think what you're doing is
feeding one or the other constantly.

127
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,510
And I think you probably
choose which one to feed.

128
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,190
I think that's,

129
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,920
and I mean that's how it
feels that way to me as well.

130
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,180
Like when I look at my own,

131
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,633
you know,

132
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,740
maybe you're really
aggravated with something,

133
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,450
maybe you're aggravated with your wife,

134
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:32,284
you know,

135
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:32,981
or or,

136
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,720
or your child or something like that,

137
00:05:34,721 --> 00:05:35,260
you know,

138
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:40,260
and you're feeling kind of nasty and
maybe even know that you're in the wrong

139
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,890
and an idea comes into your head.

140
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,420
You think I could say that.

141
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:44,861
And you know,

142
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:46,930
you could say it and you
know what it would do,

143
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,940
but then you pause and you think,

144
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,210
would that make it better or worse?

145
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:53,770
And then maybe you go to hell with it,

146
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,690
which is quite the thing to say.

147
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:57,860
I've got a little story about in a minute,

148
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,990
and then you say it,

149
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,190
but you knew,

150
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,130
you knew that you took the low road,

151
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,993
right?

152
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,900
And you know it,

153
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,790
and then you're guilty
about that and defensive.

154
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:10,900
And that makes the fight way worse because
then there's no damn way you're going

155
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:12,890
to admit that you actually did that.

156
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,780
And so things do go to hell.

157
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:16,003
And so,

158
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,551
so here's,

159
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:17,870
here's an ugly little idea.

160
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:19,780
So that's,

161
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:20,450
that's,

162
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,490
that's relevant to the question.

163
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,940
So imagine you're playing
around with cocaine.

164
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,410
Now I'm using cocaine
because it's very addictive,

165
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:34,280
but it's a very interesting chemical
because it's a dopaminergic agonist.

166
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:35,330
And what,

167
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,550
what dopamine does is two things.

168
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:40,040
It makes you feel like what
you're doing is worthwhile,

169
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:45,050
but it also imagine that there's a bunch
of neural circuits that are active and

170
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,840
then they get a hit of dopamine or you do,

171
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,600
then those neurocircuits get
a little bit more powerful.

172
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:51,711
Okay?

173
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,240
So it,

174
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,500
it has a rewarding property,

175
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:58,580
which is that it makes you feel like what
you're doing is important and it has a

176
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:59,780
reinforcing property,

177
00:06:59,781 --> 00:07:00,081
which is,

178
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:02,450
it makes neurocircuits growth.

179
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,970
So now what that means is that

180
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,130
whatever you were doing just
before you took cocaine grows.

181
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:11,751
Okay?

182
00:07:11,751 --> 00:07:15,170
So now imagine there's a
bunch of different things
that you do just before you

183
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:16,010
take cocaine,

184
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,590
but there's a string of decisions.

185
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:23,260
And it one decision point is the same
for all of those difference occurrences.

186
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,120
And that decision point is because
you know you're in trouble.

187
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,040
And that decision point is well,

188
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:28,910
to hell with it.

189
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:30,681
Okay?

190
00:07:30,681 --> 00:07:35,420
So then you think that each of the
200 times that you take cocaine,

191
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:36,980
even though you do it in different places,

192
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,800
but that one thought
is there all the time.

193
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:44,360
And that thing grows because
you're reinforcing it and
it grows and it grows and

194
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:45,140
it grows.

195
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,310
And so now that's in you.

196
00:07:46,311 --> 00:07:46,610
Let's,

197
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:47,480
that's part of you.

198
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,150
And it's the thing that
says to hell with it.

199
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,261
Okay,

200
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:52,094
so now,

201
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,820
and maybe that's not such a good
thing to grow inside your brain.

202
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,500
So then you,

203
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,530
you're addicted and they take you
to a cocaine treatment center.

204
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:01,670
And after a week,

205
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:02,900
you're no longer physically,

206
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,520
physiologically addicted.

207
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,750
You're not craving.

208
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,960
You don't have a problem
as long as you're there.

209
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:13,310
But then they take you back to your normal
environment and you see like cocaine,

210
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,701
Joe,

211
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:14,534
your friend.

212
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,210
And as soon as you see him up,

213
00:08:17,211 --> 00:08:18,170
that thing comes in,

214
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:18,531
Bang,

215
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:19,490
you're back on the,

216
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:23,120
you're back on the to hell with the track.

217
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,400
And that's where you're in,

218
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:29,950
where you will end up too if you
reinforce that particular perspective long

219
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,190
enough.

220
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,610
So that's a,

221
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:33,810
in a sense to the,

222
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:35,270
this decision making process.

223
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:35,930
You know,

224
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,590
if you,

225
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,060
if you take the low road,

226
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:43,130
then that winds and it gets a little
stronger because everything that wins

227
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,400
neurologically gets a little stronger.

228
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,960
It's like a Darwinian competition.

229
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:53,260
So one rule is don't practice what you
don't want to become because you really

230
00:08:53,271 --> 00:08:54,500
do become that.

231
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,170
It builds,

232
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,930
it builds itself right into
your neural architecture.

233
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,390
And that's one of the terrifying
things about addiction,

234
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:00,601
you know,

235
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:01,081
because you think,

236
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:01,470
well,

237
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,580
it's kind of psychological.

238
00:09:02,581 --> 00:09:03,300
It's like,

239
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:03,571
yeah,

240
00:09:03,571 --> 00:09:04,404
kind of.

241
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,360
It's also kind of neurophysiological and
you build a one eyed cocaine monster in

242
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:13,650
your head if you hit yourself enough
with something that reinforcing.
