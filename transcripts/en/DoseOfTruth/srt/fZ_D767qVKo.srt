1
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,060
If you plan on doing meetups with more
intellectuals like Timmy Olin and Sam

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:12,061
Harris,

3
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:13,050
who would be your pick?

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,930
MMM,

5
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,060
well I'm going to meet Jonathan Heit.

6
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,923
That'll be good.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:19,490
I really admire his work.

8
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:20,960
I think he's a really good guy.

9
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:22,760
So I'm looking forward to talking to him.

10
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,210
I'd like to talk to Thomas
Soul I or I think it's so,

11
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,100
I think that would be interesting.

12
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,483
MMM.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:31,431
The rest of it.

14
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:32,780
I have to think more about that.

15
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:33,614
I mean,

16
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,800
but those are two that I would
definitely like to talk to you.

17
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,630
I'm going to speak with Jocko Willink.

18
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:39,620
I think I mentioned that.

19
00:00:39,621 --> 00:00:40,880
So that might be interesting.

20
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:42,603
MMM.

21
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,970
Will there be a third
talk with Sam Harris?

22
00:00:44,971 --> 00:00:48,690
Maybe this time with Sam as you gay your
guest and you taking your gloves off.

23
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,930
I don't have any plans
for a third talk with Sam.

24
00:00:51,931 --> 00:00:53,160
I wouldn't be opposed to it,

25
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:54,030
although I think we,

26
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,050
I think we've probably got about as far
as we were going to get in or a second

27
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:58,561
discussion.

28
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:01,590
I think the two discussions
together actually worked quite well.

29
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:02,933
Um,

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,633
so I think,

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,833
I think,

32
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,610
and this is no,

33
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:09,600
um,

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,700
I'm not saying this in any negative way,

35
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,500
but I think a third discussion might be,

36
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,720
might be beating a dead horse.

37
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:16,920
Um,

38
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,753
and

39
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,481
like,

40
00:01:18,481 --> 00:01:21,830
I'm not interested in particularly
in putting Sam on the spot and,

41
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:22,813
and,

42
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,161
you know,

43
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:25,410
and it's also possible that
he would put me on the spot.

44
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:27,790
It isn't necessarily the guy
would come out victorious,

45
00:01:27,791 --> 00:01:28,624
so to speak.

46
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:29,041
I mean,

47
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:31,170
he's a very sharp guy and there's many,

48
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:31,860
you know,

49
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,440
compelling arguments to be
made in favor of atheism,

50
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,240
even though I think that overall it's,

51
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,470
it's,

52
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:38,070
it's,

53
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,470
it's a stance that lacks,

54
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,130
I don't think it contends
with its opponent fairly,

55
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:49,110
because I don't think that the atheist
community in general takes the thought of

56
00:01:49,111 --> 00:01:50,670
serious religious thinkers.

57
00:01:50,671 --> 00:01:51,301
Seriously.

58
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:52,800
I think they tend to Straw man.
