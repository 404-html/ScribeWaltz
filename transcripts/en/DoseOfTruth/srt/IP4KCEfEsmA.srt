00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:11,670
I wrote a book from 1984 to 1999 called
maps of meaning and a lot of the things

2
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:15,810
I talk about come out of all the reading
I did during that period because I was

3
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:20,400
reading an insane amount and thinking
really nonstop 16 hours a day.

4
00:00:20,401 --> 00:00:23,760
Like the only way I could stop myself
from thinking was to go work out with

5
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:24,121
weights.

6
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:28,830
I couldn't shut off by my concern with
the issues that I was dealing with and I

7
00:00:28,831 --> 00:00:32,670
was spending about three hours a day
writing and I did that everyday for 15

8
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:34,800
years and that was the consequences.

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:35,663
That was the book.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,313
And

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,480
the writing also helped a tremendous
amount because it helps clarify your

12
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,021
thinking,

13
00:00:43,021 --> 00:00:43,650
writing,

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:43,891
you know,

15
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,990
because actually you're smarter when you,

16
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:46,261
right?

17
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:50,280
Because you can externalize
your thoughts and then you can,

18
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:53,640
you can use your working memory to
analyze what you've written instead of

19
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,990
remembering the thought.

20
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:55,861
And so you're,

21
00:00:55,861 --> 00:00:57,210
you're externalizing your memory.

22
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,560
You can analyze what you thought,

23
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:59,550
you can refine it,

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,810
you can reorder it.

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,940
You can edit like mad
with a word processor,

26
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:05,470
which is also a very new thing to it.

27
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,690
Editing is very difficult.

28
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,910
If you have to do that with pen
and paper with a typewriter,

29
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:09,181
it's like,

30
00:01:09,181 --> 00:01:09,681
forget it.

31
00:01:09,681 --> 00:01:10,050
You,

32
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:11,790
you get your first draft and that's it.
