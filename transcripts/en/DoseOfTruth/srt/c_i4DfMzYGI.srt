1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:00,471
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,471 --> 00:00:00,741
Okay.

3
00:00:00,741 --> 00:00:01,221
So you're,

4
00:00:01,221 --> 00:00:02,960
you're weaving a number
of things together.

5
00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:07,961
So the first is your discovery
that if you look at the data,

6
00:00:08,451 --> 00:00:13,070
that things are getting better at a rate
that's so remarkable that it is really

7
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:14,450
nothing short of miraculous.

8
00:00:14,451 --> 00:00:19,010
And you've produced dozens of graphs
showing that in enlightenment.

9
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:19,760
Now,

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,960
I noticed the same thing about three years
ago when I was working for a UN panel

11
00:00:23,961 --> 00:00:25,490
on economic sustainability.

12
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,180
The writ for the,

13
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:28,790
for the secretary general,

14
00:00:28,791 --> 00:00:32,450
the original narrative was extremely
pessimistic and detailed how we were

15
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:36,170
destroying the planet and how everything
was getting works and how we were at,

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:36,710
uh,

17
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,790
at each other's throats.

18
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:42,791
And I started to read extremely widely
and I found that on measure after measure

19
00:00:43,851 --> 00:00:47,360
with some notable exceptions
like ocean oceanic overfishing,

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:52,720
we have been doing so staggeringly much
better in the last hundred and 50 years

21
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:55,790
that you can't believe it on almost every,

22
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,560
on almost every measure you can imagine,

23
00:00:57,561 --> 00:01:00,110
which is exactly what you detail
out and enlightenment now.

24
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,443
And,

25
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,640
and then now that that's a secret,

26
00:01:04,641 --> 00:01:06,230
let's say people don't know about it.

27
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:06,960
And Yeah,

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,030
and that's strange.

29
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,780
And then you also associated
with a critique of the,

30
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,350
of,

31
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:14,480
of the enlightenment and
scientific rationality.

32
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:16,850
And it seems to me that you're implying,

33
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,130
or perhaps you're stating explicitly that

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:21,630
you're,

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,340
you're stating explicitly that there's
a connection between the pessimism and

36
00:01:25,341 --> 00:01:29,720
the lack of knowledge about this and
the critique of the enlightenment and

37
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:30,554
rationality.

38
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,960
Because there's a question here.

39
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:36,830
If things are getting so much better
and if the news is overwhelming on that

40
00:01:36,831 --> 00:01:37,280
front,

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:37,521
I mean,

42
00:01:37,521 --> 00:01:40,700
some of the things you
outlined are like the weather,

43
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:44,930
the decrease decreases in starvation
I suppose are the most remarkable.

44
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:49,470
And the provision of bountiful
food on less and less far bunt,

45
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,840
which is not something that people don't.

46
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:51,321
It's like,

47
00:01:51,321 --> 00:01:52,550
if all this is happening,

48
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,650
why don't we know about it?

49
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:56,090
And how is it linked to the,

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,120
how do you think if,

51
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,930
if it all is linked to the critique of,

52
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,470
of enlightenment rationality,

53
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,700
what are the reasons?

54
00:02:03,701 --> 00:02:04,200
Is,

55
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,430
uh,

56
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,110
an interaction between the nature of
journalism and the nature of cognition?

57
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:08,651
They,

58
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:09,000
we,

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,390
uh,

60
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:10,630
the news is about what happens,

61
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,660
not what hasn't happened.

62
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,910
And a lot of the,

63
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:13,720
uh,

64
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,870
very beneficial developments
consist of things that don't happen.

65
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,430
Countries that are at peace,

66
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:19,264
that used to be

67
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,360
kids who are not starving.

68
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,423
Um,

69
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:24,280
a kit,

70
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:24,880
uh,

71
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:26,740
terrorist attacks that do not happen.

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,300
You never see a journalist saying,

73
00:02:28,301 --> 00:02:31,210
I'm reporting live from a country
that's been at peace for 40 years.

74
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,860
But if a war breaks out,

75
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:34,960
you can be sure that we'll
hear about it all the more.

76
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:38,650
So now that to a majority
of humanity consists of,

77
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:38,951
uh,

78
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,390
on the spot video.

79
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,290
Journalists thanks to smart phones,

80
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,200
uh,

81
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,860
also,

82
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,693
uh,

83
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:47,440
bad things can happen quickly.

84
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,400
Things can blow up,

85
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,270
worst can start,

86
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:50,350
a massacre can happen,

87
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,090
but good things aren't built in a day.

88
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:56,350
And they often consist of incremental
improvements with few percentage points a

89
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:59,200
year that the compound
that that accumulate.

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,600
But that can never make the news because
they never happened all of a sudden on

91
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,370
a Thursday in October.

92
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,490
But together with all the,

93
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:08,170
the,

94
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:08,800
um,

95
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,740
cognitive impediments to
understanding the state of the world,

96
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,860
the fact that news
reports memorable events.

97
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,694
And we know,

98
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,300
uh,

99
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,110
from the,

100
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,060
uh,

101
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:24,060
study of the cognition of risk and
probability from Daniel Kahneman and Amos

102
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:24,640
Tversky,

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,320
that we tend to assess probability
and risk by a shortcut called the

104
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:30,550
availability heuristic.

105
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:30,971
Namely,

106
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:34,210
the easier it is to I dredge
up an example from memory,

107
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,070
the more likely we think something is.

108
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:39,130
And so people think that a
tornadoes kill a lot of people,

109
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:43,150
but they don't realize that falling
off ladders kills far more people.

110
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:43,821
I just,

111
00:03:43,821 --> 00:03:45,100
cause when someone falls off a ladder,

112
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:45,970
it doesn't make the news.

113
00:03:45,971 --> 00:03:47,770
But when there is a tornado it does.

114
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,061
Yeah.

115
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:52,230
Do you know that solar power kills more
people to nuclear power every a year?

116
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,550
I did not know that,

117
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:57,160
but it doesn't surprise me because
nuclear power kills no one,

118
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,880
I suppose as installers fall off,

119
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,360
roof installers fall off roofs.

120
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,513
Yeah,

121
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:04,880
yeah,

122
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,713
exactly.

123
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,071
Well,

124
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:06,380
so,

125
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,310
so that's interesting.

126
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:08,360
So you can imagine that.

127
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,550
So good news or bad news,

128
00:04:10,551 --> 00:04:12,950
his son is dramatic.

129
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:13,831
We're,

130
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:17,720
we're tilted towards the processing
of negative information in any case.

131
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:18,351
Well,

132
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:19,170
that's right.

133
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,490
We don't naturally computer ratio between,

134
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,731
uh,

135
00:04:22,731 --> 00:04:24,860
occurrences and not occurrences,

136
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:30,160
which is of course what
goes into a probability and
rational assessment of risk

137
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,394
and probability.

138
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,653
So there's that,

139
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,301
but it's,

140
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:36,560
it's more than that than that
because in intellectual life,

141
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:39,700
in large parts of academia and in,

142
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,250
uh,

143
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,590
among commentators and pundits,

144
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,840
there is an ideology of,

145
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,331
uh,

146
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:46,164
of decline.

147
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,320
It goes back to the 19th century,

148
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,950
uh,

149
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,660
part of the counter
enlightenment that arose in a,

150
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,660
as a reaction to enlightenment,

151
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,351
hopes for,

152
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:56,820
for progress and
rationality that said that,

153
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,180
that,

154
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,180
that the holes that society is Western
civilization is teetering on the brink or

155
00:05:03,111 --> 00:05:03,944
it's circling,

156
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,440
circling the drain and
it's going to collapse,

157
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,720
uh,

158
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,101
any,

159
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,030
any time now.

160
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,920
And it's up to the intellectuals
and commentators and,

161
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:13,460
uh,

162
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:13,701
to,

163
00:05:13,701 --> 00:05:14,270
to,

164
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:14,870
uh,

165
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:19,870
point out how decadent to degenerate
society is and to people like that musical

166
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:23,060
progress comes also in a front

167
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,000
there.

168
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,790
The reaction is,

169
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,151
hey,

170
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:26,780
we've been,

171
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,010
we've been a warning,

172
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,650
all of you about how society
is on the verge of collapse.

173
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:33,920
Don't come around and tell us
that if everything's going fine,

174
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:34,140
we're,

175
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,150
what are we going to do now?

176
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:35,800
Yeah.

177
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,390
You identify a lot of that with
the romantic types like Russo.

178
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,190
And when I was reading,

179
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,430
I wondered to the,

180
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,340
there's a,

181
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,200
there's a powerful Marxists narrative
that's run it's course for about 130 years

182
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:49,411
too.

183
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:54,400
That's predicated on the idea that
there's an oppressed class and the no

184
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:55,260
pressure class.

185
00:05:55,261 --> 00:06:00,261
And that narrative seems also to thrive
on or two to be a fronted by the idea

186
00:06:01,431 --> 00:06:02,264
that the current,

187
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,230
the current system might be
producing benefits across the board.

188
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:08,120
I think you do in fact,

189
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:11,660
in one part of the book ask about
whether or not these benefits are only

190
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:12,111
accruing,

191
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:12,741
for example,

192
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:13,574
to the rich.

193
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:16,970
And that doesn't seem to
be the case as far as,

194
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,560
as far as the data indicates.

195
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:19,743
Is that a fair,

196
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,650
quite the contrary.

197
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:23,720
The most dramatic
improvements have been at the,

198
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:24,960
at the bottom among re,

199
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:25,350
uh,

200
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,170
extreme poor where,

201
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:27,520
uh,

202
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,160
the proportion of the world's
population living in extreme poverty,

203
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:35,690
it's fallen over the last couple of
centuries from probably around 90% to less

204
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:36,524
than 10%.

205
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,810
And the United Nations is,

206
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:42,560
sends one of it's millennium elegant
goals to eliminate extreme poverty

207
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:44,420
everywhere by the year 2030.

208
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,220
That's probably too optimistic at
the fact that it can be set as a,

209
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:49,790
uh,

210
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,031
as a,

211
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:51,620
as a plausible aspiration.

212
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,190
Is it self astonishing?

213
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:53,471
Oh,

214
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:56,260
I know the UN had said as
one of its millennial goals,

215
00:06:56,261 --> 00:07:01,261
the having of absolute poverty between
2000 and 2015 and that was accomplished

216
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,710
by 2012

217
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,310
exactly.

218
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,160
Ahead of schedule.

219
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,611
Yes,

220
00:07:05,611 --> 00:07:06,131
exactly.

221
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:06,964
And that

222
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,520
Marxism has a,

223
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:09,841
a,

224
00:07:09,841 --> 00:07:14,220
a complicated relationship to progress
because Marxist doctrine actually does,

225
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,030
uh,

226
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,740
layout up pathway to progress.

227
00:07:16,741 --> 00:07:17,401
Unfortunately,

228
00:07:17,401 --> 00:07:19,950
that pathway consists of
violet class conflict.

229
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:20,761
I,

230
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:23,550
it isn't the enlightenment
ideal of progress through,

231
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,090
uh,

232
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,020
through problem solving,

233
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,120
the pro se,

234
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:26,953
uh,

235
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:27,350
uh,

236
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:31,980
belief that a nature throws problems at
us and that if we applied brain power,

237
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:33,750
we can gradually chip away at them.

238
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:37,530
Mentally of progress is quite different.

239
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,300
And you're right that there is a,

240
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,560
a pretty strong,

241
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:43,740
there are critiques of progress both
from the left and from the right,

242
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:44,800
but from,

243
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,633
from the left,

244
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:46,640
uh,

245
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,820
there is a,

246
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,160
um,

247
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,450
uh,

248
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:51,510
kind of contempt for institutions like,

249
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,530
uh,

250
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:56,910
like markets like liberal democracy
that deserve a lot of the credit for the

251
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:59,320
progress that we've made
in that would be to,

252
00:07:59,350 --> 00:07:59,520
uh,

253
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,220
at least in the academic left a,

254
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:02,930
uh,

255
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,060
an despising of the very idea of progress.

256
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,280
And I found that that the,

257
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:12,120
the only political faction is actually
sympathetic to progress or libertarians

258
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,570
that have been a number of
rational optimist books,

259
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,230
uh,

260
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,760
in the last decade by people like Matt
Ridley and Ron Bailey and Johan Norberg

261
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:21,600
that,

262
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,380
uh,

263
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:27,380
that do have an overlapping vision to
the one that I took on the light light

264
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,960
down and we documenting progress.

265
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:31,950
Um,

266
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,320
but both from the,

267
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:33,831
the,

268
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:33,950
uh,

269
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,210
academic left and from
the political right,

270
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,440
there has been a,

271
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:38,140
uh,

272
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:38,350
uh,

273
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:43,080
a contempt for the notion of progress
or their different reasons in academia.

274
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:45,260
It goes back to the Romantics too.

275
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,230
So as you mentioned,

276
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,570
but also to Schopenhauer nature.

277
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,261
Heidegger,

278
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:50,490
the existentialists,

279
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,130
the critical theorists
of the Frankfurt school,

280
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,160
large swaths of the academic humanities.

281
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:56,431
Uh,

282
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:57,420
actually the test,

283
00:08:57,421 --> 00:08:58,254
the enlightenment,

284
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,370
I ironically enough,

285
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,230
not by no means all of them,

286
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,161
but I have to have,

287
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,750
but there's a significant faction

288
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,790
questionnaire,

289
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,940
kitchen partners.

290
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:08,783
Why,

291
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:12,050
I mean one of the things that really
struck me as I've gone through this

292
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,050
material over the last years is
that this is really good news.

293
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,650
Particularly it doesn't really matter
whether you're on the left to the right.

294
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:20,490
If you're on the left,

295
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:25,491
you think that the fact that the poorest
of the poor are being lifted out of

296
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:26,910
their abject,

297
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:29,550
absolute abject misery
at a rate that's just,

298
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:34,320
I don't think you could hope for a faster
improvement no matter how optimistic

299
00:09:34,321 --> 00:09:35,154
you work.

300
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,320
And then on the right of course,

301
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,550
the fact that the benefits
of liberal democracy,

302
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:41,971
let's say,

303
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:44,430
and free markets are
driving this in large part,

304
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,560
you'd take would also be
a cause for celebration.
