1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:08,410
How to be less afraid of death.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,240
I have a better suggestion.

3
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:13,180
You should be more afraid
of not living properly.

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,470
I don't know if you can
be less afraid of death.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:18,333
Exactly.

6
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:23,230
But I think that here's a hypothesis
and this is a Socratic hypothesis.

7
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,480
I write about this in
my book too by the way.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,913
Um,

9
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,220
maybe if you live your life thoroughly,

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,060
thoroughly,

11
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,331
right,

12
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:33,170
you take use of the advantages,

13
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,470
make use of the advantages
that are put in front of you.

14
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:36,850
Make use of your talents.

15
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,170
Say Yes to things.

16
00:00:38,171 --> 00:00:38,921
Tell the truth,

17
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,380
like stand up and get at it.

18
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:44,290
I'm assuming that you can do that,

19
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:44,681
you know,

20
00:00:44,681 --> 00:00:47,400
cause some people are
very ill and hurt and,

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:48,820
but assuming you can do that,

22
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,070
I think the only way to combat
fear of death is to live fully.

23
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,380
And I think that that might actually work.

24
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,670
I kind of wonder,

25
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:59,340
I've talked about this with my father too.

26
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:00,370
He was getting pretty old.

27
00:01:00,371 --> 00:01:00,671
You know,

28
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,600
I've asked him if,

29
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,711
for example,

30
00:01:02,711 --> 00:01:05,860
if he could be transformed
back into an 18 year old,

31
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:07,120
knowing what he knows now,

32
00:01:07,121 --> 00:01:08,050
would he do it?

33
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,970
And he was ambivalent about that.

34
00:01:09,971 --> 00:01:10,151
You know,

35
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:10,901
he didn't say no,

36
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:12,190
but he didn't say yes.

37
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:17,020
And we talked about this idea
that if you lived your life fully,

38
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:18,723
you know,

39
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,160
maybe that would be good enough because,

40
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:21,461
you know,

41
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:22,630
I loved having kids,

42
00:01:22,631 --> 00:01:27,631
but I don't feel that I
would have kids again.

43
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,660
You know,

44
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,630
because in some sense
I've already done that.

45
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:37,260
And so maybe there's a set number of
adventures that you have to go on in your

46
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:38,411
life.

47
00:01:38,411 --> 00:01:39,970
Let's say you have to be buried,

48
00:01:39,971 --> 00:01:40,751
you have to have kids,

49
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:41,650
you have to have a career,

50
00:01:41,651 --> 00:01:42,790
you have to have friends,

51
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:47,320
you have to have something useful to
do with your time outside of work.

52
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:50,050
All those are all things that are
covered in the future authoring program.

53
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:50,884
By the way.

54
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,480
Maybe if you do all those,

55
00:01:52,481 --> 00:01:53,140
it's like,

56
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:53,921
that's good enough.

57
00:01:53,921 --> 00:01:54,990
You've had your life and,

58
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,380
and that's enough.

59
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:56,681
I mean,

60
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:57,514
I don't know,

61
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,710
10 years ago I thought,

62
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,220
you know,

63
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,050
if I could extend my life radically,

64
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,143
then I would,

65
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:09,080
and I'm not so sure
about that now that I'm,

66
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,520
I'm 55 you know,

67
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,354
I'm getting older.

68
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:17,990
I kind of have a suspicion
that you might come to an end,

69
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:18,824
you know?

70
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,420
That's what it looks like.

71
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,201
I mean,

72
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:22,730
I don't want that to be soon,

73
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:23,863
but

74
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,780
maybe you exhaust yourself in your life,

75
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:27,991
you know?

76
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,570
Maybe you can so that there's
nothing left of you really.
