1
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:07,490
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,720
Now music itself,

3
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,170
uh,

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,580
I mean the first musical,

5
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,770
first I'd have to give you an experience
that I had that allowed me to see and

6
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:14,604
to all of us,

7
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,190
I had already been fascinated
by the gods inside of us.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,610
I concluded at the age of 12 that I was
an atheist and if there were no gods and

9
00:00:22,611 --> 00:00:24,870
they have an above us and know
God's in the ground beneath us,

10
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,901
where were the gods?

11
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,051
Will,

12
00:00:26,051 --> 00:00:27,340
my parents were trying to drive,

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,430
dragged me an atheist off the high
holiday services and they were so intent

14
00:00:32,431 --> 00:00:33,150
about it,

15
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:37,800
but I was literally holding onto the
doorframe of their blue Fraser or by now

16
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,050
forgotten car.

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,860
And,

18
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,900
and they were shredding my socks.

19
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:44,480
They were quite frankly
tearing my shoes off.

20
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:47,180
They were doing everything they
could to get me up to the temple.

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,560
And so I realized in that moment,

22
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:51,060
if the gods are not above with the gods,

23
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:51,571
are not below,

24
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:52,110
where are they?

25
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,310
They're inside my parents.

26
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:54,420
If they're inside my parents,

27
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:56,160
they're inside of me
there inside of all of us.

28
00:00:56,580 --> 00:00:57,740
So my task at,

29
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,430
uh,

30
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:03,430
basically the age of 12 to 13 became use
your scientific tools to find the gods

31
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,723
inside of us.

32
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,420
Okay.

33
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,141
Well you also,

34
00:01:07,141 --> 00:01:07,471
again,

35
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:10,950
you elaborated on that part of the
story that also made you a tune to those

36
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:13,890
ecstatic experiences because the
case that you've just laid out,

37
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,900
or I suppose we laid out together to some
degree is that perhaps it was that the

38
00:01:19,201 --> 00:01:23,070
fact that you are isolated as a kid
made you even more sensitive to the

39
00:01:23,071 --> 00:01:28,071
collective belonging element of music
because you were so starved for it and so,

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,490
and then the idea of the gods within
that you just laid out seems to me to be

41
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:37,491
very much akin to what you described as
either your tactic or your philosophy

42
00:01:38,131 --> 00:01:40,590
with regards to PR for
the rock personalities.

43
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,910
Because what you said you were doing
was trying to make them reveal some of

44
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:48,330
these archetipal figures
within and that that would,

45
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,400
and that you were actually
trying to foster that,

46
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:53,130
which meant in some sense
you weren't doing PR at all.

47
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:53,401
Like,

48
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,810
I don't know what the hell you'd call it.

49
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,370
I call it secular shame.

50
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:56,710
On us.

51
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,420
I was a name I was never comfortable
with because it's so unscientific,

52
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,060
but that was the closest I can come to it.

53
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:04,920
It's like dowsing for the human soul.

54
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,470
Well,

55
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,560
it would have been a good
name for a PR company.

56
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,573
A second.

57
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,240
Yeah.

58
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,511
Yeah.

59
00:02:09,511 --> 00:02:09,901
But I,

60
00:02:09,901 --> 00:02:10,770
I think that's a very,

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,041
well,

62
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:15,090
I think that's a very useful way of
thinking about it because obviously one of

63
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:19,910
the hold overs from the shamanic
traditions is obviously music.

64
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:20,411
I mean,

65
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:20,921
that's just,

66
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:23,320
that's just a continuation
of the same tradition.
