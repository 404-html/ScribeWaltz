1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,370
Your idea of realer than real appears to
parallel Plato's theory of the forms?

2
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,930
Is this the source of the idea or are
you reconsidering ancient philosophy?

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,840
Well,
God only knows what the source of an

4
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:21,040
idea is,
you know,

5
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:22,660
um,
uh,

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,960
my sense of Plato's forms was it was
that they weren't exactly narrative

7
00:00:28,001 --> 00:00:31,750
instructure although I think that,
I think that there isn't at least an

8
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:36,610
analogous relationship between the idea
of archetype and the idea of form.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,870
Um,
I think Plato was talking more about

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,470
forms of,
of tangible objects in the world.

11
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:47,290
You know,
where I'm talking more about permanent

12
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:49,660
patterns of behavior,
you know,

13
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:50,703
because,

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:53,933
okay,

15
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,740
what are,
what our culture is essentially is a

16
00:00:56,741 --> 00:01:00,610
dance of permanent patterns of behavior.
I mean,

17
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,590
there's a fair bit of variability in
the,

18
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,290
in the patterns.
Like there is variability in a

19
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:08,050
basketball game or a soccer game or
something like that.

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,270
You know,
there's obviously predictability and

21
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:11,800
variability,
but,

22
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:15,460
um,
what's the predictable elements are the,

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,550
are equivalent in some sense to the
platonic forms,

24
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:23,170
which is the point that you're making
and it's the discovery of those more

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,200
permanent forms that emerges.
As a consequence of the spinning of

26
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:30,820
stories,
you know,

27
00:01:30,821 --> 00:01:35,140
because we're watching each other
constantly and we're articulating what

28
00:01:35,141 --> 00:01:39,490
we see and then we're amalgamating the
articulations and we're sifting them

29
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:41,490
for,
for fundamental patterns.

30
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:44,410
Like a good example of that.
It's something I just recently

31
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,930
discovered when I did the biblical
lectures on Abraham.

32
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,060
You know,
I,

33
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,360
I didn't understand that Abraham was a
late bloomer.

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,250
You know,
he was like the guy who stayed in his

35
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:55,960
mother's basement for too long.
I mean,

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:01,200
he's 75 when God calls him on an
adventure and God basically tells him to

37
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,520
leave his family and his countrymen and
his kinsmen and to go into the land of

38
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:08,500
the stranger.
And that's,

39
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,910
see there's an archetypal pattern there.
And the pattern is,

40
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:16,990
while it's the pattern of the call and
it's,

41
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:20,020
it's deeply,
it's something that people experience,

42
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:21,280
you know,
like an adolescent,

43
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,640
a healthy adolescent wants to get away
from his or her stultifying,

44
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,130
uh,
um,

45
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:33,830
dependent upbringing and go out into the
world of adventure,

46
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,290
you know,
in,

47
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,330
in the biblical stories,
thoughts that's symbolically represented

48
00:02:40,571 --> 00:02:43,060
as something akin to a divine call,
which,

49
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:45,760
which I think is quite interesting
because,

50
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,880
you know,
we don't understand these calls.

51
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:50,650
You know,
you have an impulse to do something,

52
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:53,860
something captures your interest,
something captures your motivation.

53
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,760
It's,
it's not like it's self-generated.

54
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,520
Exactly.
You know,

55
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,323
the,
the,

56
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,790
that the call to adventure is produced
by something like a transcendent deity

57
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,730
is a really interesting idea.
Now.

58
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,350
It depends on what you mean by,
I didn't know you could think about it

59
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:10,600
as an ancient brain circuit,
I suppose.

60
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:13,210
Although I don't know if that really
makes it things any clearer.

61
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,550
But there is an impulse within people
that pulls them out into the world to go

62
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:23,140
away from their safe circumstances and
to make their fortunate where there's

63
00:03:23,141 --> 00:03:26,650
famine and tyranny and,
and threats to the integrity of the

64
00:03:26,651 --> 00:03:28,420
family,
which are all things that Abraham

65
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,610
immediately encounters when he listens
to God.

66
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,740
And so that seems to be something like
something that's realer than real

67
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,390
because everyone experiences that to
some degree or everyone can relate to

68
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,224
it.
It's a deep,

69
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,640
deep theme.
And you know,

70
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,630
what I'm looking for in the biblical
stories,

71
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:51,190
in other mythological representations is
these deep universal themes.

72
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,750
Now is that a reconceptualization of
ancient philosophy?

73
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,060
It's really hard to say because,
you know,

74
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:02,470
I derived the idea of the archetype,
at least in part from reading young and

75
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,990
young of course,
was influenced because he had a great

76
00:04:04,991 --> 00:04:09,010
classical education by the ancients.
And so exactly where these ideas come

77
00:04:09,011 --> 00:04:10,900
from isn't clear.
So,

78
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,820
um,
so I guess that's pretty much all I,

79
00:04:15,821 --> 00:04:17,140
all I have to say about that.
