1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:07,690
So that you,

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,050
you touched on this idea of the
destruction of the work of art.

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:11,891
You know,

4
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:14,490
and one of the things I really
liked about reading Nietzsche,

5
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:16,510
it was his discussion of into mall,

6
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:16,781
right,

7
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:17,561
of resentment.

8
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:18,310
And,

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,780
and it seems to me that a tremendous
amount of the motive power that drives the

10
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:23,680
postmodernist,

11
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,543
let's call it,

12
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,080
it's not a revolution.

13
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,430
Um,

14
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,430
transformation seems to me to be driven
by resentment about virtually anything

15
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:33,370
that has any,

16
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,091
well,

17
00:00:34,091 --> 00:00:34,781
what would you say?

18
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:37,330
Any merit of competence
or aesthetic quality?

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,310
And I don't know if that's,

20
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:43,660
it seems to me that that's partly
rooted in the academics disdain for the

21
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:44,620
business world,

22
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,890
which I think is driven by their
relative economic inequality.

23
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:52,510
Because most people who are as intelligent
as academics are from a pure Iq point

24
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:53,170
of view,

25
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,000
make more money in the private sphere.

26
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:56,590
And so I think that drives some of it,

27
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,330
but there also seems to be this,

28
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,690
there's a destruction and
aim for destruction of the,

29
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:03,640
of the aesthetic quality of the,

30
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:05,500
of the literary or artistic work.

31
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:08,650
It's reduction to nothing
but some kind of power game.

32
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,530
And then surrounding that,

33
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:15,010
the reduction of everything to something
that approximates a power gate,

34
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,560
which,

35
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,790
which I can't help but identifying with,

36
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:20,170
with jealousy and resentment as a,

37
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:21,520
as a fundamental motivator.

38
00:01:21,521 --> 00:01:23,200
Does that seem reasonable to you?

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,500
These professors?

40
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:24,801
Okay.

41
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:27,750
Who allege that art is nothing.

42
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:27,890
Okay.

43
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,400
But an ideological movement by one elite.

44
00:01:31,401 --> 00:01:32,234
Okay.

45
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,023
Against the,

46
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,050
I guess another group,

47
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,590
right?

48
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,080
These people are
Philistines the Philistines,

49
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:41,720
they're middlebrow hopelessly middlebrow.

50
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:41,871
Okay.

51
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:42,081
They,

52
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:42,530
they,

53
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,940
they have no sense of beauty.

54
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,350
They have no sense of the aesthetic.

55
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:45,531
Now,

56
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,660
Marxism doesn't deed a search this,

57
00:01:47,661 --> 00:01:48,090
okay.

58
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,760
[inaudible] and tries to reconfigure
the universe in terms of materialism,

59
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:53,511
it seems to it,

60
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:56,720
and it does not recognize any
kind of spiritual dimension.

61
00:01:56,721 --> 00:01:56,900
Now,

62
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm an atheist,

63
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:03,040
but I see the great world religions
as enormous works of art as the,

64
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:04,300
as the,

65
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:07,500
as the best way to understand the
universe and man's place in it.

66
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:07,790
Okay.

67
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:10,560
I find them enormously
moving that they're there.

68
00:02:10,561 --> 00:02:11,810
They're like enormous Paul.

69
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:12,653
Unless I had them,

70
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,500
I would,

71
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,590
I have called for the true revolution.

72
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,130
Okay.

73
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:20,810
What have been okay to make the core
curriculum of world education the world?

74
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,380
Okay.

75
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,000
The great religions of the world.

76
00:02:23,001 --> 00:02:25,700
I feel that is the only way
to achieve an understanding.

77
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,050
And it's also a way to,

78
00:02:27,051 --> 00:02:27,500
to,

79
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:27,711
um,

80
00:02:27,711 --> 00:02:28,730
to present the aesthetic.

81
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:28,941
Okay.

82
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:30,620
Because I feel that that the,

83
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,360
that the real sixties'
vision was about Xcel,

84
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,540
Taishan elevation,

85
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,190
cosmic consciousness,

86
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,110
all of these things,

87
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:40,400
they were rejected.

88
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:40,580
Okay.

89
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,391
By these,

90
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:43,100
by these midgets.

91
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:43,371
Okay.

92
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:47,300
Intellectual midgets who seized
onto la car dairy and fuck off.

93
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:47,630
Right.

94
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,520
It's an eye,

95
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,330
my career has been in the art school,

96
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:53,330
so I Ma Ma my entire career
beginning of Bennington college.

97
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:53,980
Uh,

98
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,361
so I,

99
00:02:54,361 --> 00:02:57,710
I represent a challenge to this
from the perspective of art.

100
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:58,120
Right?

101
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,070
It is an absolute nonsense.

102
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:00,341
Okay.

103
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:04,990
As poststructuralism maintains that
reality is mediated by language,

104
00:03:04,991 --> 00:03:05,621
by words,

105
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:06,490
everything that we can know,

106
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,330
including gender,

107
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
it's absolutely madness because I,

108
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,910
I'm teaching students
whose majors our ceramics.

109
00:03:12,911 --> 00:03:13,540
Okay.

110
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,650
Or dance.

111
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:15,484
Okay.

112
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Who are jazz musicians who understand
reality in terms of the body is sensory

113
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,933
activation.

114
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,660
So they now to see what happens if
something was going on in the art world as

115
00:03:25,661 --> 00:03:26,320
well.

116
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,690
I identify with Andy Warhol and pop art.

117
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:28,841
Okay.

118
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:31,720
That was what was going on
during my years in college.

119
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,760
Everything about Andy Warhol was like,

120
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,900
wow.

121
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,890
Admiration.

122
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:36,730
Wow.

123
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:39,280
What happened immediately
after that in the arts?

124
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,360
1970s okay.

125
00:03:40,361 --> 00:03:44,410
Was this collapse into a
snide sort of postmodernism?

126
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:44,950
Also,

127
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,950
this happened in the art world and it
was an utter misunderstanding of culture.

128
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:55,681
It seems to mean by that movement in
the art world that is oppositional art,

129
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,740
in my view,

130
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,670
is dead.

131
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:57,940
Okay.

132
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,490
It's been and what postmodernism is,

133
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,060
isn't it?

134
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,130
A pathetic attempt to continue.

135
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,260
The old hero is some of the Avalon garb.

136
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,100
The avant garde was genuinely
heroic from the early 19th century.

137
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,341
Okay.

138
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:09,511
Wait,

139
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:10,344
we're talking about,

140
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:10,631
you know,

141
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:11,530
when the core bay,

142
00:04:11,531 --> 00:04:12,364
the realist,

143
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:12,641
you know,

144
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:14,600
we're talking about Monet
and the impressions,

145
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,460
people who genuinely suffered for the
radical ideas and new innovations and so

146
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:19,000
on,

147
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,050
going right down to,

148
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,330
to to Picasso and down to a,

149
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:25,510
to Jackson Pollock who like
was w who truly suffer it.

150
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:25,660
Okay.

151
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,130
For him,

152
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:26,920
for his art,

153
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,300
it was only after his death.

154
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,541
Okay.

155
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:31,750
That suddenly the market was
created for abstract art.

156
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,750
Pop Art killed the avant garde.

157
00:04:34,751 --> 00:04:36,700
The idea that the avant garde continues.

158
00:04:36,701 --> 00:04:39,250
It's an absolute delusion of
the contemporary art world,

159
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,110
which feels that it must attack attack,

160
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:41,740
attack,

161
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,401
challenge.

162
00:04:42,401 --> 00:04:42,641
Okay.

163
00:04:42,641 --> 00:04:43,050
The,

164
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,321
the,

165
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:44,620
the simplistic beliefs of the,

166
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:45,640
of the Hoi Polloi.

167
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,080
Okay.

168
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,913
Somehow the Arctic,

169
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,650
what?

170
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,280
Excuse me.

171
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,840
Okay.

172
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,060
All right.

173
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,960
From the moment.

174
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,201
Okay.

175
00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:55,201
Andy Warhol went through and embraced
the popular media and in brick instead of

176
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,560
having the opposition to it,

177
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:57,700
the serious artists have had,

178
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,130
that was the end of oppositional art.

179
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,580
Okay.

180
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,800
So we've been going on now for 50 years.

181
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,910
The postmodernism and academia is
hand in hand with the stupidity and

182
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,640
infantilism that masquerades as,

183
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:09,851
you know,

184
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:10,091
as,

185
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:12,160
as important art and galleries everywhere.

186
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:13,150
This incredible,

187
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:13,960
incredible,

188
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,201
you know,

189
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:16,540
its mechanism of contemporary art,

190
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,800
of pushing things that are,

191
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:21,880
that are so hopelessly derivative that
[inaudible] with this idea that once

192
00:05:21,881 --> 00:05:22,121
again,

193
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:24,730
that the art world sometimes
is a superior view of reality.
