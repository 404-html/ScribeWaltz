1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:09,910
There's hints about the proper
and improper ways of engaging,

2
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,181
right?

3
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:13,330
So clearly the improper way to engage is,

4
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:18,420
I think most clearly delineated in
the Cain and Abel Story and with Kane

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,020
exemplifying the inappropriate
way to engage with the world.

6
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:28,340
And that's to engage with
the world in a bitter,

7
00:00:28,341 --> 00:00:30,140
jealous and resentful manner.

8
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:31,431
Now,

9
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,580
one of the things that I really liked
about the Cain and Abel Story and that

10
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:36,380
theme recurs continually with the,

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,640
with the duality of the
brothers right there,

12
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,720
there's constant conflict between a
perspective that's essentially like canes

13
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:44,300
and,

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:44,720
and the,

15
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,040
and the opposite perspective,

16
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:46,874
which all,

17
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,020
which I'll get to in a minute,

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,470
but Keynes sees that the world is a very,

19
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:52,820
uh,

20
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,820
tragic place and that the rewards are
distributed to unfairly and that there are

21
00:00:57,831 --> 00:01:00,530
people who do better
and people who do worse.

22
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,240
And as a consequence of that,

23
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:05,480
he becomes bitter and
resentful and curses God.

24
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,220
And then he becomes homicidal.

25
00:01:08,221 --> 00:01:11,610
Fratricidal which is even worse
than he destroys his own ideal.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,400
Then his descendants
basically become genocidal,

27
00:01:14,401 --> 00:01:15,390
something like that.

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,920
So that seems to be the
wrong way to go about things,

29
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:20,611
you know,

30
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:23,040
unless your goal is to make things worse,

31
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:27,940
like it's not like it has
a limited number of things,

32
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,530
has nothing to object to.

33
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:30,940
He's got plenty to object to.

34
00:01:30,941 --> 00:01:33,040
His situation actually is bad.

35
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,580
He's overshadowed terribly by
his brother who everyone loves,

36
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,370
who does it extraordinarily well
and who's good at everything.

37
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,200
And the story is a bit of ambivalent
about the reasons for Keynes failure,

38
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,810
although fair bit of it's
laid at his own feet,

39
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,400
but he's definitely failing.

40
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,110
And so you can understand why he
would have this terrible attitude.

41
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,600
But the problem is all
it does is make it worse.

42
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,470
So it doesn't seem to be one of the
things I've also learned as a psychologist

43
00:02:00,471 --> 00:02:02,000
sort of pondering these sorts of things.

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,080
It's often a lot easier to identify what
you shouldn't do then what you should

45
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:06,650
do.

46
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,130
Like it's,

47
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,740
I think evil is easier
to identify than good.

48
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,810
I think good is trickier,

49
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,210
but evil stands out to some degree.

50
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:15,380
And then at least you can say,

51
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:17,780
if you're trying to get as far
away from that as possible,

52
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,970
we could even say just
for practical reasons,

53
00:02:19,971 --> 00:02:23,240
so your life doesn't become hell and
your family life doesn't become hell.

54
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,540
At least you could get as far
away from that as possible,

55
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,690
even if you weren't able to conjure up
what would constitute the good as an Ame,

56
00:02:31,941 --> 00:02:34,940
you could at least avoid
those sorts of pitfalls.

57
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:38,240
And I do also think that it's pitfalls
like that that really threatened our

58
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,230
society right now.

59
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:39,531
You know,

60
00:02:39,531 --> 00:02:44,531
that I see a tremendous rise in resentment
fueling almost all of the political

61
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:50,000
polarization that's taking place and
seems unfortunate given that by and by

62
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:50,480
large,

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,360
everyone on the planet is
richer than they've ever been.

64
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,030
Now that that doesn't
mean there's no disparity.

65
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:56,271
There's,

66
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:57,560
but there's always disparity.

67
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,491
Anyways,

68
00:02:58,491 --> 00:02:59,324
Jacob,

69
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,401
of course,

70
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:05,350
Jacob on Rebecca d Esau
and Jacob ends up with,

71
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,130
with,

72
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:06,963
uh,

73
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,290
with Isaac's blessing.

74
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,850
And so that's,

75
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,400
that's a moral catastrophe.

76
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,880
And then he has to run because
his brother wants to kill him.

77
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,810
And so that's the fraud
suicidal motif again,

78
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:20,591
I like that too.

79
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,311
I think that's real,

80
00:03:21,311 --> 00:03:21,610
real,

81
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:22,510
really realistic.

82
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,230
You know,

83
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,450
one of the things that
Freud noted constantly,

84
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:27,520
and this is where Freud
really is a genius,

85
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:32,521
is that the most intense hatreds and
also sometimes the most intense love is

86
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:34,660
within families.

87
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,131
You know,

88
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,980
and in the Freud Ian
World of psychopathology,

89
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,623
it's all,

90
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,530
it's all inside the family in in fact,

91
00:03:44,531 --> 00:03:49,240
the pathology in the Freud in world is
actually the fact that it's all inside

92
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:52,780
the family because people who get
tangled up in the Friday and familial

93
00:03:52,781 --> 00:03:53,321
nightmare,

94
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,630
which is roughly eatable in structure,

95
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,070
can only conceptualize the world in
terms of their familial relationships.

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,060
They've been so damaged by
the and measurement and the
trauma and the deceit and

97
00:04:04,061 --> 00:04:06,940
the betrayal and the blurred
lines and all of that,

98
00:04:06,941 --> 00:04:11,620
that they just can't expand past
the family and go out in the world.

99
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,420
So the idea that brothers can
be at each other's throats,

100
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,763
I think is,

101
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,710
that's a very powerful idea.

102
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:22,660
And it's not something that
people like to think about.

103
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,093
So,

104
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:27,690
so Jacob has to leave and it's
not surprising because I mean,

105
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,230
what he did was pretty reprehensible.

106
00:04:29,231 --> 00:04:30,310
He betrayed his brother.

107
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,181
But nonetheless,

108
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:35,410
he's the person who dreams of the
ladder that unites having an earth.

109
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,160
And that's a very perverse thing.

110
00:04:39,161 --> 00:04:39,880
You know what?

111
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,800
But one of the things I
think it does is give,

112
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:42,971
in some sense,

113
00:04:42,971 --> 00:04:45,850
it gives hope to everyone
because it isn't,

114
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:46,871
you know,

115
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:49,180
if only the good guys when
we're really in trouble,

116
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,380
right?

117
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,180
Because it's not that
easy to be a good guy.

118
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,070
It's,

119
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,220
it's really not that easy.

120
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:58,720
And most people are pretty keenly aware
of all the ways that they fall short,

121
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,160
even of their own ideals.

122
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:04,630
And so if there was no hope
except for the good guys,

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,700
almost all of us would be lost.

124
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:11,740
And so that's one of the things I really
liked and was more surprised about with

125
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:12,850
the old testament stories,

126
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:14,020
is that these people are,

127
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,400
have very complex lives and they make
very major moral errors by anyone's

128
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,021
standard.

129
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:20,854
And yet,

130
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,010
and yet the overall message is still hope.
