1
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,580
I wanted to ask you a
couple things about that.

2
00:00:10,581 --> 00:00:11,900
So you know,

3
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:16,370
the big five research into political
differences basically shows that the

4
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:17,540
liberals are high in trade,

5
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:20,810
openness and low and treat
conscientiousness and
the conservatives or the

6
00:00:20,811 --> 00:00:21,500
reverse,

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,260
but we've fragmented conscientiousness
into orderliness and industriousness with

8
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:30,800
the big five aspect scale and orderliness
is strongly associated with disgust,

9
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:32,210
so so,

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,043
right,

11
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:33,920
right,

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,191
right,

13
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:34,701
exactly.

14
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,470
It does sound a lot like Freud but it,

15
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,490
but it also is in accordance with your
observations that conservatives have neat

16
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,061
spaces,

17
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:41,691
for example.

18
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:42,524
So,

19
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,120
so now and they're meeting start on time.

20
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:44,930
Yes.

21
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:45,171
Yeah,

22
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:45,681
exactly.

23
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:46,280
Right.

24
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,581
Right.

25
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:47,414
So,

26
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:52,550
so then the next is for political
belief seems to be openness,

27
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:57,020
so that that exploratory tendency that
you talked about exploration of ideas and

28
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:59,990
creativity and low orderliness.

29
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,371
And so then I thought,

30
00:01:01,371 --> 00:01:02,510
well why in the world would,

31
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,840
why would the political nexus
go across those dimensions,

32
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:07,940
which are some relatively uncorrelated?

33
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,203
Then I thought,

34
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,750
and this is in keeping with
your work on discussed,

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,910
is that it's an issue of borders,

36
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:17,570
which of course seems more or less self
evident in the wake of Trump's election

37
00:01:17,571 --> 00:01:18,710
when he talked about borders.

38
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,780
But you might say,

39
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:22,280
and I think this is reasonable,

40
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:27,260
that the conservative is someone who
wants the borders between categories to

41
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:30,230
remain intact no matter
what level of analysis.

42
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,240
So it's borders from the
highest resolution level of
cognition all the way up to

43
00:01:35,241 --> 00:01:37,340
the actual physical borders of,

44
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:37,730
of,

45
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:38,690
of rooms,

46
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:39,590
towns,

47
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,670
states,

48
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:41,361
countries,

49
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:41,871
all of that.

50
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:45,590
So the borders should be thicker
and the reason they want that.

51
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,930
Now there is a paper
published in plause one,

52
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:48,860
I don't know if you saw it,

53
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,850
it was a couple of years ago.

54
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:51,140
It was a mind boggling paper.

55
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,750
It should have been like front page
news as far as I was concerned.

56
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:59,260
And what the researchers did was between
countries and then within provinces or

57
00:01:59,721 --> 00:02:01,100
states within countries,

58
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,580
they correlated the level of um,

59
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:10,090
of frequency of infectious disease with
authoritarian political beliefs and

60
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:13,360
found a wallop correlation.

61
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:14,390
It was like 0.6.

62
00:02:14,391 --> 00:02:16,020
It was one of the highest by far,

63
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,570
for those of you who don't know,

64
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,020
social scientists never discover anything
that's associated with anything else

65
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,630
at a correlation of 0.6
other than heritability.

66
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,090
Right.

67
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,160
Other than heritability.

68
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:25,790
Yes.

69
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,330
And so what they found was that the higher
the prevalence of infectious disease,

70
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,590
the higher the probability of,

71
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:34,070
of totalitarian authoritarian
political attitudes.

72
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:37,730
And then they controlled for governance
because one of the questions was,

73
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,810
was this top down authoritarianism
or bottom up authoritarianism?

74
00:02:41,811 --> 00:02:43,490
And the answer was that
it was bought them up.

75
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,091
Okay.

76
00:02:44,091 --> 00:02:49,091
And so I thought about that in two from
two perspectives simultaneously at the

77
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:51,614
time.

78
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:51,860
Okay.

79
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,090
So we identified disgust,

80
00:02:53,091 --> 00:02:54,530
sensitivity with orderliness.

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,690
So let's say a fundamental sub trait.

82
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,300
Then I was reading this book that
was called Hitler's table talk.

83
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,111
And it was,

84
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,530
uh,

85
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:07,330
it was the recordings of virtually
everything he said at dinner from 1939 to

86
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:08,141
1942.

87
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:08,321
Yeah.

88
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,270
So it's a spontaneous utterance say,

89
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,463
and,

90
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,423
um,

91
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,680
it's full of discussions about Jews and
Gypsies and all the people he tormented.

92
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:20,410
But what's really interesting is
all the language is discussed.

93
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,970
It's not fear.

94
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:22,661
So,

95
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:27,661
so Hitler's basic metaphor was that the
Aryan race and country was a pure body,

96
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,210
and then it was assaulted by parasites.

97
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,571
Right.

98
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,930
And then I remembered what happened to
the native Americans when the Europeans

99
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,370
showed up and she'll cans.

100
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:39,940
What happened was that 95% of
them were dead within 50 years.

101
00:03:39,941 --> 00:03:40,181
Right.

102
00:03:40,181 --> 00:03:42,100
Because of smallpox and measles.

103
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:43,960
And so that,

104
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,220
that border issue that separates
conservatives from liberals,

105
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:49,510
let's say as the conservative,

106
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:53,290
say the novel is potentially contaminated.

107
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,970
It's not so much that it's dangerous.

108
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:55,631
That's different.

109
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:56,290
That's fear.

110
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,220
It's contaminated.

111
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,241
And the Liberals say,

112
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,074
hold on a minute.

113
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,820
If you make the borders too thick,

114
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,530
then information can't pass through.

115
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,460
Exactly.

116
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,840
That's the Omnivore's dilemma right there.

117
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,410
Right,

118
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:05,850
right.

119
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,280
And then since we have a
biological architecture on,

120
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,500
which are cognitive platforms are erected,

121
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,130
we have the same attitude
towards abstract information,

122
00:04:15,131 --> 00:04:18,720
which would be ideas that we
do to things like food or,

123
00:04:18,721 --> 00:04:19,690
or illness.

124
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,290
Right?

125
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:20,561
Right.

126
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:24,820
And so we can think of an invading idea
or a polluting idea or contaminated.

127
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:25,861
That's right.

128
00:04:25,861 --> 00:04:27,750
Now I'm a big fan of
George Lakoff metaphors.

129
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:29,130
We live by a,

130
00:04:29,131 --> 00:04:29,641
that we,

131
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:29,821
yeah,

132
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:31,290
we use our bodily,

133
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,240
our bodily ski Mada to
think about abstract things
like politics and like what

134
00:04:36,241 --> 00:04:38,550
our policies should be about
borders and immigration.

135
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,080
Uh,

136
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,080
there's a Canadian psychologist,

137
00:04:40,081 --> 00:04:40,741
Mark Shaller,

138
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,840
he and his colleagues have developed
what they call an account of these,

139
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,480
the behavioral immune system,

140
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,020
right.

141
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,160
That we don't just try to,

142
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,123
you know,

143
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,110
microbes killed probably many more of
our ancestors then did lions and tigers

144
00:04:52,111 --> 00:04:52,944
and bears.

145
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,960
And so whoever can keep themselves and
their children from being exposed to

146
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,330
fatal illnesses wins
the evolutionary game.

147
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:03,300
And so a lot of that is
judging carefully about people.

148
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:03,961
Is he dangerous?

149
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:04,800
Is She dangerous?

150
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,540
And that's both for sexuality,

151
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,440
for contact,

152
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:08,850
for all kinds of association.

153
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:09,541
Um,

154
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:09,901
so yeah,

155
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:13,830
and a lot of ways our emotions and
our bodily interactions structure,

156
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,570
how we think and feel about,

157
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,620
about social,

158
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:17,051
well,

159
00:05:17,051 --> 00:05:18,850
even with the black death in Europe,

160
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,510
I mean,

161
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,870
so the black death occurred in Europe
when the Europeans started to move around

162
00:05:22,871 --> 00:05:25,300
the world and they brought
back rats that were infected.

163
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:25,871
Exactly.

164
00:05:25,871 --> 00:05:26,171
So,

165
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:29,410
so what you saw there was both of
those forces at work at the same time.

166
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:34,060
So the European expansion produced a
tremendous interchange of ideas from all

167
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:34,781
around the world.

168
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:35,830
That's globalization,

169
