1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:04,640
99 I started at Queens University taught,

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:05,840
okay,

3
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:10,840
you were protested or testers
interrupted your talk at the beginning.

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,960
I believe you were spurred to them as
narcissistic for infringing upon the

5
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:18,900
rights of the people that
were there to hear you speak.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:20,520
They were taking that away from them.

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,660
Um,

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,440
in our country.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,221
Just recently,

10
00:00:23,221 --> 00:00:26,100
we had an unarmed man
shot in his back yard.

11
00:00:26,101 --> 00:00:27,120
20 Times.

12
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:30,570
People protested that
they shut down highways,

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,170
um,

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,740
being infringed on the rights of people
to use those highways because they

15
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:38,250
wanted to draw attention to
this really horrible incident.

16
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm asking you when is it okay
to protest and in your own mind,

17
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:47,070
how do you see a successful protest?

18
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,810
You protest

19
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:54,230
[inaudible]

20
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:03,030
it's okay to protest when you're
wanting to take responsibility for the

21
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:04,020
consequences.

22
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,670
No one [inaudible]

23
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:13,510
protests.

24
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,280
Dave take absolutely no responsibility
whatsoever for the consequences of the

25
00:01:17,281 --> 00:01:18,114
Raj.

26
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:21,340
And so I think it's
mostly cheap virtually.

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:22,211
Now,

28
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:25,210
that doesn't mean that there
isn't time diamond protest.

29
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:25,700
I mean,

30
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,400
I protested,

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,240
I suppose the one nine,

32
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:27,761
eight,

33
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:28,594
nine video.

34
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,440
Well,

35
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,610
I was a form of protest.

36
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:31,810
It was more of a refusal,

37
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,050
but I was perfectly willing to take
the consequences of what I did.

38
00:01:35,051 --> 00:01:37,310
And I put myself in a
situation where that was high,

39
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,144
no problem.

40
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,790
So let's see if you tell,

41
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,710
it was just with the book called skin,

42
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:43,150
skin in the game,

43
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,111
we're helping clients,

44
00:01:44,111 --> 00:01:45,340
this is some detail,

45
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,930
you should only trust people who are
putting themselves on the line when they,

46
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,820
when they make a recommendation.

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,180
And so the problem with protests
that if there is anything invalid,

48
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,330
the moment protest,

49
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,120
the problem with protest
as far as I can tell,

50
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,890
is that it's become the only avenue to
public virtue that seems to be acceptable

51
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:07,000
in our society.

52
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,110
And I think it's [inaudible].

53
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:18,851
I hate to lose.

54
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:22,840
The students are taught by their
professors to be activists.

55
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:26,980
It's like when did the activists
become like a profession?

56
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,860
As long as it's,

57
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,630
I don't know what to say about it either.

58
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:34,723
It's

59
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:39,220
pathological hanging
from the 1960s is really

60
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:45,930
all right.

61
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:47,900
Under that you have a
tremendous amount of breath.

62
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:50,683
Here we go.

63
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,140
Wow.

64
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,973
That was already

65
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,830
your whole life.

66
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,340
Okay.

67
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:00,910
So,

68
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:01,240
um,

69
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,870
we have,

70
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:05,470
I guess what I'll be charitable and call
a dialogue going on about guns right

71
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:05,980
now.

72
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,813
Um,

73
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,170
and mental health,

74
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,520
I guess it's also tied in with it.

75
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,170
And you mentioned that,

76
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,710
um,

77
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:15,070
essentially that the people that commit
these kind of massacres that we're

78
00:03:15,071 --> 00:03:16,330
seeing are,

79
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:18,740
it's addapp determined malevolence um,

80
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,990
and it seems to me that,

81
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,201
you know,

82
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:22,510
we're looking for simple
answers to simple questions.

83
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,683
Um,

84
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:25,180
and what I'm seeing,

85
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:28,540
and I guess kind of the preface a
little bit is I believe that the second

86
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:32,080
amendment is not just to help us protect
ourselves against those kinds of people

87
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,130
who would do us harm,

88
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,200
but also to protect against tyranny.

89
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:40,390
[inaudible]

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,430
hospital could get the simple answers
to simple questions if these people are

91
00:03:49,431 --> 00:03:52,640
determined to be 11 on tend
to commit acts of destruction.

92
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:57,641
So what do you think that we can
realistically do about the situation?

93
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,490
Okay.

94
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,360
Well the first thing is,

95
00:04:02,361 --> 00:04:05,660
is that I think it's just a state to set
up a society where the only people that

96
00:04:05,661 --> 00:04:06,860
get to be dangerous,

97
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:07,371
perpendicular,

98
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:08,420
who worked for the government

99
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,990
[inaudible].

100
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,980
I think that's the reason I say to is
because I think that was more dangerous.

101
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,873
That's great.

102
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,220
Now what can we do about it?

103
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,083
Well,

104
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,380
I see the bounce shootings
as a psychological trauma.

105
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,850
Fundamentally it's a multifaceted problem.

106
00:04:37,851 --> 00:04:38,111
I mean,

107
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,891
the first thing is,

108
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:43,370
is that there's a fair bit of narcissism
driving into like pathological

109
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:46,080
narcissism because the people
who do the amount of shootings,

110
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:49,200
they're all aware of one another and
it's a competition which established

111
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:49,970
competition.

112
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,750
Each one tries to outdo the last one
and it's not like they're aching or,

113
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,690
and they follow,

114
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,180
they follow,

115
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,510
they're informed about such things.

116
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,980
They're dwelling on it.

117
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,760
And so they found a loophole in the press
essentially ranked because they found

118
00:05:07,911 --> 00:05:09,950
a pathway to easy notoriety.

119
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:12,470
And a lot of the fantasizing that goes on,

120
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,970
it's like the fantasizing that the
proceeds out of the level of suicide.

121
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,730
So on 11,

122
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:21,440
suicide is one that you commit when you're
trying to take revenge on people that

123
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:22,430
you think of wrongdoing,

124
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,420
like your family.

125
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:28,400
And then you have a fantasy about
you at the funeral in your coffin.

126
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:28,881
You know,

127
00:05:28,881 --> 00:05:31,880
looking so pure white and
everyone that's ever wrong view,

128
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:34,210
crying their eyes out and be uh,

129
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:34,850
you know,

130
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,030
feeling deep regretted
how they groaned you.

131
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,031
Right?

132
00:05:38,031 --> 00:05:39,200
So that's a,

133
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,210
there's a fantasy that
goes along with that.

134
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:41,720
There's anything,

135
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:41,850
uh,

136
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,560
fantasies it's a kid without that goes
along with the school shooter types.

137
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,161
You know,

138
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:46,781
they,

139
00:05:46,781 --> 00:05:50,990
they think about their post death cells
cause they usually shoot themselves

140
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:53,750
because that's another way of
showing cause he fake here.

141
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,111
Here's a,

142
00:05:54,111 --> 00:05:54,944
here's a mystery.

143
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,810
If you're going to shoot yourself,

144
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,990
why don't you do that before you shoot?

145
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:03,240
Because they see other people and just
say if everyone that trouble right,

146
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,500
if you're,

147
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,810
if you're out for your own demise,

148
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,020
why go other dragging me some
other people loan with you?

149
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,580
You have to contend with them.

150
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:13,911
Well,

151
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:16,090
it's more dramatic because you're,

152
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:16,731
you're,

153
00:06:16,731 --> 00:06:21,350
what you're trying to manifest in the
world is that proclamation that life

154
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,670
itself is contemptible even yours.

155
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:26,421
Right?

156
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:29,540
And so you shoot about general other
people to make them a whole contemptible

157
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:29,901
point,

158
00:06:29,901 --> 00:06:31,340
but they do it off.

159
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,900
But then what's underlying that is this
post death fantasy about how now you've

160
00:06:35,901 --> 00:06:36,581
meet Cory,

161
00:06:36,581 --> 00:06:39,920
it's you have $100 million
worth of free publicity.

162
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,900
Everybody knows your name if you're
at the peak of the evil hierarchy,

163
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:44,990
something like that.

164
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,300
And the press plays right into that.

165
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,550
And I'm shaking my finger at the press.

166
00:06:49,551 --> 00:06:53,210
It's a very complicated problem because
even if the main street press decided

167
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:56,540
that they weren't going to
save the names of the shooters,

168
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,190
which would be a very good idea,

169
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:01,880
I don't think that would stop the
damage from being pumped facades.

170
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:02,721
Okay.

171
00:07:02,721 --> 00:07:05,330
So it's a complicated technical problem.

172
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:09,980
I would say off the psychological front
12 that's the sort of discussion we're

173
00:07:09,981 --> 00:07:10,814
having tonight.

174
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:16,270
We need to have a discussion about why
it's wrong to take malevolent revenge

175
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,780
because there's reasons for it,

176
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,690
but it's wrong.

177
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,690
It's like you can understand it.

178
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:25,881
Well,

179
00:07:25,881 --> 00:07:29,530
you see there's outpourings of sympathy
often for the school shooter types.

180
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:29,751
All,

181
00:07:29,751 --> 00:07:31,730
they must have been terribly bullied.

182
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,301
It's like,

183
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:32,630
well,

184
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:36,770
how many of you were terribly
bullied when it's like 50% of you?

185
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:37,611
You know,

186
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:40,250
it's like you don't go out
and shoot up a high school,

187
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,970
you know who sold it.

188
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,770
It's it.

189
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,910
It's not.

190
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:45,800
Yes,

191
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,240
perhaps they were bullied,

192
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:49,370
but that doesn't justify the actions.

193
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:53,720
We need to have a serious discussion about
why it doesn't justify their actions.

194
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:58,960
And it's something like you don't get
to multiply your misery and inflicted on

195
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:00,530
the world.

196
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:03,500
That's wrong even though
it's understandable,

197
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,360
it's wrong.

198
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,021
And you know,

199
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:09,110
you'd think that maybe we could have
a serious discussion about this is the

200
00:08:09,111 --> 00:08:09,621
schools,

201
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:10,161
but like,

202
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:10,460
yeah,

203
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:10,790
right.

204
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:14,000
The problem that would happen
is like zero but don't.

205
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,980
But online you can have the discussion.

206
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,401
I mean,

207
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,170
part of the reasons that people had been.

208
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:19,040
Please,

209
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,570
I suppose with my lectures.

210
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:20,900
Oh,

211
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,560
they're very strange things to be pleased
about this because I do address these

212
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:26,060
things rather bluntly.

213
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:31,570
It's like life is hard and people
have a massive capacity for evil,

214
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,910
and it's no wonder that everyone's angry.

215
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,440
What's your point?

216
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,240
And to make it worse,

217
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,530
that's your plan.

218
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:40,131
Well,

219
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:41,150
that's just not a year.

220
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:43,370
That's his weak and the pathological.

221
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,630
It's pathetic.

222
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,710
It's cowardly.

223
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,510
It's not to be countenanced.

224
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,361
It's nothing too.

225
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,190
Amen.

226
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,950
There's nothing heroic about,

227
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,730
it's wrong.

228
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,451
It's wrong,

229
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,560
because it makes everything into hell.

230
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,630
And so you need to have serious
conversation about that.

231
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:03,390
Tonight is a serious
conversation about that.

232
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,610
So yeah.

233
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,100
[inaudible].
