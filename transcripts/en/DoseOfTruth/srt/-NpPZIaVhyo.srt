1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,810
Country Right now with all of you are on
the front end of it because the rest of

2
00:00:03,811 --> 00:00:07,260
the world is trying to catch up right
now and the fact that you guys are here,

3
00:00:07,261 --> 00:00:09,780
it shows that you saw at first and uh,

4
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,240
you were in for a treat for
the next hour and a half,

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,690
so everybody give it up for Dr. Jordan.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:22,270
Thank you.

7
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,460
Thank you.

8
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:05,900
I'm going to walk through.

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,680
I'm going to try to get
through all the rules.

10
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,883
I don't think I've met him

11
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,000
once in London,

12
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,130
but I'm going to give you the background
because there's two other things going

13
00:01:19,251 --> 00:01:24,251
on in my life right now that I'm trying
to sort out and I want to tie them

14
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:26,940
together and use this,

15
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,810
this chance to talk with you further.

16
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,510
Thinking on,

17
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:36,510
on all of these fronts simultaneously
I got invited a week and a half to do

18
00:01:36,921 --> 00:01:40,460
something that was really
an overwhelming honor to me.

19
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:41,763
Um,

20
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:46,780
the pain with penguin books and in the
UK is putting on the 50th anniversary

21
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,040
version of that.

22
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:04,780
Thanks.

23
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:10,500
I think it's hard to say.

24
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:11,430
No.

25
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:11,921
You can say.

26
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:12,754
Well,

27
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:17,440
I think that's the most important in
the 20th century and maybe it's not,

28
00:02:17,441 --> 00:02:22,441
but it's in the top 10 and we have an
overwhelming impact on me and I want to

29
00:02:23,621 --> 00:02:28,621
use the opportunity to write
that introduction to do
something that needs to be

30
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,384
done.

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,770
Um,

32
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:38,770
I was just in a debate on Saturday
in Toronto called the debates and

33
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:49,600
debate.

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Opponents to contend with was
the idea that just as the,

35
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,250
as the radical right can go too far,

36
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,050
that's a claim of both,

37
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:07,051
which is virtually no disagreement
except of course from the radical right.

38
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,410
A left and go far and historical evidence
for that is called overwhelming is to

39
00:03:14,471 --> 00:03:15,820
say almost nothing.

40
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,950
And one of the things I challenged
my opponents to do was to say,

41
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:20,381
well,

42
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,870
how do you know when the
radical left goes too far?

43
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,360
Because they can go too far.

44
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,643
You know,

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,210
one debate,

46
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,340
Michael Dyson,

47
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,800
he didn't answer the question at all.

48
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:31,630
There's not that he was
compelled to or anything.

49
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:32,500
It was up to him.

50
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,660
And the other one said,

51
00:03:34,661 --> 00:03:35,110
well,

52
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,321
you know,

53
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:36,520
when they become violent,

54
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:40,720
which to me is no answer golf because to
say that people have gone too far when

55
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,770
they've gone too far,

56
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:42,604
isn't helpful

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,510
for all of us civilized people assuming
that that's what we are are against

58
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:50,020
violence.

59
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,360
So it's not a very deep,

60
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,990
it's not a very deep analysis.

61
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,580
But the problem is that trying to figure
out putting the radical left is going

62
00:03:57,581 --> 00:03:59,020
to far is actually extraordinary,

63
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,380
extraordinarily difficult because there
isn't something that appears to be a

64
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,550
smoking pistol.

65
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,091
You know,

66
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:08,770
when the radical right starts speaking
claims of racial ethnic superiority and

67
00:04:08,771 --> 00:04:10,630
then starts to react
those up in the world.

68
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:10,961
You think,

69
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:11,231
okay,

70
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:13,440
well you guys are out
with the game like that.

71
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:14,710
That's not acceptable.

72
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,740
You want in the domain of civilized
dialogue anymore on the lab.

73
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,680
It's not so obvious when
things go off the rails.

74
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,550
You know,

75
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:28,470
and one of the things that really
like reading about reading the Gulag

76
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,373
archipelago,

77
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,530
I liked reading it because it's
not going to do like to read.

78
00:04:32,531 --> 00:04:33,191
It's slick.

79
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,280
The 1700 page scream of anguish,

80
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:36,700
you know,

81
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,960
it's tense,

82
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,163
tense.

83
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:42,580
But what Social India and I don't,

84
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:47,670
I think it was something that no one had
really done before him was to lay out

85
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:53,220
the evidence that the absolute
brutality of the Soviet Union was not an

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,590
aberration in relationship
to Marxist thinking,

87
00:04:56,591 --> 00:05:00,040
but a necessary consequence
of Marxist thinking.

88
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,580
But the problem of course is that the
argument spans something like 1700 pages

89
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:11,020
and that's not concise and I'm not
criticizing you because of that,

90
00:05:11,021 --> 00:05:11,854
because

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:18,000
because everything in that book needs to
be in there as far as I can tell to in

92
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:22,120
the world to survive because there's
things you have to eat and just sit there.

93
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,003
You die

94
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,013
in the world,

95
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,300
and even if you don't die,

96
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,070
we can just sit there and
you're going to suffer.

97
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,160
And so the antidote to
suffering in the world,

98
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,590
exactly what you're trying to do.

99
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:36,470
When you act in the world,

100
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,700
you're a preacher,

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,850
you're a 50 year particular physiology
reflects that extraordinary.

102
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,440
What you're trying to
do in the world is to,

103
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,500
is to make things better than they are.

104
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,470
When you're hungry,

105
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,440
to try to feed yourself,

106
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,780
find some uranium.

107
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,890
You're taking care of your
family so they don't suffer.

108
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,450
You're,

109
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:54,900
you're,

110
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:59,690
you're orienting yourself
towards something about and
so the first proposition

111
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:02,090
is you limited world.

112
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,710
Your frame of reference is valiantly.

113
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,970
Essentially what you're doing is moving
always from a place that isn't as good

114
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:11,990
as it could be to a place that someone
edit and you see the world through that

115
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:12,740
Lens.

116
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,140
You're at point a and you're going to
point B and point B is better than point a

117
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,190
and so because if it wasn't for
why would you bother with it?

118
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,040
Why would you put in the time and effort
if what you're moving towards is better

119
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:23,090
than what you have?

120
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,430
It's a matter of definition.

121
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,320
Even that if you're
acting for words a damn,

122
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,870
unless you've decided
to make things worse,

123
00:06:29,871 --> 00:06:31,040
and sometimes people do.

124
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:34,730
If you're acting towards it and you're
acting out the proposition that what

125
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,540
you're acting towards is bending with
what you have and so there's no escaping.

126
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,373
The world is valued.

127
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:43,820
Proposition number one and this
proposition number two would be there's no

128
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,050
escaping the social world,

129
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,210
so if you act other value proposition,

130
00:06:47,211 --> 00:06:49,930
you're going to do it socially
because you're surrounded by people.

131
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,570
You're not.

132
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:52,460
No Man is an island as they say,

133
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:55,490
and so if you've worked out the
proposition that one thing is better than

134
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:55,781
another,

135
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:58,370
it's going to do that with other people
and you're going to cooperate with them

136
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:00,860
and compete with them in
relationship to that endeavor.

137
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,330
If you go to law school,

138
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,160
some people are better
at school than others.

139
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:09,380
You go to the source therapist and some
people have a natural talent for that.

140
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,460
It's like so,

141
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,380
so what that means essentially,

142
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:14,210
and I think this is a universal truth.

143
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,990
I think that as soon as you implement
the value structure in a social situation

144
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:18,900
and produced a hierarchy,

145
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,780
and I think that we know that,

146
00:07:20,781 --> 00:07:23,990
I think that's respected and phenomena
like the freedom distribution and price

147
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:24,843
law,

148
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,340
that you formulate a hierarchy.

149
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:31,760
Some people are better at whatever the
hierarchy is than others and most people

150
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:35,090
start to stack up at the boss so
you get disproportionate success.

151
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,440
At the top along of minority,

152
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,060
and that's a well established,

153
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,903
that's bookmarks,

154
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:39,440
absurd.

155
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,250
Even though he made a specific case of it,

156
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,050
he said,

157
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:42,390
well,

158
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,130
pretend to accumulate the hands of fewer,

159
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,013
fewer people.

160
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,430
He met the same people across time and
he thought it was only wealth as far as I

161
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,264
can tell,

162
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,153
and

163
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,640
and they made a number of other mistakes
at all over talking to at the moment.

164
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,241
So okay,

165
00:07:56,241 --> 00:08:00,710
so you have to act out value in the world
and if you do so you're gonna produce

166
00:08:00,711 --> 00:08:01,820
a higher in a new producer,

167
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:06,080
higher you can produce winners and losers
and that actually is a problem because

168
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,510
of this electric of it has been.

169
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,160
It's actually quite painful than
your hierarchy is pretty inclusive,

170
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:14,800
especially if they really lose
because if you lose the now,

171
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,790
if you're way down to zero,

172
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:19,340
then if you don't have enough to eat,

173
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:23,050
you don't have medical care
like it gets painful happened.

174
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,893
It's happened.

175
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,410
Not because it's logically appropriate.

176
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:28,963
Anyways,

177
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:40,280
so hard about that for a long time with
our higher is because what it means is

178
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,123
that

179
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,970
the reality that we face isn't
the reality of a hierarchy.

180
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,380
It's the set of possible

181
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,200
and the rules that govern operation
in a reality that consists of a set of

182
00:09:00,781 --> 00:09:05,781
higher piece aren't the same rules
that govern success in a hierarchy.

183
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,070
So I can give you a quick example of that.

184
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:14,340
So imagine you have a child
who's playing the game.

185
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:14,940
Soccer,

186
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,773
let's say,

187
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,893
um,

188
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,070
for fucking,

189
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,970
since it's Boston Canadian.

190
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:24,990
No,

191
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,990
your kids play hockey and we'd
have Easter Gospel clarity,

192
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,220
but he's a little stingy with poc and uh,

193
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,230
and you know,

194
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:35,940
he plays a game.

195
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,070
You and he comes off the
ice and they lose and,

196
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,350
and stick down at the Smith has
a little temper tantrum and uh,

197
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,191
you know,

198
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,610
you,

199
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:45,570
you have some sense.

200
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,000
So you take them aside and say,

201
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,480
look,

202
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,690
it doesn't matter whether you win or lose,

203
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,470
it's how you play the games.

204
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:58,680
And he's not happy to hear that because
you kind of have a bit of a pout and he

205
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,520
looks at you like there's something wrong
with you and he doesn't know what you

206
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:06,630
mean because of course he's trying to
win and you probably encouraged him to

207
00:10:06,631 --> 00:10:07,260
win.

208
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,250
And so when you come out and say,

209
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:08,760
well,

210
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,010
the win or a how you play the game,

211
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,600
he doesn't know what you mean.

212
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,300
And then when he asked you what
do you mean you don't know,

213
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,980
you don't always make your own rules
predictory across the set of all possible

214
00:10:22,981 --> 00:10:23,451
hierarchy,

215
00:10:23,451 --> 00:10:27,490
but the rules were within one higher.

216
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,760
And what you're basically telling your
job is don't sacrifice the manner in

217
00:10:32,761 --> 00:10:37,761
which you would behave when the set of
possible games for victory won your game.

218
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,460
And that's because black
isn't a hockey game.

219
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,730
It's also not a series of kids.

220
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:47,210
It's more like a series of
hockey games than like one day.

221
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,090
But life is a series of hierarchies,

222
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,680
a series of games.

223
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,441
And you might say,

224
00:10:52,441 --> 00:10:54,310
well how do you win a series of games?

225
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,870
And one answer to that is you get
invited to play a lot of them.

226
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:01,590
Anybody that does that,

227
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:05,550
there's an almost an indefinite number
of ways of interpreting the world.

228
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:08,030
And then that's kind of
split the postmodernism,

229
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,030
say the 1966.

230
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,830
But how do you know how you
should interpret a book?

231
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,033
Fiction.

232
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,110
There's plenty ways to interpret a
piece of fiction after our people.

233
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,420
Well,

234
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:25,420
how many stable way of interpreting and
if there's no stable way of interpreting

235
00:11:25,741 --> 00:11:25,861
it,

236
00:11:25,861 --> 00:11:25,981
well,

237
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:27,610
how do you rank our per patient?

238
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:31,020
How do you know what interpretation is
better than the other on they're actually

239
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,053
what you can.

240
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,210
And so you don't.

241
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,520
And so there's no such in a sense,

242
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:38,820
there's no reliable judge
of quality literature.

243
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,140
It's arbitrary.

244
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,110
Well,

245
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:49,320
artificial intelligence people bond at
the same time trying to make machines to

246
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,351
proceed the world.

247
00:11:50,351 --> 00:11:54,610
It turns out the borders between things
are so easily drawn when we look at the

248
00:11:54,611 --> 00:11:56,470
world and I can see your own blind spots,

249
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,460
no effort on my part.

250
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:58,121
I just see it.

251
00:11:58,121 --> 00:11:58,810
But you know,

252
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,540
there's three and a half billion
years of evolution when into that.

253
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,370
It's an easy problem,

254
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,470
I can solve it,

255
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,870
but not because of any
particular color than mine,

256
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,220
right?

257
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,870
I'm the beneficiary of all this
adds and all the selection.

258
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,260
When they did that for three and a half,

259
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,340
building your process,

260
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,630
that doesn't mean it's easy.

261
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,600
It wouldn't have taken old.

262
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:22,610
That gap and all those years to manage
it was easy because it very large number

263
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,400
of ways of interpreting rope.

264
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,470
That does not mean that there's a very
large number of ways of interpreting the

265
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:34,090
world and that's where the
postmodernists gone seriously wrong.

266
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:39,490
So because think about the constraints
that the one you with regards to how you

267
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,660
have to improve the world.

268
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:41,740
First of all,

269
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,920
you can't just sit there
or you'll suffer and die.

270
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,920
So you have to go out there and act
in the world and that means there's,

271
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,731
there's problems.

272
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:52,570
You have to solve it or basically
grounded in your motivational structure.

273
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:53,010
You know,

274
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,040
you have to eat,

275
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,300
you have to find water,

276
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,500
you have to find shelter,

277
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,930
you have to regulate your temperature.

278
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,200
You have to play with others.

279
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,760
You have to find a mate.

280
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,570
You have to.

281
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:04,630
You have to pursue something that
produces a certain amount of positive

282
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,080
emotional pain,

283
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,160
don't want to be anxious like and you
don't like you coming quit with all of

284
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:16,411
those systems and also for your attention
and so you have to address those

285
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,490
issues or or things that are critical
Disney for you when it's worse than so not

286
00:13:21,491 --> 00:13:26,491
only are you are you governed by those
biological God's let's say and are in

287
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:28,060
some sense they're there,

288
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:33,460
but you have to figure out how to address
those problems today because you're

289
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:34,630
not just going to be around today.

290
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,800
You're going to be on today,

291
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:36,840
tomorrow,

292
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,200
next week and next month.

293
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,060
We're now in five years from now,

294
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:40,841
10 years from now,

295
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,660
so whatever solution
you come up with today,

296
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,494
which might be,

297
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,790
let's draw the bank,

298
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,510
has the word down the
road and let's rob a bank.

299
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:51,700
Mike worked quite nicely
today and next week,

300
00:13:51,701 --> 00:13:53,380
but as a five year strategy,

301
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,070
it's a problem with the idea of the one.

302
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,090
We know that because you can say,

303
00:13:58,091 --> 00:13:58,271
well,

304
00:13:58,271 --> 00:13:59,320
don't be an impulsive.

305
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,660
Well why not?

306
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:02,410
Well,

307
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:04,620
because it's medium to longterm strategy.

308
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:04,751
That's.

309
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:07,420
That's why it doesn't work very well.

310
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,423
Polarization

311
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,740
in society,

312
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:15,940
and I think the universities are

313
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,680
degrees and I think it's partly
because the intelligentsia isn't west,

314
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,880
has never prompted to
come to terms with their

315
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,610
listening complicitness in it.

316
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:44,190
What happened in radical
left societies be sorted out

317
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:46,673
and

318
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,730
published lubricant.

319
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,680
It became for a time completely
unacceptable to profess intellectual

320
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:04,750
admiration for the Marxist doctrine,

321
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,260
but and I think what happened in France,

322
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,940
the French intellectuals,

323
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:17,260
the people who dominate the particularly
pathological end of the social sciences

324
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:21,530
and the humanities in the university
has played the sleight of hand and

325
00:15:21,531 --> 00:15:26,531
transformed them that now ultimately
toxic Marxism into the current theories of

326
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:31,600
identity politics playing out in front
of us where the proper we to look.

327
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,670
The world is the war against every
other group with a narrative,

328
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:38,810
the whole pressure,

329
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,010
oppressor and victim,

330
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,880
and that leads nowhere.

331
00:15:43,881 --> 00:15:44,714
Good

332
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:48,410
on the left leads to exactly

333
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,480
leads to college campuses
that are so repressive.

334
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,320
Premiums will go tell jokes.

335
00:15:54,321 --> 00:15:59,321
They're in more a good thing because
the tyrant is definitely someone who

336
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,800
doesn't like Comedians,

337
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:15,260
especially as they're making fun of
you because especially if you have any

338
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:20,261
authority because maybe they'll remind
you of why you're going and you went into

339
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,080
attire and that would be a
good thing to be developed.

340
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:27,520
We hope for as your level of
authority increases the west,

341
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,770
that's where you want to hit this real

342
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,810
subjective experiences
like meeting are real.

343
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:39,740
It's not a strong theory
about as far as I'm concerned,

344
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,690
I think that you can make a very
strong case and I think you could make

345
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,420
scientific case for this as well.

346
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:53,170
That meaning is an extension of the sense
of need and invalid when you're doing

347
00:16:53,691 --> 00:16:58,691
something worthwhile is actually the
most profound to instinct that you have.

348
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,840
It's the most reliable thing there is.

349
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,580
It's the most real thing.

350
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,160
I spent quite a bit of time studying how
the brain works and you have instincts

351
00:17:17,691 --> 00:17:20,890
that orient you towards learning
a very fundamental instinct.

352
00:17:20,891 --> 00:17:22,160
This is called the orientee,

353
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:26,750
reflexively discovered by Russian
neuropsychologist back in the 19 sixties.

354
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:32,060
You Orient towards things that surprise
you and that's what opens the door to

355
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:36,830
learning and you can optimize
that process of learning methods,

356
00:17:36,831 --> 00:17:38,420
zone of proximal development,

357
00:17:38,421 --> 00:17:39,254
but therapists,

358
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:41,930
Zocor or something like that,

359
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,410
and it's an indication that
you're living on the edge.

360
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,840
On the edge is where secure.

361
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,730
Stabilize yourself

362
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,103
out there.

363
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,320
Don't understand.

364
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,080
It's an exciting place to be a lecturer
and meaningful place in the region.

365
00:18:04,321 --> 00:18:05,250
It's a meaningful place.

366
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,100
That's actually where you should be.

367
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,540
You're secure,

368
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,180
you're practicing what you don't,

369
00:18:11,181 --> 00:18:12,880
but you're getting better at it over time.

370
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:18,470
It's a place where your adaptation in
the real sense is expanding at an optimal

371
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,540
rate.

372
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,540
It's a place where you're offering so
you're going to be in a way that suits

373
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,410
you,

374
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,260
read to the future in a way that's going
to be good for your family when it's

375
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:31,470
going to be good for your community.

376
00:18:31,471 --> 00:18:33,090
So all these things stack up.

377
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Harmonious sense of meaning tells you
when you're orienting reflects that helps

378
00:18:38,881 --> 00:18:41,460
you identify where you should be standing,

379
00:18:41,461 --> 00:18:42,630
wherever you are,

380
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,290
wherever you should be communicating,

381
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,361
listening,

382
00:18:45,361 --> 00:18:46,350
wherever you are.

383
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,360
If you pay attention to that
advertisement in meaning been,

384
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:49,891
first of all,

385
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:51,150
you have meaningful life,

386
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:52,620
which is a very useful thing,

387
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,563
but secondly,

388
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:57,510
you are exactly where you
should be right here now,

389
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,910
so that's a good thing to note too,

390
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:04,911
because the meeting madness
certainly have pain as a meeting.

391
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,180
I know this trick of argument.

392
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,230
You're so fucking bad.

393
00:19:10,231 --> 00:19:11,280
It's not very useful,

394
00:19:11,281 --> 00:19:12,970
so we can certainly establish that.

395
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,393
Maybe you

396
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:16,800
might say,

397
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,400
well,

398
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,310
what about the meetings that help
you transcend the pain and suffering?

399
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,010
Turns out they are the
most critical thing.

400
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,680
What looks like to

401
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,160
me about the whole week in front of the
idea I'm facing the and restructuring

402
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:01,470
was her own reflections of the same.

403
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,920
The idea of facing the dragging
until people like all of that,

404
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:10,970
almost ancient heroic ideas and ideas
that are associated with an emergent

405
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,030
ethnic girl.

406
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:13,560
Variants of the same thing.

407
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,180
Girl,

408
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,080
our attempts to picture what it would
be like to be the proper human being.

409
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:21,070
Religious stories heard attempt,

410
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,880
but if you were ever thinking it could be,

411
00:20:23,881 --> 00:20:24,770
what would you be like?

412
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,400
Oh,

413
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,980
it's pretty complicated because
you're really complicated.

414
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,110
All we can get images and stories,

415
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,120
but what might be like,

416
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,680
we can't articulate it fully,

417
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,233
what were you,

418
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:39,900
what we all need to be in that because
it's the thing that will redeem us from

419
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:40,823
the house

420
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,320
and so

421
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:45,751
on.

422
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:46,584
A roll.

423
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,340
No,

424
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:53,340
this isn't just a battle between two
arbitrary ways of interpreting the world.

425
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,440
One of those ways is wrong.

426
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,173
It's the

427
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,220
wrong.

428
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:03,980
You just leads to catastrophe
rounded property infrastructure,

429
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,843
reality,

430
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,580
but the idea of individual who bears the
burden of being property faces his or

431
00:21:12,341 --> 00:21:14,390
her suffering in front school level,

432
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,310
who faces the unknown
restructures society would.

433
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:23,311
It becomes tyrannical at ethic of
fair play and courage that's deep.

434
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,710
The were oriented towards.

435
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,360
It manifests itself in
our instinct for it.

436
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,620
It allows us to live with ourselves,

437
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,450
the clear conscience,

438
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,680
able to everything we have
accepts our social world,

439
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:40,840
right?

440
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,660
And keeps us a good distance away from.

441
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,270
And that's what we could do
and that's where we need to be

442
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,700
thanked

443
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,990
for just a second.

444
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,940
Just to stretch his legs.

445
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,010
Friends,

446
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:10,030
the job where you're going
to take care of shit.

447
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,253
Now

448
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,223
you're hiring

449
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,383
somebody.

450
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,180
All right,

451
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,300
so here's what we're gonna do,

452
00:22:28,301 --> 00:22:30,340
so we're going to do a q and a,

453
00:22:30,341 --> 00:22:35,341
so you guys submitted questions and
there's literally hundreds here,

454
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,260
which I picked out some of the best ones.

455
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,590
I've actually loved the into
Jordan's computer right now,

456
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:46,190
which means I could jump on twitter
and end this whole fucking thing

457
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,200
quite close.

458
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,520
Alright,

459
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,780
so we're going to do
a little q and a here.

460
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:58,631
Everyone feel good?

461
00:22:58,631 --> 00:22:59,464
We're all good.

462
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:05,320
Thank you

463
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,340
Jordan.

464
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,770
Thank

465
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,430
you first because this is a 10th
or 11th and I'm not kidding.

466
00:23:24,281 --> 00:23:28,730
When I tell people you are different every
single month and is that part of your

467
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,413
plan?

468
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,400
Know

469
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,513
pretty good

470
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,360
audience because then you
can see what you're saying.

471
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:51,194
Makes Sense.

472
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,790
That's the whole,

473
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,480
that's the secret of free speech in some
stamps strength because that's how you

474
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:57,060
think.

475
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,480
It's just the thing

476
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:07,170
to see what we're thinking.

477
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:12,160
We're going do that by communicating
with people and seeing what happens when

478
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,290
you see where the consequences are.

479
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,380
I've been in a battle
in some sense in Canada

480
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,830
with people who are

481
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,380
so they're so careless that they think
it's okay to introduce legislation that

482
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,580
restricts people's.

483
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:35,720
Asked me to communicate
like I don't get that.

484
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,190
It's a sin

485
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,220
to this political debate,

486
00:24:43,310 --> 00:24:44,143
let's say,

487
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,400
but it's not political
as far as I'm concerned.

488
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,840
What's happened is that the politicians
did something that wasn't political

489
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:54,060
thing jumped outside of
their proper domain of,

490
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,690
of activity.

491
00:24:56,890 --> 00:25:00,410
It was like they went down
to the constitutional level
or even lower than that,

492
00:25:00,411 --> 00:25:00,610
so.

493
00:25:00,610 --> 00:25:00,830
Well,

494
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:01,191
it's okay.

495
00:25:01,191 --> 00:25:02,450
You can mess around with this.

496
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,980
It's like it's not okay.

497
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,240
You're not gonna.

498
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,500
Justify telling people what did they can
say on the ground with some fictitious

499
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:10,334
compassion,

500
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,590
freedom nonfic dishes to passion for that.

501
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,663
First of all,

502
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:20,310
thank you.

503
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:23,690
Don't,

504
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:28,690
because you're kind of predict the supreme
court ruled that compelled speech was

505
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,293
unconstitutional.

506
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,440
Thank you.

507
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,640
How do you remain so calm in the face
of overwhelming close mindedness?

508
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:48,891
I don't know.

509
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:49,724
If I do.

510
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,550
I'm probably.

511
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,460
There are much less than
would appear in public,

512
00:26:02,570 --> 00:26:03,403
so my family,

513
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,600
my wife who's hiding
somewhere in the audience.

514
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Thank that.

515
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:23,220
I have pretty good support network is
very much with being on this kids or

516
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,543
parents

517
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:34,550
or friends around me watch
me going through all this
and criticizes me when they

518
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:35,620
think it's necessary,

519
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,553
know,

520
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:43,040
have all of this clinical
experience that helps you.

521
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:47,830
When I talk with Katherine Newman and

522
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,233
she.

523
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,753
She

524
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,220
sat down and talked to her
when the cameras were off.

525
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:07,200
She was quite friendly and then the
counters when she was a whole different

526
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:09,750
person and I saw that

527
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,050
don't be thinking you

528
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,523
don't

529
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,093
know

530
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,780
what's going on here,

531
00:27:25,781 --> 00:27:26,614
but it just.

532
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,080
So I just watched her and I

533
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,340
figured out almost immediately that
whoever she was interviewing for no

534
00:27:38,341 --> 00:27:39,510
resemblance to me.

535
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:42,983
Interesting.

536
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,360
Talking to journalists and I think the
New York Times article is a good example

537
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:53,361
of that was that was a strange experience
because the young woman who wrote that

538
00:27:53,551 --> 00:27:54,001
article,

539
00:27:54,001 --> 00:27:56,880
she hung around with me for about
two days and she was in my house,

540
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,800
my house when she called
the Chamber of horrors,

541
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,010
which

542
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,110
does have some rough in because

543
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:25,663
she was.

544
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,090
She was very friendly,

545
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,110
very open to it.

546
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:35,111
I'm very supportive and engaged and
apparently during that was true and

547
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,111
he might say,

548
00:28:40,111 --> 00:28:40,291
well,

549
00:28:40,291 --> 00:28:44,850
why bother talking to journalists and
that sort of thing happens is first of

550
00:28:44,851 --> 00:28:44,951
all,

551
00:28:44,951 --> 00:28:48,430
it doesn't happen all the time by many,

552
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,480
many journalists.

553
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:53,970
It's like 200 newspapers in Canada a
year ago came up with support what it was

554
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:54,660
doing,

555
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,590
so you have to keep the map.

556
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,493
The good.

557
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,170
Can't complain about that,

558
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,310
but more importantly,

559
00:28:59,311 --> 00:29:00,730
I think it's not so bad.

560
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,160
People revealed their hands.

561
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,320
If you talk to people
and watched and listen,

562
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:11,490
then they revealed your hands so
everyone can see what they're playing and

563
00:29:11,491 --> 00:29:12,600
that's happened to me

564
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,330
40 times.

565
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:17,880
Probably maybe more in the last two years.

566
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,530
People come after me and say,

567
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:19,711
well,

568
00:29:19,711 --> 00:29:20,700
you must be this

569
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:26,650
incarnation of a saint
tammany figure your way.

570
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,730
That's not true

571
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,790
and what's happening in various that it's
been harder on the journalists than on

572
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,360
me and I'm not calling people to continue.

573
00:29:38,361 --> 00:29:38,641
In fact,

574
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:43,180
I have good friends who think that
the New York Times basically some as a

575
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,900
respectable figure,

576
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:48,400
but I'm actually concerned
with being respectful.

577
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,960
So you're saying if you
want to sleep with tech,

578
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,300
you could ask one question.

579
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:20,263
Alright.

580
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,470
I'd like to ask them how you
figured out what I figured out

581
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:26,603
things

582
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,910
incalculably intelligent.

583
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:31,660
You know,

584
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,493
when I read,

585
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,440
I read everything he wrote in the 19
nineties about stuff wasn't like I

586
00:30:40,121 --> 00:30:45,040
understood all of it because it's tough
going and I've just done to figure out

587
00:30:45,041 --> 00:30:46,840
how he can figure out what you did.

588
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:49,010
Maybe you have maybe you know,

589
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:52,520
people do one in a billion.

590
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,320
No,

591
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:58,320
maybe it was one in a billion so he could
see things that I can't figure out how

592
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,803
anyone

593
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,163
see

594
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,870
if you have a gift for imagination,

595
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,103
you know,

596
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,400
some people are very good at articulation,

597
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:15,790
every good thinking in words and some
people are good at thinking in pictures

598
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:18,430
and he seemed to be really good at both.

599
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:18,920
You know,

600
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,170
we had a tremendous advantage.

601
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,250
Dream essentially infant learn how to
do that and seem to learn all sorts of

602
00:31:26,711 --> 00:31:28,350
things from his weekend dreams.

603
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,660
If I can do that little bit.

604
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:33,310
Sometimes when I'm doing
therapy with people,

605
00:31:33,311 --> 00:31:34,144
for example,

606
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:37,960
I'll be listening to the clinical picture
of my head or a little fragment of the

607
00:31:37,961 --> 00:31:38,794
story.

608
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,490
No,

609
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,900
what country it comes with,

610
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:45,070
imagery and it's sort of in background
and then I'll notice it and then I'll

611
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:45,904
tell them,

612
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,940
look when you said that this
happened in my imagination,

613
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:53,530
we can take apart the relationship between
what they said and what happened in

614
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:57,190
my imagination that usually ship
substantial light on what's going on.

615
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,440
But he was an absolute master at that.

616
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:01,450
So I do.

617
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,380
I find out from him how he managed
that and maybe you could say it,

618
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:09,070
but I sure like to know
I've met anyone like that.

619
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:15,110
So there were a couple of questions
here asking you to clarify.

620
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,071
It's forced.

621
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:16,904
Phenomenal.

622
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:22,550
Should we bust out their phones
for this one recording of this?

623
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:24,920
If you can do it in two minutes
and we'll throw it up on twitter.

624
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,330
Yeah.

625
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:33,410
You guys want to punch out your phones
for this one just so we get some video

626
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,870
with your answers for the

627
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,750
enemies respond well to.

628
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,550
So I'll,

629
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:48,770
I'll ask the question.

630
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,090
So the question is,

631
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,350
what do you mean by
force without doing well?

632
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:01,350
We could start by saying,

633
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,270
don't be.

634
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,690
I don't mean taking innocent women at
gunpoint and happy over to useless man

635
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:11,430
accusation.

636
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,700
It was really interesting
to watch that unfold.

637
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:18,890
What I meant was that monogamy as,

638
00:33:18,891 --> 00:33:19,160
uh,

639
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:23,510
as something that's socially valued is,

640
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,480
appears to be essentially
a human universal.

641
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:31,830
That doesn't mean that human beings are
universally monogamous because officers,

642
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,380
we're not serially monogamous in.

643
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:37,610
Some people have multiple
partners and all of that,

644
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:41,330
but here's a strong proclivity across.

645
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,780
No society can tilt towards monogamy
and the enforcement is social norms.

646
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:53,600
Think about it and I can't
believe that I have to say this

647
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,650
just gets buried.

648
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,890
And he comes home and he says,

649
00:33:58,580 --> 00:33:59,090
Dad,

650
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,760
I've been screwing around.

651
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,513
Know

652
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:10,550
you're not happy about that.

653
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:13,520
And he doesn't count because he knows
you're not going to be happy about it.

654
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,770
And that's the fourth monogamy.

655
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,480
It's part of the social structure.

656
00:34:17,481 --> 00:34:18,330
It's like what?

657
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,250
It's like.

658
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:20,420
Well,

659
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:24,620
most people want a monogamous relationship
and if they enter into a relationship

660
00:34:24,621 --> 00:34:25,050
with someone,

661
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,180
they're not happy.

662
00:34:26,181 --> 00:34:28,960
If that person goes to the surround view,

663
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:29,880
he would be happy.

664
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:30,713
If that happens.

665
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,560
That's part of enforced.

666
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,300
It's part of this moment and you
might have noticed the problem.

667
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,240
Get polygamy is actually illegal.

668
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,780
You.

669
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,093
It's

670
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,460
be known for 100 years after most
of whom are left leaning by the way,

671
00:34:54,771 --> 00:34:56,180
because that's how it goes.

672
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,480
That monogamous social structures
are one of the ways we keep children

673
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:08,180
raised property so that they have a
relatively stable environment and then you

674
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:09,890
keep male aggression,

675
00:35:09,891 --> 00:35:14,120
especially the aggression of young men
under some degree of social control.

676
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,770
It's not a mystery.

677
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:20,340
The fact that I got in trouble for
that is it's kind of a miracle foot

678
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:25,320
notice that worth it.

679
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,220
Like almost every way.

680
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:33,360
The same thing happens all over the world
and alternative diverse societies and

681
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:35,190
then when we deviate from that,

682
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,370
there's a price to be paid so and so.

683
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:43,371
That's why like I'm a New York Times
pariah is because I think the minority all

684
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:47,160
things considered is a good idea.

685
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,890
Thank

686
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:13,343
you.

687
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,040
Thank

688
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,483
you.

689
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,993
So

690
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:34,040
do you have any advice for someone who
correctly identified versus a bad choice

691
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,920
but has difficulty following

692
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,173
through

693
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:56,993
Christ

694
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,333
to someone

695
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,340
who is white?

696
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,940
It's harder to do the right
thing off that because of

697
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,670
the precedent for the future is
the sacrificial gesture to do

698
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,840
sacrifice and so interesting.

699
00:37:18,841 --> 00:37:23,430
It's one of the things I about quite
a bit in promos to figure that out.

700
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:24,930
I'm really happy about that,

701
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,900
that I sent them ritual sacrifice.

702
00:37:27,901 --> 00:37:28,081
You know,

703
00:37:28,081 --> 00:37:29,620
you read a book sacrificial rituals,

704
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,340
what those people up to,

705
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,140
no burden.

706
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,903
It's like

707
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:43,170
one of the most fundamental discoveries
that human beings ever made.

708
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,700
It's absolutely unbelievable that we
figured out that you can sacrifice

709
00:37:47,701 --> 00:37:49,640
something of value in the president,

710
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,440
gain something of value in the future.

711
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,490
That's the future,

712
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:54,660
right?

713
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,660
That's the delayed gratification
scaffold on which context,

714
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:07,020
thanks

715
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,530
before we can understand it,

716
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,640
and so that's what those
rituals were about,

717
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,530
was acting that out for thousands
of years before we can say,

718
00:38:16,531 --> 00:38:17,364
well,

719
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:19,840
what sort of sacrifices
did your parents think?

720
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,640
And here's what we know,

721
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,360
what the sacrificial is.

722
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,700
So it's difficult to sacrifice the present
for the future because it means the

723
00:38:29,701 --> 00:38:31,610
foregoing of gratification,

724
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:32,370
you know,

725
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:34,410
you need to be gratifying now,

726
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,880
have some water now.

727
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,900
You have to have sex now,

728
00:38:40,350 --> 00:38:42,260
but for the future is also we'll.

729
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,070
So you have to learn how to balance
the future was the precedent.

730
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:46,923
That's hard.

731
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:47,650
And I would say,

732
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:49,880
well you do that the same way.

733
00:38:49,881 --> 00:38:50,980
If you do that for yourself,

734
00:38:50,981 --> 00:38:53,920
the same what you do for a child
that you care for it is that you,

735
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:54,920
you,

736
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,840
you discipline yourself gently.

737
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:02,380
And the way you do that is by setting
yourself tasks that are hard but possible.

738
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:03,443
You know,

739
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:06,940
you have to get up in rule four,

740
00:39:06,941 --> 00:39:07,481
I think it is.

741
00:39:07,481 --> 00:39:11,570
Compare yourself with who you
were yesterday and with some,

742
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,210
with someone else's today,

743
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:16,990
it's like what you want to do is be a
little better than you were yesterday.

744
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:19,330
And you might say what's a little bit,

745
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:20,200
well,

746
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,870
it has to be announced so that
you're happy if it happens,

747
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,160
but not so little,

748
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:25,750
but it's a trivial accomplishment.

749
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,400
And then he kind of calibrated.

750
00:39:27,401 --> 00:39:29,140
It's like you know,

751
00:39:29,141 --> 00:39:32,200
you're not interested in playing a
game that you can win every time.

752
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:33,430
You're kind of a full,

753
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:37,180
under no circumstances do you want to
have a pretty decent shot at winning,

754
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:40,350
but maybe that your skill
improves while you're playing it,

755
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:42,460
so that's what did you set
yourself a task and think,

756
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:42,570
well,

757
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,870
I can probably in this,

758
00:39:43,871 --> 00:39:47,020
it's a little bit outside
of my zone of comfort.

759
00:39:47,021 --> 00:39:49,810
Let's say it's a little bit
of white habitual practice,

760
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,300
but I think I can do it tomorrow.

761
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:53,470
I can do it for a week,

762
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,860
and then if you can't do it while they
lower your sights a little bit now,

763
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,701
lower your sights,

764
00:39:57,701 --> 00:40:00,100
tell you a little better,

765
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:01,181
then you think,

766
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:01,361
oh,

767
00:40:01,361 --> 00:40:02,440
there's my zone.

768
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,600
I can I can improve at this rate.

769
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:07,420
You'll find that that's
a meaningful place to be.

770
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,830
It wouldn't be at the place where you
could improve a little bit constantly and

771
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:14,500
you can find that experiment
that takes humility,

772
00:40:14,501 --> 00:40:15,280
right?

773
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:15,790
Jennifer,

774
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,800
because you're not as good at
getting better as you think you.
