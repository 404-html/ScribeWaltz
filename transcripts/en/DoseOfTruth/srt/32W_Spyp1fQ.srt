1
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,650
Kids
and that doesn't necessarily sound very

2
00:00:20,531 --> 00:00:22,810
important.
They're just

3
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:27,330
really,
again,

4
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:32,340
is actually a microcosm of world just
like any play.

5
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,460
Normally
the microcosm of normals are capitalism

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,280
and say you've been learning people
about like playing because even though

7
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,210
it's the board is real,
people with real emotions that will be

8
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:58,810
relevant in real
until you can see what their funding,

9
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:05,200
if they're funding play in
winning,

10
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,050
he attributes
it detached themselves from a little bit

11
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:13,010
so that it's easy.
Hey,

12
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,340
remember that it's like the
sophisticated things.

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,320
It's fundamental a rate by testing to
play with your testing,

14
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:26,210
how well they match was and so that's
what kids do.

15
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,580
Play Games with their friends too.
It's more complicated because those

16
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,960
games,
especially if they're pretending.

17
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,710
So let's say kids freaking excited,
going to play house.

18
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:42,840
This is a common kits and pavement first
thing that it was negotiation,

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,500
so screenwriters and say,
will you be the mom that you need the

20
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:49,310
data?

21
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:52,290
You know,
you can be the cat and then if everyone

22
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:56,400
wants to play that role,
but that's the first thing the kids

23
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:58,100
have.
All the kids have to one play

24
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:01,650
voluntarily or not,
so that's a good thing to keep in mind.

25
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,320
Everybody accepts the goal and then you
might say,

26
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:08,010
well then they go and imitate the mother
and the father and the cap,

27
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:10,940
but they don't actually imitate them
because like if I was entertaining,

28
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,960
you would move exactly the same way you
will,

29
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,590
but if I was caricatured review,
let's say I got to know you a little

30
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:21,450
bit,
then I can kind of adopt the spirit of

31
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,000
your voice and your mannerisms.
Whatever they are,

32
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,380
I could extract from you a pattern of
church artist doing.

33
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,890
I could avoid that pattern on some long
more sophisticated interest invitation

34
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,650
and that's what the kids are trying to
do when they play house and I'm

35
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,910
indicating their father because they
weren't doing exactly the same movements

36
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:40,440
that the father was doing.

37
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,640
They've watched the quad that need the
father over multiple contexts and

38
00:02:44,641 --> 00:02:49,641
they've extracted on the commonalities
across those contexts and portrayed that

39
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:53,160
with the term terms.
You can think about that as a spirit.

40
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,450
It's the spirit of that being the
partner across multiple contexts and

41
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:02,451
then they're acting that representing a
play and so they can say what they're

42
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:06,490
doing and they can't tell them what the
rules are,

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,540
but they can use their own body to
represent this incredibly complex thing

44
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:13,430
that they don't understand and they
could do the same thing with mother.

45
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:16,480
They can play with a goal and feed it
and do all those things,

46
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:18,840
but the mother doesn't can practice
being a mother,

47
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,870
so they learn how to do this ideal.
Describe it.

48
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,390
There's a lot of things that we knew
like that and so we know how to act out

49
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,820
things that you don't understand it now.

50
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:38,160
Eventually we figured out collectively
over the 10 years you've been trying to

51
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:42,150
figure things out,
how to act in a manner that makes us

52
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:45,280
essentially civilized,
civilized.

53
00:03:45,281 --> 00:03:49,120
That enables us to sit in this group
even though we don't know each other and

54
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:53,380
to all the same thing,
to all the same posture and to all about

55
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,270
essentially the same attitude,
Nsap,

56
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,510
emotional state,
and to thereby being predictable to one

57
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:02,410
another and to be safe with one,
which is what we're doing right now.

58
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,350
It's a ritual.
Everyone understands it's a theatrical

59
00:04:05,351 --> 00:04:09,850
Richard that everyone understands and
the fact that everyone is doing the same

60
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,600
thing means that we can all be virtually
assured that at the moment we're all

61
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:17,950
holding the same ideal and that's why
we're not terrified because if someone,

62
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,960
all of a sudden I stood up and branch to
90 nineties,

63
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,480
this was not be the same place.

64
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,780
Right?
It was seriously,

65
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,340
you don't want the same place and you
wouldn't be using the same part of your

66
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:30,900
brain to process.
It would switch instantly and you'd be

67
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:34,150
possessed by ancient motivational
states,

68
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,810
terror and rage and the preparation for
action.

69
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:42,160
That would be completely outside of the
neurological systems that you're using

70
00:04:42,161 --> 00:04:46,150
to orient yourself at this moment and
people do not like it.

71
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,720
When that happens.
We don't like even if someone,

72
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:52,690
you know what that's like,
if you're walking down the street and

73
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:56,920
you see someone who's doing something
that isn't normal,

74
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,560
like maybe they're muttering to
themselves preaching a little bit or

75
00:04:59,561 --> 00:05:01,900
something like that and they're a little
disheveled,

76
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,820
you'll do what almost everyone does,
which is we'll give them a wide berth

77
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:11,170
and you'll keep on walking and you
probably do what you can not to make eye

78
00:05:11,171 --> 00:05:14,680
contact because that's an invitation,
so you're,

79
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:15,100
you're.

80
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,690
You walk down the street and you think,
oh,

81
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,500
there's some unexplored territory
circumvented that,

82
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,560
and then you continue on so everything
you can as a consequence of your options

83
00:05:25,811 --> 00:05:30,520
to stop yourself from being exposed to
anything that disrupts the stability of

84
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,970
the theory that you're using to
orientate yourself in the world.

85
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,070
That's why people hold onto their
theories because underneath that is like

86
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:41,640
terror rage and you don't want that
coming up and so we don't take it

87
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:45,790
kindly.
People come along and masks are the

88
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:49,270
axioms of our theories.
We seriously look like that and that's

89
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,690
partly why people are so motivated to
protect their belief systems.

90
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:55,120
Right?
It's not only that we construe the world

91
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,460
with our belief systems,
we organize our social behavior,

92
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,920
we started building systems,
and so if you mess with the belief

93
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,560
systems,
you mess with the structure that makes

94
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:05,900
everyone predictable to everyone else.

95
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:10,370
And that is not.
There's nothing been down that path,

96
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,080
that's for sure.
Alright,

97
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:17,200
so now
we've learned how to act out this

98
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:20,990
pattern.
It makes us acceptable and desirable

99
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:25,940
project and we're constantly reminding
each other how to do that because like

100
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:29,830
if you go to a party,
you're gonna want people who knows when

101
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,480
you walk by.
If you're the typical person,

102
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:34,700
a typical reasonably well socialized
person,

103
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,340
you're going to want people to like you
more than they dislike what you're going

104
00:06:38,341 --> 00:06:42,200
to want to pay some attention to you.
You're going to want to engage people in

105
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,260
interesting conversation.
Maybe you're going to want people to

106
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:49,780
appreciate you and you know if you want
to have a good time to have a good time

107
00:06:49,990 --> 00:06:54,380
party needs to act in a certain way that
elicits a certain set of responses from

108
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:56,300
other people.
And if you fail it,

109
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:59,630
that they will tell you,
they'll ignore you,

110
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,320
they won't laugh at your jokes,
you know they'll move away from you.

111
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:06,480
There's all sorts of reasons.
There's all sorts of things they will do

112
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:10,010
to broadcast at you,
your deviation from the ideal.

113
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,180
And that can be very painful,
right?

114
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:16,370
Especially if you're very deviant from
the ideal because it opens up this

115
00:07:16,371 --> 00:07:19,670
realization that you just don't know
what they hell you're doing at all,

116
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:23,380
and that either means that other people
are contemptible and horrible and

117
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:26,990
something should be done about that or
that there's something seriously wrong

118
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:30,440
with you that needs to be rectified.
And neither of those options are very

119
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:34,050
pleasant.
So we carry within us,

120
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:37,210
let's say,
implicit ideal that we carry within us.

121
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,890
A counter idea as well.
The opposite of that.

122
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,630
That's an introduction in some sense to
the landscape of good and evil because

123
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:48,790
the ultimate ideal is whatever is good,
that the ultimate counter ideal is

124
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:53,270
whatever's evil.
So that's the space within which we map

125
00:07:53,271 --> 00:07:58,271
our behaviors and we can't help but map
out that space because it's.

126
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:02,120
It constitutes the most extreme version
of this structure that we use to

127
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:05,060
evaluate everything everyone else does
in everything we do.

128
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:09,230
We also know that that's the case
because when you go to a movie,

129
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:12,110
even though you don't know that you know
it's the case,

130
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,680
you go to a movie,
let's say it's an action group or it

131
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,180
doesn't matter.
It could be a roadmap.

132
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,000
Maybe those are the two basic categories
of foods.

133
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,610
Naturally he has a hero if you're is
either greg or partially do like a

134
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:28,880
complex here,
but in kind of a flawed and interesting

135
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:29,714
way.
Right?

136
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:34,340
And then of course in an action movie,
there's the evil bad guy as well,

137
00:08:34,341 --> 00:08:37,640
but hopefully he's not good enough
because otherwise it's a caricatures,

138
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,690
but always into movies.
You have that hero and the villain and

139
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:46,890
the intermodal maxwell that you have the
person who's the love interest in all

140
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,830
those who've failed to measure up.

141
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,370
And so it's the same thing.
It's just played out for different

142
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,170
reasons.
So you know it's,

143
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:59,300
it's difficult to understand that if you
go to see your movie,

144
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,570
which is fiction,
isn't real,

145
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:08,880
then it's also more real than real
because otherwise you either watching

146
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,690
it,
you don't want the movie director to

147
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:17,370
show you how many times the protagonists
links before they get out of bed in the

148
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,310
morning.
It's not interesting when you want them

149
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:25,311
to do is to take the full panoply of
here with behavior and only extract from

150
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:31,560
it those instances that are particular
interest in relationship to the

151
00:09:31,561 --> 00:09:34,280
portrayal of that ideal or the counter
id.

152
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,980
You want to see why they're bad guys bad
and you want to see why the group guys

153
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:42,660
good and that's more real than reality
because it's abstracted from reality.

154
00:09:42,661 --> 00:09:45,960
It's more real than reality.
Like numbers are more real than the

155
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,630
things that are derived from some form
of abstraction.

156
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,050
Right?
And it doesn't.

157
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,060
It makes perfect sense that when you
want to extract from fictional

158
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:56,550
representations,
there's represent representations of

159
00:09:56,551 --> 00:09:59,520
what's good and what's evil,
so that in principle,

160
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,930
assuming that this is what you want,
you could do a better job of embodying

161
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,130
what's good because then everything
would go well for you in the world

162
00:10:07,131 --> 00:10:08,790
world,
assuming that that's what you want,

163
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,780
so there's probably nothing more
important than you could possibly do

164
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:14,310
that.
No do that,

165
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:17,160
and that's why you treat it like it's
more important than anything else.

166
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,320
You can do this.
If you think about it,

167
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,790
you will go to a movie and you'll line
up and you pay to be exposed to that

168
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:28,140
kind of information and that's an.
That's an indication of exactly how it

169
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,770
is,
right?

170
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,740
You actually find most of you,
and if it isn't movies slogan,

171
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,530
it's it's fiction or or stories that
people tell you,

172
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,880
no interest whatsoever in people and
that's very rare.

173
00:10:38,990 --> 00:10:41,790
If even if that's the case,
you'll find that science fiction or

174
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,120
something else like that where the
mythology creeps into the technology

175
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,640
doesn't really matter.
It's going to come at you one way or

176
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:52,590
another and the fact that you will pay
to expose yourself to that and then also

177
00:10:52,591 --> 00:10:57,510
that when you go into those venues,
be entranced by it despite yourself,

178
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,730
despite the fact that you know,
is real,

179
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,600
is an indication of exactly how
important that information is.
