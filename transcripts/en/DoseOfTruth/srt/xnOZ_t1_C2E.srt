1
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:09,820
So now there's this idea that there's a,

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,660
there's the possibility of opening up
a line of communication between human

3
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:15,610
psyche and the transcendent divine.

4
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:17,200
And there's a,

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,930
there's a great image of Christ as Pantry.

6
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,901
They're so creative,

7
00:00:20,901 --> 00:00:23,660
the world at just one
of the first mosaics,

8
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:24,920
if I remember correctly.

9
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:25,740
And I wish I knew,

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,750
remember where it was,

11
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:27,500
but I don't,

12
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:27,751
but it's,

13
00:00:27,751 --> 00:00:29,180
it's a very interesting image.

14
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,330
I'm having a carving of it made
at the moment by a friend of mine.

15
00:00:32,331 --> 00:00:37,331
But you see Christ's face in me portrayed
in a medieval manner and he's holding

16
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:39,561
a book.

17
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:42,290
So it symbolizes the importance of,

18
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:42,981
of the book,

19
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:43,310
you know,

20
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:43,790
uh,

21
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,620
as a means of transmitting wisdom.

22
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,060
And his face is very asymmetrical
and the eyes are different.

23
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,110
One side and the other,

24
00:00:51,111 --> 00:00:54,290
and one half of the face
represents the human part.

25
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:57,290
And the other side of the face
represents the divine part.

26
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,250
And you know,

27
00:00:58,251 --> 00:01:03,251
I also think about that psychologically
because I do think that that's the right

28
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:08,390
way to conceptualize human beings is that
there's an aspect of us that's mortal

29
00:01:08,391 --> 00:01:09,620
and cumin and limited,

30
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:12,830
but there's an aspect of us that's
transcendent and divine as well.

31
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,540
And it's latent in some sense.

32
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,030
But there are times when
it manifests itself.

33
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:19,280
And this is not speculation,

34
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,660
right?

35
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,510
This is like the oldest
experience of human beings.

36
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:23,900
Now,

37
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,600
it's not necessarily an
easy experience to have,

38
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,550
but it's reported everywhere.

39
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,510
And it can be reliably induced as we've
discussed before by chemical means,

40
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:32,900
which,

41
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,910
and I don't know what that means exactly.

42
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:37,700
We've talked a little bit about
silicide mushrooms for example.

43
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:41,450
And you could say that the mystical
experiences that have been invoked in the

44
00:01:41,451 --> 00:01:46,451
newest experiments down it at Johns
Hopkins are derangements or forms of

45
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:47,990
psychosis,

46
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,351
you know,

47
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:52,490
because they have some similarity
to psycho psychotic experiences.

48
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,470
Although psychotic people were given
LSD in the 60s and they always said that

49
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:59,540
that was something different
than what they were having.

50
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,270
And if you give psychotic
people amphetamines,

51
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:03,350
you can make them worse.

52
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,000
So there biochemically separate.

53
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,200
And we know that.

54
00:02:06,201 --> 00:02:06,650
And,

55
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:10,090
but also the thing that's so interesting
about the psilocybin experiences is

56
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:14,510
that they reliably produce mystical
experiences that the people rate as among

57
00:02:14,511 --> 00:02:16,430
the most important
experiences of their life.

58
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:20,540
And among those who have
the psychedelic experience,

59
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,910
positive things happen to them.

60
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,850
And so that kind of messes with
the whole psychosis theory,

61
00:02:25,851 --> 00:02:26,091
right?

62
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,140
Because what are you going to do?

63
00:02:27,141 --> 00:02:30,230
You're going to claim that you give
someone a pill and they have a psychotic

64
00:02:30,231 --> 00:02:31,430
break and then they're healthier.

65
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:31,971
It's like,

66
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:32,660
no,

67
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,550
that isn't how psychotic breaks work.

68
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,500
You're not healthier after having one.

69
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,580
You're like,

70
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,340
you're a broken egg and it's not
easy to put you back together.

71
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,683
So,

72
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,290
and we know that people all over the
world have discovered every manner of

73
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,900
psychedelic substance
that you could possibly,

74
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,020
while you imagine there's lots of hungry
people wandering the earth for a long

75
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:54,050
time and they eat every damn thing
they could get their hands on and now,

76
00:02:54,051 --> 00:02:57,470
and then something very peculiar
happened as a consequence.

77
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,903
So,

78
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,430
so here I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the Shamani tradition because

79
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:08,110
it's associated with Jacob's ladder.

80
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:08,880
So,

81
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,640
um,

82
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,480
according to Elliot at Mircea Eliade,

83
00:03:11,481 --> 00:03:12,940
who was a great historian of religion,

84
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,930
a compatriot of viewings and,

85
00:03:14,931 --> 00:03:15,261
and,

86
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,710
and the influenced each
other quite substantially.

87
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:22,870
Eliana believed that shamanism that used
psychedelics was a degeneration from

88
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,770
the original,

89
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,360
more pure shamanism.

90
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:28,790
But I think later scholarship has
demonstrated that that's incorrect,

91
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:34,350
that the show ritual per se was a direct
consequence of the use discovery of Ed

92
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,870
and ritualistic use of
psychedelic substances.

93
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:38,703
But anyways,

94
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,010
Eliana identified three pathways
to shamanism and the Sharman in it,

95
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:49,701
in a tribe was more educated than the
typical person with a larger vocabulary

96
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,850
and was the repository
of the oral tradition.

97
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:59,230
And so learned all the stories
that had been passed down.

98
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,101
Word of mouth.

99
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:01,210
And people by the way,

100
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:01,571
are very,

101
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,404
very,

102
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,251
can very,

103
00:04:03,251 --> 00:04:06,160
very accurately tell the same
story across generations.

104
00:04:06,161 --> 00:04:07,780
That's been quite well documented.

105
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,860
So,

106
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:09,130
and,

107
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:13,690
and people who can't read
really can remember cause
what else are they gonna do?

108
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,890
Their memories are far greater than
modern people's memories because we can

109
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,630
forget everything because
we can just look it up.

110
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:22,900
But they remembered things
because they had no choice.

111
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,500
My father knew someone
who was a illiterate and,

112
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,030
and,

113
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:27,370
and,

114
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:29,490
and couldn't use numbers either when,

115
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,180
when he grew up in Saskatchewan,

116
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,470
you know,

117
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:33,430
60 years ago.

118
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,661
And he was,

119
00:04:34,661 --> 00:04:35,350
uh,

120
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,011
he had a sheep,

121
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:37,180
if I remember correctly.

122
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,620
And although he couldn't count,

123
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:42,130
he knew if one of his sheep was
missing because he knew all the sheep.

124
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:45,550
And so he could tell just by looking
if one of the sheep was missing but he

125
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,384
couldn't count.

126
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:47,523
And so,

127
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:48,251
well,

128
00:04:48,251 --> 00:04:50,950
so people who don't have our
particular set of skills,

129
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:51,461
first of all,

130
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:52,181
they're not stupid.

131
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:52,691
And second,

132
00:04:52,691 --> 00:04:54,970
they have other skills that
we don't understand to,

133
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:55,990
to fill in the gaps.

134
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,440
So Eliana identified spontaneous vocation.

135
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,850
So you were just,

136
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,320
you had this spirit of a Sharman,

137
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:02,681
let's say.

138
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,510
So you're probably
extremely high in openness,

139
00:05:04,511 --> 00:05:06,040
let's say from a modern perspective,

140
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,690
hereditary transmission.

141
00:05:07,691 --> 00:05:08,830
So you know,

142
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:11,770
your father was a showman and your
grandfather was a showman and so forth,

143
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:15,520
and you got initiated into that
process or a personal quest

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,610
in Siberia.

145
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,380
This is from Eliana and Siberia.

146
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:24,370
The youth who is called to be a showman
attracts attention by his strange

147
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:25,204
behavior.

148
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,081
For example,

149
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:26,980
he seeks solitude,

150
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:27,970
becomes absent minded,

151
00:05:27,971 --> 00:05:31,240
loves to roam in the woods or unfrequently
frequented places has visions and

152
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:32,110
sings in his sleep.

153
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:32,500
You know,

154
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,560
if you put someone in a in
a place that's deprived,

155
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:36,990
that's where you're,

156
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,853
you're deprived.

157
00:05:38,050 --> 00:05:39,460
From a sensory perspective,

158
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,690
it fit normal.

159
00:05:40,691 --> 00:05:42,310
People will hallucinate quite quickly,

160
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:46,300
so it seems what happens is that if
you dampen down the sensory input,

161
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,630
then you start to become aware of the
background processes of your mind.

162
00:05:49,631 --> 00:05:50,441
It's something like that.

163
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,270
It's like the signal to noise ratio.

164
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,890
I got to get this right.

165
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,250
As the noise decreases,

166
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,600
some of the noise becomes signal,

167
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,840
the background noise becomes signal and
you start to become aware of your own

168
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,430
internal psychological processes.

169
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:05,330
It's something like that.

170
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,790
He has visions and sings in his sleep.

171
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,050
In some instances,

172
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:12,740
this period of incubation is marked by
quite serious symptoms among the Yakut.

173
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,400
The young man sometimes has fits of
fury and easily loses consciousness,

174
00:06:16,401 --> 00:06:17,390
hides in the forest,

175
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,950
feeds on the bark of trees,

176
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,760
throws himself into water and fire
and cuts themselves with knives.

177
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:29,180
We went to a potlatch in northern
northern Vancouver island.

178
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:31,640
About a year ago and
they had this one dance,

179
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:36,020
it was the Kwakwaka'wakw natives and
they had this interesting dance that was

180
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,310
the dance of the wild man.

181
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:42,311
And so the person who invited us was the
wild man and he was dressed up in tree

182
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:43,760
branches and so forth.

183
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,960
And so he was the person who'd been in
the Bush too long and he came in as a

184
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:52,961
cannibal and there there was genuine
cannibalistic rites among these people not

185
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,141
so long ago.

186
00:06:54,141 --> 00:06:57,080
And he came in as accountable and
everybody had to wear this like cedar head

187
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,360
dress because if you had
a cedar headdress on,

188
00:06:59,361 --> 00:07:01,370
then the cannibal wouldn't
take a bite out of you.

189
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:03,710
And they actually took
this route as seriously,

190
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:06,320
so you should have your
Cedar headdress on.

191
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,620
And so he's looking around the crowd and
there's like 400 people in this place

192
00:07:09,621 --> 00:07:11,420
and he could really act too.

193
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,100
So he's doing this wild man dance.

194
00:07:13,101 --> 00:07:18,101
And then all the women stood up and
started to tight kind of dancing place and

195
00:07:18,321 --> 00:07:20,480
sing and they were taming him.

196
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,130
So that was really cool.

197
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,760
You know,

198
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,430
it was really interesting to see
that because those people are about,

199
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,130
they've had an unbroken
culture for about 13,000 years.

200
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,250
That's how long they've been
out out on the island there.

201
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:35,210
And it was very interesting to see that
dramatization of the domestication of,

202
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:39,050
of man by women laid out
in that dance in that way.

203
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:43,370
But it was also interesting
in relationship to the
shamanic tradition because he

204
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:44,540
came in as a wild man,

205
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:44,751
right.

206
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:49,640
And he had to be re civilized in some
sense and brought back down to earth.

207
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:54,260
So by whatever method he
may have been designated,

208
00:07:54,261 --> 00:07:55,970
a showman is recognized as such,

209
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:59,030
only after having received
two methods of instruction.

210
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,190
The first is ecstatic dreams,

211
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,330
trances visions.

212
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,460
The other thing that this guy told me,

213
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,130
and I have no reason to doubt him,

214
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,473
um,

215
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:10,330
he's also not illiterate person.

216
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,150
Um,

217
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,260
and so has a great memory.

218
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:15,740
He does carving traditional
carving and he's very good at it.

219
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:20,560
He carved a 53 foot totem pole that's
now in front of the Museum of art in,

220
00:08:20,561 --> 00:08:21,950
in downtown Montreal.

221
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,120
So if you ever go there,

222
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:23,990
you can go see it.

223
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,370
I won't be there forever,

224
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,450
but it's there right now.

225
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,183
And uh,

226
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:33,370
he was taught to carve by his grandparents
and he said that he dreamed in,

227
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:33,981
you know,

228
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:34,251
you know,

229
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:35,720
what the Haida images look like.

230
00:08:35,721 --> 00:08:37,030
So the Kwakwaka'Wakw cert,

231
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,610
kind of like the hightest same sort of
imagery he told me that he dreamed in

232
00:08:40,611 --> 00:08:41,450
those images.

233
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,830
So when he dreams,

234
00:08:42,831 --> 00:08:46,520
that's the form that the
things he dreams about takes.

235
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,730
And he also said that he would talk
to his grandparents and his dream.

236
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:53,000
So if he was working on a piece of wood
and trying to figure out how to carve

237
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:53,480
it,

238
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,620
and he ran into a particularly
difficult problem,

239
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,670
he dream in his great,

240
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:59,250
he'd have a conversation
with his grandparents and
they'd help him figure out

241
00:08:59,251 --> 00:09:00,180
how to solve the problem.

242
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:01,740
And then he'd wake up and
he could go carve the,

243
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:02,641
and the thing is,

244
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,610
he told me these things
sort of matter of factly,

245
00:09:05,611 --> 00:09:06,000
right?

246
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:06,960
Like you don't,

247
00:09:06,961 --> 00:09:07,794
you know what I mean?

248
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:08,893
It wasn't like,

249
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:09,470
okay,

250
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:11,990
he was telling me these weird
things that happened to him,

251
00:09:11,991 --> 00:09:13,440
although he was doing that to some degree.

252
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,473
I asked him

253
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,870
a lot of questions about what
he carved and what it all meant.

254
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:20,010
And um,

255
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,460
you know,

256
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,620
that was just part of his
explanation of how he did it.

257
00:09:22,621 --> 00:09:23,380
And he,

258
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:28,320
he carved me a couple of doors that I
have in my house and one of them is quite

259
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:29,020
interesting,

260
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:29,761
well the,

261
00:09:29,761 --> 00:09:34,761
to make a panel and there
are an underwater scene and
under the water there's a

262
00:09:35,071 --> 00:09:35,904
bunch of,

263
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,301
you know,

264
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:37,740
mythical monsters.

265
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:40,800
Some of them are killer whales and I
think there's an octopus down there and

266
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,450
carved in this particular style.

267
00:09:42,451 --> 00:09:45,810
And he said that the other thing that
happens to him when he dreams as he goes

268
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:49,650
down to the bottom of the water where
these mythical creatures are and he gets

269
00:09:49,651 --> 00:09:50,760
inspiration from them.

270
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:53,880
And so I thought that was
extremely interesting to,

271
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,510
you know,

272
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,343
we,

273
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:58,800
we don't know what a mine
that isn't hyper civilized,

274
00:09:58,801 --> 00:10:01,230
let's say hyper literate,

275
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:01,620
like,

276
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,460
like our minds are,

277
00:10:02,461 --> 00:10:05,250
cause we're so bombarded
by external stimuli can,

278
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:08,400
we have no idea what the
natural mind is like really.

279
00:10:08,401 --> 00:10:10,500
And so it was quite interesting to,

280
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:11,880
to,

281
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:12,780
to listen to that.

282
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,140
And,

283
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,450
and also to see the consequences
cause you've quite a great,

284
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,710
he's quite a great carver.

285
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,890
So the first is ecstatic dreams,

286
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:20,740
trances visions.

287
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,160
The second is traditional
shamonic techniques,

288
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:27,030
names and functions of the spirits
methodology and genealogy of the clan.

289
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,140
A secret language.

290
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,680
This two fold teaching imparted by the
spirits and the old master Sherman's

291
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:33,000
constitutes initiation.

292
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:33,571
Well,

293
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:34,740
so you know,

294
00:10:34,741 --> 00:10:37,710
modern people have a problem with that
because we don't really get initiated.

295
00:10:37,711 --> 00:10:38,910
But I would say

296
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:44,991
it all,

297
00:10:44,991 --> 00:10:48,860
let's say that we're each on a quest
of some sort or you wouldn't be here,

298
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:49,571
I don't think if,

299
00:10:49,571 --> 00:10:51,890
if you weren't because why
else would you be here?

300
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,133
Can you eat?

301
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,240
And so you're on a quest
of some sort to figure out,

302
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,310
to struggle with the meaning of life,

303
00:10:58,311 --> 00:10:59,144
let's say.

304
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:04,070
And you don't want to do
that alone because you only
last like 70 years and good

305
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:05,090
luck figuring it out on your,

306
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,811
on your own.

307
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:06,860
It's just not going to happen.

308
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:09,560
It's too complicated and
you'll be too isolated,

309
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:09,980
right?

310
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,150
If,

311
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:11,270
if it's just you,

312
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,440
that's insanity.

313
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:14,000
That's no one can stand that.

314
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,720
And so you hope that other people have
things to tell you when that your culture

315
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:18,710
has something to tell you.

316
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:18,950
You know,

317
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:20,030
so you're on a quest,

318
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:24,440
maybe not with the same intensity as
a shit shamonic initiat but you know,

319
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:25,550
let's give you some credit.

320
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,880
And then you're also trying to understand
the wisdom of the past and that that's

321
00:11:31,101 --> 00:11:32,120
the second part of this.

322
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:32,481
It's like,

323
00:11:32,481 --> 00:11:32,751
okay,

324
00:11:32,751 --> 00:11:35,480
well you're a human being and human beings
have been telling stories for a long

325
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,820
period of time trying to
figure out what's going on,

326
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,920
trying to figure out how to
orient themselves in the world.

327
00:11:39,921 --> 00:11:44,470
And so partly what you're doing here is
exactly what the shamonic initiates does

328
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,010
in the second part of the process,

329
00:11:46,011 --> 00:11:51,011
which is to expose yourself to the degree
that you can to names and functions of

330
00:11:51,951 --> 00:11:52,750
the spirits,

331
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,770
mythology and genealogy of the
clan and the secret language.

332
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,030
There's two fold teaching imparted by
the spirits and the old master Schamens

333
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:02,380
constitutes initiation.

334
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,000
So it's,

335
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,870
that's the rebirth,

336
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:05,420
right?

337
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:05,920
That's,

338
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,450
that's what initiation is.

339
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:10,070
It's being born again and,

340
00:12:10,071 --> 00:12:12,970
and that's a birth of the
spirit rather than of the body.

341
00:12:12,971 --> 00:12:13,870
It's something like that.

342
00:12:13,871 --> 00:12:16,390
And so it's the rebirth
of an integrated psyche.

343
00:12:16,391 --> 00:12:18,910
That's one way of thinking
about it and a psyche that's,

344
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,770
that's individual,

345
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,300
but also grounded in common humanity
and the wisdom of common humanity.

346
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,950
And that makes you strong,

347
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,810
or at least it makes you stronger.
