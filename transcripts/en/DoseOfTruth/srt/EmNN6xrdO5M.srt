1
00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:04,700
So the question is Pontius Pilate,

2
00:00:04,701 --> 00:00:05,311
this question,

3
00:00:05,311 --> 00:00:07,320
the first postmodernist what is truth?

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,350
And it was taken up many times,

5
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:14,370
but by nature and the genealogy of
morals were all truth is interpretation.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,090
And of course this is not the case with
Nisha and anybody who follows him as you

7
00:00:18,091 --> 00:00:18,924
pointed out,

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,760
because that's somebody else's truth,

9
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:23,100
that there is no truth and
therefore what do you do with that?

10
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:25,800
And you're into the problem
of the creek and liar.

11
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,880
But here is the problem
for me even with your talk,

12
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,960
which is as usual,

13
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:35,460
brilliant and I think grounded and and
tremendous amount of factual information.

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,720
I was asked once after
a book of mine came out,

15
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:41,820
which was contested hottie by many people.

16
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,030
What gave me the right
to think I had the truth.

17
00:00:45,031 --> 00:00:48,150
This was an interviewer in Toronto
for the Random House thing.

18
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,960
And why did I think what
I was saying was true.

19
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Who was I to say that I had the truth
and I said I don't have the truth and I

20
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:01,050
have to come up with some explanation
quickly and some kind of phrase.

21
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:01,950
And it just occurred to me.

22
00:01:01,951 --> 00:01:02,191
I said,

23
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:06,630
all I have is this credible
verisimilitude what is credible?

24
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:08,340
Various similitude he wanted to know.

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:09,870
I said a,

26
00:01:09,871 --> 00:01:13,320
it depends on gathering as much
evidence as you possibly can,

27
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,930
even if you have to
counter your own biases,

28
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:20,931
you just said with as least
at least amount of deceit
or self self-indulgence as

29
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:21,984
possible.

30
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,020
And the second factor is common sense,

31
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:27,360
which seems to be not
so common these days.

32
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:32,550
So if you can put evidence and common
sense together and at the same time try

33
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:35,370
and Marshall and monitor
your own proclivities,

34
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,020
I went right,

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,100
but that was hard with my book as
I was left before I could go right.

36
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,080
And I had to make that decision.

37
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:47,310
Do I want to go right and lose all
my friends or do I want to stay left?

38
00:01:47,311 --> 00:01:48,080
And you know,

39
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,750
I have Catherine and join my
friends and saw I had to go right?

40
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,900
Because that's what the evidence
told me against my own desires.

41
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,160
So honesty,

42
00:01:56,161 --> 00:01:57,150
if you can manage it,

43
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,200
evidence and common sense,

44
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:02,250
but here's the problem.

45
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,563
Truths,

46
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,590
it's still there.

47
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,690
How do you get from credible,

48
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,390
various similitude to truth.

49
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,340
Where is the bridge?

50
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,203
How do you get there?

51
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,320
Nobody can say that.

52
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,460
Ultimately,

53
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,640
yes,

54
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,351
the problem,

55
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:17,580
I think you can,

56
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,840
you can say certain things are true,

57
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,900
certain dates et Cetera,

58
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:23,280
said certain things of happens with men
have suffered as a result of feminism.

59
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,360
All of this is true,

60
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,670
but where truth seems to founders,

61
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:27,930
when you enter the realm of,

62
00:02:27,931 --> 00:02:32,931
because who has the truth to explain why
feminism developed in the way it did or

63
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:39,480
why climate warming or global
warming developed in the way it did.

64
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,680
We can point out the facts,

65
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:41,221
this is wrong,

66
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:41,730
this is wrong,

67
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:42,563
this is happening.

68
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:45,330
But when you get out of the element,

69
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,560
the region of events and into
the region of the causes,

70
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,260
that's the bridge,

71
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,670
the gap from credible,

72
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:55,230
various similitude to truth.

73
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,110
And I frankly don't
know how to manage that.

74
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,260
So the conclusion I'm coming to is a
little bit different from your conclusion.

75
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:05,740
It's not the one that I want to come
to and I would like to resist it,

76
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:09,130
but the conclusion I'm coming
to is quite simply we're fucked.

77
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,041
Yes.

78
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:13,180
But that's always been true,

79
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:13,451
right?

80
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,980
That's the apocalypse is always,

81
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,790
that's why the apocalypse is
eternal because the world's
always coming to an end

82
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,240
and it's actually true small
ways and in great ways.

83
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:26,380
I mean with regards to your,

84
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,700
your ideas about truth,

85
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,130
I would say that like language,

86
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,560
truth is more like a process.

87
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,840
And I would say it's,

88
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,350
it's,

89
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:40,350
it's a process that you actually embody
rather than conceptualize abstractly to,

90
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:44,740
one of the ways I've thought about it
is that if you're seeking the truth and

91
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:47,380
what you don't know is more
important to you than what you know,

92
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,930
and that's a fundamental orientation,

93
00:03:49,931 --> 00:03:50,171
right?

94
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:50,740
I mean,

95
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,431
what I'm doing,

96
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,830
what I've been doing since September,

97
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:55,720
and I've had friends who've
been helping me with this,

98
00:03:55,721 --> 00:03:58,510
but I think I've been doing this for a
long time as I'm trying to figure out

99
00:03:58,511 --> 00:03:59,440
where I'm wrong.

100
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,350
I'm watching the audience to
see if I'm making a mistake.

101
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:05,530
I'm listening to my friends who are
watching my youtube videos telling me what

102
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:10,531
I'm a little too angry maybe or maybe
too pompous or too noisy or you know,

103
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:13,660
all the different ways that you
can fail in front of an audience.

104
00:04:13,661 --> 00:04:17,590
I'm listening to them and listening to
the comments and I'm trying to modify

105
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:18,820
myself accordingly.

106
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:19,451
You know?

107
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:23,920
And so you live in error
and strive towards the truth
and it's in that striving

108
00:04:23,921 --> 00:04:26,050
that the truth is most
accurately embodied.

109
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,970
But then I would also say one other thing,

110
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:30,670
and this is what I like about
the existentialists is that,

111
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:31,451
you know,

112
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:31,840
there's,

113
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,770
there's a kind of emphasis on pragmatic
truth among the existentialists because

114
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:39,100
they claim that your truth is
something that you should act out,

115
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,600
not merely hold.

116
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,380
Because to act out is to
believe that it's a definition,

117
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:44,680
right?

118
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:44,831
It's,

119
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:45,041
it's,

120
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:45,401
it's not,

121
00:04:45,401 --> 00:04:46,900
it's not precisely a proposition,

122
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:47,770
it's a definition.

123
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,210
And so I found some things
that I was confident in,

124
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:54,850
enough into risk acting out.

125
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,870
And so that's what I'm doing
to the best of my ability.

126
00:04:58,871 --> 00:05:00,500
And then I'm watching what happens and,

127
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,080
and I'm watching what happens if other
people act out the propositions and w as

128
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,220
far as I can tell,

129
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,260
so far so good.

130
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,183
I mean,

131
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:10,360
I,

132
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,193
I don't,

133
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,410
I wouldn't say that my
position right now is to be,

134
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,570
what would you envied?

135
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,920
It's very stressful.

136
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,480
I mean since September,

137
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,310
I basically be in a position of

138
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,130
any mistake is fatal for for
all intents and purposes,

139
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:27,791
you know,

140
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:30,370
and that's very stressful
to be that hypervigilant.

141
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,563
And uh,

142
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,550
but by the same token,

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,230
the public response to what I've been
doing has been overwhelmingly positive.

144
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:38,411
You know,

145
00:05:38,411 --> 00:05:40,390
I've only got three pieces of hate mail,

146
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,110
which,

147
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,370
which just staggers me,

148
00:05:42,371 --> 00:05:42,760
you know?

149
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,031
And,

150
00:05:43,031 --> 00:05:45,310
and the comments on Youtube for example,

151
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:45,940
are,

152
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:48,290
are like 50 to one positive and who,

153
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:48,910
I mean who,

154
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,270
yeah,

155
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,440
maybe it's a biased sample,

156
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:51,340
I can't tell but,

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,833
but um,

158
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,340
and the other thing know I've been
trying to rip holes in the ideas that I

159
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:03,620
presented to you today for really like
with all my intellectual capability for

160
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:04,100
as long.

161
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,170
Every time I lecture I'm
trying to do the same thing.

162
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:06,501
It's like,

163
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,020
is there something in this
that I haven't got right?

164
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:09,981
Cause I'm trying to,

165
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:11,060
I was trying to look for some,

166
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,370
a rock at the bottom of things,

167
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:14,204
you know,

168
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,200
and partly why I decided that I wasn't
going to use those damn words is because

169
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:22,100
I think the rock at the bottom
of things is honest speech.

170
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,700
I really believe that it,

171
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:28,670
it seems to me to be right
and that's good enough.

172
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,580
So I'll act that out and see
what happens as best I can.

173
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:31,821
I mean,

174
00:06:31,821 --> 00:06:33,020
I'm not claiming to be,

175
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,410
I'm not claiming to be any
more honest than anyone else.

176
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:36,711
You know,

177
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:37,371
seriously.

178
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:38,200
I'm not,

179
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:38,900
I did that.

180
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,260
That's a big claim to make you better
watch your bloody step if you're going to

181
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:43,094
say that.

182
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:47,780
But that doesn't mean I don't believe
that arms speech is the pathway to

183
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,321
redemption,

184
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:49,430
because I do believe that.

185
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,250
So I know that's strange language,

186
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:54,020
but you know,

187
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,890
that's still,

188
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:58,400
it's the most accurate language
for that kind of conceptualization.
