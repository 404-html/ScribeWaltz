1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:10,190
Were there any lectures or lectures
series that you found helpful to you,

2
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:11,024
this Nathan,

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,800
like yours have been to so many?

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:13,431
Well,

5
00:00:13,431 --> 00:00:14,264
Nathan,

6
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,223
you know,

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:15,890
okay.

8
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,960
I would say not really.

9
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,010
Um,

10
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:19,843
although,

11
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:20,751
you know,

12
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:21,321
when I went,

13
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,990
I went to this little college called
Grand Prairie Regional College.

14
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,850
It was a way the hell
up in northern Alberta.

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,440
And um,

16
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,070
yeah,

17
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,750
there's only 600 people that went,

18
00:00:29,751 --> 00:00:31,670
it was an adjunct of the
University of Alberta.

19
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:32,600
It's still exists.

20
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:33,950
It's really lovely building.

21
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:35,240
Um,

22
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,550
and we had professors there.

23
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:38,740
Okay.

24
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:42,370
An English professor and the political
science professor in biology,

25
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:43,780
professor philosophy professor,

26
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:47,620
people that I still remember
little seminars and they,

27
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:50,440
we got deeply into the
material and I really,

28
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:52,240
it really helped me a lot.

29
00:00:52,241 --> 00:00:55,810
This English professor really taught me
to write to because he just slashed my

30
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:57,250
essays to ribbons.

31
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:00,760
I was really upset the first time I got
a bad grade because I'd always got good

32
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,530
grades and my papers in high school,

33
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:04,240
even though they were dreadful.

34
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:04,930
Um,

35
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:05,231
you know,

36
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:10,231
I was verbally intelligent enough to be
able to compose an essay that was better

37
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:14,500
than most with very little effort
and with very little quality.

38
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,180
And so that was very influential to me
and I did a lot of reading under the

39
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:23,080
tutelage of those professors in these
tiny little courses in my first year.

40
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:27,430
But mostly what's been
helpful to me have been books.

41
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,050
And you know,

42
00:01:29,051 --> 00:01:29,970
I read Nietzsche,

43
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,330
I didn't read all of nature,

44
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:33,400
but I would read all that was easily,

45
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,960
easily accessible,

46
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,790
published works of nature in sequential
order in the order in which they were

47
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:43,450
written when I was in my twenties and I
read everything that young had published

48
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:45,620
it when I was in my twenties and um,

49
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,050
and well,

50
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,480
and the same with a wide
variety of other authors.

51
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:51,220
And so those were like
lecture series and they were,

52
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:53,140
I was unbelievably useful to me.

53
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,120
I put some of those
books on my reading this.

54
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:55,870
So,

55
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,703
um,

56
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,440
could you please tell us your second ghost
story as mentioned on h three h three

57
00:02:02,441 --> 00:02:03,274
podcast.

58
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:04,780
God,

59
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,560
Nicholas,

60
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,170
if you asked me that at the next
Q and a and people voted up,

61
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:09,220
then I'll tell the story,

62
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,620
but I can't right now cause it's a
long story and I'm just about out of

63
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:14,740
[inaudible] and brain and time.

64
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,030
And that's,

65
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,550
so I'm going to answer two
more questions I think,

66
00:02:18,551 --> 00:02:22,870
and then I'm going to stop because
I really am running out of,

67
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,973
um,

68
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,993
words.

69
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,410
Let's see.
