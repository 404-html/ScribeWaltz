1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,040
Our daughter entered her
life at 24 due to depression.

2
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:05,110
If someone is determined
to end their life,

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,400
how can one change their mind?

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:06,731
Oh,

5
00:00:06,731 --> 00:00:06,941
well,

6
00:00:06,941 --> 00:00:07,774
first of all,

7
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,090
I'm very sorry about that.

8
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,260
That's a terrible thing.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,513
Look,

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,990
I had this friend

11
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,103
her,

12
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,193
sorry.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:37,470
There's been a lot of
depression in our family,

14
00:00:37,471 --> 00:00:41,250
so it's a question that
cuts close to the bone.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,623
Anyways,

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:51,460
I had this friend and friend of my
parents and her grand daughter committed

17
00:00:51,461 --> 00:00:52,000
suicide.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,833
You know,

19
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,010
she was just beating herself up
about what could have I done,

20
00:00:57,011 --> 00:00:58,210
what could have I done differently?

21
00:00:58,211 --> 00:00:59,650
This is the problem with suicide.

22
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:02,050
It leaves everybody behind thinking,

23
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:02,651
Oh my God,

24
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:03,700
what could've I done?

25
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,320
I could have treated the person better.

26
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:06,131
I could have listened.

27
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:07,000
I could have been there.

28
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:07,691
It's like,

29
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:12,580
and she was just beating yourself up about
this really feeling that she wasn't a

30
00:01:12,581 --> 00:01:13,391
useful person,

31
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,770
that she'd failed as a grandmother.

32
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,150
She's a really good person,

33
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:16,984
you know?

34
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,090
And so I went for a walk
with her and I said,

35
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,750
and she,

36
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,310
she's married and she likes her husband,

37
00:01:21,311 --> 00:01:22,330
and he's a really good guy.

38
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:23,570
I met.

39
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:24,403
He said,

40
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,593
look,

41
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:26,800
you're,

42
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,480
you're blaming yourself for the,

43
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,913
for your granddaughter,

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,753
suicide.

45
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:31,750
It's like,

46
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,830
are you blaming your husband?

47
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,760
Are you sitting him down
and telling him what to use?

48
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,910
Useless bastard.

49
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:40,360
He was as a grandfather because his grand
daughter committed suicide and how he

50
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:41,350
failed completely.

51
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:42,491
She said,

52
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:42,701
no,

53
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:43,630
I'd never do that.

54
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:44,951
So I said,

55
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:45,784
well,

56
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,530
don't do it to yourself.

57
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,440
No people.

58
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,220
Depression was a terrible thing and many,

59
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:57,641
many,

60
00:01:57,641 --> 00:01:58,720
many things cause it,

61
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:00,010
and we don't understand.

62
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,170
We understand some of them,

63
00:02:02,171 --> 00:02:03,760
but lots of them we
don't understand at all.

64
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:03,971
You know,

65
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:06,430
sometimes people get depressed
because they're really sick.

66
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,300
We know that depression could
be an inflammatory disease,

67
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:11,830
it might be associated with audio,

68
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:12,820
immune dysfunction.

69
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:16,330
There's lots of reasons that
people get depressed and depressed.

70
00:02:16,331 --> 00:02:18,370
People can go places that are so dark,

71
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:19,840
you just cannot imagine it.

72
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,190
And it isn't necessarily the case
that you can always rescue someone,

73
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:25,024
you know,

74
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:25,780
and,

75
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,410
but,

76
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:30,100
but drowning yourself in the
aftermath of a suicide is not helpful.

77
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,353
So there's a,

78
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,670
there's a good room for
self forgiveness there.

79
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:33,941
You know,

80
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:34,540
I mean,

81
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,990
maybe you did some things you shouldn't
have done that were reprehensible and

82
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:38,501
all of that,

83
00:02:38,501 --> 00:02:40,270
but you don't want to beat yourself up.

84
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,940
Remember the presumption of innocence,

85
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:43,300
right?

86
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:47,440
Innocent until proven guilty and
you have to apply that to yourself.

87
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,210
I don't think.

88
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,840
I think there are times when people are
so depressed or if there isn't anything

89
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:53,800
that anyone can do.

90
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,380
You know when the depressed person thinks,

91
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,270
and this is probably the worst part of it,

92
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,710
it depressed person thinks

93
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,671
everywhere I look,

94
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,520
it's nothing but catastrophe and there's,

95
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,410
I can't see any way out of it.

96
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,180
I,

97
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:16,150
I can't see any path forward
whatsoever and then they think as well,

98
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:19,240
and maybe it's the combination of these
two thoughts that that really make

99
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,230
people suicidal.

100
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,760
It's like it's hopeless.

101
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,770
It isn't going to get any better.

102
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,030
No matter where I turn,

103
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:25,864
there's no escape.

104
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,790
The suffering is unbearable and I
had absolutely no use whatsoever.

105
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,450
Do anyone.

106
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,020
It would be better for everyone if
I was just gone because I'm going,

107
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,890
if I'm not so much of a burden now
that it's going to destroy their life,

108
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:43,000
then I'm going to be that much
of a burden in the future.

109
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,700
And so target,

110
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,260
imagine what that's like for people,

111
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:51,940
but it's dreadful and there's
lots of ways you get there and so

112
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,910
you can listen to people.

113
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,840
You can desperately encouraged
them to seek the help they need.

114
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,081
You know,

115
00:03:59,081 --> 00:03:59,680
like I've,

116
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,260
I've seen antidepressants
work miracles on very,

117
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,520
very many people now.

118
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:06,250
They don't work for everyone
and they're not a panacea,

119
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,900
but you know,

120
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:09,460
they have side effects and all of that.

121
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:13,240
But one of the side effects of untreated
depression is that you kill yourself

122
00:04:13,241 --> 00:04:14,830
and there is no recovery from that.

123
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,280
And the are the probabilities
actually rather high.

124
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:22,900
So you can go to war with
them about antidepressants.

125
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:25,180
If the person can't get out
of their depression and their,

126
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,230
and their suicidal,

127
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,800
it's like what do they have to
lose one month on antidepressants?

128
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,143
They'll know,

129
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:31,750
oh,

130
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,240
they might have to experiment
longer because it would depend on,

131
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:34,541
you know,

132
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:37,930
some people respond better to some classes
of antidepressants than the others.

133
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,563
Um,

134
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:43,600
it's worth having a war with someone if
they're in dire straits and they won't

135
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,400
do everything they can to get better.

136
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:46,900
ECT works.

137
00:04:46,901 --> 00:04:49,570
Electric convulsive therapy
works for intractable depression.

138
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,490
It's a terrible thing to contemplate,

139
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:55,540
but the modern versions of ECT aren't
one flew over the cuckoo's nest.

140
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,171
And again,

141
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,690
it's like there's no
coming back from death.

142
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,300
So look,

143
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,110
it isn't clear.

144
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,670
You can't rescue everyone.

145
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,460
People get sick and they die.

146
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
And sometimes the way they die,

147
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,080
it looks like it's depression.

148
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,720
Depression is a multifaceted phenomena.

149
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,670
You can be there for them,

150
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,533
you can listen,

151
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,340
you can watch,

152
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,660
you can intervene,

153
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,480
you can try to understand,

154
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,890
you can hold them accountable.

155
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,330
You can do all of those things,

156
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:27,823
but that,

157
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,570
but everyone has their own destiny,

158
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:29,980
you know,

159
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,440
and you're not omnipotent.

160
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,080
And so sometimes it catastrophe
yield curves like your daughters and

161
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,703
then,

162
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,940
and then you should try to drag the least
amount of misery forward that you can.

163
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,573
Okay.

164
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,200
Once you recover from your grief.

165
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:55,810
Yup.
