1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:10,870
I've talked to lots of business people
about leadership and there's a literature

2
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:11,441
on leadership,

3
00:00:11,441 --> 00:00:13,150
but it's not a good literature.

4
00:00:13,151 --> 00:00:13,351
It's,

5
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,320
it's pretty shallow.

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,071
Um,

7
00:00:15,071 --> 00:00:18,430
partly because it's not that easy to
define leadership and partly because there

8
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:19,270
are different,

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:20,693
you know,

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:24,760
people have different temperaments and
different temperaments can be leaders.

11
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,350
They just do it in different ways.

12
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,630
Now there's something in
common about being a leader.

13
00:00:28,631 --> 00:00:28,770
The,

14
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,540
and I would say one is that
if you're a natural leader,

15
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:33,040
you actually know where you're going,

16
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:33,970
right?

17
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,310
Cause what are you going to
do lead people in circles.

18
00:00:36,311 --> 00:00:38,290
It's like maybe they'll follow
you but you're not a leader.

19
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,280
You're just a charlatan.

20
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,010
So you have to know where you're
going and then you have to be able to

21
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:45,280
communicate that and then
people have to trust you.

22
00:00:45,281 --> 00:00:46,770
So you actually have to be honest,

23
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:47,950
cause people aren't that stupid.

24
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,720
At least not for a long period of time.

25
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,090
And then where are you going?

26
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:54,250
Has to have some value because otherwise,

27
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:55,960
why would anyone want
to go along with you?

28
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,363
So,

29
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,361
and then you might say,

30
00:00:58,361 --> 00:00:58,881
well what,

31
00:00:58,881 --> 00:01:01,090
what are the attributes
then that make you a leader?

32
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:05,290
And I would say well
they're characterological
fundamentally and this is not

33
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:07,330
naive optimism or,

34
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,810
or or casual demoralizing.

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,470
It has nothing to do with that.

36
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,221
You know,

37
00:01:12,221 --> 00:01:17,221
we know for example that conscientious
that the personality trait is a good

38
00:01:17,441 --> 00:01:20,770
predictor of long term success
in in most occupations,

39
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,000
not all but most.

40
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,150
And that one of the things that's
associated with conscientiousness is that

41
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:26,140
people keep their word,

42
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:26,980
they're trustworthy.

43
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,350
And that's certainly
one element of a leader,

44
00:01:29,351 --> 00:01:31,450
especially across any
reasonable amount of time.

45
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:33,310
You have to be able to trust the person.

46
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,570
They can even be harsh,

47
00:01:34,571 --> 00:01:34,900
right?

48
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:37,540
It doesn't matter because you can
see harsh leaders and kind leaders,

49
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,280
but as long as they do what they say
they will do and then you can follow them

50
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:44,620
and you know that the future payoff is,

51
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,670
is,

52
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,540
is secure,

53
00:01:46,541 --> 00:01:47,560
something like that.

54
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,080
So the idea that character,

55
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:54,400
logical development is more important
to leadership then primogenitor I think

56
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,234
that's the right word.

57
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:56,440
Ah,

58
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,880
premo genesis anyways,

59
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:58,750
being a first born,

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,730
that's a very crucial psychological
realization that its character,

61
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:06,370
logical development that
makes you favored of God.

62
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,141
You know?

63
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:11,800
And I do think we've forgotten this in
many ways because there isn't a lot of

64
00:02:11,801 --> 00:02:15,550
emphasis in our education system
on characterological development.

65
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,631
And that's very,

66
00:02:16,631 --> 00:02:17,710
very surprising to me.

67
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:21,040
I think maybe it's partly
because in our fractured society,

68
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:24,560
we can't agree on what constitutes
a reasonable character,

69
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:25,900
a logical goal.

70
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,050
So we just throw up our hands and don't
educate our kids to any degree at all,

71
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,960
especially in schools about what
an admirable person is like,

72
00:02:34,961 --> 00:02:36,130
or even let them know that,

73
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:36,521
well,

74
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:38,200
maybe you should actually try to be one.

75
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:42,280
You know that that's actually the most
important possible thing that you could

76
00:02:42,281 --> 00:02:42,700
learn.
