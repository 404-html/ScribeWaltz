1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,400
Field when he was,

2
00:00:08,401 --> 00:00:12,630
he did some of the early cycle surgery
for epilepsy because it intractable

3
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:13,231
epilepsy.

4
00:00:13,231 --> 00:00:15,420
Sometimes the only thing
to do is radical surgery,

5
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:16,254
like a corpus.

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,240
He caught the Corpus callosum for example.

7
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,283
So that the,

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:19,861
you know,

9
00:00:19,861 --> 00:00:20,191
the,

10
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:21,960
the electrical storm so to speak,

11
00:00:21,961 --> 00:00:25,480
can't transmit across the hemispheres
and the whole brain won't be effective.

12
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:26,250
So,

13
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,570
but while he was doing that,

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,220
he used a little electrode to map out the
surface of the brain and he mapped out

15
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:32,971
the motor strip,

16
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:35,490
which is just behind
the prefrontal cortex.

17
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:36,930
And then the sensory strip,

18
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:41,560
which is just behind that to find
out how the body representatives are,

19
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:43,080
the brain represents the body.

20
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,740
And basically what he showed
was that on the motor strip,

21
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,520
you know,

22
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,353
you're,

23
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:52,410
the thumb has as much
representation as your whole trunk.

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,910
So basically your thumb is as
smart from a motoric perspective,

25
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,580
smarter than you from here to here,

26
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,151
you know,

27
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:03,180
well try picking up
something with your back,

28
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:03,660
you know,

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,760
and you'll figure out exactly why that is.

30
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:09,720
And the thumb basically has almost as
much representation as the rest of the

31
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,081
hand.

32
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:12,780
But the hands are like gigantic balloons,

33
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:13,511
you know,

34
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:15,780
and the arms are a little
skinny sticks here,

35
00:01:15,781 --> 00:01:16,370
here,

36
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:17,880
theater fairly highly

37
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:20,671
represented,

38
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:23,400
especially in the sensory
cortex because you know,

39
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:24,870
you gotta be careful about what you,

40
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,130
what you step on.

41
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:30,180
And one of the things that's
very interesting about
the representation of the

42
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:33,900
feet on the sensory strip is that it's
right beside the representation of the

43
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:34,770
Genitalia.

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,600
And so there's cross costs.

45
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,380
And so some of you are pretty
into foot massages and that's why,

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,191
you know,

47
00:01:41,191 --> 00:01:41,681
so it's,

48
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:41,921
it's,

49
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:43,590
it's a consequence of the overlap.

50
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,300
Now why that overlap is there,

51
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:46,500
I don't know exactly,

52
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:46,681
you know,

53
00:01:46,681 --> 00:01:49,920
maybe maybe the brain
had organized itself.

54
00:01:49,921 --> 00:01:52,140
So particularly sensitive surfaces.

55
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,210
We're taking advantage of the same tissue,

56
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,380
something like that.

57
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,311
But you know,

58
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,720
it's an interesting case of,

59
00:01:57,721 --> 00:02:00,060
it's like synesthesia and sent in a sense,

60
00:02:00,061 --> 00:02:01,560
it's like sensory synesthesia.

61
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,401
So,

62
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,234
um,

63
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,070
as far as your brain's concerned,

64
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,720
your all hands and your hands are almost
all thumb and you're quite a bit of

65
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:13,380
feet and your lips are
massive and so is your tongue.

66
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,990
And your face is very
highly represented too.

67
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,610
So basically as far as your
brain is concerned with
regards to sensory input and

68
00:02:20,611 --> 00:02:21,444
motor output,

69
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,890
you're this huge face with great big
lips and tongue and you have massive

70
00:02:25,891 --> 00:02:28,560
balloon like hands and your
feet are pretty big too.

71
00:02:28,561 --> 00:02:32,940
And there's a fair bit of sensory
representation for the Genitalia as well.

72
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:34,770
And then the body's hardly there at all.

73
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,960
So,

74
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,680
so that's kind of what
a human being is like,

75
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:37,950
right?

76
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,220
We're all thumbs in hands and we talk
about what we do with our thumbs and hands

77
00:02:41,221 --> 00:02:44,700
all the time when we take things apart
with them and we put them together and

78
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,500
then we tell everybody
else how we're doing that.

79
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,510
And that's basically a human being.

80
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:52,800
And when you're thinking about the
difference between human beings and highly

81
00:02:52,801 --> 00:02:56,490
encephalitis mammals
like dolphins and whales,

82
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:00,280
because people have claimed that
dolphins and whales are extraordinarily

83
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,114
intelligent.

84
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,601
And you know,

85
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:04,990
dolphins don't seem
particularly simple minded,

86
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,490
but look at the things they're in.

87
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,890
Like if they're in these
test tube shaped bodies,

88
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,753
what are they gonna do?

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,620
Flip sand up into buildings?

90
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,510
It's like they can't manage that.

91
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:16,040
And so the embodied the,

92
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,870
the manner in which their nervous
system is embodied turns out to be

93
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:22,960
extraordinarily important when you're
trying to understand something like the

94
00:03:22,961 --> 00:03:24,730
relationship between cortical tissue,

95
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:26,440
mass and intelligence,

96
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:31,630
you can't just think about mind as
something that's floating like a soul in

97
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:32,464
space.

98
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,320
If it isn't stuck in
something that you can use,

99
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:40,120
it's not particularly good for anything
or anything that human beings would

100
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,320
regard as particularly intelligence.
