1
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:09,390
Okay.
So now tell me how many,

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,990
how many members,
you don't have to discuss any of this

3
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,750
obviously,
but how many members of Heterodox

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,910
Academy are there now?
We have 1300 members.

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:20,620
So once we opened up,
it's originally was just where we

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,410
searchers who were studying this
problem,

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,510
but we had lots of people wanting to
join.

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:25,560
And so we said,
well,

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,281
okay,
why not?

10
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:27,390
And so we just said,
all right,

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,200
if as long as you're a professor,
um,

12
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:31,230
that is,
you have a phd,

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,180
you're living more or less the life of a
professor,

14
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:36,450
you have a university affiliation.
So we now take adjuncts if they have a

15
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:37,770
phd,
uh,

16
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,560
we take postdocs basically if you're in
the guild,

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,860
if you're living the life of a professor
and you're concerned about the rise of

18
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:49,080
intimidation,
frankly,

19
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:53,190
if you're concerned that our wonderful
institution I love,

20
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:54,660
I love being a professor.

21
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,220
I Love Adam and I feel like it's not
just losing public respect,

22
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,040
it's losing its ability to,
to function.

23
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:05,610
It's losing its ability to teach and do
research on politicized topics.

24
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,400
So there were more politicized topics
all the time.

25
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:09,340
That's,
that's right.

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,670
And there are few in the natural
sciences,

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,940
not many,
but there are some of the natural

28
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,410
sciences as well.
Anyway,

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,530
my point is we're now growing very
rapidly and something I'm very excited

30
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:20,970
by is since we've started having more
violence on campus with beginning with

31
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:24,450
birth and Middlebury,
we're seeing a pervasive sense among

32
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,590
people on the left that there really is
this problem here that something has to

33
00:01:28,591 --> 00:01:31,260
be done.
And so we are finding much more

34
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:33,000
acceptance now,
um,

35
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,670
from professors on the left.
So I like to think about there's the

36
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,070
liberal left,
which is the great majority,

37
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,930
and there's the illiberal left.

38
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,890
We did a factor analysis of politically
correct beliefs and found exactly that

39
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,710
and that the,
and that the illiberal left was also

40
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:48,780
high in orderliness.
That's interesting.

41
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,370
That's the authoritarian.
Exactly.

42
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,260
Predisposition.
Yeah.

43
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:56,300
And also kind of markedly declined.
It was also characterized by a market,

44
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:59,610
lack of verbal intelligence.
Oh,

45
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,430
that's
0.4.

46
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,421
Well that,
oh,

47
00:02:03,421 --> 00:02:04,470
that's beautiful.
That's beautiful.

48
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:07,980
Because one of the simplest formulations
I've heard really great formulation from

49
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:11,010
Mark Lilla.
So Mark Lilla wrote this fantastic op

50
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,140
ed.
The New York Times week after Trump was

51
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:16,890
elected saying identity politics is a
really foolish thing to do.

52
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,800
It pushes lots of people over to Trump's
side.

53
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,630
The identity politics as part of the
problem.

54
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,030
Well,
he writes this hotbed and one of his

55
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,670
fellow professors at Columbia,
I forget how she does it,

56
00:02:26,671 --> 00:02:28,770
but she basically says something about
the,

57
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:31,110
you know,
the mask with eye holes falls from his

58
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:31,320
face.

59
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,591
Like,
you know,

60
00:02:31,591 --> 00:02:33,870
he's a Ku Klux Klan members,
something like that.

61
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:38,970
And so Lilla Lilla who isn't humanities,
he's an intellectual historian.

62
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,690
Lilla has this simple formulation.
He says that's a slur,

63
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,390
not an argument.
And once they had that simple

64
00:02:45,391 --> 00:02:46,200
formulation,
I realized,

65
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,750
wow,
that's almost all the push back I've

66
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:51,450
ever gotten.
It's somehow,

67
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,201
you know,
oh,

68
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:56,070
you know,
you're winking at Nazis or your comfort

69
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:57,450
to me over and over.
I was just,

70
00:02:57,451 --> 00:03:01,180
my neighborhood was just posters with
all that intimidation.

71
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,520
So,
so this is really key.

72
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,480
We're supposed to be all about,
you can say anything you want,

73
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,940
you can make any argument you want.
If you can support it,

74
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,360
if you can back it with reasons.
This is critical thinking and this is

75
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,920
what we're supposed to train our
students to do.

76
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,420
Well.
And not only that,

77
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:18,220
you can say anything,
but you can say it.

78
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,930
There's a boundary on that,
which,

79
00:03:19,931 --> 00:03:22,780
especially if you're a scientist,
less so in the humanities.

80
00:03:22,781 --> 00:03:26,590
But if you're a scientist,
the things you say have to be vetted by

81
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:28,720
people who are going to be critical of
them.

82
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,710
Right.
So,

83
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,530
so not only do,
not only [inaudible] there's

84
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:34,330
accountability built into it.
That's right.

85
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,170
So I didn't mean to say you can say
whatever you want,

86
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:39,220
this brand.
I mean you can put forth any idea you

87
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:40,540
want,
if you can back it up.

88
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,500
What we're seeing with anything
politicize is it's not about backing it

89
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,480
up.
Students are learning rhetorical

90
00:03:46,481 --> 00:03:50,680
techniques to link their enemies to
something racist.

91
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Contemptible some tangible that's bad.
Those are the things that are not only

92
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:59,830
worthy of being destroyed,
but that you have a moral duty to

93
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:00,790
destroy.
Exactly.

94
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,860
So that's right.
So it's almost like the immune system,

95
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,030
how exactly it works.

96
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,310
But there's some cell that tags Acel as
you know,

97
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,340
enemy,
enemy.

98
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:12,700
And once that tad was put on the cell
that attracts other,

99
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,120
I forget what kind of cell to
[inaudible].

100
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,660
And so we should look into this,
this metaphor of the immune system,

101
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:17,840
because you know,
once they know,

102
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,910
once you're labeled as a racist,
students don't have to read you that.

103
00:04:21,911 --> 00:04:24,800
It doesn't matter what you actually say.
You will now be a tap.

104
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,310
It's also too that once you're labeled
that way,

105
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:31,120
if someone defends you,
the label is contagious.

106
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,110
And it's our dynamic.
That's how we know where in this super

107
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:38,620
religious territory of witch hunts that
if you stand up for someone,

108
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:40,840
you are tagged and then you will be
mobbed.

109
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:43,000
Right?
And that's why there's so much disease

110
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,590
that,
and that's why there's so much cowardice

111
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:47,050
on campus among both students and
faculty.

112
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,160
People are afraid to stand up,
even if the majority think that what's

113
00:04:51,161 --> 00:04:53,710
going on is nuts or is unfair.

114
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,280
They're afraid to stand up.
And that's in part due to social media

115
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,750
because it's just,
I mean,

116
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:04,060
students today had been raised with
various platforms that make it easy for

117
00:05:04,061 --> 00:05:07,600
people to join in attack someone they
look at who liked what.

118
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,060
So if in that article we just saw on
read,

119
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,000
uh,
there was a bit of a counterrevolution

120
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:16,780
and read the students had to get
together somehow and decide should I

121
00:05:16,781 --> 00:05:18,880
like that post?
How about if we all liked it at the same

122
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:20,260
time,
then we'll get in less trouble.

123
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:21,400
Okay.
Okay.

124
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,510
So to what degree,
so let's talk about the aims of the

125
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:27,400
Heterodox Academy.
So you've brought people together who

126
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:31,780
are in principle interested in a
diversity of opinions and,

127
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,020
but,
but in what manner is that going to be

128
00:05:35,021 --> 00:05:36,730
utilized to,
to,

129
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,430
to,
I don't want to use the word combat,

130
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,160
but to,
but to deal with this emergent problem

131
00:05:42,161 --> 00:05:44,390
of ideological rigidity in the
university.

132
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,370
So,
uh,

133
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,890
two useful concepts here.
One is the emperor's new clothes.

134
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,510
Um,
we all know that story.

135
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,580
Um,
even if most people,

136
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:54,340
even if everybody sees this is nuts,
the empress walking around with no

137
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:56,290
clothes,
they're afraid to say it until one

138
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:57,830
person says it.
So,

139
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,280
and this is also the ash experiment.
Everybody says that that line is the

140
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:05,990
same as that line is obviously not true.
If one person says the truth,

141
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,040
then nobody conforms after that.
So the mere presence of a group of

142
00:06:10,041 --> 00:06:11,510
people who say,
you know what,

143
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,340
we actually need a diversity of
opinions.

144
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,530
And the fact that on our site we'll
publish things.

145
00:06:15,531 --> 00:06:18,560
So sometimes when professors are mob,
like when Bret Weinstein,

146
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,491
you know,
was mobbed,

147
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,140
you know,
so I wrote an essay that stood up for

148
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:21,890
him.
Uh,

149
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,780
we've done that for some of them.
It's happening so fast.

150
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,530
I can't keep up.

151
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,850
I can't,
I've got books to write and I,

152
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,970
you know,
every week there's some new member was

153
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:30,680
getting mobbed.
And so we're going to develop a team of

154
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:32,960
people who will write.
But just knowing that there are people

155
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:34,560
who will stand up for you,
um,

156
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,920
knowing that there are people who will
say,

157
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:40,220
wait a second,
this is not what we do in the academy.

158
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,380
So that's one thing is we just stand up
for each other too,

159
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:48,400
is we develop products that we think can
basically fix the situation.

160
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,460
So one of our products is called the
campus expression survey.

161
00:06:52,461 --> 00:06:56,360
It's a survey designed to actually
measure who was afraid of speaking up

162
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,510
about what topics and why,
what are they afraid of?

163
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,960
And it turns out everyone's afraid of
the students more than the faculty.

164
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,270
Uh,
they're afraid of mostly to talk about

165
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:06,710
race.
What about the administrators?

166
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:09,070
Everyone's afraid of the students.
They're afraid of the students.

167
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:11,630
So I don't have,
we've not sorted them.

168
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,760
I've only surveyed students.
Okay.

169
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,900
But from what we hear,
um,

170
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,600
uh,
people are afraid of,

171
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:20,390
of the students,
um,

172
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,151
you know,
well,

173
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:23,400
that's what your hauling,
hauling in its own manner.

174
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,430
Like was that real of leaders?
That's for sure.

175
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:29,070
They let those kids come into the
classroom,

176
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,490
the actual classroom and disrupt a class
on an ongoing basis.

177
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,730
I mean,
yes and I couldn't understand that

178
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:36,564
exactly.
I mean,

179
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,400
my response to that would be first I
would tell them to leave.

180
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,350
Second,
I would call campus security.

181
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,090
Third,
if something wasn't done about it,

182
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:48,390
I just wouldn't teach the class.
So I don't understand like it,

183
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,690
it seems to me that it's also up to
individual professors to draw a line,

184
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,270
which is that if you're being
intimidated,

185
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:55,650
dated by students,
why do you,

186
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,720
why do you show up and teach the class?

187
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,860
I don't understand that.
Yeah.

188
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,570
So again,
people are afraid to stand up if it

189
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:05,310
means that people will call you a
racist,

190
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,830
Cabot God.
I mean it's,

191
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,730
it's weird and that situation though,
because it's carried to third to go to

192
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:12,110
your class,
you know,

193
00:08:12,111 --> 00:08:14,350
and there's a much more proximal thread
there.

194
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,510
That's what I mean.
What I'm most alarmed by is the rise of

195
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:20,540
intimidation.
Intimidation is now a factor in many

196
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,550
aspects of academic life.
And that's just terrible.

197
00:08:22,551 --> 00:08:26,270
That's completely incompatible with,
with what we do and who we are.

198
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,510
Well,
it's especially,

199
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:30,750
it's especially appalling given that
whatever happens in the university

200
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:31,460
campuses,
you know,

201
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,960
like one of the questions I've faced in
Canada as well,

202
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:37,030
why should we care about what's
happening in the,

203
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,170
in the Ivy Tower is going to hire these
people next year.

204
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,731
You are?
Yeah.

205
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:43,820
Well it's the heart.
Like what's happening in the campuses is

206
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:45,510
going to happen in society in five
years.

207
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,180
It's already hot goats.
It's already happening.

208
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,800
So this is actually an important,
um,

209
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,240
I,
I just gave a talk at a,

210
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:53,830
at a big law firm here in New York where
they're very devoted to diversity,

211
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,070
but they're doing it right.
They're really about diversity.

212
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,260
Why is diversity good?
And so they have a whole month on

213
00:08:58,261 --> 00:09:00,180
viewpoint diversity,
which is just fantastic.

214
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,350
And what I'm learning from talking to a
number of people in the business world

215
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,520
is that in the last year,
they're now all these pressures on

216
00:09:08,521 --> 00:09:13,521
leaders to endorse this condemned that
signed this open letter and coming into

217
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,420
human resources.
That's right.

218
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,550
That's right.
But it's the same dynamic we have on

219
00:09:17,551 --> 00:09:20,730
campus and the answer to it.
So if anybody,

220
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,530
anybody watching here,
if you run a business,

221
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:24,870
if you have friends who are in business,
I think the only,

222
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,720
the,
the,

223
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,360
the,
they're only two stable equilibria.

224
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:30,510
One is that every organization is just
either,

225
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:32,760
all right wing were all left wing,
but that would be disastrous.

226
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:33,331
So you,
so are there,

227
00:09:33,331 --> 00:09:34,230
you just say,
okay,

228
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,670
we're on one side,
that'd be terrible.

229
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,840
The other is what we call the Chicago
principles of free expression.

230
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,740
The University of Chicago has the best
statement out there on how the

231
00:09:43,741 --> 00:09:48,000
university provides a platform on which
multiple views can contest.

232
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,310
The university does not take anyone's
side.

233
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,100
That's the only other stable
alternative.

234
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,800
And I think leaders need to do this in
business.

235
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:58,620
It certainly universities.
So we're encouraging every university to

236
00:09:58,621 --> 00:10:02,730
adopt the Chicago principles because a
lot of what mass action is,

237
00:10:02,731 --> 00:10:07,380
is an attempt to compel the authority to
come in on your side and punish your

238
00:10:07,381 --> 00:10:08,170
enemies.
Yup.
