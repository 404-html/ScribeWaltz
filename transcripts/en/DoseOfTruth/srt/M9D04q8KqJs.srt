1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,500
Lots of times when,

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:04,290
when I'd been treating
people for depression,

3
00:00:04,291 --> 00:00:04,921
for example,

4
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:05,754
or anxiety,

5
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:07,590
they have existential issues.

6
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:07,961
You know what,

7
00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:09,960
it's not just some psychiatric condition.

8
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,220
It's not just the third tapped off of
normal because their brain chemistry is

9
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:14,660
faulty.

10
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:15,420
Although,

11
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:15,841
you know,

12
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:17,670
sometimes that happens to be the case.

13
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:22,440
It's that they are overwhelmed by the
suffering and complexity of their life and

14
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:26,210
they're not sure why it's
reasonable to continue with it.

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:26,461
You know,

16
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:30,270
that they can feel that terrible
negative meanings of life,

17
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:34,200
but are skeptical beyond belief
about any of the positive meanings.

18
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,520
I had one client who was a very brilliant
artist and as long as he didn't think

19
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:39,420
he was fine,

20
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:39,691
you know,

21
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:43,140
because he'd go and create and who
is really good at being an artist,

22
00:00:43,141 --> 00:00:43,620
he just,

23
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:43,831
you know,

24
00:00:43,831 --> 00:00:47,970
he had that personality that was
continually creative and quite brilliant.

25
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,530
Although he was self denigrating and,

26
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,100
but as soon as he started to
think about what he was doing,

27
00:00:53,101 --> 00:00:53,400
then,

28
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:53,701
you know,

29
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,270
the,

30
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:55,103
the,

31
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:56,743
it's like a,

32
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,850
like a drill or a thought
or something like that.

33
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,870
He'd saw the branch off that he was
sitting on because he'd start to criticize

34
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:04,740
what he was doing.

35
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:06,060
Even the utility of it,

36
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:08,160
even though it was sort
of self evidently useful,

37
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:09,480
and then he would be,

38
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,171
then it would be very,

39
00:01:10,171 --> 00:01:13,170
very hard for him to even
motivate himself to create.

40
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,101
And He,

41
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:14,280
I,

42
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,200
he always struck me as a good example of,

43
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,933
of

44
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,110
the consequences of having your rational
intellect divorced in some way from

45
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,100
your being divorced enough so that it
actually questions the utility of your

46
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:29,934
being.

47
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,500
And it's not a good thing.

48
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,990
It's not a good thing and it's,

49
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,700
it's really not a good thing because it
manifests itself not only an individual

50
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:42,300
psychopathology but also
in social psychopathology.

51
00:01:42,301 --> 00:01:45,270
And that's his proclivity of people
to get tangled up in etiology.
