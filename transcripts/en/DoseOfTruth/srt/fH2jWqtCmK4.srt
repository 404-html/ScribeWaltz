1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:08,210
Oh my God,

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,800
the evidence about mental,

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:11,420
the mental health crisis that adolescence,

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,070
when Greg and I wrote the article,

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:13,791
we were,

6
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:14,570
you know,

7
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,740
we saw lots of hints that depression and
anxiety were gone way up and we think

8
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:21,580
that's related to the
protection you have do.

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:21,850
Okay.

10
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:22,220
So let,

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,560
let's talk about that just for a
sec and then go back to the book.

12
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:28,250
So I've got a dem potential demographic
explanations for that in part.

13
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,210
Well,

14
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:31,130
and I don't know if you guys
have looked into this or not.

15
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:31,821
Well there,

16
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:32,570
there's,

17
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:35,090
there's two things that I think
might be contributing to it.

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,990
One is two or three things.

19
00:00:38,991 --> 00:00:42,680
One is the average age
at which children are,

20
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,653
uh,

21
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,520
the average age at which people
have children has gone way up.

22
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:47,001
That's true.

23
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:47,161
Okay.

24
00:00:47,161 --> 00:00:48,170
So why does that matter?

25
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:48,561
Well,

26
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:51,800
because I think people
get more conservative and
cautious as they get older,

27
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,060
but that's true.

28
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,320
But it's a very small effect.

29
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:54,610
Okay.

30
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:54,920
And it's,

31
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,450
wait a second.

32
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:55,710
Okay.

33
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,380
It's the having of the kids,

34
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,940
which is what makes
them more conservative.

35
00:00:58,941 --> 00:00:59,960
When you have kids,

36
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,610
you are more threat sensitive,

37
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,410
you're more likely to vote
for the right wing party.

38
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,720
So just delaying child,

39
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:06,550
child,

40
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:06,930
uh,

41
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,763
childbirth wouldn't.

42
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:08,091
Okay.

43
00:01:08,091 --> 00:01:08,630
What about,

44
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:09,980
what about fewer siblings?

45
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:10,641
That would,

46
00:01:10,641 --> 00:01:11,360
yes,

47
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,193
that's part of it.

48
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:12,741
Uh,

49
00:01:12,741 --> 00:01:14,180
and this is what we're seeing in Asia too.

50
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,890
When you have a lot of kids,

51
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,680
you're not quite as worried,

52
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:19,190
you don't have all your
eggs in one basket.

53
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,460
Well and you can probably just worried
and the siblings raise each other.

54
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:22,820
That's right.

55
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,091
Right.

56
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:23,924
And then there's a lot of

57
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,480
quite,

58
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,170
exactly.

59
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,730
It's the free play and the fighting,

60
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,530
the working things out for themselves.

61
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,360
Those are essential skills of adulthood.

62
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:32,631
Okay.

63
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:33,110
So cool.

64
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,010
So then all right.

65
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:35,810
Smaller family sizes,

66
00:01:35,811 --> 00:01:36,620
part of it.

67
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:36,861
Well,

68
00:01:36,861 --> 00:01:40,190
and then also what's
happening increasingly in
schools is that kids aren't

69
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:42,220
allowed free play and there are certain,

70
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,190
not even loud,

71
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,870
rough and tumble free play.

72
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,793
Exactly.

73
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,280
That's right.

74
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,420
That's one of the biggest things about,

75
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:47,950
so the two,

76
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,151
the,

77
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:48,490
the,

78
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,230
there are three giant there.

79
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:50,850
There are a lot of cards.

80
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:50,971
It's,

81
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:51,290
it's,

82
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:51,680
I mean,

83
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,940
this is such actually,

84
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:55,670
it's really fun puzzle because it's like
the biggest social science puzzle of

85
00:01:55,671 --> 00:01:56,504
our age.

86
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,230
What is happening that's making so
many of our systems go haywire and I'm

87
00:02:00,231 --> 00:02:01,190
focusing on the university.

88
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,190
The big three I would say
are one is the loss of,

89
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:04,910
of free,

90
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,310
unsupervised free play.

91
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,430
And Peter Gray has been brilliant
on this season I Boston College,

92
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,350
showing how even among young animals,

93
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,860
they have to practice the skills for
adulthood and getting in at showing that

94
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:16,120
to,

95
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:16,953
exactly.

96
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,760
So getting in conflicts and then dealing
with it and sometimes losing your,

97
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:22,603
come back,

98
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,920
having game in which there's a problem,

99
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:26,720
but you have to work it
out with the game stops.

100
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,160
That's what kids always did.

101
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,250
It's only recently the night beginning
in the nineties that they're always

102
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,980
supervised because we're afraid
if we take our eyes off them,

103
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:34,910
there'll be kidnapped.

104
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,710
And that was never a risk was never right.
