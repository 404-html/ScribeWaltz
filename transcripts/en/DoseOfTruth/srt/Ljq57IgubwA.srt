1
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:09,780
My lower Iq clients,

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,700
they used to go to the government
agencies that were designed to help people

3
00:00:12,701 --> 00:00:13,630
find employment.

4
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:14,351
And you know,

5
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,880
the typical response was,

6
00:00:15,881 --> 00:00:16,480
well,

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,210
just go home and type up
your CV and distributes.

8
00:00:19,211 --> 00:00:19,830
It's like,

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,180
yeah,

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:20,480
uh,

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:20,860
you're,

12
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,000
you just go like,

13
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,620
I can't use a computer.

14
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:24,640
I can't type,

15
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,380
I don't know what a CV is.

16
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,161
It's like it's,

17
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,260
it's a nonstarter and all three councils,

18
00:00:29,261 --> 00:00:29,680
right?

19
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,010
That's right.

20
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:35,010
So in the United States are 51 million
people with iqs under 85 and there were

21
00:00:35,831 --> 00:00:39,040
about 43 million people living in poverty.

22
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:42,310
Do you think those Venn
diagrams intersect?

23
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:42,900
Yeah.

24
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,030
You're,

25
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:43,211
well,

26
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:46,720
we should also be clear about this because
it is so politically suspect is that

27
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,330
it's not like it's,

28
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:49,970
it's,

29
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:50,803
it's,

30
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,830
it's self evident that people who have
less cognitive capability are likely to

31
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,410
end up poor because there are serious,

32
00:01:03,411 --> 00:01:08,411
complex problems in life that the Septum
that they have a difficult time dealing

33
00:01:08,511 --> 00:01:10,340
with and they can't learn as quickly.

34
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:15,800
And so the relationship between poverty
and intelligence is self evident.

35
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,440
If you're willing to think it
through for any length of time.

36
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,840
It doesn't mean that
everybody who's rich that is,

37
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,370
it doesn't mean that everyone who is
rich is smart and it doesn't mean that

38
00:01:25,371 --> 00:01:28,250
everyone who is horror is stupid.
