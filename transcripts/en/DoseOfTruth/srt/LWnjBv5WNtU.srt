1
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,133
Long suffering.

2
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,750
One of the things that I was noticing
from the stories of Jacob and a lot of

3
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:23,490
these biblical narratives is you do have
this all powerful God who is able to

4
00:00:23,491 --> 00:00:27,390
kind of essentially be the hidden
protagonist in the narrative.

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:32,270
But then the funny thing is that he's
kind of revealing some of his qualities

6
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,390
throughout the course of the story.

7
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:34,590
So you were talking about,

8
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:35,973
um,

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,400
the weird paradox of the fact that God,

10
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:44,401
somehow ally was Jacob Israel to win the
fight and he does that with Abraham to,

11
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,300
yeah.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,160
So my question is relating to pan seps
thing about the rats that you told like

13
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:53,010
three or four times and the number of
occasions I saw when I got my recent

14
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,311
videos,

15
00:00:53,311 --> 00:00:57,060
you talked about it where the bigger rat
lets the smaller rat win because then

16
00:00:57,061 --> 00:00:57,450
the other,

17
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:59,370
the smaller rep won't engage in the game.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,420
So the question is,

19
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,860
is two fold for me.

20
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,880
One is God allowing humanity
to win periodically.

21
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,470
So that's to allow us to actually engage
in the dialogue through these stories

22
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,580
and to,

23
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,420
is it a much more primitive
version of the virtue of humility?

24
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,480
Which you wouldn't normally
characterize of an of an omnipotent,

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:20,970
omnipotent day at [inaudible].

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:22,981
Well,

27
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:24,540
those are excellent questions.

28
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,000
I really liked the second
one in particular that
that that God's decision to

29
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:34,710
allow human victory from time to time
is actually a manifestation of something

30
00:01:34,711 --> 00:01:37,440
approximating humility or at least mercy.

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,050
But humility is an interesting take on it.

32
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:40,371
Well,

33
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:45,371
it's also connected to Paul's image of
how Christ handed him hands himself over

34
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,900
and allows himself to be defeated
by men and therefore a conquers sin,

35
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,160
which is man's enemy.

36
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,210
It's a weird,

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,250
it's the same paradox where God enters
into that dynamic with people and loses

38
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,960
and willingly loses.

39
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:01,641
Yeah.

40
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:03,830
Well that's okay.

41
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,450
So if the first thing I would say is that,

42
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,430
that's a really interesting analogy.

43
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:08,660
I,

44
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,493
I,

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,391
I can't,

46
00:02:11,391 --> 00:02:15,460
it's complicated enough
questions so that I can't go be,

47
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:19,220
I don't think I can go beyond the question
actually because it's so complicated

48
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:22,070
that I don't think I can formulate
it any better than you already did.

49
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,590
Like it's an interesting string of ideas.

50
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:29,591
I'd have to play with it a while to see
it does shed interesting light on why

51
00:02:30,621 --> 00:02:34,580
God is amenable to negotiation
in the Old Testament,

52
00:02:34,581 --> 00:02:35,660
which is really a strange,

53
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,531
as you pointed out,

54
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,580
it's really a strange thing.

55
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:42,410
It's like this is omnipotent God who
obviously can do whatever he wants and yet

56
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:43,040
he allowed,

57
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,660
he can be bargained with.

58
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:49,130
And then that also opens up the question
of why like your hypothesis as well.

59
00:02:49,131 --> 00:02:51,290
If you don't let the little
rat win now and then,

60
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:53,990
then they get dejected and quit playing.

61
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,770
And that's,

62
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,371
I mean that's,

63
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:58,700
that's a pretty good observation if
people don't get to win now and then,

64
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,591
you know,

65
00:02:59,591 --> 00:02:59,920
they,

66
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,420
that's kind of what happens to cane.

67
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,681
God says,

68
00:03:02,681 --> 00:03:04,270
well you're not playing a straight game.

69
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,350
That's why you're not winning.

70
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,573
But

71
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,243
I dunno,

72
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,320
there's an intimation in the old testament
and I think it's more developed in

73
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:18,070
the New Testament,

74
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,280
maybe not that the
straighter the game you play,

75
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,900
the more likely you are to win.

76
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,370
And so maybe part of the reason that God
lets Abraham bargain and even Jacob is

77
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:33,700
because they've started to
play very straight games.

78
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,870
And so maybe you do when you're wrestling
with God if you play a straight game.

79
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,820
I mean I think that's,

80
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,840
I actually think that's,

81
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:45,340
I think the reason that's true is because
that's actually why we would define it

82
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:47,020
as a street gate now.

83
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,730
Then we could speak psychologically.

84
00:03:48,731 --> 00:03:49,390
Again,

85
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,390
I think that what we've come to recognize
as a straight game is the game that in

86
00:03:55,301 --> 00:04:00,301
the broadest number of situations across
the widest range of time spans is most

87
00:04:01,061 --> 00:04:02,830
likely to produce a positive outcome.

88
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:03,580
And that's,

89
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:07,720
that's actually the grounds for our sense
of ethics that it's really practical.

90
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,420
Not to Belabor it too
much because there was,

91
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:14,260
there was an interesting insight from
Chesterton's demand who was Thursday where

92
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:19,261
God sets himself up as the benevolent
antagonist so as to accelerate the game.

93
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,520
Yeah.

94
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,920
Well I think that that's
a really interesting idea.

95
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:26,540
I mean there is,

96
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,780
there is hints I would say throughout
the biblical stories that the reason that

97
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:34,160
God tolerates Satan,

98
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:34,641
let's say,

99
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,310
is because without an adversary,

100
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,300
you're soft.

101
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,250
And that's,

102
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:40,431
I mean,

103
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:44,510
that's tied in with the notion that
life is something like a moral struggle.

104
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,021
You know,

105
00:04:45,021 --> 00:04:48,200
that that's the fundamental
essence of being a moral struggle.

106
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,710
Now I think that that's phenomenologically
a reasonable observation.

107
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,420
Maybe it's maybe other people
don't experience it that way,

108
00:04:56,421 --> 00:05:00,770
but it seems to me like within my
own experience that that's accurate.

109
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:01,491
Now,

110
00:05:01,491 --> 00:05:02,061
I don't know what,

111
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:02,361
again,

112
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:05,270
I don't know what that says about
the fundamental nature of reality,

113
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,660
but I had a vision at one point that
I was in a ring with Satan actually,

114
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,380
uh,

115
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,213
believe it or not.

116
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,810
And um,

117
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:17,120
it was like a Roman coliseum.

118
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,460
And you know,

119
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:22,790
I was rather upset to find myself there,

120
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,690
but I won.

121
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:28,640
And I asked God afterwards
why he would do such a thing.

122
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,510
And his answer was he knew I could win.

123
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,250
That's interesting.

124
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:34,461
You know,

125
00:05:34,461 --> 00:05:35,330
because like,

126
00:05:35,331 --> 00:05:36,530
I don't know what to make of that.

127
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:37,041
Believe me,

128
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,420
I have no idea what to make of that.

129
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,720
But the idea was that if you're trying
to encourage someone rather than protect

130
00:05:45,981 --> 00:05:46,161
them,

131
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:47,510
because those are really different things,

132
00:05:47,511 --> 00:05:47,810
right?

133
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:49,760
To protect someone isn't
to make them strong,

134
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:51,620
to encourage them is to make them strong.

135
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,370
Then you set them a series of challenges,

136
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,253
right?

137
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:58,581
Right.

138
00:05:58,581 --> 00:06:03,581
At the point where they may win and maybe
you could make a case that that's what

139
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,780
you do if you really care for someone.

140
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,280
Now I know that that's it.

141
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,280
I'm not saying that that
interpretation is correct.

142
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:10,960
I'm not,

143
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,570
I'm not,

144
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:12,200
but,

145
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,220
but there's something,

146
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,070
I mean you definitely with your children,

147
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,720
you know when you're wrestling with them,

148
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:18,950
say when you're playing with them,

149
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,570
you use,

150
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,853
okay.

151
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:27,520
Push them to the limit of their ability
because otherwise they don't transcend

152
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:28,780
their current abilities.

153
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,603
So

154
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:33,900
Yep.

155
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,900
[inaudible]

156
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,640
so we'll see some of you,

157
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,360
perhaps most of you in December and I
think we'll finish off genesis at that

158
00:06:54,701 --> 00:06:55,534
point.

159
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,800
And then in the new year,

160
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:58,600
probably not till the spring,

161
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,090
I'll start with exodus,

162
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,480
which I'm really looking forward to
because I really liked the exodus story.

163
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:07,390
It's an amazing story
and unbelievably deep,

164
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,360
not well the ones we've covered so far,

165
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,070
you know,

166
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,380
pretty good as well.

167
00:07:11,381 --> 00:07:14,820
But so thank you all for coming and
will perhaps see you in about it.
