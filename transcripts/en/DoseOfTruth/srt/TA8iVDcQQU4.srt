1
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,783
If you don't mind,

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,710
you have a whole corpus
of work and there are,

3
00:00:14,711 --> 00:00:18,920
we current seems in some sense one of
them being things are getting better in

4
00:00:18,921 --> 00:00:20,770
ways that we really don't know.

5
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,713
What are you,

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,220
what if you could have what you wanted
with regards to the impact of your books,

7
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:28,520
what,

8
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:32,680
what would you want that impact
to be and also what do you think?

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,010
Like one of the things I've done on
Twitter recently because I'm trying to

10
00:00:36,011 --> 00:00:37,060
figure out how to use Twitter,

11
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:42,061
is to tilt my tweets towards people like
human progress.org someone you site in

12
00:00:42,821 --> 00:00:46,480
your introduction and people who are
purveying information while including

13
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:47,350
yourself by the way,

14
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,650
who are purveying information about
how much better things are getting.

15
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:54,760
And so what impact would you like to
have your books have and how do you see

16
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:56,470
that playing out psychologically,

17
00:00:56,471 --> 00:01:00,940
politically and what do you think people
who are listening now say could do

18
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:04,270
practically to get the
good news out so to speak?

19
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:05,550
Yeah,

20
00:01:05,550 --> 00:01:09,120
certainly intellectual life
should be more data driven.

21
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:14,300
I bet you shouldn't be allowed to say
talk about any reported trend based on an

22
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,540
event that happened
yesterday or this year.

23
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:23,900
Because trend means change over time and
in so many areas we really do have data

24
00:01:24,331 --> 00:01:28,020
and if you're responsible
not to to a site those data,

25
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,250
particularly since they
have become increasingly
available through websites like

26
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,580
our world in data and cubit progress.

27
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,970
So I'd like to see a replacement
of ideological debate,

28
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,980
which so much of our,

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,270
our current debate is,

30
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,900
it's whether the right or
the left is more saintly,

31
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:49,734
moral,

32
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:50,793
uh,

33
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,450
praiseworthy,

34
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,283
correct.

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,220
And more,

36
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,461
uh,

37
00:01:53,461 --> 00:01:53,740
well,

38
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:53,931
well,

39
00:01:53,931 --> 00:01:54,780
let's look at the data.

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,140
It's,

41
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:59,130
chances are that neither an off the
shelf position of the left nor an off the

42
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:01,620
shelf position and the right is
likely to have it all figured out.

43
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,000
No one is this,

44
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:03,460
the end or,

45
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,410
or infallible.

46
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,420
These ideologies go back to the,

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:10,740
to the French revolution and they're
unlikely to be the font of solutions to

48
00:02:10,741 --> 00:02:11,880
complex problems.

49
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:13,950
Let's try to see what works,

50
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,581
what doesn't,

51
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:18,360
and come up with the mixture of what
is most likely to solve our problems.

52
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,210
Spoken like a true proponent
of the enlightenment.

53
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:21,980
Yeah,

54
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,813
I guess,

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,370
uh,

56
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,190
and stepping back even farther,

57
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,400
I would like to see a
greater integration of the,

58
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,293
um,

59
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:29,790
uh,

60
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,110
the,

61
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:35,110
the insights and mindset of the science
into social and cultural affairs.

62
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,530
As we talked about earlier
in the conversation.

63
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,770
This very ideas often met with horror.

64
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:43,410
Yeah.

65
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:44,350
Well you don't just,

66
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,710
the humanities types I suppose in some
sense aren't very happy with the idea of

67
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:50,190
that they'd have to learn statistics.

68
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,670
And I can I have a certain amount of
sympathy for that perspective button?

69
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:54,841
Well,

70
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:55,290
there is,

71
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:55,561
yes,

72
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:56,150
there is a,

73
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:56,271
uh,

74
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:57,104
a horror,

75
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,320
the expanding realm of a bad
number in data and a horror at the,

76
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,310
uh,

77
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,860
the thought that,

78
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:06,880
uh,

79
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,800
ideas about human nature from,

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,940
from science,

81
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,760
from evolutionary psychology,

82
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,150
from behavioral genetics,

83
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:18,430
from social and personality and cognitive
psychology might be brought to bear on

84
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,560
our understanding of society,

85
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,520
of justice,

86
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,110
of art,

87
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,370
literature and fiction.

88
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:29,800
Quite contrary to be the mindset of
the enlightenment where all of the

89
00:03:29,801 --> 00:03:30,990
enlightenment philosophers off.

90
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:31,900
We're,

91
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,281
uh,

92
00:03:32,281 --> 00:03:34,150
we're pretty serious psychologists.

93
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,830
It'd be the field didn't
exist at the time,

94
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,850
so they weren't called that.

95
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,043
But they,

96
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:38,950
uh,

97
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:41,530
mind the observations from,

98
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,800
from travelers of missionaries and
a and explorers out be ways of other

99
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:47,884
cultures.

100
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:51,340
They relied on their own
observations and common sense.

101
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,520
They tapped into what brain
science existed at the time.

102
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:55,181
So it's not a,

103
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:58,740
it's hardly a radical idea
that our understanding of,

104
00:03:58,750 --> 00:03:59,380
uh,

105
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:03,280
of art and culture and society should be
informed by our understanding of human

106
00:04:03,281 --> 00:04:04,000
nature.

107
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,540
But now that the disciplines have become
so professionalized and they're housed

108
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:10,540
in different buildings on
campus and there are rivals for,

109
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,230
uh,

110
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,220
money from the dean,

111
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:12,770
uh,

112
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:17,770
there's great hostility to
the old enlightenment idea
of consilience is often a,

113
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:18,740
a,

114
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:18,980
a,

115
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,330
a paranoid fear that this means that
the sciences we'll take over the

116
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,164
humanities,

117
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,550
which of course is preposterous.

118
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,070
They wouldn't,

119
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:25,841
they would want to,

120
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,110
they couldn't there to be here.

121
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:27,511
No,

122
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:30,210
and I think the sciences can
really inform the humanities.

123
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:30,500
I mean,

124
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,171
my first side,

125
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,004
yeah,

126
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,690
I had to be trained as a scientist.

127
00:04:33,691 --> 00:04:37,230
My appreciation for the humanities
is actually substantially deepened.

128
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,840
So in here

129
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,010
and indeed in many fields,

130
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:41,920
this is a authentic,

131
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:42,490
complete,

132
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:42,830
my,

133
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,580
one of my own fields of linguistics.

134
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,590
It's just taken for granted and no
one really cares where the humanities

135
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,610
influences.

136
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,880
I ended the scientific ones begin studies
of philology classical grammar of uh,

137
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:01,671
of texts now blend into
statistical studies of uh,

138
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:03,030
of Corpora,

139
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,860
of laboratory studies,

140
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:09,861
of speech and language processing and
where the science ends up in the ends off

141
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:12,270
in the humanities begins
no one even talks.

142
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:12,410
Yeah.

143
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,490
Oh the science can also really change,

144
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,900
can really change your mind.

145
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:20,070
Like I've looked at individual differences
in relationship to political belief

146
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:25,610
and so I've learned three things from
doing that that I think are revolutionary

147
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:27,270
had been revolutionary for me.

148
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:28,950
So the first is that

149
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:30,763
mmm,

150
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,640
liberal lefty types are characterized
by higher trade openness and lower

151
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:37,610
conscientiousness and then
conservatives the reverse.

152
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,091
And I think,

153
00:05:39,091 --> 00:05:41,880
well that's quite interesting cause
it puts the liberal left types in the

154
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:45,570
creative entrepreneurial domain cause
that's characterized by high openness and

155
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:48,780
it puts the conservative types in the
managerial and administrative domain.

156
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:54,000
And so that implies that the liberal
left types create new ideas and new

157
00:05:54,001 --> 00:05:57,440
enterprises including entrepreneurial
enterprises cause the doubted there is

158
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:58,274
fairly solid.

159
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,690
Where's the conservative types,

160
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,810
manage and administer those enterprises.

161
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,710
And so each needs the other.

162
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,220
And so there's that nice polarity dynamic.

163
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,480
And then there's also

164
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,750
the idea that the reason that openness
and conscientiousness unite to predict

165
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:17,030
political behavior is because of borders.

166
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,650
So open people like the borders between
concepts to be fluid so that there's

167
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:24,680
information exchange
and they're not orderly,

168
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,980
the liberal types because they're not
conscientious and so they don't see any

169
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,620
utility and keeping things
categorically distinct.

170
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,210
Whereas the conservatives are afraid of
the contamination of things because of

171
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:40,010
the movement of information and they like
to see the borders between things to,

172
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,600
to ensure that that's the case.

173
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:46,040
So the reason that openness
and conscientiousness stack
together as predictors

174
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,400
of political behavior
seems to be because of the,

175
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:54,160
I've two did fundamentally different
attitudes toward towards borders all the

176
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:55,990
way from the conceptual to the political.

177
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,860
So the right wingers think while
borders are good because that stops

178
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:04,030
contamination and is a real problem
and a definitely problem often.

179
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,950
And the liberal lefty type thing,

180
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,131
no,

181
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:06,251
no.

182
00:07:06,251 --> 00:07:08,500
We want as much information
to flow as possible.

183
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,120
And both of those perspectives are
valid and need to be discussed.

184
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,360
Then the other thing I learned
from the American empirical doubt,

185
00:07:16,361 --> 00:07:17,980
it was that orderliness,

186
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:18,960
which is part of conscious,

187
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:23,290
the part of conscientiousness predicts
conservatism is associated with disgust,

188
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:24,124
sensitivity,

189
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,760
and so that that feeds that desire to
maintain borders so that there's no cross

190
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:33,990
contamination that's associated with
what's being called the behavioral immune

191
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:34,380
system.

192
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,040
And so those are actually
quite revolutionary ideas
from the perspective of

193
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,874
political theory.

194
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,770
You know that the political belief is
temperamentally determined that the reason

195
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:47,010
that the two temperamental
traits determined political
belief is because of a

196
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,390
difference in attitude,

197
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:52,290
fundamental difference in attitude towards
the borders between things that you

198
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:57,090
can make a case for open and closed
borders on evolutionary grounds and that

199
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,600
there's a,

200
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,330
there's an association between
conservatism and discussed,

201
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:02,670
which to me shed tremendous light,

202
00:08:02,671 --> 00:08:03,211
for example,

203
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:07,110
on the motivations of Hitler who is an
extraordinarily orderly person and who

204
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,850
use disgust oriented language.

205
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:12,180
It's all the time when he was formulating
his policies of extermination.

206
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:15,990
So those are revolutionary
contributions of individual,

207
00:08:15,991 --> 00:08:20,440
different science to political theory
and it's all driven by hard data

208
00:08:20,441 --> 00:08:21,640
statistically derived.

209
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,311
Well,

210
00:08:23,311 --> 00:08:23,640
I,

211
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I agree and I can sense the kind of
paranoid reaction that these claims might

212
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:34,761
elicit among some traditional
political theorist and thinkers that,

213
00:08:35,161 --> 00:08:35,341
oh,

214
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:40,290
are you saying that the conservative
beliefs are nothing but an expression of

215
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:40,741
disgust,

216
00:08:40,741 --> 00:08:43,740
sensitivity and of course
it doesn't apply that these,

217
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,500
uh,

218
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,780
big fascinating findings don't say that
the earned income tax credit is a good

219
00:08:48,781 --> 00:08:52,830
or a bad idea or the Paris
climate accords by themselves.

220
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,880
I'd be issues still have to
be decided on their merits.

221
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,900
The other hand,

222
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:58,740
if you do,

223
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:03,770
if you are aware of your own potential
biases and that that is a source of

224
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:04,261
insight,

225
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:05,820
it's a source of understanding your cook.

226
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:09,900
It could cause you to step back from your
own convictions and be more receptive

227
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,910
to arguments on both sides.

228
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:12,970
Of course,

229
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,520
that was not for me,

230
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,010
that it can't not be a helpful,

231
00:09:17,011 --> 00:09:21,210
cannot be an important source of insight
as to how political debates unfold.

232
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,731
Yeah.

233
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:26,020
Well if you know that the liberal left
types are necessary for the fostering of

234
00:09:26,021 --> 00:09:28,990
new enterprises and the Conservatives
are necessary to run them,

235
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,540
then that certainly indicates why both
groups not only are necessary but are all

236
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,860
of mutual benefit.

237
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:40,660
Somebody has to maintain systems and
someone has to expand the and those things

238
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:44,350
are going to work in opposition to one
another because expanding a system often

239
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,263
fragments it.

240
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:50,670
So there's going to be tension but no
system can remain static forever and,

241
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,310
and,

242
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:56,140
and completely untrammeled transformation
throws everything into chaos.

243
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:59,050
So there obviously has to be a
dialogue between those two viewpoints.

244
00:09:59,200 --> 00:09:59,800
Like a,

245
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,680
it's like an opponent
process issue essentially.

246
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,621
Yes.

247
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:04,971
And,

248
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:05,461
and uh,

249
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:06,930
all of us ought to be,

250
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:07,650
uh,

251
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,311
more aware,

252
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:11,640
have more insight into how our own psych,

253
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,660
psychological,

254
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:13,783
uh,

255
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,090
proclivities might,

256
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:15,670
uh,

257
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:20,640
affect the positions that seem to each
of us to be obvious to meet welding

258
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,000
and that is what they do.

259
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:22,211
Right.

260
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:26,290
Cause the temperamental variable
variables actually tell you what is self

261
00:10:26,291 --> 00:10:27,040
evident.

262
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,150
That's how they operate.

263
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,000
Hmm.

264
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,890
My understanding from,

265
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,020
from the literature that
you're citing is that the,

266
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,100
the,

267
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,700
uh,

268
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,810
variance and opinions that is correlated
with an eight personality differences

269
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,670
is also the hardest to get people to,

270
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:41,500
to give out,

271
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:41,780
to,

272
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,760
to persuade them.

273
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,271
Yeah.

274
00:10:43,271 --> 00:10:43,960
Well,

275
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,150
no doubt because I think the,

276
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,510
those temperamental differences
are like axiomatic values,

277
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,321
you know,

278
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:50,481
and,

279
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:55,360
and they're grounded and I think they're
grounded in the hyper development of

280
00:10:55,361 --> 00:10:56,380
separate circuitry.

281
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,840
So it's going to be very,

282
00:10:58,841 --> 00:10:59,170
very,

283
00:10:59,170 --> 00:10:59,440
I mean,

284
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,210
and I also think that like if you're an x,

285
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:02,080
if you're an introvert,

286
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,250
you want to learn to be an extrovert.

287
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,380
You have to learn it.

288
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,540
Micro skill by micro skill,

289
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,261
right?

290
00:11:08,261 --> 00:11:09,730
There's no revolution.

291
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:13,000
There is no revolutionary
cognitive transformation
that's going to turn you into

292
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:13,780
an extrovert.

293
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:15,010
You can pick up the skills,

294
00:11:15,011 --> 00:11:15,550
but it's,

295
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,590
it's bit by bit it and it's incremental.

296
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:21,340
And so I think it's the same with
political attitudes is you can develop an

297
00:11:21,341 --> 00:11:25,420
appreciation for the viewpoint of
people who are on the other side of the

298
00:11:25,421 --> 00:11:26,440
temperamental divide.

299
00:11:26,441 --> 00:11:27,520
But it's a,

300
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,760
it's an increment by increment
and bounce and it's very,

301
00:11:30,761 --> 00:11:31,630
very effortful,

302
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:32,860
but necessary.

303
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,760
It's necessary.

304
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,361
You know,

305
00:11:34,361 --> 00:11:34,491
it,

306
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:39,491
it's been really useful to me
to see where the cognitive,

307
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:40,830
sociological,

308
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:45,390
political utility of both
political temperaments lights and,

309
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:46,500
and,

310
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,090
and why it's so crucially important.

311
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:48,570
I mean,

312
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,430
with regards to discuss the sensitivity,

313
00:11:50,431 --> 00:11:51,211
I mean you might think,

314
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:54,640
well that's pure reduct purely
reductionistic regards to the conservative

315
00:11:54,641 --> 00:11:55,121
viewpoint.

316
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:55,871
But no,

317
00:11:55,871 --> 00:12:00,871
a lot of people in history have died
as a consequence of cross cultural

318
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,200
contamination,

319
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,501
right?

320
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:04,900
I mean there are estimates that up to 90%,

321
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:08,950
maybe even 95% of the native Americans
perished because of their exposure to the

322
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:09,784
Spaniards.

323
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:10,883
Right.

324
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:15,610
And so the idea that
contamination is a problem when,

325
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,630
when two things that
were distinct unite is,

326
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,540
is,

327
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,540
is a truism and it's a
powerful evolutionary force.

328
00:12:22,690 --> 00:12:25,120
An equally powerful is
the observation that well,

329
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:25,391
yeah,

330
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:26,224
despite that,

331
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,400
despite that though,

332
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,380
the benefit of information flow,

333
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:32,830
free information flow and trade is so
overwhelming that you can't throw the baby

334
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:33,470
out with them.

335
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,303
Water.

336
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:35,341
Yes.

337
00:12:35,341 --> 00:12:36,720
It's a case where the

338
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,920
evolutionary adaptive value of a,

339
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,170
uh,

340
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,710
uh,

341
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:46,050
have a motive or a oven
emotion is explicable.

342
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:46,620
Uh,

343
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,420
and we can also recognize that thanks
to advances in science and technology,

344
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:55,950
the emotions themselves are no longer
particularly effective defenses against,

345
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:56,290
uh,

346
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,010
in this case infection by my packages.

347
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,710
We have much better ways
of protecting ourselves,

348
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,020
but we are stuck with these ancient,

349
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,220
uh,

350
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,160
adaptations,

351
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:05,650
which are,

352
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,670
are no longer whites who are
adaptive for the DB can be harmful,

353
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,840
especially when they're right to treat.

354
00:13:12,841 --> 00:13:17,790
Other people on the metaphor
of contaminants are pathogens.

355
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,130
And you're certainly right that in,

356
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,700
in not in Hitler's rhetoric,

357
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,380
despite the fact that he is often,

358
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,390
uh,

359
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:23,730
uh,

360
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:28,730
claimed to have used eugenic ideas to
motivate a genocide against the Jews.

361
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,980
I'm much more of his language came from,

362
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:32,580
uh,

363
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,540
from pathology and Estonia.

364
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:35,390
Oh yeah.

365
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,223
It's contempt.

366
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,343
And

367
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,850
there was a enterocytes parasites.

368
00:13:41,851 --> 00:13:42,684
Exactly.

369
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,040
Microbiology,

370
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,210
not genetics that daddy gave
him or is a toxic ideas.
