1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,270
My wife and I found out earlier in the
year and we may not be able to have

2
00:00:03,271 --> 00:00:03,960
children.

3
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,300
Then last month I was
diagnosed with cancer.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,080
Okay.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:09,070
Oh man,

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:10,990
how do I combat depression?

7
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:11,951
Well,

8
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:13,780
the first thing that we
should point out here,

9
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:15,370
I'm very sorry to hear about all that.

10
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:15,780
That's,

11
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:19,060
that's a lot of tragedy in
a very short period of time.

12
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:19,953
And,

13
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:20,530
um,

14
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,260
and I'm not going to give you
any casual advice because,

15
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,340
but I,

16
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,080
maybe I can make some things clearer.

17
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:28,240
The first is you're not depressed.

18
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,640
You've had terrible things happen to you.

19
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,020
That's not the same thing.

20
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,250
Right.

21
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,000
Okay.

22
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,320
I distinguished between them.

23
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:39,970
If a client comes to me and they say
they're feeling very sad and down and

24
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,610
anxious and worried about
everything and so forth,

25
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,350
then I kind of walked through their life.

26
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:46,060
Do they have friends?

27
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,110
Do they have a family?

28
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:48,580
Do they have a meaningful job?

29
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,180
It,

30
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,230
is their educational background
appropriate for their
level of intelligence and

31
00:00:53,231 --> 00:00:54,064
ability?

32
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,450
Are they taking care of themselves?

33
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,950
Do they have something to look forward to?

34
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,220
Did they use their time outside
of work productively and wisely,

35
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:00,881
et cetera.

36
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:03,850
So you think about those as
the dimensions of a good life.

37
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,433
There's more,

38
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,580
or maybe there's fewer,

39
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:10,090
but that's not too bad for a quick
and dirty first pass through,

40
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:10,924
let's say.

41
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:11,590
Um,

42
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,970
those are the dimensions by the way,

43
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:13,900
that you work on.

44
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,500
If you do the future authoring
program in the self authoring suite,

45
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:21,640
you're asked to think about all those
dimensions and consider what your life

46
00:01:21,641 --> 00:01:24,130
might be like if you
optimized along all of them.

47
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,923
And so,

48
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,183
um,

49
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:30,921
if you,

50
00:01:30,921 --> 00:01:34,550
if all of those things are going well
for you and you feel terrible all the

51
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:34,881
time,

52
00:01:34,881 --> 00:01:36,080
then you're depressed.

53
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,650
Okay.

54
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:38,410
Cause there's,

55
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,720
there's something wrong with
your emotional regulation.

56
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,021
You know,

57
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:41,261
I mean,

58
00:01:41,261 --> 00:01:43,870
maybe you're having an existential
crisis that's a possibility,

59
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:44,710
but I mean,

60
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:47,890
let's assume we can't see anything
structurally wrong with your life,

61
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:48,820
but you're feeling terrible.

62
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:49,871
Then I would say,

63
00:01:49,871 --> 00:01:50,560
well,

64
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,430
you have depression.

65
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,330
There's something wrong.

66
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,000
Maybe it's physiological
and people like that.

67
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:55,930
In my experience,

68
00:01:55,931 --> 00:01:58,540
those are the people who often
really benefit from antidepressants.

69
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:04,050
But then there's other sort of
person who who is in trouble.

70
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:06,760
You know,

71
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,593
they,

72
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,433
they,

73
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,890
their educational attainment
is not what it should be.

74
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,450
They don't have a job.

75
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,790
They have an alcohol or drug problem.

76
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,780
They have a family that's really not
functioning well or they don't have a

77
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:20,614
family.

78
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:22,780
Their immediate relationship,

79
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,480
intimate relationship is
nonexistent or terrible.

80
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,350
Um,

81
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,030
their friends are non existent or,

82
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,083
or,

83
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,750
or worthless and,

84
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,160
and destructive.

85
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,360
Um,

86
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,020
they don't get along with their relatives
there in poor mental and physical

87
00:02:38,021 --> 00:02:38,854
health.

88
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,200
You get the picture that's,

89
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,430
and they're not feeling good.

90
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,040
There are moods low and they're anxious.

91
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:46,270
That's not depression.

92
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,471
Like it might be,

93
00:02:47,471 --> 00:02:47,771
you know,

94
00:02:47,771 --> 00:02:48,580
but it's a terror.

95
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,211
But what that is,

96
00:02:49,211 --> 00:02:50,410
is a terrible life.

97
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,031
And,

98
00:02:51,031 --> 00:02:52,990
and those are different
things they needed to be,

99
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,090
they need to be
conceptualized differently.

100
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,460
Now even if you have a terrible life,

101
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,050
an antidepressant might be able to
lift you up enough so that you can keep

102
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:02,530
fighting.

103
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:02,951
Let's say,

104
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,270
assuming that that's what you're doing,

105
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:08,800
but an antidepressant
obviously isn't going to help,

106
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,720
isn't going to remove the
facts of your terrible life.

107
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,611
Now you,

108
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:18,980
you've got terrible things
happening to you at the moment and,

109
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,090
and there's no simple answer to that.

110
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,160
I would say you could,

111
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,750
you could take a look at
chapter 12 in my book,

112
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,280
12 rules for life.

113
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:31,950
It's,

114
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,370
it's called a pet,

115
00:03:33,371 --> 00:03:35,500
a cat when you encounter
one on the street.

116
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,490
And in part it's a,

117
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:41,410
it's an autobiography I autobiographical
chapter about how my wife and I and my

118
00:03:41,411 --> 00:03:41,861
family,

119
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,190
my,

120
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:43,450
my son and daughter and my,

121
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,700
my extended family as well dealt with
my daughter's extremely serious illness

122
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:49,390
while she,

123
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,223
it's still,

124
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,330
it's still plagues are to some degree,

125
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,920
although not nearly as much as it did.

126
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,120
She was very seriously ill
when she was a teenager and a,

127
00:03:58,121 --> 00:04:00,280
it was an ongoing crisis,

128
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,670
a continual for years of crisis.

129
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,960
And so the question is
how do you cope with that?

130
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:10,000
And the answer is,

131
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:14,260
the first answer is you
shrink your timeframe.

132
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,573
You know,

133
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,770
you've had these,

134
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,380
especially with regards to your diagnosis.

135
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,243
So like

136
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,620
all of a sudden your future has been
thrown completely into chaos and

137
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,930
you don't know how to deal with that.

138
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,940
And who would you do what you can to
stabilize your medical treatment and to

139
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,580
optimize your quality of
life while that's happening.

140
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,440
Very complicated thing to do.

141
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,260
And then I would say you live for the day,

142
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:45,310
you know,

143
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:46,420
for the week maybe,

144
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,550
maybe a week's too much even,

145
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,850
but for the day it's like
you get up in the morning,

146
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,180
you think I need to do everything I can
to make this day as meaningful and and

147
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:01,780
rich as I possibly can.

148
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,860
And hopefully I will have had a full day
by this evening and then I'll be able

149
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:11,800
to sleep and then I'll be able
to get up in the morning and say,

150
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:17,760
I'm going to try to make this day as
useful and meaningful and engaging as it

151
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:19,324
can be.

152
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,520
And then maybe when you're really sick,

153
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,361
you don't have a day,

154
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:24,940
you have hours and then you do
the same thing for the hours.

155
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:27,070
And then maybe you do the
same thing with the minutes.

156
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,290
I would also say,

157
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:32,531
you know,

158
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:37,180
you've been through a lot of shock and
it's conceivable that you might need to

159
00:05:37,181 --> 00:05:38,014
talk to someone.

160
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,500
It's also conceivable that an
antidepressant could help you,

161
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,701
you know,

162
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:47,050
you've got a lot to deal with and you
might need your nervous system might need

163
00:05:47,051 --> 00:05:49,510
some stabilization with all that stress.

164
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,120
And so that's something to consider.

165
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,690
Antidepressants are also quite
effective as pain medications,

166
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,860
especially a drug called.

167
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:02,300
So that's also worth knowing because
you need to know about effective pain

168
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:03,134
medication.

169
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,370
It's very important,

170
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,270
um,

171
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,180
in extreme situations of pain.

172
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,090
Opiates of course are the drug of choice,

173
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:14,600
but you could use drugs
like methylphenidate,

174
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,291
Ritalin,

175
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,910
the Adhd drug,

176
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,650
you can use them as adjuncts to,

177
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,000
to pain medication.

178
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,010
And people need to know that because the,

179
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:22,911
the,

180
00:06:22,911 --> 00:06:23,744
um,

181
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,430
there basically amphetamines,

182
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,370
amphetamines have analgesic properties,

183
00:06:28,371 --> 00:06:29,210
but they also keep,

184
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,300
they also maintain alertness.

185
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,910
And so the problem with opiates
is they can be sedating,

186
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:37,280
but an opiate amphetamine combination.

187
00:06:37,281 --> 00:06:40,220
And this is for people who are
in absolutely intractable pain,

188
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:41,054
by the way,

189
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,973
um,

190
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,770
that can increase alertness
and help cope with pain.

191
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:49,430
And it's really useful to know what
you might need to cope with pain.

192
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:55,300
So I would say shrink your
time horizon and then,

193
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:00,181
oh,

194
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,014
thank you.

195
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:05,520
Okay,

196
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,353
thanks Tim.

197
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,580
Shrink your time horizon
and then concentrate on the

198
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,300
concentrate on the moment.

199
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,100
Whatever that moment happens to be,

200
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,300
might be the next minute,

201
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,050
you know?

202
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:27,050
I don't know what else to do when
you're in an extreme situation.

203
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,381
The other thing,

204
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:30,780
I guess the final thing I
would say with regards to the,

205
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,750
we may not have be able to have children.

206
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:33,991
Well,

207
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:38,100
you need a plan to address that to the
best that that you can to the best way

208
00:07:38,101 --> 00:07:38,701
that you can.

209
00:07:38,701 --> 00:07:43,020
And then you have to give yourself some
time to reconceptualize your life and

210
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:43,501
your future.

211
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:44,640
And I would say news,

212
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,340
like we may not be able to have children
that probably takes about a year or

213
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:50,790
year and a half to digest.

214
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,150
So don't be too hard on yourself
if you haven't figured it out yet.

215
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,030
It's any major life transformation,

216
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,010
like a really major life transformation.

217
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,660
I would say it takes a minimum
of a year to really adapt to.
