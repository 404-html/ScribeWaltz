1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:07,150
You know,

2
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:08,870
I can use a biological example too,

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:13,160
which would place me outside of the
postmodern realm of argument because the

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:15,020
postmodernists don't
believe in biology but,

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,110
but they act like they
do cause they all die.

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,283
So,

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,081
so,

8
00:00:27,081 --> 00:00:27,231
uh,

9
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:30,110
this primatologist named,

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:30,591
well,

11
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:31,610
I'll tell you two stories.

12
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:31,881
Okay.

13
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:32,421
Cause these are,

14
00:00:32,421 --> 00:00:33,410
these are really useful.

15
00:00:33,411 --> 00:00:34,940
So the ones about rats,

16
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:38,600
and I got this story from Jaak
Panksepp who is a great neuroscientist.

17
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:40,400
He wrote a book called
affective neuroscience,

18
00:00:40,401 --> 00:00:41,930
which by the way is on my reading list.

19
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,100
It's on my website.

20
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,680
It's a really good book
affect of neuroscience.

21
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:46,790
He's a great scientist.

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,050
He was one of the people who he learned
that he learned that rats laugh.

23
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:53,360
They laugh out ultrasonically like bat.

24
00:00:53,361 --> 00:00:54,120
So if you're going to,

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,640
you tickle them with a pencil eraser,

26
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:56,481
they laugh,

27
00:00:56,481 --> 00:01:00,470
but you have to record it and then slow
it down and then you can hear them and

28
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:00,921
you might think,

29
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:04,040
well rats laugh like who've
whopping daad grant for that?

30
00:01:04,041 --> 00:01:05,150
What kind of idiocy is that?

31
00:01:05,151 --> 00:01:05,510
It's like,

32
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:05,841
no,

33
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:06,081
no,

34
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:06,291
no.

35
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:06,831
Just don't,

36
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:07,161
don't,

37
00:01:07,161 --> 00:01:08,810
don't get ahead of yourself here.

38
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:09,980
You know,

39
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:10,840
he was showing that,

40
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:14,120
that that capacity for social interaction,

41
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:19,121
for social interaction that was mediated
by physiological touch activated the

42
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:21,434
same,

43
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,873
excuse me,

44
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,900
activated the same circuits in rats,

45
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,960
that it doesn't people and that
those are actual biological circuits.

46
00:01:29,961 --> 00:01:32,480
And we share them even with rats.

47
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:32,631
Now,

48
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:34,370
rats are quite similar to human beings.

49
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:35,204
As it turns out,

50
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,080
I could say especially postmodernists,

51
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:39,914
but I won't.

52
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,673
And uh,

53
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,120
and,

54
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,520
and so the fact that that,

55
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:45,930
you know,

56
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,550
that little routes giggle when you
tickle them is actually extraordinarily

57
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:50,330
important.

58
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,100
He also identified

59
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:55,911
surprising,

60
00:01:55,911 --> 00:01:57,380
I've been talking too much lately.

61
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,693
Um,

62
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,420
he also identified the primary
place circuit and mammals.

63
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,420
And that's a big deal too
from a scientific perspective.

64
00:02:05,421 --> 00:02:06,920
That's like discovering a new continent,

65
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:10,220
like discovering a whole brain system
that people really didn't know existed.

66
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,120
That's a big deal.

67
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:12,920
So here's a little story about rats.

68
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,370
Young rats like to engage
in rough and tumble play,

69
00:02:16,371 --> 00:02:17,960
especially juvenile males.

70
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,760
It's also the case for puppies.

71
00:02:19,761 --> 00:02:20,840
If you've ever had a puppy,

72
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,100
dogs are like that.

73
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:22,970
They liked to wrestle.

74
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,400
And it's one of the things that he may,

75
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:27,290
all human beings tend to
do with their offspring.

76
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,130
And it's a really,

77
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:29,150
really good thing,

78
00:02:29,180 --> 00:02:32,720
like rough and tumble play with children
really helps socialize them because it

79
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:37,721
helps them figure out the difference
between a touch and even rough touch and

80
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,440
pain.

81
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,681
You know?

82
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:42,230
Cause one of the things you're doing
when you're rough and tumble playing with

83
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:42,861
the little kid is,

84
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:43,071
you know,

85
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:44,900
you throw them up in the air
and you're wrestling around.

86
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:45,861
I built my,

87
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:49,520
I had two couches when my kids were
little that were sort of face to face.

88
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:52,520
So we built this little wrestling ring
and I used to go in there and pound them

89
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,080
half to death every night,

90
00:02:54,081 --> 00:02:54,840
you know,

91
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,730
so they loved that.

92
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:57,770
I mean they get so excited about that.

93
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:58,790
They love that so much.

94
00:02:58,791 --> 00:02:59,710
It's crazy.

95
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:03,400
But the reason for that is like you're
stretching out their bodies and you're

96
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:06,850
showing them that they can't put their
thumb in your eye and you're teaching

97
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:07,980
them to be graceful and,

98
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:08,320
and,

99
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,610
and you're teaching them the difference
between something new that's happening

100
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,170
to the body and something painful.

101
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,000
You're really teaching them to dance.

102
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,160
And it's this really
complicated physiological dance
that that is indicative of

103
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:22,490
a socialized being.

104
00:03:22,491 --> 00:03:25,600
And that's partly why women like
men who can dance by the way,

105
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:26,260
um,

106
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,470
because it shows that you can
pay attention to someone else,

107
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,161
first of all,

108
00:03:30,161 --> 00:03:31,060
that you're coordinated.

109
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:34,600
But even more importantly that you can
take the fact of your coordination and

110
00:03:34,601 --> 00:03:37,660
coordinate that with
someone else's coordination.

111
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:38,411
So,

112
00:03:38,411 --> 00:03:40,570
and that's very primal and physiological.

113
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:44,680
It's built right into your body and rough
and tumble play helps with that a lot.

114
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,783
Um,

115
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:46,451
anyways,

116
00:03:46,451 --> 00:03:50,320
rats also liked to rough and tumble play
for much the same reasons and sort of

117
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:52,780
sort of pretty much all social mammals.

118
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,280
So you can tell that rats like it.

119
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:55,570
See,

120
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,250
how do you know if a rat like something?

121
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,461
Well,

122
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:58,330
he'll work for it.

123
00:03:58,331 --> 00:04:01,690
And one of the ways you can figure out
if a rep wants to work for something is

124
00:04:01,691 --> 00:04:02,524
that,

125
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:02,861
you know,

126
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:06,760
you get them in a state where maybe he's
desperate for whatever he's working for

127
00:04:06,761 --> 00:04:10,420
and you can put a little spring on them
and figure out how hard he pulls to go

128
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:10,840
somewhere.

129
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,430
He knows where he's going to get that.

130
00:04:12,431 --> 00:04:15,370
And then you can measure the force that
he's willing to apply in that gives you

131
00:04:15,371 --> 00:04:17,200
a rough estimate of his motivation.

132
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,370
Or maybe ask a bar,

133
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:18,971
press like,

134
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:19,510
uh,

135
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:19,721
you know,

136
00:04:19,721 --> 00:04:20,380
like a coke,

137
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,420
cocaine addicted rat to,

138
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,860
to receive the reward.

139
00:04:23,861 --> 00:04:27,160
And you can count rate of bar pressing
and you can get an estimate of how

140
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:29,830
excited the route is to go do whatever
it is the route's going to do.

141
00:04:29,831 --> 00:04:32,080
And so Panksepp used to,

142
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:32,410
uh,

143
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,243
put rats,

144
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,540
it pair them one riot against the
other and kind of a play a Rina,

145
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:38,620
not a very big thing.

146
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,323
And uh,

147
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,080
and these were juvenile males
and they would work to do that.

148
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:44,620
Okay.

149
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,453
So they liked it.

150
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,000
And then maybe one rat was
10% bigger than the other.

151
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,470
And then when you paired them,

152
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,130
the big rat would beat the little route
because 10% weight advantage was enough

153
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,960
to make the bigger rat dominant.

154
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,171
Okay.

155
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,900
So then they established basically
dominance and submission.

156
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,270
You might think about that
as a power relationship.

157
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,470
And to some degree it is.

158
00:05:02,471 --> 00:05:04,240
But it's more complicated than that.

159
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:05,320
And this is very important.

160
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,154
So,

161
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:11,190
so the rats play together once and the
a big rep pins the little route really

162
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:17,110
very much like wrestling rats
wrestle just like people wrestle.

163
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,383
Um,

164
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,120
and if you pair them together,

165
00:05:22,121 --> 00:05:23,620
then the big wrap can pin the little rat.

166
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:23,891
Okay,

167
00:05:23,891 --> 00:05:25,470
so now you got dominant rats,

168
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:26,760
subordinate rat,

169
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,570
roughly speaking and,

170
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,820
but then you see,

171
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:32,590
if you stop the experiment there,

172
00:05:32,591 --> 00:05:32,981
you'd think,

173
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:35,350
well the rats play to establish
dominance and submission.

174
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,590
But the thing is is that
rats don't just play once,

175
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:39,191
they play many,

176
00:05:39,191 --> 00:05:39,431
many,

177
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:40,300
many times.

178
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,530
And that's also the case with human
beings is that you don't just play once,

179
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,521
you play many,

180
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:46,354
many times.

181
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,770
And there is a difference between the
rules of a game and the rules of a set of

182
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:51,604
games.

183
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,710
And that's so unbelievably important.

184
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:55,510
So you keep that in mind
cause we'll return to that.

185
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,493
So anyways,

186
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,730
the time the two routes get together,

187
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,870
the little rat house to house,

188
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,220
the big route to play because the rule
basically is subordinate entity asks

189
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:05,630
dominant entity to play.

190
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,940
And so the little rat does
what mammals do to play.

191
00:06:10,941 --> 00:06:11,151
You know,

192
00:06:11,151 --> 00:06:14,990
they kind of put their paws down and
put the rear end up bit up in the air.

193
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,340
You see dogs do that.

194
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:17,750
And unless you're completely clueless,

195
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:20,360
you know that that doesn't mean
he's going for your throat.

196
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:23,720
It means he wants you to whack them on
the side of the head so he can sort of

197
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:24,710
pretend to bite you.

198
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,490
You know,

199
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:25,731
it's,

200
00:06:25,731 --> 00:06:28,820
it's pretty obvious if you've
played with dogs and children.

201
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,103
So,

202
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:30,930
um,

203
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,100
yeah.

204
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:34,160
And I make that comparison because dogs
and children and understand each other,

205
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:34,400
right?

206
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,360
They're pack animals,

207
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,250
they follow the same basic rules.

208
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:37,971
They know how to play.

209
00:06:37,971 --> 00:06:39,140
They can become friends,

210
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,790
otherwise he wouldn't have them as pets.

211
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,410
I mean the dog's not the children.

212
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:44,023
Um,

213
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,920
so anyways,

214
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,783
the little rat ass,

215
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,700
the big role to play in big rep things.

216
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,010
Yeah.

217
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,281
Yeah.

218
00:06:49,281 --> 00:06:49,660
Okay.

219
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,271
That will play.

220
00:06:50,271 --> 00:06:52,910
They wrestle and you
pair them multiple times.

221
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,500
Well if you pair them multiple times,

222
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:58,160
what you find is that less the big rat
lets the little rat win 30% of the time

223
00:06:58,161 --> 00:07:00,500
the little rat won't ask
the big rat to play anymore.

224
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:01,851
And that you think,

225
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,930
well who cares what?

226
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,190
Like why is that important?

227
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,491
It's like,

228
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:05,870
it's really important.

229
00:07:05,871 --> 00:07:09,290
That's a really important discovery
because it shows you that the,

230
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:14,510
that even rats have a set set a sense of
fair play that emerges across iterated

231
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,344
games.

232
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:15,891
It's,

233
00:07:15,891 --> 00:07:16,161
it's,

234
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:16,670
it's an,

235
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:20,270
it's evidence for the biological
instantiation of a social morality.

236
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,650
It's a big deal,

237
00:07:21,651 --> 00:07:22,100
man.

238
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,420
That's a big discovery.

239
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,140
And,

240
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,780
and it shows you that
even at the level of rats,

241
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,460
they're very social animals by the way.

242
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,753
Um,

243
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,400
the interactions between rats,

244
00:07:32,401 --> 00:07:36,290
her are mediated by something like
a sense of fairness or justice.

245
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,870
And so that's extremely cool because,

246
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,621
you know,

247
00:07:39,621 --> 00:07:42,290
we tend to think of animals as
having dominance hierarchies.

248
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:43,730
And that's predicated on power.

249
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:44,510
And that idea,

250
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:47,450
even though the bloody postmodernists
don't believe in biology,

251
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,970
they extend that analogy
up to human beings.

252
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,260
It's just not true.
