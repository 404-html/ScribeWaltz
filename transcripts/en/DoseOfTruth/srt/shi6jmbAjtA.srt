1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,543
Okay.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,500
Turns out to be true of chimpanzee.

3
00:00:09,501 --> 00:00:10,650
So Frans de Waal,

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,340
who is a Dutch primatologist,

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,370
very smart one too.

6
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,580
He's been interested in the
biological basis of morality as well.

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,210
Um,

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:18,560
and he,

9
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,020
he's written a lot of good books on,

10
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:20,450
on,

11
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:21,450
on primate behavior.

12
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,350
Chimps in particular,

13
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:23,850
chimps are brutal creatures,

14
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:24,684
man.

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,890
Like they go to war a.

16
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:29,880
And so if you have a chimp
territory out in the jungle,

17
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:30,330
then the,

18
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:32,250
the juveniles will,

19
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,400
the males in particular the band
together in groups of four or five.

20
00:00:35,401 --> 00:00:38,100
There's often but not always
a female or two with them.

21
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,520
And if they come across chimps from
another truth that aren't within their

22
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:44,221
hierarchy,

23
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,390
let's say they will,

24
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,811
if they're,

25
00:00:45,811 --> 00:00:46,780
if they outnumber them,

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,240
cause they can't really count,

27
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:50,550
but they can estimate magnitude visually.

28
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:51,900
It's not the same as counting.

29
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,070
Um,

30
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,940
but if they outnumber them,

31
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:55,770
they will tear them to pieces.

32
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,270
And chimps serve at least twice as strong
as a really well developed human male.

33
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,400
And so they can tear you up pretty good.

34
00:01:02,401 --> 00:01:04,230
And chimps are perfectly capable.

35
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:05,350
They hunt there,

36
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,223
they're carnivorous.

37
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,670
I like human beings and they hunt.

38
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:12,300
They hunt colobus monkeys often they weigh
about 40 pounds and they'll basically

39
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:17,301
eat them alive at monkeys screaming away
like mad cause you know it's in pain

40
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,480
cause it's being eaten.

41
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,890
And um,

42
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,840
that doesn't slow the chimps down a bit.

43
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,410
There's no cross species empathy
stopping them from having their snack.

44
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:29,700
And so chimps are very
brutal creatures and uh,

45
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,810
it isn't obvious they have a lot of
internal inhibition of their aggression at

46
00:01:33,811 --> 00:01:34,051
all.

47
00:01:34,051 --> 00:01:36,750
Most of the inhibition is sociological.

48
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:38,190
It's out in the hierarchy.

49
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:41,580
And so the reason chimps aren't always
aggressive with one another is because

50
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,200
they know who can pound them and,

51
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:45,200
and who will gang up
on them and who won't.

52
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,530
They establish their hierarchy.

53
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:47,753
Anyways.

54
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,350
You know,

55
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,970
you think about a champ hierarchy and
you're talking about a fairly strong and

56
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,210
aggressive creature.

57
00:01:54,211 --> 00:01:55,260
You might think it's biggest,

58
00:01:55,261 --> 00:01:56,010
ugliest,

59
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:56,850
meanest,

60
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,010
most vicious,

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,940
irritable,

62
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,700
unpleasant chimp that rises to the top.

63
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,730
While that's kind of the
postmodernist view of human society,

64
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:07,170
but that's not the case.

65
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:08,310
It happens sometimes.

66
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,720
But what happens,

67
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,610
and dwell has documented
this quite nicely,

68
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:13,110
is that tyrant,

69
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:16,080
chimps lead unstable regimes.

70
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:16,681
Now,

71
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:17,514
you know,

72
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,160
that might sound familiar
because the same thing,

73
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:21,720
of course it's true human beings.

74
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:22,681
Why is that?

75
00:02:22,681 --> 00:02:22,831
Well,

76
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:23,910
it's because you know,

77
00:02:23,911 --> 00:02:27,090
people don't like tyrants and chimps
don't like them that much either.

78
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:30,390
And chimps are actually quite
reciprocal in their social interactions.

79
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:32,130
So they don't just dominate each other.

80
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:33,090
They groom each other,

81
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:34,230
they have friendships,

82
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,500
they can track social relationships
over very long periods of time.

83
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:38,400
No,

84
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,540
and they do that.

85
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:43,500
And so they engage in
reciprocal interactions,

86
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,350
let's say prosocial
reciprocal interactions.

87
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,431
And you might think,

88
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:48,000
well,

89
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,990
what's the,

90
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:51,420
what's the weak point of the biggest,

91
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:51,901
ugliest,

92
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:53,580
toughest chimp in the troop?

93
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,211
And that is,

94
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,650
he doesn't have any friends.

95
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,731
And so,

96
00:02:56,731 --> 00:02:57,031
you know,

97
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,740
maybe has a bad day,

98
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,830
he's a little hung over or whatever for
meat and fermented bananas or whatever

99
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:04,300
he is partying with.

100
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:06,590
And two of the slightly less ugly,

101
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,290
less slightly less mean,

102
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,071
chimps decide,

103
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:10,870
well this is a good time to take 'em out.

104
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:12,220
And they tear him to pieces.

105
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:13,720
Okay.

106
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,390
And so one of the things do all
his pointed out quite nicely,

107
00:03:16,391 --> 00:03:20,010
is that if you want to have a
stable chimp dominance hierarchy,

108
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,430
let's call it a regime,

109
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,260
the stable ones aren't ruled by the
tyrants because the tyrants get taken out

110
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,094
by,

111
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,410
by paired up friendship dyad,

112
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,600
something like that.

113
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,580
So that's really worth thinking about too,

114
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:34,443
you know,

115
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,343
because,

116
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,300
because it indicates that
even in creatures that have
less complex sociological

117
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,653
orders,

118
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,531
and they do,

119
00:03:46,531 --> 00:03:49,950
because one of the things that predicts
how complex your social order is,

120
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:52,110
is how big your brain is
compared to your body.

121
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,910
It's encephalization essentially.

122
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:55,770
And the more encephalitis to creature,

123
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,110
the larger the social groups it can track.

124
00:03:58,111 --> 00:03:58,561
And of course,

125
00:03:58,561 --> 00:04:00,240
human beings are very highly encephalite.

126
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,830
So we have quite complicated group.

127
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,000
Um,

128
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,430
we have quite complicated
group organizations,

129
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,940
but even in simpler group
organizations like the chimps,

130
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,870
it isn't the tyrant who rules stabling.

131
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:15,510
And that turns out to be
also incredibly important.
