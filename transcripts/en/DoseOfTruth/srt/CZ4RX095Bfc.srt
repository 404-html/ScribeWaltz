1
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:12,810
So it's not obvious on first consideration
why discussed would be a moral

2
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:14,460
emotion.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,450
So you know,

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,280
most of the work that's done,

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,780
it's outside of the disgust realm I
would say is predicated on the assumption

6
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:23,850
that the reason that
conservatives in particular,

7
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:28,680
but perhaps people who
are more authoritarian and
general draw boundaries around

8
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:31,710
their territories because
they're afraid of the other.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,030
But that isn't really,

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,760
that isn't really how it plays
out as far as I can tell.

11
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:37,260
Because conservatives for example,

12
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:40,710
are less neurotic than treat in the
big five traits sense than liberals.

13
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:41,280
Although it's,

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,300
it's a minor difference.

15
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:45,480
But the disgust issue seems
to be particularly relevant.

16
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,170
So,

17
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,650
so can you tell us a little
bit about why disgust per se?

18
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:50,620
Well,

19
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,350
first conservatives are
a little less neurotic,

20
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:54,990
but they also add,

21
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:57,460
if you do very low level
perceptual experiment,

22
00:00:57,461 --> 00:00:59,260
just like a puff of
white noise in the ear,

23
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,910
people who react more strongly to that
to any sort of very low level threat are

24
00:01:03,911 --> 00:01:05,980
more likely to vote
Republican in this country.

25
00:01:05,981 --> 00:01:06,511
So they're there.

26
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:06,670
You know,

27
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:09,700
there are all these interesting
personality differences
that lead to different

28
00:01:09,701 --> 00:01:10,330
politics.

29
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,530
But as for why discussed?

30
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,573
Um,

31
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,260
so I'm,

32
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:14,660
I'm uh,

33
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,050
Durkheimian I would say I love the,

34
00:01:17,051 --> 00:01:17,680
uh,

35
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,431
the sociologists,

36
00:01:18,431 --> 00:01:19,264
Emile Durkheim,

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,530
and I'm also,

38
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,790
I'm a social psychologist,

39
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:26,440
so I'm always thinking not about people
as individual utility maximizers but

40
00:01:26,441 --> 00:01:28,330
people as members of social groups,

41
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:33,570
people who are totally
focused on belonging in their
social groups and people

42
00:01:33,731 --> 00:01:37,420
who have some pro social motives
about keeping the group together,

43
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,160
about doing things that
are good for the group.

44
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,410
So as I tried to argue in my book,

45
00:01:41,411 --> 00:01:42,250
the righteous mind,

46
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,061
yes,

47
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:43,691
we're selfish.

48
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:47,890
There's no doubt that we often will do
things to advance our own self interest

49
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,940
at the expense of others.

50
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,460
But we're also really groupish,

51
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,210
which means we'll do all sorts of things
to advance Eric Group at the expense of

52
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,133
others.

53
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,831
Basically,

54
00:01:56,831 --> 00:01:57,664
we're tribal,

55
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,090
we evolved as a tribal
species and we're doing,

56
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:03,160
we have all this software,

57
00:02:03,161 --> 00:02:03,821
I would know all this,

58
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:05,800
all these predispositions,

59
00:02:05,801 --> 00:02:08,470
these mental predispositions for life in,

60
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,140
in tribes that are battling other tribes.

61
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:12,940
And that's why it comes out so easily.

62
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:16,510
If you look at the way boys organized
themselves when they get up fraternity,

63
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,260
um,

64
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,310
the hazing rituals,

65
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,210
when you look at the weight,

66
00:02:19,211 --> 00:02:20,230
it's especially clear in boys,

67
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:20,810
uh,

68
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,420
the way street gangs organized themselves.

69
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:22,661
Girls,

70
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:23,830
tribalism is a little different.

71
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,053
Um,

72
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,320
but I would say this is,

73
00:02:26,321 --> 00:02:26,980
and that's why,

74
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,251
again,

75
00:02:27,251 --> 00:02:29,680
I love the [inaudible] approach
of archetypes or something.

76
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,290
There's just this weird
stuff that is pan human.

77
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,200
Even if it comes out slightly
differently around the world,

78
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:38,830
there really is a human nature and it
comes complete with a whole bunch of like,

79
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,060
predesigned ideas.
