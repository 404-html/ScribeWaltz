1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:07,281
Right?

2
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:08,570
Well those are big problems,

3
00:00:08,571 --> 00:00:10,640
especially the loss of unsupervised play.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,120
It's not,

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,520
it's not obvious at all how
that might be addressed.

6
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,300
Yes it is.

7
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:14,600
Okay,

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,901
good.

9
00:00:14,901 --> 00:00:15,734
Good.

10
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,730
Everyone should just by Lenore skinnies,

11
00:00:18,731 --> 00:00:23,450
he's book free range kids and then they
should loosen up and give their kids

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,650
more unsupervised time.

13
00:00:24,651 --> 00:00:26,210
Now you can't do this alone.

14
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,590
You'll be arrested.

15
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:32,450
I tried to get my son to go out across
the street to buy groceries when he was

16
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,670
nine years old and he'd say liquid.

17
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,121
You know,

18
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:35,600
Daddy,

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,620
people look at me funny there.

20
00:00:36,621 --> 00:00:37,820
There were no other kids out there.

21
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:39,110
Um,

22
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:43,430
and so Lenore has started a fantastic
organization called let grow.

23
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,790
So if you were to go to let grow.org,

24
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,030
okay,

25
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,740
we'll put all this in the description,

26
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,551
all of these things,

27
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:49,790
right?

28
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:51,440
So I'm on the board of it as an advisor,

29
00:00:51,441 --> 00:00:52,274
Peter Gray,

30
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,551
uh,

31
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:53,211
an expert on,

32
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:56,840
on play is on the board and
they're doing these simple things.

33
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,381
Simple,

34
00:00:57,381 --> 00:01:02,381
simple things like you convinced the
school to just open up the playground an

35
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:06,500
hour early or keep it open after school.

36
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:10,190
Why should kids always have organized
activities and soccer practice?

37
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,460
Just give them a place to play
where there's a nurse available.

38
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:14,360
If someone gets hurt,

39
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,790
there is an adult but
he's not supervising.

40
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,260
He's just over there.

41
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:20,030
So don't worry parents,

42
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,930
there is an adult,

43
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,090
but beyond that do what they want.

44
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,340
And they just started
this a few weeks ago.

45
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,660
The results are fantastic.

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,460
The kids are having so much fun,

47
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,200
they are becoming more independent,

48
00:01:30,201 --> 00:01:32,570
they're more willing to
do projects on their own.

49
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,740
It's working out great.

50
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:36,350
So that's really good
to do this on your own.

51
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,050
But the thing is we all
know something's wrong.

52
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,490
So those are very practical.

53
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,490
That's very practical piece of advice for,

54
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,401
for schools.

55
00:01:43,401 --> 00:01:47,570
It's like open up the
unsupervised play facilities and,

56
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,230
and,

57
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,730
and facilitate their use.

58
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,360
That's right.

59
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:50,721
Give,

60
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:52,280
give everyone a place which is safe.

61
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:52,791
And by safe,

62
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:53,960
I mean physically safe.

63
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:58,220
Never use the word safety to
describe emotions and ideas.

64
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,140
Safety means physical safety.

65
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:02,780
So you've got to provide a physically
safe place for the kids to play.

66
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,730
And beyond that you let them go.

67
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,950
Now there will arise problems of bullying.

68
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:09,470
So if it's repeated harassment,

69
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:09,711
oh,

70
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:10,160
you know,

71
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,630
well I know a book about that,

72
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:14,630
which it's by Dan always called bullying,

73
00:02:14,631 --> 00:02:16,250
what we know and what we can do about it.

74
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:17,084
And it was written,

75
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,050
it's got to be 30 years ago
and always cut the rope,

76
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,013
the,

77
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,993
the uh,

78
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,790
the,

79
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,960
the incidents of bullying in the
Scandinavian countries down by 50%.

80
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,190
And he really,

81
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:30,470
really targets what bullying means.

82
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,740
So he's not a safe space guy by
any stretch of the imagination.

83
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,200
I don't know what the origins of it are.

84
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,920
I know that valuations of his program
in America show it anywhere from zero to

85
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:44,921
20% reductions and the effects are much
smaller in the u s in the u s yeah.

86
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,110
The question is whether or not they were
able to implement them with the rigor

87
00:02:48,111 --> 00:02:53,111
he did in the u s but bullying programs
are part of the problem because bullying

88
00:02:53,121 --> 00:02:53,931
clearly is a problem.

89
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:55,100
We need to do something about it,

90
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,230
but because we have what's
called concept creep.

91
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:57,941
Yeah.

92
00:02:57,941 --> 00:02:58,774
So,

93
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,240
so it's now back to your point,

94
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,780
concept creep looks like even,

95
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,230
yeah,

96
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,063
that's right.

97
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:03,610
Uh,

98
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,310
so now it's the case that if,

99
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,200
if kids don't invite,

100
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,590
if some kids want to do something
and they don't invite another kid,

101
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,760
they've excluded that kid.

102
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,100
Right.

103
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,020
Well that could be bullying.

104
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:14,381
Right.

105
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:18,400
I've read of schools in Europe that
don't allow kids to have best friends for

106
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,420
exactly that reason.

107
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:19,810
Yeah.

108
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:19,991
Well,

109
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:23,800
because this is also something that
really bothers me about the misuse of the

110
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:28,090
IAT because it's not that easy to
distinguish in group preference,

111
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,470
which no one can,

112
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,920
no one went in their right mind would
want to eliminate in group preference

113
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,480
given that it governs your choice of mate
and your behavior towards your family

114
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:37,841
members,

115
00:03:37,841 --> 00:03:38,674
let's say,

116
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,240
to distinguish that between outgroup
exclusion is no in no simple matter.

117
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:46,630
And to tell kids that they can't have
a best friend is another thing that

118
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:48,520
interferes with an
important part of their,

119
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,250
that's right.

120
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:49,450
Yeah.

121
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:53,060
I think both of us have spent a lot
of time looking at ancient wisdom at,

122
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,220
at the writings of,

123
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,140
of people long ago.

124
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:56,800
Uh,

125
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,330
and I often come back to Aristotle's
claim that any virtue carried to extremes

126
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:02,380
becomes advice.

127
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,240
So inclusion is a good thing if people
are being excluded because they have a

128
00:04:07,241 --> 00:04:08,980
physical stigma or,

129
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,920
or they're overweight or their skin color.

130
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,641
So,

131
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,090
you know,

132
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:16,090
we need to be looking at the
reasons why kids are excluded.

133
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,510
But if you say inclusion
is the primary virtue,

134
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,420
inclusion over everything else.

135
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:25,360
And so if those two best
friends are excluding others,

136
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,290
no more best friends,

137
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,550
this is madness.

138
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:28,930
This is a vice.

139
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,550
So I think that inclusion,

140
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,420
again,

141
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:31,990
you know,

142
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:34,630
it's a virtue unless
it's carried to extremes.
