1
00:00:06,770 --> 00:00:08,630
Can you talk more about the resurrection?

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:12,980
This remains a stumbling block for many
of your more atheistic followers who

3
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:16,070
have otherwise embraced you approach
to understanding Christianity?

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:17,721
Well,

5
00:00:17,721 --> 00:00:22,000
I can only talk about it symbolically
to begin with and that's I think,

6
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:23,510
not sufficient.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:29,200
But I hope as I move through the biblical
series that I can zero in on that more

8
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:30,860
and more particularly.

9
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:35,861
But I mean the idea of the dying and
resurrected God is a very old idea

10
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,720
and it's echoed in such things as
the imagery say of the Phoenix,

11
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:45,080
which burns itself up and
then restores itself to its,

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,090
to its early form.

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,530
And I think speaking
purely psychologically,

14
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:56,531
that idea of the dying and resurrected
savior is something like a reflection of

15
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:01,931
the fact that in order to progress
psychologically you have to let go,

16
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,700
especially in the face of obstacles.

17
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:08,900
You have to let go of those things that
are impeding your progress that might be

18
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:10,100
very dear to your heart.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,440
You have to let them go and let them die.

20
00:01:12,441 --> 00:01:15,080
And then you have to let a
new part of yourself be born.

21
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:17,510
So because when you're wrong,

22
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:19,370
you have to let the part of you,

23
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,330
that's wrong guy.

24
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,830
And then a new part spring
to life in some sensor.

25
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,210
It's a new part that's partly a union
of your mind and the Union of the

26
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,550
information that's contained in
the error that you committed.

27
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,700
And it's like the birth in
some sense of the new spirit.

28
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,330
And so you could say that there's this
idea that you have to have faith in

29
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:43,730
Christ because Christ is the
way and the truth and the life.

30
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,010
No one comes to the father but through,

31
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:46,933
but through him.

32
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,030
What that means symbolically
as far as I can tell them,

33
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,240
is that you have to embrace the process
of voluntary death and rebirth in order

34
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:59,030
to continue moving forward
properly in your life.

35
00:01:59,030 --> 00:01:59,360
And it,

36
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,960
it's also that process of death and
rebirth that rejuvenates the father.

37
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,580
And it's also that process of death
and rebirth that produces the father to

38
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:08,270
begin with.

39
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,450
If you think about the father
as the symbol of of culture.

40
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,390
So at minimum,

41
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:19,750
the idea of the resurrected Christ is the
idea that you should identify not with

42
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:24,380
that part of yourself that's stagnant
and dad and that already knows but is

43
00:02:24,381 --> 00:02:25,220
prone to error.

44
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:29,690
You should identify with that part of
yourself that's always stretching beyond

45
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,691
what you currently know and has the faith
to let go of old certainties so that

46
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:38,360
new patterns of being can
be brought into place.

47
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,990
And so now that's a purely psychological
explanation and I think I've made the

48
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:49,280
case in my biblical lectures that
I'm striving for a psychological

49
00:02:49,281 --> 00:02:50,600
interpretation at the moment.

50
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,830
Um,

51
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:56,830
my experience with the biblical stories
is that there are layers of depth in

52
00:02:57,781 --> 00:03:01,360
them that are sufficiently profound,

53
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,070
perhaps because of that
staggering hyperlinking of
the text and its association

54
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:11,071
with almost the entire Corpus of Western
literature that as you keep digging,

55
00:03:12,071 --> 00:03:13,300
you find more and more.

56
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,193
And so,

57
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,303
um,

58
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:19,180
I don't know what to make of
the more metaphysical claims,

59
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:20,014
you know,

60
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:20,560
and,

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,930
but I'm going to leave it at
that because I don't know.

62
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,190
It's only speculation.

63
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,743
Um,

64
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:28,661
see,

65
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,920
I guess it is that we don't,

66
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,400
I really don't believe that we understand
consciousness and we don't understand

67
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:36,730
this rule in the cosmos.

68
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,670
It could be that consciousness is just
an epithet phenomena of materialist

69
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,513
processes,

70
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,940
but there's a couple of things to me
that seems to mitigate against that

71
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:46,790
explanation.

72
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:52,170
The first is that we don't have an account
of cautiousness that's that's useful.

73
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:57,640
We have no idea how the material
substrate of the brain produces this,

74
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:02,980
this awareness and self awareness that
seems to be crucially important in the

75
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:07,660
existence of the cosmos in so far as if
there's nothing to experience something.

76
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:10,750
It's very difficult to say
in what way that it exists.

77
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,120
You need a viewer and an observer.

78
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,990
Scientists sort of gerrymandered that
by positing a hypothetical observer when

79
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:22,930
they talk about a phenomena where
there is no actual observance and so

80
00:04:22,931 --> 00:04:25,540
consciousness could be
just an epiphenomenon,

81
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:29,470
but it could also be something central
to the nature of being and certainly

82
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:32,770
mythological stories presented
that way that there's,

83
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,250
there's nature now.

84
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:37,960
It would be nurture from the scientific
perspective and there's the social world

85
00:04:37,961 --> 00:04:40,840
that would be the great father
from the mythological perspective.

86
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,160
And,

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,560
and that's all there is from
a scientific perspective.

88
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,450
But from a mythological perspective,

89
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:50,590
there's active consciousness and that's
associated with the idea of the logos

90
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:55,750
and the logos seems to be something like
if you think about it as consciousness,

91
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,080
it seems to be this thing that encounters
the potential of future being and then

92
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:03,700
determines at least in
part how to shape it.

93
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:06,700
Obviously we're constrained in many ways.

94
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:09,430
You can't shape things in any old way,

95
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,240
uh,

96
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,350
but we can certainly advance in the
direction of our imagination in quite a

97
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:16,480
staggering and compelling manner.

98
00:05:16,481 --> 00:05:17,800
And then you might say,

99
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:18,634
well,

100
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,690
is that real?

101
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,830
Is Is,

102
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:25,830
is the idea that we have a consciousness
and that it's free and some in

103
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:31,710
incomprehensible sense and that it
plays a role in constructing the cosmos?

104
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,770
Is that real?

105
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,510
And then I would say,

106
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,280
well it depends on what you mean by real,

107
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:41,340
but I would also point out that you act
as if it's real and that are functional

108
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:42,310
legal systems,

109
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:46,810
like the legal systems of the on the
West are predicated on the acceptance of

110
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:47,644
its reality.

111
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,210
And it was an idea that took many,

112
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:52,270
many thousands of years to to emerge.

113
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,380
You know,

114
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:54,041
first of all,

115
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:56,650
the only sovereign was well was the king.

116
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,230
And,

117
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:01,240
and then the nobles became sovereign
and then men became Sawford.

118
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,870
And then with the Christian revolution,

119
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:05,660
every individual soul became sovereign.

120
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,890
That idea of,

121
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,300
of individual sovereignty and worth is
the core presupposition of our legal

122
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:12,950
system and our cultural systems.

123
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:17,951
And so we all walk around acting as if
every one of us is a divine center of

124
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:23,890
logos because we give
each other the respect of,

125
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:24,950
of,

126
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:29,950
of individual citizens who are sovereign
and that are equal before the law.

127
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:31,730
And the funny thing is,

128
00:06:31,731 --> 00:06:33,500
is if someone doesn't treat you that way,

129
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,770
it treats you as if you're free.

130
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:40,771
Will is an illusion or refuses to regard
you as someone who plays a active part

131
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:45,110
in choosing outcome of their life,

132
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:45,891
then you get very,

133
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:46,724
very annoyed.

134
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:50,570
And so if it's an illusion
and perhaps it is,

135
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,860
we don't understand an alternative
to it and it's unbelievably,

136
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,990
it's unbelievably functional.

137
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,663
So,

138
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,051
okay,

139
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:01,100
so back to love.

140
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,443
Well,

141
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,493
um,

142
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,650
it will make the case that a
limitation is necessary for being,

143
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,100
and then we can make the case the
tragedy is an inevitable consequence of

144
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,271
limitation.

145
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:18,140
And then we might say,

146
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,381
well,

147
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:21,170
is being worth the tragedy?

148
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:24,980
And I think the answer
yes to that is love.

149
00:07:24,981 --> 00:07:27,980
And the answer no to that
is the opposite of love.

150
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,270
Because when you,

151
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,130
when you love someone,

152
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,770
you love them in spite of,

153
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:35,600
or even because of their vulnerability,

154
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:38,330
not that you don't want them to
transcend that because you do.

155
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,700
But,

156
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:44,700
and I think that love is the
acceptance of the price of being.

157
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:45,611
It's,

158
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:48,590
it's the way you manifest your
acceptance of the price of being.

159
00:07:48,591 --> 00:07:49,730
Because if you love someone,

160
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,180
you know they have their
vulnerabilities like every human being.

161
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,480
But your basic judgment is that
despite the fact that they have these

162
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,880
vulnerabilities that are even fatal,

163
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:03,200
and that there are certainly tragic,

164
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,800
that it's better that they
were then that they weren't.

165
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,540
And that's,

166
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,830
and I think that's the right attitude
to have towards being itself.

167
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,610
Uh,

168
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:14,443
it's,

169
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,530
it's,

170
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,270
it's an optimistic attitude and I think
it has to be predicated on faith because

171
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,650
I don't think that you can
necessarily derive that conclusion by,

172
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,090
by looking at the available evidence.

173
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,910
Dealable evidence has kind of 50,

174
00:08:28,911 --> 00:08:29,361
50,

175
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:30,830
and in many situations,

176
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:32,323
but,

177
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,910
but I can tell you if you adopt the other
attitude that being is unjustifiable,

178
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:39,590
then that leads you down a very,

179
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:44,510
very dark road and then you soon start
to work in a way that makes things far

180
00:08:44,511 --> 00:08:46,490
more intolerable then they should be.

181
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,990
So that's,

182
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,853
uh,

183
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,920
that's my answer to that.

184
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:54,740
Any tips on avoiding booze?

185
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,011
Yeah,

186
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,090
that's a real tough one.

187
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,451
Well,

188
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:58,890
I would say a couple of things.

189
00:08:58,891 --> 00:08:59,580
Um,

190
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,413
there is a drug,

191
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,590
if you're a binge drinker,

192
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,940
there is a drug called naltrexone
that you could consider and you take

193
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:07,200
naltrexone every day.

194
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,080
It doesn't really have any
psychological effect on you,

195
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:12,660
but if you're a naltrexone responder,

196
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,830
what will happen is that it will dampen
your positive response to alcohol.

197
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:18,990
So some people who are alcoholic,

198
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,390
many of them have a
very pronounced opiate,

199
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,940
uh,

200
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,773
uh,

201
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,040
an opiate effect from alcohol.

202
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,690
It looks like it's mediated by Beta
endorphin and Naltrexone is an opiate

203
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,261
blocker.

204
00:09:31,261 --> 00:09:32,094
And so,

205
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,223
um,

206
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:38,630
what naltrexone seems to do is dampen
the positive response and the positive

207
00:09:38,731 --> 00:09:39,564
response,

208
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,130
which would be opiate.

209
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:46,050
And then dopaminergic is the same response
that makes you want to keep drinking

210
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,040
when you start drinking.

211
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,860
So if you're one of those people that
has a drink and then has to have another

212
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:51,240
one and then it has to have another one,

213
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:51,871
and you know,

214
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,220
as soon all your money's gone,

215
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,940
then the probability that you have
an opiod response is pretty high.

216
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,370
And now trick someone can help with that.

217
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,210
Um,

218
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,480
generally when people take Naltrexone,

219
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,360
they keep drinking,

220
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,500
they try to control,

221
00:10:04,501 --> 00:10:08,460
but they keep drinking and they learn
over time that the alcohol doesn't have

222
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,420
the same punch.

223
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,690
It's still pleasant but doesn't have the
same overwhelming punched that it did

224
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,733
at one point.

225
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,310
So that would be one suggestion
and it's worth trying.

226
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,010
The other is like make a plan.

227
00:10:20,011 --> 00:10:22,050
I would say do the
future authoring program,

228
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,330
you know,

229
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,050
because it isn't that you're
trying to avoid booze.

230
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:25,884
Exactly.

231
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,740
It's that you're trying to
restructure your whole life,

232
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,101
you know,

233
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:32,530
because if you're a drinker then
all your friends are drinkers and,

234
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,530
and you're used to drinking
it every social situation
and the places that you go

235
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:41,610
to socialize or places that you drink
and like it's really built in as a whole

236
00:10:41,611 --> 00:10:42,510
set of habits.

237
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:46,530
And so what you have to do is kind of
redesigning your life and you have to

238
00:10:46,531 --> 00:10:47,430
think of things.

239
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,800
You can't just stop drinking.

240
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,330
You have to figure out what you're going
to start doing instead of drinking.

241
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,590
There's a hole that you have
to fill in and you know,

242
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,920
the future authoring program,

243
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:02,430
we'll also help you figure out what your
life could look like in the absence of

244
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:07,431
alcohol and what kind of Hell you could
end up being if you keep drinking.

245
00:11:08,161 --> 00:11:08,420
And,

246
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,740
and it causes all the
problems that it can cause.

247
00:11:10,741 --> 00:11:12,980
And I think you really need to like,

248
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:16,980
you need to think through the hell that
can occur and you have to think through

249
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,060
how your life could be valuable without
alcohol calls so that you can be

250
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,710
motivated enough to,

251
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,323
to try to,

252
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,530
to regulate it.

253
00:11:25,531 --> 00:11:28,650
And I would also say if you fail and slip,

254
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,530
don't berate yourself
and beat yourself up.

255
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,720
Just start quitting again.

256
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:34,740
Because you know,

257
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:39,060
if you could cut your alcohol intake down
75% that's a hell of a lot better than

258
00:11:39,061 --> 00:11:39,894
zero.

259
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,470
And often people go all or nothing
just like they do when they're quitting

260
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,710
cigarettes and all.

261
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,220
They all quit for a month and then
have a cigarette and they'll say,

262
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:47,791
oh my God,

263
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:50,070
now I'm now I've broken the pact.

264
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,920
And then they'll smoke all pack
and they'll be smoking again.

265
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,340
You don't have to do that.

266
00:11:54,341 --> 00:11:58,420
You can just decide that you slipped
and that you're going to get back on the

267
00:11:58,421 --> 00:11:59,254
wagon again.

268
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,191
And you know,

269
00:12:00,191 --> 00:12:01,390
it can take a long time,

270
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,870
but I do believe that you need
it a better vision of life,

271
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,290
right?

272
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:08,080
You have to find something to
do that's better than alcohol.

273
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,060
And that might take some,

274
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,350
some real consideration,

275
00:12:11,351 --> 00:12:15,550
especially if alcohol is a
very potent drug for you.

276
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:19,000
And I would also say don't
hesitate to try the nail trek.

277
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:24,010
Solomon's it's got a pretty
decent clinical history and
it's basically harmless.

278
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,120
So.
