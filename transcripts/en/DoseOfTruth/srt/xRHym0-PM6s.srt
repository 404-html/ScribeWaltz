1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,650
The first rule in 12 rules for life is
stand up straight with your shoulders

2
00:00:11,651 --> 00:00:12,430
back.

3
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:17,110
And I want to tell you a little bit about
the world in which that rule applies.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,071
And it's our world.

5
00:00:18,071 --> 00:00:22,780
But it isn't necessarily the world
that you think of when you think of our

6
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:23,590
world.

7
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,401
Although it's the world,

8
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:25,234
you know,

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:27,070
it's funny cause it's a world you know,

10
00:00:27,071 --> 00:00:27,731
but you don't know.

11
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:28,564
You know it.

12
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,620
It's a world that presents itself to
you in literary form and in mythological

13
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:34,600
foreman and symbolic form.

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,040
And you all understand it,

15
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:36,370
but you,

16
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,810
you can't articulate it.

17
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:38,980
Um,

18
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,390
but I can articulate some of it.

19
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,340
How many of you have seen the lion king?

20
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,410
Okay,

21
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:45,520
how many of you haven't?

22
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:46,781
Okay,

23
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:47,680
so that's a better question.

24
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:50,410
Hardly you guys should see the lion
king because obviously there's something

25
00:00:50,411 --> 00:00:51,244
wrong with you.

26
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:52,263
So,

27
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,070
so,

28
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:53,861
and in any ways,

29
00:00:53,861 --> 00:00:55,990
I want to tell you about
the world of the lion king.

30
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,290
Now,

31
00:00:56,290 --> 00:01:00,100
one of the things I want you to notice
is that when you go see that movie or

32
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,120
when you show it to your kids,

33
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:02,020
when you watch it at home,

34
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,300
I don't care what you fall into it.

35
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:06,700
And that's very strange
because first of all,

36
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,421
it's not a world,

37
00:01:07,421 --> 00:01:08,500
it's drawings,

38
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,071
right?

39
00:01:09,071 --> 00:01:10,690
It's animated drawings of a world.

40
00:01:10,691 --> 00:01:13,420
It's very low resolution and
the creatures aren't human.

41
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:14,201
They're animals.

42
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,730
You've all noticed that no doubt.

43
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:21,060
And the world is magical because things
happen in it that aren't the sorts of

44
00:01:21,101 --> 00:01:23,020
things that obviously
happened in the real world.

45
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,700
But you don't care about any of that.

46
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:26,470
You don't care that the animals talk.

47
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,540
You don't care that the lions are kings.

48
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:31,120
All of that makes perfect sense to you.

49
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,670
And that means that which
is a very strange thing,

50
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,830
which it means that the manner in which
the characters are represented and the

51
00:01:38,831 --> 00:01:42,790
world that they inhabit is somehow
familiar to you because otherwise you

52
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:45,280
wouldn't fall into it
and you wouldn't even.

53
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,730
And you'd notice that what you're doing
is so strange because it really is so

54
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:49,091
strange.

55
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:50,830
So imagine the opening of the lion king.

56
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:55,831
So what happens is that the camera pans
over the Great African plain and you see

57
00:01:56,591 --> 00:01:57,790
all the animals gathering,

58
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,041
right?

59
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,870
And they're all coming
together and there's this kind
of thrilling Black Gospel

60
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:04,990
music going on in the
background with an African beat.

61
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,041
And so,

62
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:06,970
and it's really well done.

63
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:11,971
The opening of that movie and
then the camera pans up like,

64
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,080
like it's revealing something.

65
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:18,340
And you see this structure that's
known in the movie as pride rock.

66
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:23,210
And so it's this structure that
rises up above the plane and it's,

67
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,060
it's shaped like it's
a mountain essentially,

68
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:25,631
although it's not,

69
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,351
it's just a rock,

70
00:02:26,351 --> 00:02:26,770
but it's,

71
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,910
it's a high place.

72
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:29,590
It's a place that you can,

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,660
that you can view everything from.

74
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:31,991
Right?

75
00:02:31,991 --> 00:02:32,824
So it's a place that,

76
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,110
it's a place from which
you can get an overview.

77
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,670
It's a place from which you can see.

78
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,140
And uh,

79
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,890
you're introduced to the king's little
bird whose name I don't remember at the

80
00:02:41,891 --> 00:02:42,610
moment,

81
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,110
and he's the eyes of the king.

82
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,190
And so the king is obviously something
that has eyes because he has a bird and

83
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,970
the bird can fly around from up above
and see everything and report to him.

84
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,730
So whatever the king is is
associated with the bird.

85
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,910
Just like Horus,

86
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:59,350
the ancient Egyptian God
was associated with fall,

87
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:01,720
could in fact for exactly that reason,

88
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,300
fall cans can see better than
any other creature by the way,

89
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,010
better even than human beings.

90
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,300
And we have very good eyesight.

91
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,990
So the king is the creature who
can see and the king is a lion.

92
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,620
And the reason the lions are king is
because the lines at the top of the food

93
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:14,951
chain.

94
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:15,784
That's part of it.

95
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,930
But the line is a solar.

96
00:03:16,931 --> 00:03:18,190
Beastie has a main,

97
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:19,750
he's associated with the sun.

98
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,710
He's associated with the daytime is
associated with power and majesty and

99
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:24,091
strength.

100
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:26,230
And it's not a mouse that's king,

101
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,070
right?

102
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:27,940
It's not a rat.

103
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,250
It's,

104
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,071
it's a lion.

105
00:03:30,071 --> 00:03:30,521
And you think,

106
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,530
well obviously the lion is king.

107
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,131
You know,

108
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:36,700
everyone knows that even though animals
don't have kings in case you didn't

109
00:03:36,701 --> 00:03:37,330
notice.

110
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,670
So it's not self evident
that it should be the lion.

111
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:43,240
And the lion is on the rock in the sun,

112
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:44,411
right?

113
00:03:44,411 --> 00:03:48,220
So the rock sticks up above everything
else and the lion is there and the lion

114
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,280
is paternal lion and he has a mate and
the scene opens with them giving birth.

115
00:03:54,971 --> 00:03:56,740
And so it's a nativity scene.

116
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,701
And so,

117
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:01,990
and that's painfully obvious if you
watch it with a little bit of detachment,

118
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:07,350
it's an activity scene and Rafiki who's
the Shaman priest lifts up the new

119
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:11,530
Messiah to the Sun.

120
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,970
And when that happens,

121
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,780
the music swells and all of the
animals go down on their knees.

122
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:17,770
And it's a very,

123
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,360
and then the,

124
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,970
there's a drum beat and the,

125
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:22,750
the,

126
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,590
the words the lion king come up on
stage and it's beautifully done.

127
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,790
It's beautifully done.

128
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,090
They,

129
00:04:28,090 --> 00:04:33,090
they pan up to the revelation of the
lion cub to the son two or three times.

130
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,330
And it's really,

131
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,580
it's really emotional moment.

132
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,290
And it's because all of these levels of
symbolism lock in at the same time you

133
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,124
have the,

134
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,270
the environment,

135
00:04:43,271 --> 00:04:45,250
the field where all the animals gather.

136
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:48,820
So all the animals are gathering to
review the revelation of something

137
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:53,821
transcendent and the revelation of what's
transcendent is the birth of the new

138
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:58,810
hero to the king and Queen
on the rock above the plane.

139
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,360
And there's a universal truth in that,

140
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,420
which is why the animators worked as hard
as they did to make that scene and why

141
00:05:06,791 --> 00:05:10,780
it opens what was one of
the most spectacularly
successful movies of all time.

142
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:12,483
And the,

143
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,970
the way the film makers do it
is when Rafiq he holds up the,

144
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,250
the infant Simba,

145
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,670
the clouds break and the sun shines on it.

146
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,620
And that's the culminating moment.

147
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:28,390
And that's the revelation of the
identity of the newborn hero with the

148
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,980
consciousness of the sun.

149
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,980
And so we're light creatures.

150
00:05:32,981 --> 00:05:34,180
We're daytime creatures.

151
00:05:34,181 --> 00:05:35,350
We're visual creatures,

152
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:35,870
right?

153
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:36,120
We're,

154
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,580
we're not,

155
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,001
we don't,

156
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:38,020
we're not nocturnal.

157
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,000
The night is when we're unconscious.

158
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,090
The day is when we're conscious and
the terminology that we use that's

159
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,960
associated with the furtherance of
our consciousness is illumination and

160
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:50,794
enlightenment.

161
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:55,660
And so there's a tight relationship
between waking up and letting the light

162
00:05:55,661 --> 00:06:00,661
shine in and in consciousness and the
association between the rays of the sun

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,450
and the lifting up of the
infant is the association,

164
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:13,220
the ancient association between the hero
who defeats the forces of darkness and

165
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:14,240
the Sun itself.

166
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,400
And you all know all of that,

167
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,290
which is why that opening works and why
it sets the scene for the rest of the

168
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,124
movie.

169
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,960
And what's the rest of the movie?

170
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,973
Well,

171
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,660
we could think about the landscape.

172
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:27,141
First of all,

173
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:29,400
there's a scene where Sam,

174
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:33,500
his father takes him up on top of pride
rock and tells him that his kingdom,

175
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:37,850
that he's the king and his kingdom
extends as far as the light touches.

176
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,780
So the landscape is a
place with a pyramid in it.

177
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,400
They're at the top of the pyramid on a
plane that's circumscribed by the light

178
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:48,290
and outside the light is darkness.

179
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:49,363
And so the,

180
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,490
the mythological landscape in which this
story reveals itself is light versus

181
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:58,220
darkness or order versus chaos.

182
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,880
And the reason for that is
because that is our landscape.

183
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,730
We inhabit peer middle structures.

184
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,520
Those are hierarchies
of other hierarchies.

185
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,080
I think in our society,

186
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:10,910
those are mostly
hierarchies of competence.

187
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:11,800
We,

188
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,340
we,

189
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:17,150
we inhabit hierarchical structures
on a plane that's defined,

190
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,950
defined by our understanding,

191
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,070
surrounded by what we do not comprehend,

192
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,310
and that's the universal human world.

193
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:31,330
And that hierarchy itself is a cooperative
structure that enables us to live

194
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:36,350
with a certain amount of peace
and productivity together.

195
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,860
And also to establish a value system
with whatever is at the pinnacle of the

196
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:47,180
hierarchy regarded as
whatever's most valuable.

197
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,730
Now think about what
happens in the lion king.

198
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,470
It's a,

199
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,020
it's a voyage into what's most valuable.

200
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,240
It's an examination of
what's most valuable.
