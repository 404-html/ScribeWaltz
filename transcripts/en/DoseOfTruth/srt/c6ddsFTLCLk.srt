1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,153
So

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,660
what if the truth could
unravel your entire life?

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,040
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,251
Well,

5
00:00:07,251 --> 00:00:07,731
first of all,

6
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:08,564
it would,

7
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,561
and second,

8
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:09,831
yeah,

9
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:10,730
I know what you mean.

10
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:16,090
You mean what if I suppose a cardinal
case there would be that you did something

11
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:18,500
really terrible and then
if that was revealed,

12
00:00:18,501 --> 00:00:21,350
it would be a catastrophic situation.

13
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:24,440
It's like without knowing
the details of that,

14
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,510
I can't provide a generic answer.

15
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:27,171
You know,

16
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:32,171
I think that there are some sins that
are so egregious that you don't get to

17
00:00:32,211 --> 00:00:33,160
confess to them.

18
00:00:33,161 --> 00:00:33,620
You know?

19
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,240
Like if you've done something terrible,

20
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,160
and I'm not recommending this,

21
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,180
it's just an example.

22
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:41,420
If you've done something terrible and you
know that if you revealed and it would

23
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:44,180
blow the lives of many
people around you apart,

24
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,390
it isn't obvious to me that you have any
moral justification for confessing just

25
00:00:50,751 --> 00:00:52,400
to free your miserable soul.

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:56,450
So what if the truth could
unravel your entire life?

27
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,140
Or maybe you need to go to
Catholic confession and let
someone know exactly what

28
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:00,531
happened.

29
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:01,700
So you're clear about it then.

30
00:01:01,701 --> 00:01:05,330
Then maybe what you need to do is to
swear to whatever God you worship that

31
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:08,540
you're going to try to walk the
straight and narrow from here on in.

32
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:13,190
And that'll be sufficient to atone for
whatever terrible thing that you did.

33
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:14,270
And that's a,

34
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:15,650
that's a form of prayer.

35
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,410
And it sounds like one
that you desperately need,

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,670
at least in principle.

37
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:20,900
No.

38
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,733
So

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,590
without knowing the details,

40
00:01:25,591 --> 00:01:26,970
that's about the best I can do.

41
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:37,050
I think what put you over with so many
of us was the constructive message of how

42
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:37,980
to be a good man.

43
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,340
Well,

44
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,720
a good person I would say.

45
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,510
Do you think that's where
the media want you to go?

46
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,620
I don't know.

47
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,830
Generally not day.

48
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,250
I mentioned this earlier,

49
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:51,480
is that the media as it disintegrates
and it certainly is disintegrating at an

50
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,770
incredibly rapid rate.

51
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,113
Um,

52
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,220
everything is political there.

53
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,280
It's less if the philosophical and the
psychological and the theological don't

54
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,364
exist.

55
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,331
And you know,

56
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:08,331
increasingly in my interviews I've been
talking about what's been happening at

57
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:12,870
my lectures on my tour and describing
the fact that the vast majority of the

58
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:14,970
audience isn't there for
political reasons at all.

59
00:02:14,971 --> 00:02:18,750
They were there because they want to
figure out how to have a responsible and

60
00:02:18,751 --> 00:02:22,950
meaningful life and it's as if
that story just doesn't exist.

61
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:23,610
The the,

62
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,630
the framework,

63
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:28,500
which is basically a political framework
and increasingly a politically correct

64
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:32,280
framework doesn't allow
that to exist as a reality.

65
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,380
And that's why,

66
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,203
well,

67
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,240
I'm much more comfortable lecturing to
the crowds that have been coming to see

68
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,970
me then I am talking to journalists.

69
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,813
It's become,

70
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,691
I have to,

71
00:02:45,691 --> 00:02:46,860
I have been limiting my,

72
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,060
my interactions with journalists even
though that might not be self evident yet.

73
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,350
I have been trying to do that,

74
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,380
that the demands have been increasing.

75
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,040
So the proportion of media invitations
that I've responding to has fallen

76
00:03:02,561 --> 00:03:07,480
dramatically even though the absolute
number hasn't declined as precipitously.

77
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,850
And the reason for that
is that while I find the,

78
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,600
I find the typical
interview very stressful,

79
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:13,991
very,

80
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:14,830
very stressful.

81
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,150
I'm on guard.

82
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:20,560
And I would say also my attitude isn't
as good as it could be any more because

83
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,394
I've been,

84
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm,

85
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,980
because I'm on guard so much,

86
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:28,420
it's easier for me to get a bit snappy
and an unpleasant and that's bad.

87
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,051
That's bad.

88
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:29,980
I don't want to do that.

89
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,280
I want to stay calm and
detached and try to,

90
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,211
you know,

91
00:03:34,211 --> 00:03:38,410
tell the truth and be happy that I'm
there regardless of the circumstances.

92
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,430
Um,

93
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,210
the fact that the mainstream media,

94
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:43,840
let's say,

95
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,570
is not very receptive,

96
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,460
although sometimes there's exceptions,

97
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,560
not very receptive to the idea that I
could just be going around talking to

98
00:03:53,561 --> 00:03:56,890
people who want to get their
life together is quite saddening.

99
00:03:56,891 --> 00:04:01,540
And I think it's definitely a commentary
on the fundamental corruption of our

100
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:03,010
media apparatus.

101
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,350
I think it's better to talk on youtube,

102
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,780
to speak on my podcast,

103
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:14,830
to do these lectures,

104
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,830
and I think it's increasingly
better to do that.

105
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:22,920
The long form discussions on youtube
though with people like Joe Rogan and Dave

106
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,400
Rubin and,

107
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,233
and so forth,

108
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,720
that works just fine.

109
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:31,260
So the new media form is emerging and
I think it's going to be a lot more

110
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,390
productive.

111
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:32,800
Um,

112
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,910
it won't be a scripted,

113
00:04:33,911 --> 00:04:35,230
it'll be much longer forum.

114
00:04:35,231 --> 00:04:37,660
It will be allowed for
much more thoughtfulness.

115
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,173
Um,

116
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,583
and

117
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,493
I'm,

118
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,080
but it's okay.

119
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,630
It's not like the media exposure,

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,100
although it's been stressful.

121
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:51,930
It's not like I'm not grateful for it.

122
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,030
Even people who've put me on the spot
very badly have ended up doing me a

123
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,110
tremendous favor.

124
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,730
But the problem is,

125
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:01,260
is that because

126
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:04,863
yeah,

127
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,850
the problem is I'm becoming
too much on garden and I,

128
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,730
I've noticed,

129
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,390
uh,

130
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,390
developing sense of impatience
within me and some suspicion,

131
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:16,380
and that's not good.

132
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:20,130
I don't want to be in situations where
those are my fundamental orientations.

133
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:20,500
It's,

134
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,270
it's a,

135
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,240
it's a sign of a certain amount
of internal corruption on my part.

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,351
And,

137
00:05:25,351 --> 00:05:26,184
uh,

138
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:30,090
I want to be in situations
where I'm speaking with people,

139
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:33,000
speaking honestly to people
who are honestly listening.

140
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:34,470
That would be,

141
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,610
that's a good situation.

142
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,713
So

143
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,690
would you agree with Cs Lewis?

144
00:05:42,691 --> 00:05:43,860
That if you look for truth,

145
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:44,940
you may find comfort?

146
00:05:44,941 --> 00:05:45,900
If you look for comfort,

147
00:05:45,901 --> 00:05:47,010
you will find despair?

148
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,521
Oh yes.

149
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:48,780
That's definitely the case.

150
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,180
It's quite an intelligent
phrase because he says,

151
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:52,140
if you look for truth,

152
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:54,090
you may find comfort.

153
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,640
He didn't say you will find comfort.

154
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,171
Yeah.

155
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:57,351
Well,

156
00:05:57,351 --> 00:05:58,610
sometimes if you look for truth,

157
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:00,140
you don't find comfort to begin with.

158
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:00,711
That's for sure.

159
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,910
You find a lot of trouble.

160
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,720
But sometimes you have to go through
a lot of trouble to get to set things

161
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:06,530
right.

162
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:07,760
If you look for comfort,

163
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,670
despair,

164
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,410
well the reason for that is that
you can't look for comfort in life.

165
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,990
Life isn't about comfort.

166
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,270
Life is a deadly game.

167
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,730
It's a game of life and death.

168
00:06:19,731 --> 00:06:21,020
It's a game of good and evil.

169
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,690
It's everything's on the line.

170
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,700
Your sanity's on the line,

171
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,953
you're,

172
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:30,570
your freedom from pain is on the line.

173
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,580
Your freedom from despair is on the line.

174
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,050
Your families on the line,

175
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,400
there's no comfort.

176
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,900
Life is an adventure.

177
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:42,470
And I think the greatest adventure that
you can possibly have is one is the one

178
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,410
that you find if you look for the truth.

179
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,650
And that's a good place to stop.

180
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,750
That's been 90 minutes.

181
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,823
And uh,

182
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:59,070
I've been reasonably sharp and
with it for the full 90 minutes.

183
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,960
And so I think I'll bring it to a close,

184
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,830
just a couple of reminders for
those of you who tuned in late.

185
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,040
If you want to try out the
self authoring program,

186
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,840
I made a code August and that
an titles you did 20% off,

187
00:07:15,841 --> 00:07:18,810
there's a two for one special so
you can give it to a friend as well.

188
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,060
If you want to try understand myself,

189
00:07:21,061 --> 00:07:25,020
which is a personality test
only takes about 15 minutes.

190
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:27,450
It's quite a bit easier than
the self authoring suite.

191
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,560
Um,

192
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,300
the code for that is also August.

193
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:32,160
That also gives you 20% off.

194
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:36,510
Self authoring helps you write about
your past and present and future and you

195
00:07:36,511 --> 00:07:40,680
can do a bad job and if you haven't
developed a life plan and you don't know

196
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:42,510
where you are and you don't
know where you're going,

197
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,590
then I would highly recommend trying the
program and you're welcome to do a bad

198
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:49,530
job at it because a bad plan is,

199
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,510
is a lot better than no plan at all.

200
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:56,380
And understand myself will
help you understand who you
are for better or worse.

201
00:07:56,381 --> 00:07:56,850
And,

202
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,310
and people have responded
quite positively to it.

203
00:07:59,311 --> 00:08:03,990
So I think it's worth the 15 minutes
in the nine 95 that it costs,

204
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:05,163
um,

205
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,660
discounted 20% now.

206
00:08:06,661 --> 00:08:08,490
So I guess that's about seven 95,

207
00:08:08,491 --> 00:08:09,324
something like that.

208
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:10,650
So that,

209
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,723
um,

210
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,520
the second Iceland lecturer
is going to come out soon.

211
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,140
I released the first Iceland lecture,

212
00:08:16,141 --> 00:08:17,730
which is part of 12 rules for life.

213
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,660
I have a tour coming out through the
northeastern part of the United States

214
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:26,640
starting in September and then over to
the UK and northern Europe in September

215
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:29,610
and October and then Australia
and New Zealand in February.

216
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,073
Um,

217
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,540
I've really enjoyed the tour.

218
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,150
I think it's an amazing opportunity.

219
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,880
It's been extraordinarily heartwarming,

220
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,720
let's say,

221
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,570
to talk to so many people who are
trying to put their lives together.

222
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,770
And if enough people do that,

223
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:50,580
then they will put their lives together
and that will help put everything else

224
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:51,414
together.

225
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,240
And so we'll hopefully
these Q and A's are a smart,

226
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,380
small part that,

227
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,590
so thank you very much for listening in.

228
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,920
And I'll try to do one in September.

229
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,670
Um,

230
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,301
if I don't,

231
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:05,430
it's because I'm on the road all the time,

232
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,740
but I will definitely try
to do one in September.

233
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,990
So thank you for,

234
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:11,520
to my patrion supporters.

235
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,060
Um,

236
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:16,380
I mentioned to you guys that I am working
hard on the online university and have

237
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:18,330
hired three people to work
on that and that we're,

238
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,830
we're about a year ahead of schedule,

239
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:20,400
I would say,

240
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,181
where I thought I'd be,

241
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:21,961
so in three months,

242
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:23,640
we're a year ahead of
where I figured I'd be.

243
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,533
We'd be.

244
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,463
So,

245
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,400
um,

246
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,180
thanks again.

247
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,013
Good night.

248
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,800
Ciao.
