1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:06,751
Is it?

2
00:00:06,751 --> 00:00:10,030
It is the case that we live in a field.

3
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,160
It's defined by the extent of our vision.

4
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,080
It is the case that we live in a
hierarchical structure on that plane.

5
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,050
It is the case that there's
a king ship at the top.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,220
It is the case that that's always
threatened by malevolence and sin.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,850
It is the case that that can make you
corrupt and cynical and irresponsible.

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:33,880
It is the case that that's the
inappropriate response and that it's your

9
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:38,881
responsibility to repair
the damage structure of
tradition despite the fact that

10
00:00:40,481 --> 00:00:43,360
it veers towards corruption.

11
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:47,470
It is the case that if you take
that responsibility on yourself,

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,740
that the rain falls again
and everything flourishes.

13
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,540
It's correct.

14
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,670
It's the right way of
looking at the world,

15
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,800
and if we didn't know that deeply,

16
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,070
everyone in this room wouldn't
have watched that movie.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:01,481
And you think,

18
00:01:01,481 --> 00:01:01,631
well,

19
00:01:01,631 --> 00:01:05,800
it's so strange that we can watch
that movie without understanding it.

20
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:06,551
Right?

21
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:08,350
You can fall into it because you do.

22
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,453
When you go to,

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,301
you might wonder,

24
00:01:10,301 --> 00:01:10,930
well,

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,880
do people have religious experiences?

26
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:16,060
Because people wonder about
the truth of religion,

27
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:16,894
let's say,

28
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,510
and I'm not going to go
very deeply into that issue,

29
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:23,740
but I can tell you that what you're doing
when you go to a movie like that that

30
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:27,430
has that mythological
structure and you fall into it,

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,320
which is what you do,

32
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,650
that what you're having is absolutely
indistinguishable from a religious

33
00:01:32,651 --> 00:01:33,484
experience.

34
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:37,060
It's the revelation of
knowledge that you know,

35
00:01:37,061 --> 00:01:37,900
but you don't know.

36
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:38,734
You know,

37
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,690
and there's something about it that's so
deeply engaging in meaningful that you

38
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:47,590
will line up and pay for the
privilege of being exposed to it.

39
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:50,020
And this is not an easy
thing to understand.

40
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,130
Like if you bring,

41
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,420
your child will be very excited about the
possibility of going to the lion king,

42
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:56,920
right?

43
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,840
And maybe want to watch it 20 times.

44
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,270
My son watched the d,

45
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,340
The whale seen in Pinocchio.

46
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,540
I bet he watched that 115 times
when he was four or five years old.

47
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:10,990
He just watched it over
and over and over and over.

48
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:11,501
I thought,

49
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:12,820
what the hell are you doing kid?

50
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:13,870
You know?

51
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,111
I mean,

52
00:02:14,111 --> 00:02:17,080
it was so interesting to watch
that he was so obsessed by it.

53
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:20,110
But there's a tremendous amount
of information in that movie,

54
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:20,751
like a,

55
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:22,880
an almost unlimited amount of information.

56
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:25,750
And he was gripped by it and was trying,

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:31,050
however it is that a child's imagination
tries to come to terms with what the

58
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,560
movie was representing.

59
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,270
And it wasn't like he enjoyed it.

60
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:35,890
Not at all.

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,880
Not In the least.

62
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:37,091
You know?

63
00:02:37,091 --> 00:02:37,930
And if you,

64
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:38,201
well,

65
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:38,591
if you,

66
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,640
if you watch the scene,

67
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,230
how many of you have
seen the Movie Pinocchio?

68
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:42,280
Okay.

69
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,180
So it's the same thing.

70
00:02:43,181 --> 00:02:47,110
It's one of the 10 most highest
grossing movies of all time,

71
00:02:47,111 --> 00:02:47,830
by the way.

72
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,663
Um,

73
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:50,260
there's a scene where Pinocchio,

74
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:50,860
who's turned in,

75
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:54,430
he's a wooden puppet who's been
turned into a jackass and for some,

76
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,830
which is supposed to make sense
to you and apparently does.

77
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:02,050
And he goes to the bottom of the ocean
to rescue his father who was somehow

78
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,070
swallowed by a whale.

79
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,630
So think about what you're watching.

80
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,590
You're watching a drawing of a
puppet turned into a jackass.

81
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:12,730
Go to the bottom of the ocean and rescue
his father from a fire-breathing whale

82
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,130
and you're all perfectly okay with that.

83
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,300
Right?

84
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,370
So it's very peculiar and so,

85
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:19,630
and it's very frightening.

86
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,660
Like the whale is a while it does breathe
fire because it's actually a dragon,

87
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:25,563
not a whale.

88
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:26,500
And,

89
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,750
and the,

90
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,400
the animators used locomotive noises to,

91
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,270
to,

92
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:36,270
to add the audio background and the whale
is hell bent on destroying the hero of

93
00:03:36,881 --> 00:03:39,580
the story of Pinocchio and also Japan and,

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,380
and it's a very tense scene.

95
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,080
And so my son was just like this
like the whole time watching it.

96
00:03:45,081 --> 00:03:45,310
It,

97
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:45,850
it wasn't,

98
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,080
you wouldn't think that he would,

99
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:47,770
you know,

100
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,030
he's like these terrified,

101
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:53,280
like a rabbit who's being watched by a
wolf and then it makes his heartbeat and

102
00:03:53,281 --> 00:03:55,150
he's all exhausted and it goes,

103
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,460
and then the first thing he
wants to do is to do it again.

104
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,241
It's like,

105
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,440
what the hell is going well?

106
00:03:59,441 --> 00:03:59,711
What,

107
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:00,550
what's going on there?

108
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:01,980
It's not like it's a cake walk.

109
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,160
It's not that at all.

110
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:05,290
It's like he could hardly
even stand to watch it.

111
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:06,310
It's so tense,

112
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,020
especially when you're for,

113
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,150
it's like it's bad enough
when you're an adult,

114
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,421
you know,

115
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:12,940
and you've seen a
thousand things like that.

116
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:14,140
And at least in principle,

117
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:15,700
your little tougher and a little wiser.

118
00:04:15,701 --> 00:04:17,830
But when you're for that
just blows you away.

119
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:18,130
Like,

120
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,750
like everything in the world does.

121
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:23,140
And yet all he would do is expose himself
to it over and over and over and over

122
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:23,974
and over.

123
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,000
And in the lion king,

124
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,930
like if you watch children when they go
see that they're just demolished when

125
00:04:28,931 --> 00:04:29,221
Simba,

126
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:30,310
his father dies,

127
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:30,850
right?

128
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,200
Just tears them apart.

129
00:04:32,201 --> 00:04:33,250
They can't believe that,

130
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:33,940
you know,

131
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,280
the king has disappeared.

132
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,930
And yet they'll watch it over and over
and over and over just like you do.

133
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:41,981
And it's because,

134
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,191
well,

135
00:04:42,191 --> 00:04:46,570
the whole story we used to tell our son
when we took them to movies because he'd

136
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,490
get all shorted out by what was happening.

137
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,900
And unsurprisingly,

138
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,240
watch the hero.

139
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,740
Keep your eye on the hero because
that's the pathway through.

140
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,150
And that's exactly right because you're
supposed to keep your eye on the hero

141
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:06,280
because that is the pathway through and
there isn't anything that's more true

142
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:07,114
than that.

143
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,160
That's a true story.

144
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:10,211
You think?

145
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:10,391
Well,

146
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:11,230
it's fictional.

147
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:14,440
It's like fiction presents abstractions.

148
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,320
Abstractions aren't false hoods.

149
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,090
They're abstractions.

150
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,860
Think about numbers.

151
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:23,260
Numbers are abstractions.

152
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:27,220
They're abstracted away from
individual entities in the real world.

153
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,630
But if you know the numbers,

154
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,660
you know abstractions of tremendous truth.

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,360
While the abstraction of the idea of the
individual hero from the collective of

156
00:05:37,361 --> 00:05:41,980
human action is the abstraction
of it's more true than true.

157
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,010
Deep fiction is more true than truth.

158
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,360
That's a way of thinking about it.

159
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,090
It's more real than reality itself.

160
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:53,230
In the same way that an abstraction can
be more real than the thing that it's

161
00:05:53,231 --> 00:05:56,200
abstracted from all of the,

162
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:03,070
all of the landscape in a mythological
tale like the lion king is an abstract

163
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,544
landscape.

164
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,790
What's common across all landscapes?

165
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:08,930
Well,

166
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,681
wherever you go,

167
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:14,330
there are things that you know and
there are things that you don't know and

168
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:18,860
that's the human world and it doesn't
matter who the human being is.

169
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,080
You might know more than you do,

170
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,520
but doesn't matter because your knowledge
is still bounded by your limitless

171
00:06:25,521 --> 00:06:26,354
ignorance.

172
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:31,540
And the possibility that that domain of
limitless ignorance will make mockery of

173
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:32,960
what you know at any moment.

174
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,860
It's a reality and it's
a universal reality,

175
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,880
and you have to orient
yourself in that landscape.

176
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,090
And and so does everyone else.

177
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,330
You have to deal with what you knew
and what you don't know everywhere.

178
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,440
And the way you do that is by straddling
the divide between what you know and

179
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:52,274
what you don't know.

180
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,820
You do that by staying firmly grounded
to some degree in what you understand,

181
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,630
but by putting a tentative foot outward
into what you don't understand so that

182
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:03,770
you can remain stable,

183
00:07:03,771 --> 00:07:07,790
but you can stretch yourself and
challenge yourself simultaneously.

184
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:08,511
Right?

185
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,130
And that's the proper place to stand.

186
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,570
And that's actually a real place.

187
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:13,580
That's the line between chaos and order.

188
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,230
And that's the place of meaning.
