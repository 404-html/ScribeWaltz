1
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:12,693
It

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,830
frustrated by his success in the day,

3
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:21,760
or at least the excuse she

4
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:24,163
jumped,

5
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:30,100
right?

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,820
It's not a casual,

7
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,010
aggressive,

8
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:33,791
impulsive.

9
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:38,791
When twist your hand is in your hands
because it wrangler and you see crowd

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,181
people,

11
00:00:40,181 --> 00:00:41,260
it's not bad.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,511
It's very,

13
00:00:42,511 --> 00:00:43,344
very deliberate.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,170
And to hit people one
continuous sequence like that.

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,980
And then I talked to a journalist who
had seen his hand the next day he was

16
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:54,940
raised in court.

17
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:58,960
She said that he walked into the courtroom
like someone who's near Fort Ward.

18
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,670
And so,

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:06,670
so there's this constellation of action.

20
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:12,240
I think the only proper way to
describe those options as evil action.

21
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:16,870
That is in some sense,

22
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:21,871
because you described the options as
equal as to also simultaneously proclaim

23
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:25,540
the reality of good and evil in the world.

24
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,450
But that doesn't really bother me
because I can't see that presenting

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,190
alternative language.

26
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,090
It's useful to describe.

27
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:38,590
You might not agree with that

28
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:42,911
you might want to make,

29
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:46,980
but that's the appropriate language
within which to close such event.

30
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,320
I need to be appropriate language.

31
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,400
And that means that in order to understand
that you have to speak a language of

32
00:01:54,401 --> 00:01:55,210
good and evil,

33
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,940
and I do believe this to be true.

34
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,730
I can tell you why in part one of
the things that's happened to me,

35
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:05,940
I didn't lecture online a distinction
between tried to do an eval and I think

36
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:12,121
it's one of the most effective but direct
delivered are starting to say brigade

37
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,640
out conceptually earthquakes and cancer,

38
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,100
you know standard catastrophes of life.

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,660
The perpetrator acts of God will speak
very hard on the people obviously and how

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:29,920
often did Jay from the level of tax which
are getting in the same manner and you

41
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:32,530
might think therefore the same,

42
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,420
they're not the same thing.

43
00:02:34,421 --> 00:02:35,820
They're tragic use.

44
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,240
One thing and the level of this is
another thing and the level of tragedies,

45
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,120
the worst things that we actually don't
this as clinicians if we're awake like

46
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,480
all of those because one of the things
that it's well documented in the clinical

47
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,510
literature is what causes post
traumatic stress disorder.

48
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,480
Generally speaking,

49
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,540
it isn't exposure to tragedy opposed to
disorder can usually what causes post

50
00:03:02,731 --> 00:03:04,540
traumatic stress is exposure.

51
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:05,374
To my level.

52
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:10,830
So not only can you have to be hurt or
do you have to be hurt by someone who is

53
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:12,640
intended for food.

54
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,290
That's why I'm very,

55
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,790
the other variants of this
often happens to soldiers.

56
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,520
They go into battle and they observe
themselves something that's deeply 11th,

57
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:22,490
and they never knew that.

58
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,100
They had to ask him for that.

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,200
Perhaps just part of
them that even enjoys it,

60
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:27,550
at least in the vulnerable thing.

61
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,600
And afterwards they're
fragmented by the consequences.

62
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,820
Say people who were
perhaps somewhat too naive,

63
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:36,370
he can make effective soldiers.

64
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,603
Um,

65
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,900
they observe themselves doing something
terrible on the battlefield and then

66
00:03:40,901 --> 00:03:43,420
they're broken and they
cannot be prepared.

67
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,460
And I've had many heart,

68
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:46,060
it's very difficult for
them to be repaired.

69
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:50,860
And I've had many people like that
contact me and say that because they've

70
00:03:50,861 --> 00:03:52,930
watched the select trouble,

71
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,210
the distinction between tragedy and evil,

72
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,370
they have been able to recover,

73
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:59,770
at least in part from the post
traumatic stress disorder.

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,460
And so in my own clinical
practice when I treated people,

75
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,550
I had a client who was a young woman
and she had been bullied very badly by a

76
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,170
boy who she did not want to go up with it.

77
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,310
After that made it his life's
work to bring her down.

78
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:19,360
When she did very effectively is friends
and they pulled her into a state of

79
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,070
absolute psychosis.

80
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:22,000
When I first saw her,

81
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:25,180
she couldn't even speak
and she was hallucinating.

82
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,600
She had arbitrary and visual
hallucinations and I could
barely communicate with

83
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,434
her.

84
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,560
I spent about eight months with her slowly
detailing out what happened and what

85
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:40,570
could really affected her was the fact
that she couldn't understand how anyone

86
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:43,870
can be so cruel as to bloat with the
way to do nothing but make her life

87
00:04:43,871 --> 00:04:46,720
miserable and that's what
broke her and she was real.

88
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:51,130
It was really serious and
we had to sit and talk.

89
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:51,731
First of all,

90
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:55,930
I tried to carry weight and then as she
recovered in increasingly coherent ways

91
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,000
about good and evil,

92
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:02,350
essentially about the fact that people
can be motivated to pursue nothing.

93
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,370
That disruption and pain and misery and
to do that consciously and within 10

94
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,840
accidentally and assets as the
victims of some of the process,

95
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:14,470
you know,

96
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:15,010
but fuck,

97
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,400
knowing full well what they're doing
it and doing it because they know what

98
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,234
they're doing.

99
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,270
And she was a lot more mature,

100
00:05:22,271 --> 00:05:25,530
let's say at the end of that process
that she was at the beginning,

101
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:25,780
uncle,

102
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,190
she paid great crisis
Chrysler for politics,

103
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,190
which is typically the case.

104
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,100
So I do understand that.

105
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,880
I do understand what sort of language is
necessary for use to frame these sorts

106
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,720
of situations.

107
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,130
And uh,

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,590
and I think the language of good and
evil is the appropriate language.

109
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,830
You aren't treating the topic we
sufficient seriousness unless you need the

110
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:54,970
appropriate terminology and evil.

111
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:55,301
To me,

112
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:59,690
it's something like the generation
of harm for the sake of the harm.

113
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,650
It's best to think
about it as a continent,

114
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,520
this fed.

115
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,130
And you can understand that if you think
about the assignment of mentioned work

116
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,060
will set you free.

117
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,033
There's in this

118
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:14,090
dramatic or artistic statement
painted block essentially.

119
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,380
And people don't like that idea
because we don't like definitely,

120
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:18,741
you know,

121
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,780
we like to think that
the only cause of human

122
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,750
inappropriate human action is increments.

123
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,490
Like people just do better.

124
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:29,131
They wouldn't do it.

125
00:06:29,131 --> 00:06:30,940
And it's like I'm afraid
that just doesn't cut it.

126
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:34,520
People know perfectly well what they're
doing and that's exactly why they're

127
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,354
doing it.

128
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:36,080
I mean,

129
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,120
there's increments evolve.

130
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:38,920
What does eight parents
involved in everything and it's,

131
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:40,490
it's not sufficient explanation.
