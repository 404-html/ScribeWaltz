1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:07,850
There's a tipping point.

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:12,320
It was corruption much direction
before you hit that tipping point.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,730
And so what that means is the moral
behavior of each individual is far more

4
00:00:16,731 --> 00:00:18,380
important that people generally think,

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,760
cause it doesn't take many
cheaters getting away with
it to make those who don't

6
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:26,300
cheat think that they're fools.

7
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:29,720
It's the probability of being caught.

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:30,770
That's the deterrent,

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:32,480
isn't the severity of the punishment.

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:33,690
Okay.

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,770
We know that that doesn't,

12
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:36,150
that isn't questionable.

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:37,440
We know that that's the case.

14
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,120
And I don't know why conservatives don't,

15
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,740
the reason they don't get
it is because they vote by,

16
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,031
you know,

17
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:45,120
they think by their temperament
and their temperament says punish.

18
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:48,090
It's not thinking it's just
a temperamental response.

19
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:49,350
Whereas the liberal responses,

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,423
well,

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:51,570
you know,

22
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,080
those poor criminals must've had something
happened to them that was terrible in

23
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:56,490
their past or they wouldn't be criminals,

24
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:56,990
which is,

25
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:57,600
you know,

26
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,400
just equally as nonsensical.

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:00:59,820
Yeah.
