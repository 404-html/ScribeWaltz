1
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,010
I mean,

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,900
what happened as far
as I can understand it,

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:14,120
some financial wizards figured out
that by bundling mortgages together,

4
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,740
you could calculate their average
riskiness and then you could discount them

5
00:00:18,741 --> 00:00:21,980
according to that riskiness and then
you could sell them as high grade

6
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:22,820
investments.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,460
And the regulatory agencies
went along with that.

8
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:29,570
And that's partly because they're
generally staffed by people who aren't as

9
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,440
smart as the people who were manipulating
the monetary system for obvious

10
00:00:33,441 --> 00:00:34,274
reasons.

11
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,420
And it was brilliant.

12
00:00:35,421 --> 00:00:39,020
It makes sense that if you take a bunch
of risky investments that you can and

13
00:00:39,021 --> 00:00:40,880
you can calculate the risk and discounted,

14
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,080
then you stabilize.

15
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:43,280
It gets brilliant.

16
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,690
Except for one thing,

17
00:00:45,560 --> 00:00:48,560
they didn't calculate the fact that
everything could collapse it once.

18
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:53,420
Now what happened was when
they transformed these risky
investments into stable

19
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,254
investments,

20
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,370
they got really valuable.

21
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:58,970
And so it was worthwhile for the banks
to give mortgages to everybody that could

22
00:00:58,971 --> 00:01:00,110
possibly process.

23
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,400
And that's where the crookedness started.

24
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,500
Dis CPM,

25
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,471
you know,

26
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:04,304
they thought,

27
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:04,640
well,

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,640
it doesn't matter how risky be mortgage
is because we'll average that out

29
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:11,990
anyways and we're going
to make money on that.

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,460
On the trash.

31
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:15,710
I think they were called brilliant,

32
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,010
except for the one thing
that no one expected,

33
00:01:19,011 --> 00:01:22,190
which was that the whole bloody
market could collapse at once.

34
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:23,661
So,

35
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:24,470
you know,

36
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:24,951
you can think,

37
00:01:24,951 --> 00:01:25,101
well,

38
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:26,210
it's obvious in retrospect,

39
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,320
no,

40
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,153
no obvious,

41
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:27,561
you know,

42
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:31,220
like the American housing market value
peaked way below what the Japanese

43
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,600
housing market had peaked out.

44
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:33,080
You know,

45
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,050
after you decades before
it was nothing like it.

46
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:36,471
Jada,

47
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:40,790
Japanese real estate market got
inflated away past the American.

48
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:42,170
So now one,

49
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,640
you don't know where the talk is.

50
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,253
So,

51
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,231
and the,

52
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:46,560
you know,

53
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,020
the crookedness was

54
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:57,060
people's failure to play by
standard rules of risk evaluation.

55
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,310
But even that's complicated
because they thought,

56
00:01:59,311 --> 00:01:59,461
well,

57
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:00,900
maybe these rules don't apply anymore.

58
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,370
And that's what the guys who were making
these bundled investments we're trying

59
00:02:05,371 --> 00:02:05,671
to do.

60
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:09,300
They were trying to make the old rules
not apply anymore by eradicating the risk

61
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,123
didn't work.

62
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:12,803
Was it crooked?

63
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,613
Probably.

64
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:17,880
It's not so obvious though.
