1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,220
We know that the snake is

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:07,220
utilized conceptually and metaphorically
as representation of transformation,

3
00:00:07,221 --> 00:00:07,491
right,

4
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:11,630
because the snake is something that
can shed its skin and be reborn.

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:16,010
We know that a snake is something that's
innately attractive and terrifying

6
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,120
human beings and other primates so
that if you come across a snake,

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,790
you're likely to be at least startled,

8
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,080
if not horrified by it,

9
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:28,820
but also attracted to it in a way
that is underneath your voluntary

10
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:29,481
consciousness,

11
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:29,691
right?

12
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:33,980
Because snakes attract orienting
reflex isn't they activate the systems

13
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:36,980
underneath your consciousness that
actually govern the structure of that

14
00:00:36,981 --> 00:00:37,814
consciousness.

15
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:43,130
We know that the snake can be well
represented as well as internal chaos,

16
00:00:43,131 --> 00:00:44,360
so imagine this,

17
00:00:44,361 --> 00:00:49,361
imagine that it's not unreasonable for
a self conscious mind searching for a

18
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:54,920
mode of self representation to remark on
the parallels between the structure of

19
00:00:54,921 --> 00:00:57,140
the snake and the spine and the brain.

20
00:00:57,141 --> 00:01:02,060
Given that a snake is essentially a spine
with a brain and then imagine as well

21
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:05,540
that the most archaic aspects
of our nervous system,

22
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:10,340
those that govern novelty and orienting
and anxiety responses are in fact

23
00:01:10,341 --> 00:01:15,341
precisely those that were described by
Mclean as nested inside the reptilian

24
00:01:15,921 --> 00:01:18,910
brain and then imagine
along with the Hindu Yogis,

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:23,360
that the purpose of Kundalini Yoga
is to activate the circuitry that's

26
00:01:23,361 --> 00:01:24,800
associated with that snake,

27
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:25,634
so to speak,

28
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,810
to produce a permanent
state of alert wakefulness.

29
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,520
It's associated with consciousness,

30
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,420
so imagine this.

31
00:01:37,421 --> 00:01:42,421
Imagine an animal like like a zebra
grazing mindlessly in the herd with no

32
00:01:43,841 --> 00:01:45,340
consciousness whatsoever,

33
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:50,400
and then imagine it's relatively
undeveloped cortical structures activated

34
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:55,471
suddenly by the movement of a lion off
in the perimeter and then imagine for

35
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:59,830
that brief moment the thought
Zebra is actually conscious state.

36
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:02,710
That requires a tremendous amount
of energy and difficult to maintain,

37
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:07,711
but because the threat and the uncertainty
manifest itself within the zebras

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,180
mode of consciousness,

39
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,650
it wakes momentarily.

40
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,380
And then imagine that
human beings are like that.

41
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:19,381
Zebra always because we've become self
conscious because we know that the

42
00:02:20,111 --> 00:02:21,910
unknown is around us all the time.

43
00:02:21,911 --> 00:02:23,410
Even when we think we're safe,

44
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,850
we're never safe.

45
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,080
Imagine that the reason we're so conscious
is because as a consequence of our

46
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:29,711
discovery,

47
00:02:29,711 --> 00:02:32,350
of the possibility of our own mortality,

48
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,180
all this underlying circuitry that in
other animals is only apparent when

49
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:40,240
they're startled or afraid
or interested or curious.

50
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,051
In human beings.

51
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:44,650
It's on all the time and that's what
makes us conscious and the reason for that

52
00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:49,651
is because we developed enough cortical
elaboration to note that we're always

53
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:51,880
threatened by everything that's around us.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,200
And then imagine that.

55
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,071
Well,

56
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:55,000
that's pretty awful,

57
00:02:55,001 --> 00:02:55,421
isn't it?

58
00:02:55,421 --> 00:02:58,930
Because it's at the basis of
all our innate existential,

59
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,530
but then imagine as well that without
that terror pushing us forward and and our

60
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,140
constant reference to the
dangerous aspect of the unknown,

61
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,370
we would have never been motivated to
produce the kind of societies that we've

62
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,211
produced,

63
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:18,211
which are essentially very remarkably
elaborated devices that enable us to find

64
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:22,750
some protection from that
unknown and to manipulate,

65
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,550
manipulate it effectively,

66
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:26,900
and then remembering that Surrey,

67
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:32,100
we will return to genesis young says
the snake was regarded by early gnostic

68
00:03:35,371 --> 00:03:40,371
Christians as a kind of deity whose
faculties were more developed and advanced

69
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,590
than the original daddy that
actually structured the world.

70
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,150
The idea there being that the world
initially was a pretty dismal place.

71
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,920
Everyone wasn't conscious.

72
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:54,150
We all existed at the level of the
animal and then the snake came along and

73
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:54,984
said,

74
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,220
wake up.

75
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,113
Wake up.

76
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,920
And the movement from that state of
unsolved consciousness paradise to this

77
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:06,921
profane state of awakening can be regarded
not so much as a descent but as an

78
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,850
asset of sorts,

79
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,390
even though a painful one.

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,850
And then you have Gareth.

81
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:16,560
This commentary from Mephistopheles,

82
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:21,060
his representation of Satan and
his capacity for temptation,

83
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,050
who says,

84
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,130
follow the adage of my cousin,

85
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:27,330
snake from dreams of godlike knowledge,

86
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:32,331
you will wake to fear in which your
very soul shall quake a statement,

87
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,850
associating the human
tendency to attribute to all
revolutionary sources of new

88
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:41,874
information,

89
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:44,130
a kind of demonic being,

90
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,880
and then you have the
problem of the woman.

91
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,240
Now we know that within the context
of the Judeo Christian tradition,

92
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,420
women have unduly suffered for their
role in tempting humanity in the embodied

93
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:02,200
form of Adam towards higher
order self consciousness,

94
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:02,741
and then you think,

95
00:05:02,741 --> 00:05:03,310
well,

96
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,840
let's just take a look at how human beings
and their mating relationships differ

97
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,800
from those of other animals like
chimpanzees to whom we are very closely

98
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,970
genetically related.

99
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:16,030
And if you look at the mating
strategies of female chimpanzees,

100
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:19,450
you see that they really don't
care who they sleep with,

101
00:05:19,451 --> 00:05:20,290
so to speak.

102
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,300
Any old chimpanzee will do.

103
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:22,960
Now,

104
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,580
the last dominant male chimps tend to be
chased away by the more dominant nailed

105
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:27,881
chimps,

106
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:31,990
but if a female than less dominant chimp
can get the hell away from the watchful

107
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,370
gaze of the dominance hierarchy,

108
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,230
they're perfectly happy to mate.

109
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,900
Human females are not like that.

110
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,640
There is selective of maters and there's
a tremendous body of evolutionary

111
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:46,630
psychological information that
suggests that although both genders,

112
00:05:46,631 --> 00:05:49,900
value intelligence and
physical appearance,

113
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:54,400
females value the ability
to attain dominance,

114
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:58,040
hierarchy status in men far more than men,

115
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,940
admire the ability to attain
dominant status in women,

116
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:06,970
which is to say that men don't care what
a woman has with regards to potential

117
00:06:07,371 --> 00:06:08,420
for attaining status.

118
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,440
Whereas with women,

119
00:06:09,441 --> 00:06:12,620
it's one of the strong
determinant of mating preference.

120
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:13,820
So then let's say,

121
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:14,360
look,

122
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,780
we don't know why the hell are
cortex has expanded so rapidly,

123
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,390
somewhere between five
and 3 million years ago.

124
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,610
Let's offer this as a hypothesis.

125
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:26,780
The women started to get choosy and
because they were so damn complicated,

126
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:31,781
the whole human species had to exaggerate
it's critical growth prior to any even

127
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,400
use for that critical growth,

128
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:38,090
just so that the men had
uneven hand in the competition,

129
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,600
right?

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,520
So women put tremendous selection
pressure on the human being to develop

131
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:44,354
tremendous,

132
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,310
tremendous cortical expansion.

133
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,840
Now we already know that from a
mythological perspective that women are

134
00:06:50,841 --> 00:06:54,320
frequently cast into the
same conceptual domain,

135
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:58,160
the temptress domain as the
benevolent aspect of the unknown,

136
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:02,270
and we know as well from representations
of hero mythology that it is the

137
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,460
individual who goes out to confront chaos,

138
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,980
who's most likely to free from the dragon,

139
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,320
not only treasured,

140
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:09,410
but a virgin,

141
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:13,940
say in the case of mythological
representations like St
George and the dragon

142
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,280
in the Old Testament in genesis,

143
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:21,671
there's no.

144
00:07:21,671 --> 00:07:26,380
There's this notion that not only did
people become self conscious because they

145
00:07:26,381 --> 00:07:27,011
did something,

146
00:07:27,011 --> 00:07:28,900
but they did this voluntarily,

147
00:07:28,901 --> 00:07:29,170
right?

148
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:29,350
They,

149
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:29,650
they,

150
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,020
they made this decision on their own.

151
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,130
So Milton puts words into
God's mouth and says,

152
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:41,750
so will fall.

153
00:07:41,751 --> 00:07:45,560
He meaning the human being
and his faithless progeny,

154
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,760
whose fault?

155
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,850
Whose about his own engrave he had of me,

156
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:50,181
oh,

157
00:07:50,181 --> 00:07:51,014
he could have.

158
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,250
I made him Justin,

159
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,084
right?

160
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,780
It's efficient to have
stood though free to fall,

161
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,591
and then you think,

162
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:57,741
well,

163
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:02,741
maybe the notion of the heritable sin
of Adam characterizing human beings and

164
00:08:02,961 --> 00:08:06,920
their fallen existential condition
isn't just the black heart ravings of

165
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:09,320
fundamentalist southern Baptist lunatics,

166
00:08:09,321 --> 00:08:09,830
right?

167
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:11,330
There's something to this.

168
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,650
Human beings are the only creatures
that seem to live at odds with their own

169
00:08:15,651 --> 00:08:20,000
experience and it's not so unreasonable
to suppose that it's hard dawning

170
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:24,020
capacity for self consciousness that
put us in that uncomfortable position.

171
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,050
So why do I associate the eating of
the apple with selfconsciousness?

172
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:30,591
Well,

173
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:30,741
let's.

174
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:32,900
Because that's how the
story lays itself out.

175
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:36,590
You have the collateral evidence of
the Buddhist story of enlightenment,

176
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,191
right?

177
00:08:37,191 --> 00:08:38,720
His contact with death.

178
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:40,160
You have multiple media,

179
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:44,510
medieval representations of
Eve offering to animal to Adam.

180
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,160
Not An apple,

181
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:47,390
but a skull.

182
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:50,270
You have multiple
representations of the tree,

183
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:54,050
of the knowledge of good and evil in
medieval iconography as not containing

184
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:54,561
apples,

185
00:08:54,561 --> 00:08:59,460
but containing skulls and you have
the the statements that are within the

186
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:01,890
context of genesis itself.

187
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:08,230
And the eyes of both of them were opened
and they knew that they were naked and

188
00:09:08,871 --> 00:09:12,050
they sewed fig leaves together
and made themselves aprons.

189
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,310
Well,

190
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:15,800
there's a lot of information
packed into those two lines,

191
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:16,190
right?

192
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,720
What does it mean to have your eyes open?

193
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,441
Or half?

194
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:20,180
Your brain is visual cortex.

195
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,253
It's not on.

196
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,290
It's not unreasonable to
presume that that means a quick,

197
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,730
a quick magnification of consciousness.

198
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,440
Your conscious during the day,

199
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:33,590
that's when your eyes are open or
what happens when your eyes are open?

200
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:34,221
Oh,

201
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:35,180
you know you're naked.

202
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:35,350
Well,

203
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,260
what does that mean?

204
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,651
Well,

205
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:36,981
you know,

206
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:37,761
you're vulnerable,

207
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:38,300
right?

208
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,540
To social comment,

209
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,520
to social judgment,

210
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,331
to dominance,

211
00:09:41,331 --> 00:09:41,901
hierarchy,

212
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:43,010
status maneuvering,

213
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:45,920
and to all the terrible things
that the unknown world can,

214
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,200
can recap on you.

215
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,580
And so then what do you do?

216
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,241
Oh,

217
00:09:50,241 --> 00:09:51,410
you create culture,

218
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:52,280
right?

219
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,170
And that's what this little sentence says.

220
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,400
And they sewed fig leaves together
and made themselves aprons.

221
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:03,130
That's a pretty eventful sequence all
crammed up in two little sentences.

222
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,130
So then what happens?

223
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,980
I think it's extremely interesting.

224
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,310
So before Adam and eve figure
out that they're naked,

225
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,540
they're cruising around the garden.

226
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,430
Having a fine time doing
whatever they want.

227
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:19,170
They don't take any
thoughts for the future,

228
00:10:19,171 --> 00:10:19,600
right?

229
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,150
I don't have a prefrontal cortex.

230
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:26,330
They're living in a in a paradox lists
environment like an animal lives.

231
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:28,451
Well,

232
00:10:28,451 --> 00:10:30,550
what happens after they
become self conscious?

233
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,713
Well,

234
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,860
prior to this,

235
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,690
Adam's walking around with God,

236
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:35,230
right,

237
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:36,790
and you think about what that means.

238
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:37,930
It means something like this.

239
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,820
An animal isn't in the world of good
and evil and animal nature points out is

240
00:10:42,821 --> 00:10:43,870
beyond good and evil,

241
00:10:43,871 --> 00:10:44,360
right?

242
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,360
Enraptured in entirely by the actions
of automatic instinct governed by

243
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:52,870
processes that are
completely transcendent.

244
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,530
The animals,

245
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,720
nothing but a force of nature.

246
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,090
There is no opposition between
the animal in the world.

247
00:10:58,091 --> 00:10:59,440
The animal is the world,

248
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:03,590
and just as in the case of the animal,

249
00:11:03,591 --> 00:11:05,450
prior to the eating of the apple,

250
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,120
Adam walks around the garden with God.

251
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:13,180
There's no discontinuity between him and
the and the transcendent world as such,

252
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,880
but as soon as he becomes naked,

253
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,520
he hides well.

254
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:20,354
Why?

255
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,751
Well,

256
00:11:20,751 --> 00:11:22,220
that doesn't need to be answered.

257
00:11:22,221 --> 00:11:23,420
All you have to think about it.

258
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,540
Why would you hide if
you know you're naked?

259
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,020
Well,

260
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,860
it's simple.

261
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,740
You'll hide because you
think you can get hurt.

262
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:35,890
You think that whatever you are is so
vulnerable that if it shows itself to the

263
00:11:36,711 --> 00:11:38,870
transcendent to others,

264
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,160
to the natural world,

265
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,870
that something terrible will happen,

266
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,890
and then you think,

267
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,161
well,

268
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:45,230
that's a pretty logical presupposition,

269
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:45,920
right?

270
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,753
Look at us.

271
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,270
So God comes cruising around
the garden after Adam and Eve,

272
00:11:55,300 --> 00:12:00,300
the apple in the cool of the day and
Adam and Eve hide themselves among the

273
00:12:01,811 --> 00:12:04,480
trees of the garden and God says to Adam,

274
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,123
Hey,

275
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,690
where are you?

276
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,763
Adam says,

277
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,110
I heard your voice,

278
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:14,860
and I was afraid because I
was naked and I hid myself,

279
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,070
and that story has bottomless depth
because it means something like this.

280
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,380
At the beginning of genesis,

281
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:26,890
there's this notion that there is a
transcendent relationship between the

282
00:12:26,891 --> 00:12:28,000
individual and God,

283
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:28,271
right?

284
00:12:28,271 --> 00:12:31,180
The identity of logo 70 individual,

285
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,111
right?

286
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:33,070
I know it shouldn't by the way,

287
00:12:33,071 --> 00:12:36,970
that our entire idea of
intrinsic human right,

288
00:12:36,971 --> 00:12:41,971
it's predicated on it as we've been at
some pains to demonstrate a relationship

289
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:47,131
between the limited and the limitless
eradicated by the dawn of self

290
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:48,780
consciousness.

291
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:49,613
What does that mean?

292
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:49,751
Well,

293
00:12:49,751 --> 00:12:53,020
let's say you have a destiny
just for the sake of argument,

294
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:53,620
right?

295
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:58,360
Because you are a being with a tremendous
history and an unbelievable potential.

296
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,000
So let's say you have a destiny
just for the sake of argument,

297
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,320
what would cause you to
hide from that destiny?

298
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,280
Well,

299
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:07,113
obviously

300
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:11,410
your own reflections on
your mortal vulnerability,

301
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:11,770
right?

302
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:16,770
How could I be characterized by any
transcendent power whatsoever when I'm

303
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,180
susceptible to social alienation,

304
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:22,690
right?

305
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:27,690
When I have this body which is capable
of terrifying degeneration that will

306
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:32,440
eventually decay into old edge
and that is bounded by death.

307
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:37,620
How could I be good for anything which
is precisely what this little story says,

308
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,960
and so God figures out that Adam and
eve ate the fruit and that's pretty

309
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:46,390
decisive move because once you wake up,

310
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,260
sorry,

311
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,093
you're awake,

312
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,203
and he says,

313
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:51,010
and this is not an injunction,

314
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,873
by the way,

315
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,020
this is a description,

316
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,273
all right,

317
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800
you've done it now unto the woman.

318
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,191
He says,

319
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:01,390
I will greatly multiply the Isaura night
conception in sorrow shalt thou bring

320
00:14:01,391 --> 00:14:02,230
forth children.

321
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,453
Why?

322
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,743
Why?

323
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,913
Well,

324
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,720
we have a big CORTEX,

325
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,860
right?

326
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,693
Really big.

327
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,360
It grew fast and what that meant is
that there was an evolutionary arms race

328
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,580
between skull size,

329
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,310
date of birth,

330
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,400
and pelvic diameter girth.

331
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:24,190
The wider the pelvis,

332
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,510
the less effectively you
can walk a larger the skull.

333
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,560
The bigger the brain,

334
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,180
the younger the baby,

335
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,160
the more dependent and vulnerable.

336
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,380
So what do we have in
the case of human beings,

337
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:40,450
the female human pelvis has already
stretched to the limits of its structural

338
00:14:40,451 --> 00:14:41,200
capacity.

339
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,910
So the hole in its center is as big
as it can get without compromising the

340
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:50,260
structural integrity of the pelvis while
still allowing women to walk and run.

341
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:53,120
So how have babies adapted to that?

342
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:53,431
Oh,

343
00:14:53,431 --> 00:14:54,320
that's simple.

344
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:57,950
A mammo of our size should have
a gestation period of two years.

345
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,960
We have a gestation period of nine months.

346
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:03,740
Why you got to get the damn baby
out before it's head gets too big?

347
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,760
What does that mean?

348
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,380
Well,

349
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:06,410
it means it's vulnerable,

350
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:06,740
right?

351
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,930
Nothing more vulnerable than a baby human
being except maybe a baby kitten room.

352
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:11,360
Right?

353
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,400
But it's got a pouch to hide in at least.

354
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,110
So we're born vulnerable,

355
00:15:15,111 --> 00:15:15,441
right?

356
00:15:15,441 --> 00:15:17,360
Characteristic of the birth of the hero.

357
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,190
Who suffers in childbirth?

358
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,060
Women.

359
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,893
Why?

360
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:21,740
Baby skulls?

361
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,090
Just a little bit too big,

362
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,000
has to be crunched and
compacted during birth,

363
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:26,510
right?

364
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,260
The skull bones aren't joined together
so that the baby's head can be squashed

365
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,290
and visibly deformed during
the process of birth.

366
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,820
Prior to the 20th century,

367
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:37,340
what was the death rate
among women giving birth?

368
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,240
One in three,

369
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,320
one in five.

370
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,400
Terrible.

371
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,233
Why?

372
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,670
That's the price you pay
for self consciousness

373
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,140
and I desire shall be to the
husband and he shall rule over thee.

374
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,640
This is not an injunction.

375
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,050
This is a description.

376
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,510
The additional burden that
dependent offspring place on women,

377
00:15:58,570 --> 00:16:00,070
place them at a disadvantage.

378
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,890
What's the consequence of that
from a historical perspective?

379
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,251
Well,

380
00:16:03,251 --> 00:16:05,590
any feminist can answer that question,

381
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,513
right?

382
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,990
Add on to Adam.

383
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:09,441
He said,

384
00:16:09,441 --> 00:16:14,240
because you listened to your wife and
have eaten the tree of which I commanded

385
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:14,391
thee,

386
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:14,691
saying,

387
00:16:14,691 --> 00:16:15,524
don't eat that.

388
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,460
Cursed is the ground for the sake in
sorrow shall though he'd have it for all

389
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,293
the days of thy life.

390
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,321
Fair enough,

391
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:21,830
right?

392
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,330
Once you're self conscious,

393
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,223
you work.

394
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:24,800
Why?

395
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:24,951
Well,

396
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:25,970
animals don't work.

397
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,380
Why do people work well?

398
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:28,550
Because we know,

399
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:28,911
right,

400
00:16:28,911 --> 00:16:31,520
we know that if it isn't
gonna happen today,

401
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,040
it's going to happen tomorrow and if
it isn't going to happen tomorrow,

402
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:37,310
what's going to happen next week or
the week after the month after the year

403
00:16:37,311 --> 00:16:39,860
after and we bloody well better prepare.

404
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,120
So that's what we do.

405
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:46,270
Constantly prepare and prepare and prepare
so we're not bounded and motivated by

406
00:16:47,511 --> 00:16:50,630
what's happening from second to
second like the animal is in.

407
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:51,940
It's still paradisical state.

408
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:56,390
We're constantly tormented by an
endless string of what if questions,

409
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,250
because when we look at the unknown,

410
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,400
we can see the possibility for everything
including our own punishment or own

411
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,310
tournament,

412
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,570
our own demise,

413
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:09,860
and so we're motivated like no
other animal to work and so we work.

414
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,130
But that is another aspect that
alienates us from paradise.

415
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:14,023
Wellbeing

416
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,780
thorns and thistles shall it
bring forth for the analysis.

417
00:17:17,781 --> 00:17:21,550
You'll eat the herb of the field in the
sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread

418
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,540
til thou return unto the ground for
Dust Thou art and unto dust shall thou

419
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:26,374
return,

420
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,490
right?

421
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:28,031
Therefore,

422
00:17:28,031 --> 00:17:31,690
the Lord God sent him forth from the
garden of Eden to till the ground from

423
00:17:31,691 --> 00:17:32,620
whence he was taken.

424
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,490
So he drove out the man and he placed
at the east of the garden of Eden

425
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:41,140
Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned
every way to keep the way of the tree

426
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:41,950
of life.
