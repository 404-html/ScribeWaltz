1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,003
So here we are.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:09,150
Well,

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,390
so I made a case tonight.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:11,890
I'll go over it.

5
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,760
What's the case?

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,290
The postmodernist are wrong.

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:20,810
They're philosophically naive.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,670
They're right about an infinite number
of interpretations and wrong about a

9
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:29,540
finite number of viable
interpretations and that's like that's,

10
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,890
that's death.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,310
That's the end of postmodern is theory
and that's not the only way in which

12
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:34,821
they're wrong.

13
00:00:34,821 --> 00:00:36,020
They're wrong in a bunch of other ways,

14
00:00:36,021 --> 00:00:37,250
but they're more subsidiary.

15
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,750
The Marxists,

16
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:42,140
they're not just wrong,

17
00:00:42,141 --> 00:00:44,660
they're wrong and murderous or wrong,

18
00:00:44,661 --> 00:00:46,190
murderous and genocidal.

19
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:50,380
Unless you think murderers and
genocidal doesn't mean wrong and you,

20
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:53,960
you can think that there's lots of would
be revolutionaries who would be happy

21
00:00:53,961 --> 00:00:57,980
to have blood running in the street if
they had their chance for revenge and the

22
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:01,790
opportunity to move up the
hierarchy of tyranny so you can,

23
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,760
you don't have to think that
murder and genocide is wrong,

24
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:07,320
especially if the right people
are murdered in genocide,

25
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:07,581
right?

26
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:08,750
That's actually part of it,

27
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,610
part of the whole equation.

28
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,810
But if you're willing to think that
murder and genocide on a mass scale across

29
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:15,561
many cultures,

30
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:17,900
over many decades is wrong,

31
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,570
then Marxism is wrong.

32
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,600
And the postmodernist don't
get to just come along.

33
00:01:23,601 --> 00:01:28,550
And a dog Marxism as a matter of sleight
of hand because they're Marx's theory

34
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:30,830
didn't work out and they
figured out a rationalization.

35
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,890
They don't get to get away with
that because it's too dangerous.

36
00:01:33,891 --> 00:01:35,540
It's too dangerous to the rest of us,

37
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,340
and we don't.

38
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
And it isn't necessary for us who are
trying with the small part of our hearts

39
00:01:46,331 --> 00:01:51,331
that might be oriented towards the good
to allow people who are manipulating us

40
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,290
with historical ignorance
and philosophical sleight
of hand to render us so God

41
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,560
damn guilty about what our
ancestors may or may not have done.

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,380
So that we allow our
shame and our guilt to be,

43
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,680
to be used as tools to manipulate us into
accepting a future that we do not want

44
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:08,824
to have.

45
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:12,720
And that's that

46
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:16,850
[inaudible].
