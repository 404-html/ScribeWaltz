1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:06,581
Oh,

2
00:00:06,581 --> 00:00:10,390
I'm leaving Patriot on January 16th.

3
00:00:10,391 --> 00:00:15,391
Some of you may know that that's I
suppose in protest over their treatment of

4
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:17,890
Carl Benjamin,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:18,790
uh,

6
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,100
perhaps better known as Sargon of the cad.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,323
Um,

8
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:27,470
patron like many companies seems to
believe that their role now is to act as

9
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,420
sensor for speech patterns
or speech content that they
regarded as unacceptable.

10
00:00:34,751 --> 00:00:39,120
And I think that they made
a big mistake with Sargon.

11
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:44,130
And so both Dave Rubin and I and also
Sam Harris decided to leave patriotic and

12
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,650
that's going to be official
as of January 15th.

13
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:52,240
So those of you who are
my Patriot on subscribers,

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,030
if you're interested in
continuing with that subscription,

15
00:00:55,031 --> 00:01:00,031
you can go to my
website@jordanbpeterson.com and
there's a support button there

16
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:05,590
in the menu and you can use that system.

17
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,460
I'm also trying to design a
system that at least in principle,

18
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:12,820
might work as a reasonable
replacement for patriotic.

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,450
Um,

20
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,590
that's a couple of months away,

21
00:01:14,591 --> 00:01:16,140
but we're working hard on it to,

22
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,590
we're getting legal advice.

23
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:21,940
We're going to set up multiple payment
channels so that it won't be easy for

24
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:25,390
people to be kicked off
by credit card companies,

25
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:27,190
or let's call them,

26
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,060
um,

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,440
virtue signaling,

28
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,030
uh,

29
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:35,080
ethical types who think that their
role is to police free speech.

30
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:39,610
So I think this is a very bad precedent
that patron is set and the credit card

31
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:40,181
companies too,

32
00:01:40,181 --> 00:01:45,181
I can't imagine it's difficult to imagine
a more dystopian scenario than to have

33
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:46,624
the,

34
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:47,080
uh,

35
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,910
large tech companies in combination with
the credit card companies monitor your

36
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:56,911
spending to decide when what you're
doing is sufficiently ethical by their,

37
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,430
by the standards of the
people who are running their,

38
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,590
let's call them safety and security,

39
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:04,360
speech monitoring programs.

40
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,190
It's just such a terrible idea.
