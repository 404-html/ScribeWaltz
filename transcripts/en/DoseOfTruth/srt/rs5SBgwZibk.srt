00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,070
Hey,

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,430
so last week you talked about how you
hated people ask you if you believe in God

3
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:13,770
and or do you believe miracles are,

4
00:00:13,771 --> 00:00:15,000
you just liked those questions at least,

5
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,280
but you also talked about how,

6
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,430
and I want to put words in your mouth,

7
00:00:18,431 --> 00:00:20,540
but I think he said
something about the ideas,

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:24,690
an empirical evidence for religious
experiences or spiritual experiences.

9
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:29,930
And I wonder how those two ideas like
can a spiritual existence or can a

10
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:32,990
spiritual experience exist
without God or how did I,

11
00:00:32,991 --> 00:00:33,824
I had,

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:34,943
who knows,

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,353
who knows?

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,170
You know,

15
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,003
I don't know what.

16
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:39,390
I don't know what to make of that.

17
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:39,661
I mean,

18
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:40,051
you could,

19
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:42,930
it depends on what you're
willing to accept as proof.

20
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:45,780
I suppose that's where things get tricky,

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:46,561
you know,

22
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:51,150
if you have to demonstrate the existence
of God objectively than subjective

23
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,880
experiences of the
transcendent are irrelevant.

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,380
Right?

25
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:56,213
But,

26
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,860
and that's a perfectly
reasonable standpoint.

27
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,570
If your initial presupposition is the
only thing that has actual existence is

28
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:05,850
those things that can be
demonstrated objectively.

29
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,740
And I'm not putting that down.

30
00:01:07,741 --> 00:01:10,110
Like that's a powerful methodology.

31
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,560
Our technology is basically
dependent on the acceptance,

32
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:16,200
at least a partial
acceptance of those axioms.

33
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,710
But I also think that it's difficult
for me to deny the existence of these

34
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:27,900
patterns of thinking that seemed
to exist cross culturally,

35
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,470
like the existence of the
representation of the Dragon,

36
00:01:31,471 --> 00:01:32,304
for example.

37
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:37,320
Especially given that I
can see an evolutionary
rationale for the emergence of

38
00:01:37,321 --> 00:01:38,580
these representations.

39
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,080
So,

40
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:45,080
and then there's also the indisputable
fact that religious experiences are

41
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:50,640
accessible to people through
a number of different avenues.

42
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,680
Now,

43
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,630
and one of the things I mentioned
when I discussed this before as well,

44
00:01:55,631 --> 00:01:56,221
you could say,

45
00:01:56,221 --> 00:01:56,401
well,

46
00:01:56,401 --> 00:02:00,690
those are no different than
experiences of psychopathology,

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,580
but they are different
because the experiences of
psychopathology damage people,

48
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:10,350
where's the evidence is that
the transcendent experiences
actually help people.

49
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,820
So unless you can,

50
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,050
unless you're willing to say,

51
00:02:13,051 --> 00:02:13,231
well,

52
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:16,950
there are some forms of psychopathological
experience that actually facilitate

53
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,580
health,

54
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,770
which is a possibility.

55
00:02:19,771 --> 00:02:20,310
But you know,

56
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,143
I think you're,

57
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,180
you're pushing your hypo yearly
hypothesis at that point.
