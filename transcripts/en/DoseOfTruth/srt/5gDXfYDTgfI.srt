1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Wow,

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,870
the next part of the story,
there's some parallels with Abraham and

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:16,880
that's built into the narrative,
I think because Isaac is Abraham's

4
00:00:16,881 --> 00:00:21,860
descendant and so we have to keep the
narrative echoing forward.

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:24,020
Otherwise it loses its,
it's continuity.

6
00:00:24,021 --> 00:00:27,230
And um,
there was a famine in the land that

7
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:32,060
Isaac Isaacson and God tells him to stay
the course anyways,

8
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,480
repeating the promise.
He,

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,560
he gave Abraham,
although Isaac goes to Abdel Malek,

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,490
also telling the king and people that
Rebecca was his sister,

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,860
which is exactly what Abraham did when
he went to Egypt.

12
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:45,350
And so there's another echo there of the
same,

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,730
the same.
It's as if the story is being told for a

14
00:00:49,731 --> 00:00:52,640
second time essentially.
And that's supposed to remind you of

15
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:54,080
the,
of the previous story,

16
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:59,290
but they're careless.
The king sees that Rebecca and Isaac are

17
00:00:59,331 --> 00:01:01,610
intimate together.
And um,

18
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,770
luckily he doesn't have them put to
death.

19
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:06,920
He just tells everybody in the kingdom
that there to be left the hell alone.

20
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:12,250
And then Isaac prospers in that land,
just like Abraham did in Egypt until the

21
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,310
Philistines asked him to leave.
He's just getting too rich and powerful.

22
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:18,110
Things are going too well for him,
so he's asked to.

23
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,170
He's asked to leave.
Now,

24
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,890
in the meantime,
Esau gets married and this is a funny

25
00:01:24,891 --> 00:01:28,130
little story.
He says he marries two women who give

26
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:30,690
grief to Isaac and Rebecca,
so they,

27
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,740
whoever he saw Mary's,
they're not popular with his,

28
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,140
with their in laws,
not in the least.

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,040
That actually becomes relevant a little
later because they drive rebecca quite

30
00:01:40,041 --> 00:01:42,200
mad.
So I get a kick out of that because

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,520
that's very common.
You know,

32
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:48,521
it's not easy to integrate new people
into your family and hope that that will

33
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,900
go smoothly.
It's actually one of the real

34
00:01:50,901 --> 00:01:52,310
catastrophes in life,
right?

35
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,400
You have a kid,
maybe you get along with them and maybe

36
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,800
you don't,
but let's assume you do,

37
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:02,210
but then they marry someone that you
just don't like and or maybe you think

38
00:02:02,211 --> 00:02:03,410
is wrong for them.
I mean,

39
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:05,840
that's really rough.
That's what are you going to do about

40
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:06,790
that?
You know,

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,890
because you're,
you're basically screwed both ways.

42
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:12,630
If you have the person you love around,
then you have to put up with this

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,960
horrendous creature that they allied
themselves with.

44
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:17,600
And if you,
if you get rid of them completely,

45
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,700
well then you know you don't have your
child anymore.

46
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:22,040
So it's very,
very difficult position.

47
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,860
And so that's another example of the
realism,

48
00:02:24,861 --> 00:02:25,910
I think,
of the stories.

49
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,303
Now,
Isaac,

50
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,760
who's hypothetically on his deathbed
asks Esl to hunt for Venison because he

51
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:35,600
likes venison and he's happy that his
son is a hunter and Rebecca overhears

52
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:39,710
this so she conspires with Jacob,
um,

53
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:44,970
to,
to slaughter to small goats and make his

54
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:49,100
father is some stew because he wants to
make him stew out of venison.

55
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,170
But Rebecca,
who's being,

56
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,040
I would say,
let's say slightly deceitful or horribly

57
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,410
lying that would be more accurate.
Um,

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,420
she conspires with Jacob.
Jacob kills two little goats kids and

59
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:02,950
boils,
APA stew.

60
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:04,430
And then he puts on some,
uh,

61
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,110
are goatskins because Esau was a hairy
character.

62
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:12,730
And,
and Rebecca Dresses Isaac in east

63
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:15,310
clothing because Isaac can't see very
well at this point.

64
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:20,311
And so then Jacob goes into his father
with the stew and he's trying to

65
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,350
disguise his voice,
but it doesn't work very well.

66
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,630
And so Isaac asks them to come close and
Jacob puts out his arm with the goat

67
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:31,210
skin on it and,
and Isaac smells him too.

68
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:35,710
And he smells like Esl and,
which maybe wasn't the best thing,

69
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,120
but,
um,

70
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,470
and feels like,
um,

71
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:39,870
and so,
uh,

72
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:42,130
because Isaac thinks he's on his
deathbed,

73
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,530
he decides to deliver a blessing to
hypothetically to Esol.

74
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:50,800
And so,
but it's Jacob.

75
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,950
And so that's a big deal too because the
blessing is actually,

76
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,170
as I said before with these ancient
people,

77
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:58,900
it appeared as though once you said
something,

78
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,910
you didn't get to take it back,
you couldn't say,

79
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,250
well look,
you've deceived me.

80
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:06,740
So it doesn't count.
It was like I did.

81
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:10,390
They weren't maybe as
as

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,990
well,
week might be one way of thinking about

83
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:15,460
it,
but another way is they weren't quite as

84
00:04:15,461 --> 00:04:16,990
attentive to context,
you know,

85
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:20,260
because if I make you a deal and then it
turns out that you betrayed me,

86
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:24,820
I may feel that the deal is no longer
valid because the assumption was you

87
00:04:24,821 --> 00:04:28,360
were being honest to be given within
that violates the whole spirit.

88
00:04:28,361 --> 00:04:31,240
But that isn't how these people thought.
They said once he promised man,

89
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,560
you promised,
and that was that.

90
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,160
So Isaac Blessed Jacob.
He says that God give you the dew of

91
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,320
heaven and the fatness of the earth and
plenty of corn and wine.

92
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:43,810
Let people serve you and nations bow
down to you.

93
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:47,350
Be Lord over their brethren that's going
to be rough on Esl.

94
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,850
Let thy mother's sons bow down to the
cursive.

95
00:04:49,851 --> 00:04:53,240
Be everyone that curse if the blessing,
he blesses blessing.

96
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,160
And so there's a credit remarkable
painting of that.

97
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,820
So there's Rebecca,
she's looking pretty old and Isaac's

98
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:06,700
looking pretty blind and Jacob's taking
directions from his mother and we might

99
00:05:06,701 --> 00:05:09,850
say he's perhaps a little old to be
taking more or lessons from his mother,

100
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:13,270
especially given how she's acting.
And so it's a pretty ugly scene

101
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,210
altogether,
especially that we also know that Jacob

102
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,600
already tricked Esau out of his
birthright.

103
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:23,110
And so now he's like taking the
birthright and he's taken the blessing.

104
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:28,410
And so as I said that Jacob,
he turns out to be the father of Israel.

105
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,810
It's like he's a reprehensible
character.

106
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:35,770
These are major league betrayals that
he's engaging and it's not trivial.

107
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,430
He really,
really pulls the rug out from under his

108
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:40,570
brother and you know,
you could say,

109
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:43,660
well Esl is not as awake as he might be.
You know,

110
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:48,080
he's kind of a wild man and fair enough.
But it certainly seems to me that,

111
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:52,360
that the predominant moral error falls
on Jacob's shoulders.

112
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,790
It's very treacherous behavior.
What he's doing.

113
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,780
So then Esau shows up and he's got a
Nice Steg for his dad and it's like

114
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,180
little late for that.
And he states that his brother was

115
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,600
rightly named Jacob,
which means supplanter because he's been

116
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:12,680
deceived twice and Isaac says,
Isaac answered.

117
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,950
He's,
he's asking for Esl,

118
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:17,840
was asking fundamentally if there's
anything at all leftover for him.

119
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,500
And Isaac can't give him the same
blessing because that's already been

120
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:23,360
given.
So he has to think of something else.

121
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,230
And Isaac says,
behold,

122
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:27,800
I,
I've made him my Lord,

123
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,470
and all his brothers I've given to him
for servant,

124
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,990
which includes you and with corn and
wine,

125
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:33,900
have I sustained him?

126
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,610
And what shall I now doing tv my son.
And Esau said unto his father,

127
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:42,230
how have you even one blessing for me,
my father bless me also.

128
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:44,600
And An esaw lifted up his voice and
wept.

129
00:06:44,601 --> 00:06:46,550
And you know,
we already know that Esau is a pretty

130
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,400
tough guy by all appearances.
And you know,

131
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:51,290
he's out there hunting on his own and
camping.

132
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,200
And it's like he's no pushover.
And the fact that this reduces him to

133
00:06:54,201 --> 00:06:57,800
tears is an indication of the magnitude
of the betrayal.

134
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,010
And Isaac says,
behold,

135
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,020
thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the
earth and of the dew of heaven,

136
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:05,420
from above and by Thy Sword,
thou shall live,

137
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:09,080
and thou shalt serve your brother,
and it shall come to pass when you will

138
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:11,150
have the domain Indian and you'll break
the yolk.

139
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:14,600
His yoke off from died neck.
And the Esol hated Jacob because of the

140
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,730
blessing where with his father blessed
him.

141
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,630
And Esau said in his heart,
the days of mourning for my father are

142
00:07:20,631 --> 00:07:23,210
at hand.
Then I will slay my brother Jacob.

143
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,680
So fundamentally,
you know,

144
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,630
if Isaac dies or when he dies,
then we'll mourn for him.

145
00:07:29,631 --> 00:07:34,631
And then Jacob better look the hell out
because it's like it's serious death

146
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,530
coming his way.
