1
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,210
I was wondering what your thoughts are
on meditation and if you practice it

2
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:15,740
yourself?
Well,

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:20,980
that's a good question.
I think I practiced it a lot and look,

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,270
when I listened to someone,
or even when I listened to myself,

5
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,200
but let's say when I listened to someone
in my clinical practice,

6
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:35,440
I think I do it in a meditative way in
that I sit and listen and I wait for

7
00:00:36,591 --> 00:00:39,920
thoughts to appear rather than
voluntarily thinking.

8
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,990
So I clear my mind.
I try to keep my agenda's off the table,

9
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,610
my agendas,
whatever they are,

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,380
except that I want the best for my
client in this hour and the best say by

11
00:00:51,381 --> 00:00:54,470
their definition.
And mine jointly decided because that's

12
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,500
all part of discussion.
And then I listened very carefully and I

13
00:00:57,501 --> 00:01:02,501
wait for the reactions that occur within
me and then I share them.

14
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,660
And I think that's a meditative
exercise.

15
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,670
I think it's different than voluntary
thinking.

16
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:08,750
It's like,
you know,

17
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:13,190
there's a statement in the new testament
that says a knock and the door will

18
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:15,080
open,
ask and you will receive.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,610
Now
that's a meditative,

20
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,090
that's a,
that's a call to a meditative mode of

21
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:24,500
existence.
It's like,

22
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,420
well,
often what I do,

23
00:01:26,421 --> 00:01:28,700
for example,
if I want to solve a problem is I,

24
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:33,170
if I have a problem with my own behavior
or maybe I'm having problems in my

25
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:36,740
family is all go sit on a badge or a
chair and they'll think,

26
00:01:36,741 --> 00:01:39,920
okay,
I would like an answer to this.

27
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,050
I would like to know what the answer to
this.

28
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:46,010
And I'm willing to accept whatever
answer is appropriate.

29
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,920
And cause usually you get an answer that
you don't like.

30
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:50,060
Right?
If it's a real answer,

31
00:01:50,061 --> 00:01:52,490
it's not something that you're going to
be all that happy about and then

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,600
magically so to speak and answer
appears.

33
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,790
And I think that's a meditative practice
and

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,590
the meditative practices part to clear
your mind of your proximal concerns and

35
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:13,001
to concentrate more deeply on what might
be regarded as eternally true and to

36
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:19,061
open yourself up for a revelation in
relationship to what is eternally true.

37
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:24,650
And I found that incredibly effective.
And I think that you can live like that.

38
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,870
Um,
you just have to abandon your proximal

39
00:02:29,871 --> 00:02:31,460
pursuits.
Now in my new book,

40
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:35,540
again I wrote a chapter about that
called do what is meaningful and what

41
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,090
not,
what is expedient and it's a bit of a

42
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,290
meditation on the sermon on the mount I
would say because the essential message

43
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:45,290
in the sermon on the Mount,
which is the foundational document of

44
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:47,360
Western civilization as far as I'm
concerned,

45
00:02:47,361 --> 00:02:51,560
essentially,
is that you should orient yourself

46
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:56,300
ultimately towards the highest good that
you can conceive.

47
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,250
And I've tried to formulate that and I
mentioned that earlier in this Q and a

48
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:04,270
that the highest good that you can
conceive it should be something like

49
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:08,920
what would be good for you now and good
for you tomorrow and next week and next

50
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,770
month and next year.
So good for you and all the future use

51
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:15,220
that might exist.
And also at the same time,

52
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,280
good for your family and good for the
community,

53
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,630
you know,
conceptualized narrowly and broadly and

54
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:25,840
good now for your family and the
community and then also into the future.

55
00:03:25,841 --> 00:03:27,160
So it's something like that.
It's,

56
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,840
it's a balance of goods that stretches
across time and you have to decide if

57
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:35,320
that's what you really want.
And my sense would be you haven't got

58
00:03:35,321 --> 00:03:37,780
anything better to aim at and that you
should aim at.

59
00:03:37,781 --> 00:03:40,280
The best thing that you can aim at for a
whole bunch of reasons.

60
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,590
One is if you don't aim at something,
you're certainly not going to attain it.

61
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:47,800
And if you're going to aim at something,
why not aim for the best thing that you

62
00:03:47,801 --> 00:03:50,680
can think of?
And if you do aim for the best thing

63
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:53,200
that you can think of and you make any
progress whatsoever,

64
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:57,040
it's extremely exciting.
And if you do aim for the best thing you

65
00:03:57,041 --> 00:04:00,910
can think of and you make some progress,
then it's very life affirming and

66
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:04,780
validating and that sort of quells your
anxiety and your existential pain.

67
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,560
And so he get yourself properly
oriented.

68
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:13,150
And the sermon on the mount basically
suggest that you do that by orienting

69
00:04:13,151 --> 00:04:16,450
yourself towards God.
And for the psychological purposes,

70
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:21,010
we could conceptualize God as the
highest good that you can conceive of.

71
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:25,090
And then you concentrate on the day.
And so you can get up in the morning and

72
00:04:25,091 --> 00:04:25,930
you can think,
well,

73
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:28,630
I want the best possible thing to
happen.

74
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:32,740
And so what is it that I should do to
serve that?

75
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,340
And if you ask that genuinely,
and that's in a meditative way,

76
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,530
I will say you get an answer to that
right away.

77
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:39,640
Now,
the problem is,

78
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,700
is that it's usually an answer that
involves some kind of sacrifice.

79
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,140
It means that instead of doing what you
would like to do impulsively right now,

80
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,630
you're more likely to have to go do
something.

81
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,210
You know that you've been avoiding.
And that's difficult.

82
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,470
But if you do that,
then you'll have some,

83
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:59,170
you know,
you can also leave in your day with some

84
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,350
pleasure,
uh,

85
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,800
to reward yourself for doing something
difficult.

86
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:04,390
But if you,
if you live that way,

87
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:06,880
then I think that your,
your house stays clean in,

88
00:05:06,881 --> 00:05:11,290
your family stays organized and the
state doesn't rock and all that,

89
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,600
and all that's extremely,
extremely good.

90
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,590
So.
