1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:07,340
Okay.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,861
All right.

3
00:00:07,861 --> 00:00:10,140
What the hell address the Jewish question?

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,790
That's a hell of a thing to ask.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,200
So that's Jacqueline turn,

6
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:13,620
you know,

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,480
I mean really that's a
hell of a thing to ask,

8
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:17,190
but I will say something about it.

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,450
You know,

10
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,740
and I've thought about this a lot.

11
00:00:19,741 --> 00:00:23,040
So there is evidence that Ashkenazi Jews,

12
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:24,960
so those are Jews of European heritage,

13
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,650
have iqs that are about 15 points
higher than the population average.

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,240
So that's a lot 15 points.

15
00:00:30,241 --> 00:00:33,270
It's about the average difference between
the typical high school student and

16
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:34,800
the typical state college student.

17
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,783
It's a lot.

18
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:37,920
And one of the things that means is,

19
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:41,460
so imagine there's two distributions and
that they overlap and that the Jewish

20
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:42,294
one is,

21
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,223
uh,

22
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:48,290
is the mean is as one 15 so the whole
distribution has shifted to the right.

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,440
What that means is if you go up into the
Higher Iq strata one 31 45 way the hell

24
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:55,740
up there,

25
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,490
that Jewish people are overwhelmingly
overrepresented at the high end of the

26
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,480
Eicu distribution.

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,890
Now the price they pay for that is some
increased propensity for neurological

28
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,491
diseases.

29
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:08,630
That seems to be associated in
some sense with that heightened Iq.

30
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:09,480
Now,

31
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:09,721
you know,

32
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:11,490
the science on this isn't settled but,

33
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,510
but it,

34
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,120
it's reasonably solid.

35
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,200
It,

36
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,480
it'll given the standards of such things.

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:18,991
Okay,

38
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,991
so Jews are going to be over represented
at the high end of cognitively complex

39
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,344
disciplines.

40
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:26,580
So then I would say,

41
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:27,870
and that's the case,

42
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:31,560
like they're way overrepresented among
like outstanding scientists and among

43
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:33,840
Nobel prize winners and so forth.

44
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,430
And so you know,

45
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:36,510
people look and they think,

46
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:40,770
well why are there a disproportionate
number of Jewish people in positions of

47
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,161
authority?

48
00:01:41,161 --> 00:01:41,491
And they say,

49
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:41,671
well,

50
00:01:41,671 --> 00:01:43,230
it must be a conspiracy.

51
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,011
You know,

52
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:46,260
it must be systemic in some sense.

53
00:01:46,261 --> 00:01:46,591
It's like,

54
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:47,160
no,

55
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:51,360
it can be simply accounted for by
that relatively large Iq differential.

56
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,850
Now the next criticism would be,

57
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:54,540
well,

58
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,730
don't the Jews tend to lean left?

59
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,080
Well first you might say,

60
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,620
well,

61
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:58,950
you know,

62
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:03,950
given what happened in Nazi Germany to
the degree that that was right wing as we

63
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:04,771
discussed earlier,

64
00:02:04,771 --> 00:02:06,720
that's the nationalism and ethnocentrism.

65
00:02:06,721 --> 00:02:09,030
It's hardly surprising that they might,

66
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:09,691
you know,

67
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:13,380
in this historical period of time
tend to move towards the left.

68
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,000
But more importantly than that,

69
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:20,370
I queue is associated with trait
openness and trade openness is a strong

70
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:22,860
predictor predictor of
political liberalism.

71
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,233
So,

72
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,820
and it's the strongest predictor
of political liberalism.

73
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,350
So you know,

74
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,570
it's very difficult.

75
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,250
So that's what I have to say about that.

76
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:32,611
It's like,

77
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:33,930
and the other thing I would say is,

78
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,040
you know,

79
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,930
the fact that there's a population is
subpopulation of people who are much

80
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:41,190
smarter than average,

81
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,300
not on average,

82
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:42,750
right?

83
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:43,540
On average,

84
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,970
I've got to get that straight on average
is actually of great benefit to the

85
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,860
rest of us because what do you want?

86
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:51,060
Fewer geniuses,

87
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:55,590
fewer people with Iqs
of 145 or 160 that's,

88
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,790
and you know,

89
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,520
and it's no conspiracy that
people who are smarter,

90
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,360
higher up in competence hierarchies
because accused the best predictor of

91
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,420
movement up in a complex
car competence hierarchy.

92
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,800
So there,

93
00:03:08,801 --> 00:03:10,360
I've addressed the Jewish question.

94
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:15,510
It's like it's a confusion
between ethnicity and and
Iq as far as I'm concerned.

95
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,620
So I'll probably get like painted six
different shades of black for that answer.

96
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:21,454
But it's,

97
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,840
I've thought about a long time.

98
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:24,580
It's the best that I can manage.
