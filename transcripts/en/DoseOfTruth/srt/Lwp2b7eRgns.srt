1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,361
He said unto them,

2
00:00:07,361 --> 00:00:08,560
here I pray you this dream,

3
00:00:08,561 --> 00:00:09,790
which I have dreamed for.

4
00:00:09,791 --> 00:00:10,241
Behold,

5
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:11,080
we were binding,

6
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:12,580
we achieves in the field,

7
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:13,210
and Lo,

8
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:14,650
my sheaf arose.

9
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,761
And behold,

10
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:18,640
your sheaves stood round
about and bowed to my sheaf

11
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,110
and his,

12
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:23,861
and remember he's,

13
00:00:23,861 --> 00:00:24,081
yeah,

14
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:24,731
the young one,

15
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:25,200
right.

16
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:25,600
And,

17
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,820
and also the daughter
of the favorite wife,

18
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:28,890
which is another thing that's,

19
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,190
or the son of the favorite wife,

20
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:30,851
which is another thing,

21
00:00:30,851 --> 00:00:32,380
not really working in his favor.

22
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:33,790
And his brethren said to him,

23
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,950
Shalt Thou indeed reign over us,

24
00:00:35,951 --> 00:00:38,080
or shall dow indeed have dominion over us?

25
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,341
And they hated him,

26
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:41,680
yet the more for his
dreams and for his words,

27
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,240
while there there's a shock,

28
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,021
you know,

29
00:00:44,021 --> 00:00:45,370
that makes perfect sense.

30
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,540
So when it gets worse,

31
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,470
so you see here,

32
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,980
well there's the wheat
sheaves bowing there and uh,

33
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,780
and then you see this,

34
00:00:52,781 --> 00:00:53,800
what's going on here?

35
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,011
Well,

36
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,450
that's not the end of his,

37
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,280
let's call it grandiosity.

38
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:58,503
Um,

39
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,850
and there's an idea too,

40
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,060
and in the Old Testament,

41
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,440
especially in the stories of Joseph,

42
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,150
that if God sends you a dream twice,

43
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:05,020
he really means it.

44
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:06,970
And so I don't know if that's true,

45
00:01:06,971 --> 00:01:09,280
although I do know that
people have repeating dreams.

46
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,090
Um,

47
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,090
it might be true that a dream you have
twice is really trying to punch something

48
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:15,490
home.

49
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:15,761
You know,

50
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:20,170
it's certainly the case that recurrent
nightmares are meaningful and that

51
00:01:20,171 --> 00:01:25,171
recurrent nightmares are associated
quite tightly with decreased states of

52
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:25,901
mental health.

53
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:27,700
And that if you can treat the nightmare,

54
00:01:27,701 --> 00:01:28,990
which is often quite easy,

55
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:29,830
um,

56
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,663
by the way,

57
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,200
then the,

58
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,540
some of the mental health
problems will decrease.

59
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,750
So repeated dreams seem
to be important anyways,

60
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,660
he dreamed yet another dream and
told it to his brethren and said,

61
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,321
behold,

62
00:01:41,321 --> 00:01:45,070
I've had another dream and be
and behold the sun and the moon.

63
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:50,070
And the 11 stars bowed to me and he told
it to his father and to his brothers

64
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:52,540
and his father rebuked
him and said unto you,

65
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,170
unto him,

66
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,150
what is this dream that
thou history of shall I?

67
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:55,780
And My,

68
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,160
and your mother and your brothers indeed
come to bow down ourselves to the,

69
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:01,563
to the earth.

70
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,670
And his brothers envied him,

71
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:06,250
but his father observed to say,

72
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:07,631
well,

73
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:09,370
what the hell do you make
of something like that,

74
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:09,581
right?

75
00:02:09,581 --> 00:02:12,400
If someone tells you that it's like,

76
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,930
are they responsible for their dreams?

77
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:16,990
We don't really seem,

78
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:20,410
we don't really hold ourselves responsible
for are for the dreams we have at

79
00:02:20,411 --> 00:02:24,460
night and what do you make of a dream
is like one of the things that you've

80
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:25,060
pointed out,

81
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:29,080
this is where he differed
from Freud substantially is
Freud tended to think that

82
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:34,081
the dream had its meaning because it's
contents were acceptable to the conscious

83
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:36,460
mind and young said,

84
00:02:36,461 --> 00:02:36,641
no,

85
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:36,881
no,

86
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:37,900
you don't understand.

87
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:38,920
That's not what happens.

88
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:43,270
What happens is the dream is doing the
best it can to express something that the

89
00:02:43,271 --> 00:02:47,140
person doesn't yet really know and
young thought about the dream as a

90
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,670
manifestation of nature.

91
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:50,440
It wasn't associated with the ego at all.

92
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:54,310
It was just like you have a dream and
there were things happening in it.

93
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:56,440
The same way that when you
walk into a dinner party,

94
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:58,000
there are things happening there.

95
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:58,451
You know,

96
00:02:58,451 --> 00:02:59,284
it's not,

97
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:03,760
the dream isn't something that's subject
to your capacity for manipulation.

98
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:05,080
It's something that happens to you,

99
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:06,340
not something that you do.

100
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,530
And so,

101
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,190
so if someone has a dream like that,

102
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:10,810
well you've got three options.

103
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:13,660
You can just discount dreams all together,

104
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:15,820
which is what people in the
modern world tend to do,

105
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,500
which is a very bad idea because their
thoughts and you shouldn't discount them.

106
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,393
You know what I mean?

107
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,520
They're hardly random as
some neuroscientists claim.

108
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,980
That's absolutely cockeyed theory,

109
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,180
that random.

110
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,500
He like television,

111
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,600
Snow on a TV set if it was random.

112
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,913
So,

113
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,260
so one is while you just discount dreams.

114
00:03:35,261 --> 00:03:38,510
The other is that you consider the
person a liar and a braggart and a

115
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,670
narcissist.

116
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,020
And the third is,

117
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,221
well,

118
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,060
what's the third?

119
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,620
It's like he dreamt that the sun and the
moon and the stars bowed down to him.

120
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,400
You might think about
that two or three times.

121
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,271
So,

122
00:03:52,271 --> 00:03:54,760
but it's not necessarily something
that's going to make you happy.
