1
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,023
Um,

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:17,060
thank you very much for tuning in
and thank you all for your support.

3
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,490
And um,

4
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,343
keep

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,223
what else?

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,880
I hope that

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:33,280
I have lots of plans for 2018 and I
would like to keep you all in the loop.

8
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:34,960
And so all post a lot of those.

9
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:35,770
Oh yes.

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,790
I should tell you this.

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,460
I'm going to be giving some public talks,

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:40,383
a bunch of them.

13
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,030
So I'm going to be in the
following places in January,

14
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:46,180
February and March.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,451
Um,

16
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:47,680
I'll try to say them in order.

17
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:51,700
I'm going to be in London and then I'm
going to be in Amsterdam and then I'm

18
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:54,220
going to be in New York,

19
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,710
Los Angeles,

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,330
San Francisco,

21
00:00:58,660 --> 00:00:59,770
maybe Oakland.

22
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,570
Then I'm going to be in a bunch of
cities across Canada and major cities,

23
00:01:04,571 --> 00:01:05,141
Winnipeg,

24
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:05,740
Edmonton,

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,573
Ottawa,

26
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:07,623
Calgary,

27
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:08,620
maybe this little town,

28
00:01:08,621 --> 00:01:11,410
grand prairie that I went
to college in Vancouver.

29
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:15,580
And then I'm going to go down to Australia
and I'm going to go to Melbourne and

30
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:16,960
Sydney and Brisbane.

31
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:18,850
And so I'll post

32
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:22,810
the dates on my website very soon.

33
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:23,770
I've,

34
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:25,180
I'm still making the arrangements.

35
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:27,340
And so if you want to come
and listen to me talk,

36
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:31,390
then you'll have the
opportunity to do so and so.

37
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,810
Okay.

38
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:33,700
So I have to say good night.

39
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,170
And so good night to all of you.

40
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:35,620
And,

41
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,453
uh,

42
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:38,770
what would I like to compose with?

43
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,531
Well,

44
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:48,531
I'm glad you're tuning in and I hope
that you're using the information that

45
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:54,870
you're finding as a consequence of
tuning in to put your lives together,

46
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,900
because it would really be good in
2018 if a whole bunch of people did

47
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:04,260
everything they could to put their lives
together because then maybe we could

48
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:08,760
avoid this idiot catastrophe that we
seem to be dreadfully sliding towards.

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,820
And so that would be lovely
if we could just not do that.

50
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,860
So until next time,

51
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:14,820
bye bye.
