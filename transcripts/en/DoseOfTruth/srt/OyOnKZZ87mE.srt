1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,390
Sample an individual that it takes your
program and authors his or her future

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,830
already has taken the first steps off
response,

3
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:20,470
personal responsibility by doing
something about it.

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:25,830
So let's assume that we hear we,
we assume responsibility for our lives.

5
00:00:25,961 --> 00:00:29,680
We get our act together and we start
with our rooms and we,

6
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:32,170
we,
we broadened the circle and we want to

7
00:00:32,171 --> 00:00:37,171
start helping people out in the world
that don't have this first seed of

8
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:40,180
responsibility.
Um,

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,800
and of course some of them also have
diseases they can't do anything about.

10
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,850
We can leave that aside
for now,

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,750
but what do we do to inspire others?
Well,

12
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,750
you just laid it out.
I would say it's like,

13
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:58,420
you know,
one of the things that you,

14
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:03,900
you pull out of the clinical literature.
Imagine you have children who have a

15
00:01:05,531 --> 00:01:09,820
certain low level amount of neurological
trouble when they're infants.

16
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,330
So something's gone wrong.
Maybe a little oxygen deprivation at

17
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,820
birth or something like that.
Something's going a little bit wrong

18
00:01:15,821 --> 00:01:20,290
with their neurological development.
Assuming that the damage isn't too

19
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:24,580
severe,
those children will stabilize and

20
00:01:24,581 --> 00:01:29,581
normalize if they have at least one well
put together role model in their life.

21
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,290
And so one of the things that you do if
you want to inspire others is get your

22
00:01:38,021 --> 00:01:43,021
act together because you inspire most
through example.

23
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:47,020
It's more much more powerful than,
than words.

24
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:50,320
Words are very powerful if they're also
accompanied by example,

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,800
but the best thing you can do is start
putting things together around you.

26
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,640
There's plenty of things to put
together.

27
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,710
It's a good meditative exercise.
You know,

28
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:02,890
if you're,
and I think this is the proper form of

29
00:02:02,891 --> 00:02:04,000
prayer,
let's say,

30
00:02:04,001 --> 00:02:09,001
assuming that there is such a thing,
I'm proper form of prayer would be if

31
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:11,650
you're not happy with your life,
if you're miserable,

32
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,380
you sit on the edge of your bed and you
think,

33
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,160
is there anything I can change in what
I'm doing that is going to make this

34
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:23,550
less awful than it has to be less awful
than it might be?

35
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,160
You have to ask that,
you know,

36
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:31,220
with intent and generally speaking,
you'll get an answer almost immediately.

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,450
There's something that you could put
right that day that would make things

38
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,970
slightly better than they are.
And that's rule four,

39
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:46,400
which is compare yourself to who you are
yet to who you were yesterday and not to

40
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,530
who someone else's today.
There,

41
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,610
I don't believe that there's a person
who exists who wouldn't receive an

42
00:02:53,611 --> 00:02:55,830
answer to that question if they
genuinely asked it.

43
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:58,770
And it's no different really than
thinking like if you,

44
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,410
you have a problem,
you think you get an answer might not be

45
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,930
the right answer,
but obviously you get an answer and you

46
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:05,471
might think,
well,

47
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,030
I thought up that answer.
It's like,

48
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,790
well that's really not much of an
explanation because you don't know how

49
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,220
you think.
It's like I'm sitting there and thoughts

50
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:15,430
appear in my head and that's how I think
it's like that's a pretty shallow

51
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:18,580
explanation.
It's not much different than revelation.

52
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,890
It's like you ask yourself the proper
questions,

53
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,720
you'll get the proper answers if you ask
the right question and you want the

54
00:03:25,721 --> 00:03:29,500
answers right.
And those are not easy preconditions to

55
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,750
set up because who knows?
You know,

56
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,820
if you're sitting on the edge of your
bed thinking,

57
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,063
okay,

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,870
what am I doing wrong?
That's a hell of a question to ask.

59
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,240
You know,
because if you really want to know,

60
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,630
you'll find out and then you'll find out
that you really didn't want to know.

61
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:50,290
Because generally speaking,
finding out what you're doing wrong is

62
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:54,520
not a pleasant experience and it means
that you have to sacrifice part of

63
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:56,380
yourself,
usually a burned out,

64
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,450
stupid,
bitter,

65
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,710
corrupt,
arrogant,

66
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,890
nasty,
vengeful part of yourself,

67
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:06,280
but nonetheless part that you like.
And so,

68
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,140
so you can,
I think that room for those incremental

69
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,900
improvements exists within everyone's
grasp.

70
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,520
And,
and I think that it's a humble thing to

71
00:04:19,521 --> 00:04:22,400
do,
to ask how you could improve

72
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:25,460
incrementally without interfering with
anyone else.

73
00:04:25,461 --> 00:04:27,200
Like it's your problem,
not theirs.

74
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,650
But I think that the consequences of
maintained incremental improvement are

75
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:38,351
anything but incremental.
You get compound interest on incremental

76
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,040
improvement.
You know,

77
00:04:40,041 --> 00:04:43,070
there's another rule in the New
Testament called the Matthew principle.

78
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,210
It's economists use it and the rule is
to those who have everything more will

79
00:04:47,211 --> 00:04:49,190
be given.
And from those who have nothing,

80
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:52,610
everything will be taken to an actually
a description of the way the world

81
00:04:52,611 --> 00:04:54,050
works.
Interestingly enough,

82
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,090
you know that if you've ever played
monopoly,

83
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,980
because that's what happens if you play
monopoly.

84
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,890
And there's a reason for that.
That's a deep reason.

85
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,130
But what,
and it's a very harsh rule because it

86
00:05:04,131 --> 00:05:07,760
means as you start to wander off the
path,

87
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:10,670
let's say,
the probability that you will wonder

88
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:15,671
further off the path increases
nonlinearly and that's a terrible thing

89
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:16,670
to know.

90
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,060
As you wonder towards the edge,
the probability that you'll fall off the

91
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:25,360
cliff increases and that's a statistical
justification for the concept of hell.

92
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,450
But as you improve the probability that
each improvement will produce a further

93
00:05:32,451 --> 00:05:35,750
improvement increases.
And so perhaps the,

94
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,150
the downside is the cataclysmic
catastrophe that you can engage upon if

95
00:05:41,151 --> 00:05:46,151
you reproduce your moral failings.
But the upside is that each improvement

96
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:50,090
produces an increment in the probability
of the next improvement.

97
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,160
And I've seen that it's a truism among
behavioral psychologists.

98
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:56,090
I mean,
although they don't generally phrase it

99
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,790
that way.
If you're a behavioral psychologist and

100
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:02,810
I am a behavioral psychologist,
what you do is you find out what

101
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:08,720
essentially you help a person establish
their aim and then you break down what

102
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:12,770
they're trying to do into attainable
units and you negotiate with them.

103
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:13,521
You say,
well look,

104
00:06:13,521 --> 00:06:14,354
you know,
um,

105
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,453
well I'm not me.

106
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,480
They say I'm not making use of my time
very well.

107
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,850
Spending three hours a day playing video
games.

108
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,010
And you say,
well,

109
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,490
okay,
hypothetically,

110
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:27,980
how much time would you like to spend
playing video games?

111
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:29,540
And they say,
well,

112
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,040
I could probably spend an hour a day
without it interfering with the rest of

113
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:35,750
my life,
which is kind of the issue,

114
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:37,430
right?
Because if you play video games,

115
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:39,710
fine,
but maybe three hours means that you're

116
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:42,590
not doing your homework or something and
that's not a good game.

117
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:43,701
So you say,
okay,

118
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:45,890
well I want to play for an hour a day.
It's like,

119
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:47,660
okay,
well can you shift to an hour a day

120
00:06:47,661 --> 00:06:49,880
right now?
And this is supposed to be an honest

121
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:51,620
conversation.
And the person says,

122
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,660
no.
I've tried that lots of times.

123
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,460
Every time I try,
I just fail.

124
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,020
And so you don't say,
well,

125
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:57,740
quit failing.

126
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,520
Go play one hour a day and the problem
will be solved.

127
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:04,160
That's a stupid strategy.
You say,

128
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:05,240
okay,
well look,

129
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:10,280
you think about this and don't agree to
do this unless you think you will do it

130
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:12,380
because otherwise it's just a waste of
both of our times.

131
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:15,140
It's like,
do you think that you could track how

132
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:18,200
much time you've spent playing video
games for one week?

133
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:22,760
Don't change anything,
just track it and they think,

134
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,220
yeah,
I could probably do that,

135
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:26,990
but I might miss a couple of days and
you think,

136
00:07:26,991 --> 00:07:28,640
okay fine,
so here's the deal.

137
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,270
Five out of the next seven days,
you just track how much time you spend

138
00:07:32,271 --> 00:07:35,000
playing video games and the person says,
I think I can do that,

139
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,680
because that's what you want them to
say.

140
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:40,430
You want them to succeed at.
The improvement is not much of an

141
00:07:40,431 --> 00:07:41,720
improvement,
but it's something,

142
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:42,230
right?

143
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,700
Then they come back and they say,
well,

144
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,710
yeah,
I was playing about four hours a day,

145
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,480
and so you say,
okay,

146
00:07:47,481 --> 00:07:49,490
well fine,
good work man.

147
00:07:49,491 --> 00:07:51,110
You've got to track.
Now we know what,

148
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,560
we know the parameters of your problem.
It's actually a little worse than you

149
00:07:54,561 --> 00:07:56,870
thought,
but at least he had enough sense to

150
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,020
measure it.
We know where you're at.

151
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,280
Okay.
Do you think you could cut that down to

152
00:08:04,281 --> 00:08:07,550
three and a half hours every day and the
person thinks,

153
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:11,330
no,
I'm pretty weak willed.

154
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:14,330
I don't think I could manage that.
You say,

155
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,081
well,
how about this?

156
00:08:15,081 --> 00:08:19,970
Do you think that two of the next seven
days you can only play for three hours?

157
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:22,130
You think you can manage that and you
don't.

158
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:24,800
You're not cynical about this.
You're not insulting the person,

159
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,380
any of that.
It's like because you don't care,

160
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,670
all you care is that they make some
incremental movement towards their goal

161
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,410
and the person thinks about that.

162
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,920
If they have any sense and they take
their weakness into account and they

163
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:39,350
think,
I think I could probably do that.

164
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,990
And then they come back the next week
and they say,

165
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:47,620
I managed to spend three hours a day
playing video games for three days and

166
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:50,330
the rest were four hours.
And you say,

167
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,620
good work,
man,

168
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,800
you've just got rid of 25%
12 and a half percent of your problem.

169
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,330
You're one eighth of the way to fixing
it in one week.

170
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:07,110
And you know the person isn't going to
be all that thrilled with themselves

171
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:09,000
because they don't do the arithmetic
they do.

172
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,740
And they don't do that projection.
They think,

173
00:09:10,741 --> 00:09:12,330
well,
I'm still pretty damn useless.

174
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:16,440
I'm playing 25 hours worth of video
games a week.

175
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,570
It's nothing to pat myself on the back
for.

176
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:19,740
It's like,
yes it is.

177
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,930
It's definitely,
it's a market measurable improvement and

178
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,970
it's a move in the right direction,
you know?

179
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,781
And then you say,
okay,

180
00:09:27,781 --> 00:09:32,160
well on the days you succeeded,
how did you manage to succeed?

181
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:36,420
And is there a way that you could do it
for four days next week?

182
00:09:36,421 --> 00:09:37,980
How about that?
Or or come,

183
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:41,220
maybe you could even try five days.
You think you could do that?

184
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,410
And then you also tell the person,
look,

185
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,050
the other thing you've got to understand
is you're not going to improve like

186
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:48,840
this.
You're gonna improve like this.

187
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,300
So some weeks you're going to come back
and say,

188
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,890
Geez,
I backslid completely.

189
00:09:52,891 --> 00:09:55,410
And I like played for four hours a day
for seven days,

190
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,350
but doesn't matter because that doesn't
mean you failed.

191
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:02,610
It just means that you slid back,
you want to calculate it over a month or

192
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,080
something like that.
And you know,

193
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,870
generally speaking,
a month later the person's down to

194
00:10:06,871 --> 00:10:11,640
something like two hours a day and
you've figured out a ways of filling

195
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:13,830
their time in with something productive
otherwise,

196
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,240
and they're on their way.

197
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,040
And the general consequence of that is
that every time they manage an

198
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:23,010
accomplishment,
they get a little stronger in character.

199
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,550
They get a little bit more confident in
their ability to get a little bit less

200
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:30,180
wracked with self disgust,
they get a little bit more hopeful about

201
00:10:30,181 --> 00:10:34,170
the future and they get more confident
that they can make another change.

202
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,770
And if you're patient and you have to be
patient with yourself that way,

203
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,250
it's like you reward those incremental
improvements and you don't get all

204
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:43,440
cynical about them and you think,
okay,

205
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,280
just imagine what would happen if you
kept doing that every week for 10 years.

206
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,570
And the answer to that is things would
be so much better for you that you can't

207
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:53,820
even imagine it with that much
improvement,

208
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,220
or maybe even with half that much
improvement.

209
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,970
And so that's a,
that's a very good way of progressing.

210
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,850
So very good.
