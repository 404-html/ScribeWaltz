1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,880
Let me read you some things.

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,160
Rogers rote.

3
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:16,030
Okay,

4
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:16,850
this is a good one.

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:18,970
This is cause this is his statements.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,890
Here's some of it's
axiomatic presuppositions.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,250
So this is what you need to cleave to.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,280
If you're going to engage in
the process of Virginia therapy,

9
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,830
you have to want to be independent.

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:37,950
Now that's an interesting,

11
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:38,580
I don't know,

12
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,560
maybe we can actually have
a discussion about this.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,633
You know,

14
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:52,110
Freud thought the oedipal complex was
universal and what he meant by that,

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,750
people usually don't have this discussion,

16
00:00:55,751 --> 00:00:57,640
but we can give it a
shot and see how it goes.

17
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:01,120
What he meant by that was that

18
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:04,863
the,

19
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,280
that's struggling out of the family.

20
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:08,540
The primary family is very,

21
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,374
very difficult.

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,470
So I can give you an example.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:13,490
So I had another client,

24
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,630
very bright guy,

25
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:17,990
second generation guy from Middle East.

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,393
And uh,

27
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:21,530
he was headed for a pretty good career.

28
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,860
He's a smart guy and he's,

29
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,760
he'd done a load of work
to get this career going.

30
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,520
Isn't that position that
was difficult to obtain.

31
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,200
You had to move to a different city
in order to pursue this career.

32
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,000
And his parents were very upset that
he was moving off the street they lived

33
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:38,834
yet.

34
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:39,651
Okay.

35
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:40,484
So

36
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,960
from the Western perspective,

37
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,520
roughly speaking,

38
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,040
this is where it gets tricky.

39
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,210
The proper thing to do on behalf of the
parents would have been to support him

40
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:56,560
in his attempts to be,

41
00:01:56,710 --> 00:02:00,910
to establish himself independently about
the parent's perspective was you're

42
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,950
betraying the family by moving away.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,073
Okay.

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,610
Now the question is,

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:08,420
you know,

46
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:11,720
is it reasonable to presume that
independence is an absolute value?

47
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,171
I mean,

48
00:02:12,171 --> 00:02:13,520
we're having words about this,

49
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:14,390
that's for sure.

50
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,280
Wars have been going on for a long time.

51
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,471
For Rogers,

52
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,300
if you didn't value independence,

53
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,850
you couldn't get going
in this form of therapy.

54
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:29,050
Freud thought that all cultures were
eatable to one degree or another,

55
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:32,420
and you thought that wasn't
true for northern Europeans.

56
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:37,730
And that was part of the reason why
young and Freud came to a crossroads.

57
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,033
So

58
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,200
you think about that.

59
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:44,850
Okay.

60
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,780
In any case,

61
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,120
for Roger's only independence value,

62
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:50,340
individuals were suited for
client centered therapy.

63
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,370
Here's more acce.

64
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:54,204
Yes.

65
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,283
Honest

66
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,263
or

67
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,370
you're not.

68
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,320
That's another destination
to independence.

69
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,193
Turn point.

70
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:05,763
Good point.

71
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,860
I don't know if you can be completely
consistent with yourself and your family.

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,230
Well that,

73
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:11,450
that,

74
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,980
that's a very useful way of the way.

75
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,830
That's a very useful way of phrasing,

76
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,220
phrasing your question.

77
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,070
That's a very useful way
of phrasing the issue.

78
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,070
Can you be,

79
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,510
if you're honest,

80
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:26,890
does that mean you're independent?

81
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,203
It's a good question.

82
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,950
Might mean that because it means that
you're at least say again from the rod

83
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:33,220
next.

84
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,080
Let's take it from the
Rogerian perspective.

85
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,920
If you're speaking for yourself now,

86
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,620
that would be yourself in
relationship to other people,

87
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,940
the integrate itself,

88
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:43,151
right?

89
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:44,920
Not the kind of instrumentals,

90
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,320
useless self that's wandering
around causing trouble.

91
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,180
There's still your,

92
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,120
your unique position that
has to be contended with,

93
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,170
right?

94
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,310
And the fact that you're your own kind
of bounded entity with its own destiny

95
00:03:57,311 --> 00:04:01,510
and path and its own particular
biological structure.

96
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:07,650
And it's possible that the way that
you define independence is that that

97
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:10,870
particular need is properly
integrated into the collective.

98
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,960
So cats a good,

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,740
that's a good issue.
