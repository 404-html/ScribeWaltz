1
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,770
Taking your time to

2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,520
do some ideas.

3
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:17,703
No,

4
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,263
no,

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:21,950
it's great.

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,410
I was talking to Dave backstage.

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:30,110
We'd be trying to get our heads around
some of this and we were talking about

8
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:34,640
this idea that when
scientists look forward,

9
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,500
the intellectual dark,

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:40,670
we were trying to figure out what
it wants to do all them a in common,

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:41,633
you know,

12
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:46,240
people on that list ferry
sometimes insight on

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:48,653
Joe Rogan,

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,390
Dave and me and the Weinstein brothers,

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,100
a handful of other people,

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,820
and then one thing I can really think
of the United States is that we don't

17
00:00:58,821 --> 00:00:59,680
think you're stupid.

18
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,760
That's what it is

19
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,960
because there's no reason to treat

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:15,300
an audience attempted to assume.

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,320
Then that works to assume that people
aren't capable of operating at a high

22
00:01:22,161 --> 00:01:27,161
intellectual level to be compelling
as participate genuinely in soft,

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,870
simple discussion and perhaps discussion
that even goes deeper than that.

24
00:01:32,871 --> 00:01:37,390
Then it looks like there's a real hunger
for that in the real demand for it

25
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,340
because you know you're not stupid.

26
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:49,750
Thank you.

27
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,150
So I'm going to talk to you about tonight,

28
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:58,620
but not exactly because what I want to
talk to you about is the thing is that

29
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:02,460
I've been thinking about the same topics,

30
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,930
but since I wrote the book,

31
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:08,931
because I'm always thinking about golf
and I don't like to use sad because

32
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:11,370
they're complex ideas,

33
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,650
not because because it's the topics,

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,430
they be continual development,

35
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,040
continual articulation,

36
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,530
continual reformulation.

37
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,451
So we'll stop there.

38
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:23,100
I'm going to walk from
the rules one by one.

39
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:23,934
I don't know how many,

40
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,433
but enough

41
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,100
to stand up straight.

42
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,830
Shoulders back.

43
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,700
In some sense.

44
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,790
I'm going to say to a limited
degree on someone like me,

45
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,653
I suppose

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,790
I have heard about hierarchies.

47
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,320
Isn't that one of the things
I was trying to point out,

48
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,820
which I believe to be

49
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,580
remarkably worth knowing.

50
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,153
Instead,

51
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,710
hierarchical structures are extraordinary.

52
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,743
Um,

53
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,110
if you looked at any critiques
of Modern Society Inboxes,

54
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,610
critiques,

55
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:11,140
let's be more precise because the left
has its purposes and all get to that

56
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,410
later.

57
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:11,780
But mom,

58
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,730
sister takes

59
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,220
the boxes,

60
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,060
are very much concerned
about the detrimental
consequences of hierarchies and

61
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,120
mostly what they're concerned
about to give the devil his due,

62
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:22,954
let's say,

63
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:27,100
is the fact that if you have a hierarchy
that people tend to stack up with the

64
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:29,470
blog and that's true,

65
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,850
that that is what happens.

66
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,400
It's.

67
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,350
It's a well documented effect.

68
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:39,570
Success tends to become
disproportionate and forth.

69
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,550
People Stack up at zero and so there's
a big price to be paid for hierarchies.

70
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,660
But the problem with the
Marxist is that they placed it.

71
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,080
They attribute a causes of hierarchy to
the wrong reasons and by doing that they

72
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:58,540
do a disservice to the very
people that they purport to help.

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,550
So if you lay the problem of hierarchy
at the feet of western civilization,

74
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:06,240
say or capitalism,

75
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,210
then you're way off the
mark and Ashley dependable.

76
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,350
And that's why I wrote about lobsters
in chapter one because the fact that

77
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,400
animals who are inclined to live in
social groups spontaneously organize

78
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,060
themselves into hierarchies,

79
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,430
doesn't justify the existence
of hierarchies ethically.

80
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,740
And that wasn't the point
I was trying to make,

81
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:37,660
but it certainly doesn't disprove the
idea that there would be laid at the feet

82
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:42,661
of western civilization or capitalism
because monsters are not part of Western

83
00:04:43,151 --> 00:04:45,720
civilization and they're not capitalists.

84
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,290
That was part of a point.

85
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,350
It's actually really a problem when you
construct a hierarchy that people stack

86
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:54,184
up at the bar.

87
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,400
It's an issue.

88
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,400
It's a serious problem and it's a serious
enough submitted it repeatedly estabil

89
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,550
destabilizes civilizations.

90
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,393
In the past,

91
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,740
even if you look back
in the Old Testament,

92
00:05:05,741 --> 00:05:09,960
when the prophets announced their
opposition to the Hebrew case,

93
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,560
one of the constant complaints about the
kings who became Arabic was that they

94
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,320
weren't paying enough attention to the
windows and the children right to the

95
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,750
dispossessed and so the
profits would emerge and say,

96
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,603
oh,

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:20,990
you,

98
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,060
you don't get it.

99
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,740
You're society is destabilizing
in an unusual way.

100
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,250
And that's an indication
that it's going to fall.

101
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,290
And then it actually
happens to be the case.

102
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,280
And so the fact that people stack up
at the bottom has to be contended with

103
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:41,180
because if the inequality distribution
gets to steep than the whole society

104
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,780
stabilizes and that was a very bad thing,

105
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,560
but that doesn't mean that

106
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:51,460
that still doesn't mean that you could
lay the issue of hierarchy at the feet of

107
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:53,170
western civilization or capitalism.

108
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,920
A good book that was published recently
and somebody to be interviewing in the

109
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,753
next.

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,960
He wrote a book called the great leveler
and he did it in technical analysis of

111
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:08,590
inequality and so what are the things
he did was mattress that you surveyed a

112
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,810
variety of left wing governments in a
variety of what great we'd governments and

113
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:14,030
you've calculated the need
for warranty coefficients,

114
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,670
which you do often,

115
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,840
something called the
Gini Coefficient tissues.

116
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,100
Then you can determine whether the
left wing governments tend to produce

117
00:06:22,101 --> 00:06:25,510
societies that have more or less
equal tonight Greek governments.

118
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,400
What shutting off from was that there
was no effect whatsoever of political

119
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:33,401
ideology on inequality was a zero and
that's actually quite sad in some sense

120
00:06:33,501 --> 00:06:35,180
because given a left wing,

121
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:39,890
governments are attempting to rectify
inequality and inequality actually happens

122
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:40,760
to be a problem.

123
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,960
It wouldn't actually be optimistic at
least to something intensive analysis if

124
00:06:44,961 --> 00:06:47,810
there were to be in a relationship so
that the left wing governments work,

125
00:06:47,811 --> 00:06:50,630
in fact presentable for societies
that kindness and equality,

126
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,180
but that's what happened
and starting off analysis,

127
00:06:53,181 --> 00:06:55,610
which is quite striking,

128
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:56,091
I would say,

129
00:06:56,091 --> 00:06:59,220
is that the only thing that
reliable reduces inequality.

130
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,370
The only he got into fights or factors,

131
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:05,600
but eating kind of boiled down
to two more and the illness,

132
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:10,150
so plagues and an outright
warfare decrease inequality.

133
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,280
Why flapping everyone and there's no.

134
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,500
He couldn't detect any effect,

135
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,730
any real effective,

136
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,310
viable,

137
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,980
any viable political effect.

138
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:24,400
So that's quite striking and it's well
known that system everywhere producing

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,080
quality.

140
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:30,140
The thing that that I think makes the
west remarkable or the free market,

141
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:33,620
let's say remarkable is that a along
with the producing inequality and also

142
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:38,470
produces wealth because it's easy to
set up the society that produces nothing

143
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,500
but a new quality,

144
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,460
no wealth,

145
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,750
and so maybe we should thank our lucky
stars that although we still suffer from

146
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,220
the consequences of the good quality,

147
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:51,050
we also live in a society with
a system that old socio culture,

148
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,880
let's say to also produce wealth and
then we don't have to start and our

149
00:07:55,881 --> 00:07:58,400
children will have to start and
increasingly around the world.

150
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,680
People have to start
with and that's the best.

151
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,220
But I want to talk to you more about
hierarchies because there's something

152
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:09,221
really important apart from the fact that
hierarchies can't be laid at the feet

153
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,600
of political institution.

154
00:08:11,601 --> 00:08:15,530
Stand apart from the fact that there
are no simple and easy political fix.

155
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:16,010
This.

156
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:18,860
There's something else that's really
important to think about with regards to

157
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:19,341
hierarchies.

158
00:08:19,341 --> 00:08:19,941
Because you might say,

159
00:08:19,941 --> 00:08:20,150
well,

160
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,920
even if they are ubiquitous,

161
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,000
even if they're everywhere,

162
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,840
even if they're grounded in biology or
already emergent properties of social

163
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:27,531
interactions.

164
00:08:27,531 --> 00:08:30,050
Because either or both
of those could be true,

165
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,140
that doesn't necessarily mean the
tire or periods of good thing.

166
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,130
Maybe we should still just trying to
bring up and down and I would say that's

167
00:08:37,131 --> 00:08:38,570
another trope of the left,

168
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,090
but I also think that that's
an extraordinary bad idea.

169
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:43,850
I think it's an impossible
idea first of all,

170
00:08:43,851 --> 00:08:44,610
but north week,

171
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,770
is it an impossible idea?

172
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,970
I think it's a really,

173
00:08:46,971 --> 00:08:47,990
really bad idea.

174
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:48,980
Here's.

175
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,813
Let me make sure.

176
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,560
I think that.

177
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,890
Can you see what you think about?

178
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,980
So there's kind of two
things that you want to

179
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,780
speaking maybe more on
me than anything else.

180
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,860
You want to limit your
exposure to existential terror.

181
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:04,690
Okay,

182
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,500
so you don't want to be too anxious and
you have your resistance will be added

183
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:07,861
to the center,

184
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:11,520
but he hasn't listened to
be anxious because of being
so self conscious that our

185
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:15,720
lives are or more when our lives are
fragile and we have reason to be anxious

186
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,570
and it's very difficult for us to
keep our anxiety under control.

187
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,830
So you don't want things to be too
unstable because it destroys you

188
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,840
psychophysiological.

189
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,700
It's not just a psychological phenomenon,

190
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,910
it destroys you physiologically
as well as psychological help.

191
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,680
Keep the complexity of those
certainty under control,

192
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:36,090
so that's like rule number one and rule
number two is it's not so bad to have

193
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,420
something to live for and that's.

194
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:40,420
That's actually a positive emotion issue.

195
00:09:40,421 --> 00:09:41,740
So what the negative emotion.

196
00:09:41,741 --> 00:09:45,030
So you want me to get the
motion control primary what?

197
00:09:45,031 --> 00:09:45,811
Painting for sure,

198
00:09:45,811 --> 00:09:48,900
but also anxiety and now
the positive emotion side.

199
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,290
Well you want to be satisfied now and
then they get what it is that you want and

200
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,020
need,

201
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,853
but but.

202
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,110
But that's a secondary
consideration in some sense.

203
00:09:58,111 --> 00:10:01,680
Most of what you want is
something to strive for,

204
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:03,220
something to hope for somebody,

205
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,110
a map,

206
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,930
something that makes getting out
of bed in the morning worthwhile.

207
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,310
Let's call it a purpose.

208
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,450
Something that's meaningful,

209
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:11,060
something that you can engage with,

210
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:11,431
you have.

211
00:10:11,431 --> 00:10:15,540
You don't even have a primary
psychobiological system that is actually

212
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,040
responsive to such space.

213
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,021
It's this has been.

214
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:19,920
It's activated by drugs like cocaine.

215
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,630
It's a system that wrote to a dope beat.

216
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,020
It had human being succeed,

217
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,020
particularly powerful because we seem to
be more motivated to chase things that

218
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,450
we want than we are to actually get the.

219
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,180
Have you been kind of notice
in your life because you don't.

220
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,890
Maybe you've had a bowl for years.

221
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,281
Well,

222
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:36,810
graduation is a good example,

223
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:37,110
right?

224
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,700
You're in college here in high school.

225
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,460
You're chasing this goal of
graduation and then you graduate.

226
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,490
Well then what?

227
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:44,450
Well,

228
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:48,960
then the game starts again the next day
after you graduate your local band on

229
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:51,510
the toilet bowl for
the next big adventure,

230
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,830
and so the fact that you attained your
goal doesn't mean that you stop at any

231
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:56,161
sense.

232
00:10:56,161 --> 00:11:00,780
What it means is that you need to do
school and people need goals and so we can

233
00:11:00,781 --> 00:11:01,410
take a little bit of.

234
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,520
You need more.

235
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,580
We've absolutely you need it for way more
than you think even and they can check

236
00:11:08,521 --> 00:11:08,881
your hand.

237
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:09,541
For example,

238
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:12,280
I wrote a chapter called
be precise in your speech,

239
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:17,281
in that chapter lays out the fact that
this is a fact as far as I'm concerned,

240
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,500
that you can do that.

241
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:22,830
Look at the world without a goal because
your actual perceptions of the world

242
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,970
are organized around your value
structure and I don't even know if this

243
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,780
electrical metal,

244
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,030
the world's complicated to look at,

245
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:34,110
which is why it's taken so long to produce
machines that can see artificially.

246
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:37,480
We thought we'd have that problem solved
like 20 years ago or just getting there

247
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,190
now.

248
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,970
You can't see the world with other cool
and you can tell that because you point

249
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:45,330
your eyes and things and you point your
eyes to things that you're engaged with

250
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:46,110
an interactive thing.

251
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,110
So every single perceptual move you make
is an act of valuing and so he can't

252
00:11:51,721 --> 00:11:54,350
even perceive the world without a okay,

253
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,420
so equal to sustain you in life.

254
00:11:58,421 --> 00:12:01,390
And if people even to look at the world.

255
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:06,880
So let's think about the
consequences of having a goal.

256
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,421
Okay?

257
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:09,700
So the first thing is the thing.

258
00:12:09,701 --> 00:12:11,830
You're not actually be
better than what you have,

259
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:12,581
right?

260
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:13,330
Unless there's.

261
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,930
Unless you're aiming
down and that's not good,

262
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:17,591
like people do it.

263
00:12:17,591 --> 00:12:20,770
The guy who just read over
those people with the bat,

264
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,590
he was aiming down like seriously?

265
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,760
He was aiming to get out and so I
would say aiming down as a bad sign.

266
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,590
If you're aiming down,

267
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,750
you're in a bad way,

268
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,260
you're on a path to promotion and
maybe we'll take some people with you.

269
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:36,280
It's not a good thing,

270
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,420
so then you already know and you don't
want to eat too high up because what the

271
00:12:40,421 --> 00:12:41,254
hell good are you,

272
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,103
right?

273
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:42,660
If it's.

274
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,080
If your goal is to Boffi,

275
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,290
then it's impossible it all you're going
to do is frustrate yourself to death

276
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,460
when we pursue it.

277
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,870
Not Thinking shouldn't be high,

278
00:12:49,871 --> 00:12:50,704
but you shouldn't.

279
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:54,280
You don't want to punish yourself by
constantly reaching for things that are

280
00:12:54,281 --> 00:12:55,930
continually beyond your grasp.

281
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,170
You wouldn't do that to a child
if you cared for the child.

282
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,790
We shouldn't do that to yourself.

283
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,840
I could say that you're a not.

284
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,251
Okay,

285
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:06,550
so what that means is what you're
aiming at is better than what you have.

286
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,380
That's a value proposition,

287
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:08,920
right?

288
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,990
There's value there.

289
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,433
Here I am,

290
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:15,190
but it's not where I want to stay
awake to go to the next place.

291
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,480
The next place is hypothetical.

292
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:17,080
You better.

293
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,830
I'm not sort of the basis of
the idea of mythological quest,

294
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,830
which is why the quest
story is everywhere,

295
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:24,340
right?

296
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:29,340
You've probably seen most of the pharmacy
20 movies in the last five years that

297
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:32,650
our quest stories and it's
because no one krasner.

298
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,880
You're after something,

299
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,540
right?

300
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,090
You go after whatever
it is that you're after.

301
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:41,110
You collapse a bit the way and you fail
and you fall apart and you put yourself

302
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:41,670
back together.

303
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:42,670
You have your adventure,

304
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:46,220
you told your story and that's life
and you have to have a question.

305
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,830
Hopefully you have a quest that sub
sufficient brand here so that it justifies

306
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:55,090
your life because that's really what you
want is you want to have a name that's

307
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,320
profound enough,

308
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,380
so the fact that you're finding
and suffering is justifiable.

309
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,260
You could get out of Gordon and think,

310
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:05,741
yeah,

311
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:06,040
well,

312
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,873
you know,

313
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,140
there's a lot of things about
life than a rough and harsh,

314
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:16,710
but I'm doing something that justifies
and then then you've got that.

315
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,310
You've got a meeting.

316
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:22,060
You've got a purpose of thank God for
that because otherwise it's bitterness and

317
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:25,440
hail all the way down
and so it's a good thing.

318
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:28,360
Have so now you pause your value.

319
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:32,230
You're ending up so now you've agreed
that there is an app because otherwise,

320
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,640
why would you put in an effort to attain
your goal if you did it implicitly

321
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:40,120
accept the fact that the you're aiming
at is better than the that you have,

322
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,040
so now you're also accepting a value
Schema of good and bad and being the

323
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:48,680
ultimate acceptance of the value
Schema of good and bad isn't even good,

324
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,060
bad.

325
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,500
Maybe it's good and evil.

326
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,900
If you talks about breakthrough,

327
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:55,790
it's archetipal poles and you live
in a landscape of good and evil.

328
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:58,250
That's the landscape of the quest.

329
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,683
Now,

330
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:02,660
here's the problem with
regards to hierarchy,

331
00:15:02,661 --> 00:15:07,040
so let's let's say that you assume that
some things are worth pursuing and are

332
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,900
you going to do that in a social space,

333
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:09,111
right?

334
00:15:09,111 --> 00:15:09,760
Because,

335
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:09,900
well,

336
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,521
hardly any.

337
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:12,980
If you were ever going to
do anything entirely alone,

338
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:13,820
I mean now and then,

339
00:15:13,821 --> 00:15:17,510
but we're social right to the court were
cooperating and competing with other

340
00:15:17,511 --> 00:15:18,620
people all the time,

341
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,340
so you lay out your quest
in a collective landscape.

342
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,330
That means that as you're
moving from point a to point b,

343
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,810
then you're going to be cooperating
and competing with other people.

344
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,980
You will be instantly produce around
your goal on organization of other people

345
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:38,960
and some of her peripherally
involved in and so forth,

346
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:42,320
but it doesn't matter
because the rop is this.

347
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,730
As soon as you punch that
something is worthwhile,

348
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,220
you produce a hierarchy because as
people cooperate and compete towards that

349
00:15:49,221 --> 00:15:49,880
end,

350
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,560
doesn't matter what the end is.

351
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:56,380
Some people are going to end up being
way better at it than other people and

352
00:15:56,390 --> 00:16:00,650
some people are going to be heard data
and so what will happen is that around

353
00:16:00,651 --> 00:16:01,910
your value hierarchy,

354
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,840
you'll stack up pure middle hierarchical
structure that is composed of the

355
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:10,070
people who develop expertise
in relationship to that
goal and people who don't.

356
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,380
Now hopefully for the people who don't,

357
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,420
there are other games.

358
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:17,030
There are other value
propositions that they can play,

359
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:17,391
right,

360
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:20,000
because that's what you want
from a pluralistic society.

361
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:24,860
If your options are limited because
you're not good at one game and hopefully

362
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,050
there's no desk games live around that,

363
00:16:27,051 --> 00:16:28,700
you can go participate in that.

364
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,720
I think that's one of the real geniuses
of modern society is that with any luck,

365
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,880
there's.

366
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,050
There's a critical place for
almost everyone and there.

367
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,300
Sure thing because if you
can't find the credible place,

368
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,640
well maybe that reflects badly on you,

369
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:46,640
but it's also possible that
reflects badly on the society.

370
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:49,340
It's not a good thing because
people need a critical place,

371
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:54,080
but the point is that construction
of a hierarchy is inevitable.

372
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,650
If you're going to accept the proposition
that some things are more valuable

373
00:16:57,651 --> 00:16:58,484
than others,

374
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:01,790
and if you don't accept the proposition
that some things are more valuable than

375
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:02,250
others,

376
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:05,210
that is the reason to do
anything and you might think,

377
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:05,451
well,

378
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:05,930
who cares?

379
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,550
If there's no reason to do anything,

380
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,300
you know why you need a reason and the
answer to that as far as I can tell us,

381
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:12,380
because your life is very,

382
00:17:12,381 --> 00:17:13,220
very difficult.

383
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:17,330
Like life is characterized
intrinsically by ineradicable.

384
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,360
Elbert are limited limitation and
suffering and there's no escape from that.

385
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,530
There's little rationalization of that.

386
00:17:24,531 --> 00:17:25,364
There's no,

387
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:28,100
there's no denying that everyone
knows that can sometimes,

388
00:17:28,101 --> 00:17:28,311
you know,

389
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:33,260
it's so painful you can bury them because
you know as social needs something to

390
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:38,180
make that worthwhile and if you're
going to play the game of making it

391
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:38,631
worthwhile,

392
00:17:38,631 --> 00:17:40,730
they have to accept the value proposition.

393
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,310
And then what comes along
with that is the hierarchy.

394
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,380
So why are you going to do.

395
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:47,340
You're going to blow
up the value hierarchy.

396
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,710
So the value proposition.

397
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:53,250
So there's no hierarchy or what do you
leave people with that you really like to

398
00:17:53,251 --> 00:17:54,900
know a then no goal,

399
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:55,770
no purpose,

400
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,603
no meaning.

401
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:56,980
It's like,

402
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:58,350
that's your cure map.

403
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,210
I'd like to see what the disease is.

404
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,620
It's not good.

405
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,920
So now we'll put that aside.

406
00:18:04,921 --> 00:18:05,754
So

407
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,061
you can say,

408
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,050
well that's the hierarchy.

409
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:13,770
Doesn't a terrible aspect of a hierarchy
justified the value proposition?

410
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,101
Well,

411
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:15,150
that's a good question.

412
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,300
No,

413
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,080
I think we know what answered that too.

414
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:18,860
It's like,

415
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,693
let's say you,

416
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,090
you lay out the goal.

417
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:21,571
You might say,

418
00:18:21,571 --> 00:18:21,721
well,

419
00:18:21,721 --> 00:18:23,070
what's a good goal?

420
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:27,480
And that's a good inquiry to the
idea of what constitutes good,

421
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,190
but I think we're sophisticated enough
to have somewhat of a technical answer to

422
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:35,240
that and you can even see
this emerging unanimous cc.

423
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,150
So this morality that I'm laying out,

424
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,720
it's trends human.

425
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,050
It's,

426
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,330
it's,

427
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:39,900
it's,

428
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,390
it's sort of like the hierarchy issue.

429
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:43,170
You know when you see
hierarchies of human beings,

430
00:18:43,171 --> 00:18:44,490
but you also see them in animals.

431
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,040
You see this immersion
morality and human beings,

432
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,300
but you also see it an Admin,

433
00:18:48,301 --> 00:18:51,360
so it's deeper and broader
than human might say,

434
00:18:51,361 --> 00:18:52,170
well,

435
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,450
if you're going to pursue
something that's good.

436
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,690
What are you going to parameterize?

437
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:59,610
What's good so that you know it's good.

438
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,653
Well,

439
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:00,971
here,

440
00:19:00,971 --> 00:19:04,740
here's what the developmental
psychologists job piaget
came up with after

441
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:05,820
thinking about this for many,

442
00:19:05,821 --> 00:19:08,290
many years of studying children at Piaget,

443
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,990
the who was the most outstanding child
psychologist or the 20th century was

444
00:19:12,991 --> 00:19:16,170
motivated to do what he did because he
was turning to reconcile science and

445
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:16,980
religion.

446
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,390
It's not something that people know about.

447
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:18,811
Piaget,

448
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:19,644
much ship isn't,

449
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:23,970
isn't really advertised in university
courses dealing with fusion because it's

450
00:19:23,971 --> 00:19:25,260
such a strange issue,

451
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:29,520
but he's a genius and he got offered
to curatorship of a museum because of a

452
00:19:29,521 --> 00:19:30,740
paper we wrote on the Bolus.

453
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,470
Swimming was 10 years old and
his parents had been rejected.

454
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,420
They wrote back the people
who asked them and said,

455
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:36,920
well,

456
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,201
you know,

457
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:39,630
that's all very well and but he's had

458
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:46,390
anger is a financial genius and he had
this very interesting idea and so it's an

459
00:19:46,511 --> 00:19:50,820
elaboration on scientific
elaboration of the,

460
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:53,620
the last for Daniel proposition.

461
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:58,640
So concert ethical proposition was
something like if you're going to act and

462
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:02,160
you're trying to figure out
whether what you're doing is good,

463
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,900
you should imagine that everyone will
do it and see if that would be a good

464
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:07,763
thing.

465
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,040
And so if it's universalized bubble,

466
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,000
then perhaps it's ethical.

467
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:16,260
So that's counts categorical imperative
and it's an interesting way to think

468
00:20:16,261 --> 00:20:16,980
about it.

469
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,980
I think there's some utility in Psj are
the differentiated that quite nicely and

470
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,731
tall.

471
00:20:23,731 --> 00:20:24,810
Articulate that a little bit.

472
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:26,340
So the first thing is,

473
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,810
so imagine you've got an aid
now and you're pursuing it.

474
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:34,080
You don't want to fix yourself.

475
00:20:34,081 --> 00:20:36,000
May Room yourself tomorrow.

476
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,370
That'd be an impulsive and
you know what that's like.

477
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,620
That's like two bottles of wine at dinner.

478
00:20:40,621 --> 00:20:41,140
That's,

479
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,620
that's great during Ganda,

480
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,550
but it's not so good
for you tomorrow anyway.

481
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,620
I think the hell with it,

482
00:20:46,621 --> 00:20:51,621
it's worth tomorrow is that if you're
going to put forward the goal you want to

483
00:20:53,381 --> 00:20:53,921
put forward,

484
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,990
the goal that stood for you right now,

485
00:20:55,991 --> 00:21:00,280
but it's also good for moral but not
just tomorrow because you're not just

486
00:21:00,281 --> 00:21:01,114
around tomorrow,

487
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,340
next week,

488
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:02,990
next month,

489
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,823
next year,

490
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:08,940
five years from now and so whatever it
is the uranian for should be sue you now,

491
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:14,320
but it should suit the array of
future use that are likely to manifest

492
00:21:14,321 --> 00:21:15,670
themselves across time.

493
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:18,800
And so now the reason
I'm telling you this,

494
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,320
this is really important.

495
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,640
So I'm going to take a bit of a
side detour and then come back.

496
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,700
So the fundamental postpartum playing
this something like there's a near

497
00:21:30,521 --> 00:21:34,390
infinite number of points to interpret
the world and so it's very difficult to.

498
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,480
Because of the number of
wasted to interpret the world,

499
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,040
which happens to be true by the way,

500
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:39,970
even technically,

501
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,100
which is why it's so
difficult to build machines,

502
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:44,890
to see the world because it's
very hard to see the world.

503
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:50,070
The fact that there's a number of ways
to the world does not mean that there are

504
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:56,101
a near infinite number of viable ways
of looking at the world and that's.

505
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,200
That's a crucial distinction
because it could give.

506
00:21:59,201 --> 00:22:01,150
The postmodernist sister said,

507
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:01,421
well,

508
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,930
he stumbled on the problem
or multiple interpretations,

509
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,070
but they left it there.

510
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:06,341
It's like,

511
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:06,940
okay,

512
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,650
that is the problem.

513
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,680
Life is complicated.

514
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:10,470
How the hell do you
compute your way through?

515
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,201
It's really,

516
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:12,220
really difficult,

517
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:15,660
but for lots of things that
don't work like communism,

518
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,670
communism off the track,

519
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:25,150
thank [inaudible].

520
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:32,030
There's only two excuses for still
clinging to the idea of autonomy is works.

521
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:37,070
One is that you are historically
ignorant beyond all possible ethical.

522
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:39,843
What would you say?

523
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,470
Ethical reason,

524
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,840
or you're or you're willfully blind.

525
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,390
Three reasons or if real
from the glide or here,

526
00:22:46,391 --> 00:22:49,780
so God damn Arabic that you think if you
wouldn't be standing that you invested

527
00:22:49,781 --> 00:22:52,570
in me and told me on
the last point is very,

528
00:22:52,571 --> 00:22:53,080
very,

529
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,940
very much more common than people think.

530
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,331
It's like,

531
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:55,481
well,

532
00:22:55,481 --> 00:22:57,910
if I reverse the charge
of implementing communism,

533
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,050
it would have all gone well.

534
00:22:59,051 --> 00:22:59,470
It's like,

535
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:01,600
no and absolutely what?

536
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,360
Especially if you're the sort of
person who actually thinks that.

537
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:11,260
Thanks.

538
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,390
Okay,

539
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:15,980
so from active liability,

540
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:18,540
so here's the constraints and NDC.

541
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,570
I think I could.

542
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,560
The thing I was so striking to me about
reading piaget and also a member of the

543
00:23:23,561 --> 00:23:27,490
ankle experimentalists that I read who
are also interested in how morality built

544
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,210
itself from people like friends who all.

545
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:35,190
He studied chimpanzee behavior and he
felt just who studied both back behavior

546
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:39,670
and then complex social interactions
between animals and General Jaak Panksepp

547
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:43,450
who study the development of
a complex platforms in racks,

548
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:44,970
all pointed the same thing.

549
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
There's a morality,

550
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:48,640
but he merges off from the bottom up,

551
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,730
not from the top down.

552
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,510
Not Rational.

553
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:54,830
It's actually something that evolves and
it characterizes all sorts of different

554
00:23:54,831 --> 00:23:56,500
species and players.

555
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,081
Um,

556
00:23:57,081 --> 00:23:57,914
so,

557
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,461
okay,

558
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:00,320
so here's what's the set of constraints,

559
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:00,561
okay?

560
00:24:00,561 --> 00:24:03,200
Your first is this first
constraint is constraints.

561
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,450
You can't pursue what feels good.

562
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:05,990
Now,

563
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:07,280
if it doesn't work leader,

564
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,530
and that's really complicated,

565
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:09,711
right?

566
00:24:09,711 --> 00:24:11,750
Because it introduces
behind into the equation.

567
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,130
There's not just you,

568
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:17,150
there's the array of future use that you
have to take into account when you make

569
00:24:17,151 --> 00:24:22,010
your decisions and that's
there's a multiplicity of
the future use and you don't

570
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:25,400
want to reduce that to
two to a greater degree,

571
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:25,640
right?

572
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,670
Because you don't want to set yourself
up so you don't have any options.

573
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:34,000
So you can't gratify her impulses
impulsively because if you do that,

574
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,690
then what you do is you sacrifice your
future self and if you want to be around

575
00:24:38,691 --> 00:24:38,900
that,

576
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,980
that's a bad idea.

577
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:44,150
And so that's a major constraint because
it has to work now to all next week,

578
00:24:44,151 --> 00:24:44,720
next month,

579
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,231
next year,

580
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:47,150
five years from now and so forth.

581
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:48,080
And so,

582
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,110
and you know that perfectly well in
this part of taking care of yourself.

583
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,270
So everyone has the sense of that,

584
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,390
whether it's articulated,

585
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,210
they're not.

586
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,340
I think your instinctual
sense of conscience,

587
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:02,180
you know that that sense that you have
with what's right and what's wrong is

588
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:06,530
actually part of the evolve moral
structure that guides you in a manner that

589
00:25:06,531 --> 00:25:10,040
helps you take care of your potential
future self because otherwise you just

590
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:11,690
died stupidly.

591
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,730
You know at the more impulsive you are,

592
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:17,300
the more likely to die stupidly
and that you're getting.

593
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,230
That's the end of that.

594
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:19,550
Okay,

595
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,320
but that isn't,

596
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,010
that isn't the only constraint.

597
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:26,330
Even though that's a serious distress
in his note will be constrained because

598
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:30,220
you also have to deal with other people
and some of those people that are in

599
00:25:30,221 --> 00:25:31,820
immediate proximity to you.

600
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,620
Let's say your,

601
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:32,830
your,

602
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,950
your immediate family.

603
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,590
You have to act in a way that works for
them because otherwise they hate you and

604
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:44,360
they torture you and they lead you or
things get better and horrible around you.

605
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,770
And so unless that's what you want,

606
00:25:45,771 --> 00:25:47,450
that seems like a bad idea.

607
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,420
And so we have to foster their development
and the president and you have to

608
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:52,070
foster their future development.

609
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:55,760
And then you have to do that with
your family in a way that benefits

610
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:58,640
hypothetically benefits to the community,

611
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,810
the local community,

612
00:25:59,811 --> 00:26:00,950
and the broader community.

613
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,910
And then again across
almost talking pretty.

614
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:07,670
So it's not like there's an
infinite number of solutions
to that set of problems

615
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:08,451
right now.

616
00:26:08,451 --> 00:26:08,880
I think they,

617
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,450
what we actually recognize as
ethical behavior and which,

618
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:15,990
which I think we do naturally
recognize ethical behavior,

619
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:19,220
is that behavior that's in alignment
with that set of constraints.

620
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,920
And it's not something that
people discovered rationally.

621
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,680
It's not a rational imposition invention.

622
00:26:24,681 --> 00:26:26,810
It's not a consequence of enlightenment.

623
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:27,411
Morality,

624
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,244
for example,

625
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,470
technically speaking of the enlightenment,

626
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,850
because lots of people,

627
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,793
um,

628
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:34,780
who are enlightenment rationalist,

629
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,330
believe that these propositions were
set forth in an articulate manner,

630
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:39,370
rationally be lightened.

631
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,030
But to me they go.

632
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:45,680
That was the gloss on top of something
that was far deeper Panksepp.

633
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,231
For example,

634
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:48,270
some of you probably heard
me talking about this before,

635
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:52,170
but panksepp demonstrated that
if you pair ras repeatedly,

636
00:26:52,171 --> 00:26:55,920
juvenile rats who loved to engage
in rough and tumble play by the way,

637
00:26:55,921 --> 00:26:58,440
which is extremely good
for developing rats.

638
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,870
If you want to develop some wraps,

639
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,713
that's how you do it,

640
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:05,160
but it's also really good for developing
little kids because they really like

641
00:27:05,161 --> 00:27:07,920
rough and tumble play and there's
lots of complex reasons for that.

642
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:12,360
What panksepp observed was that if
you paired wrap dyads repeatedly,

643
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:16,260
so not just one game and who
played one game with someone,

644
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:16,471
right?

645
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:18,930
You played a game and then you
play the game again and again.

646
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,890
That's what being married is in play.

647
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,840
An infinite series of repeated Bill Gates.

648
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,170
And if you don't play the property
then it goes downhill very rapidly.

649
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:32,760
So what Panksepp observed was
that if you put it on Dale big,

650
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,890
rapidly wrapped together,

651
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:37,200
the pig gradlew stop a little
rap in their first contest,

652
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,820
but then if you parented repeatedly,

653
00:27:38,821 --> 00:27:42,180
unless the big route that deliberate when
30 percent of the time a little robin

654
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,860
stop playing and so and it was up to
the little rabbit to invite the play.

655
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:48,800
So even among Ras,

656
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:50,610
there's an immersive sense of fair play.

657
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,940
Like literally there is divergence,

658
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:54,150
sense of fair play.

659
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,510
That's a consequence of having
to repeat the game over and over.

660
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:01,110
That's what so amazing discovery back.

661
00:28:01,111 --> 00:28:01,561
I read that.

662
00:28:01,561 --> 00:28:02,010
It just,

663
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,060
it just blows me away.

664
00:28:03,061 --> 00:28:03,894
I think it seeds.

665
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,670
It's so funny.

666
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,700
You never know where we'll bolt,

667
00:28:05,701 --> 00:28:06,990
which is going to come from because like,

668
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,330
what's peg doing?

669
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:10,410
He used to tickle rats with an eraser.

670
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:11,170
There's no.

671
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,300
What the hell is he doing?

672
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:14,251
Well,

673
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:17,010
it turns out that if you take
rat pumps away from their mother,

674
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:21,750
they got just like human infants to even
if you feed them and give them enough

675
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:23,550
liquid and keep them warm and everything,

676
00:28:23,551 --> 00:28:25,080
if they're not cared for,

677
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,290
if they're not attached,

678
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,890
their gastrointestinal
system shut down in a dark,

679
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,970
exactly the same thing,

680
00:28:29,971 --> 00:28:31,230
not to human babies.

681
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:34,200
So touch touch is a primary need.

682
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:39,290
So panksepp and people learn to massage
little rats with the racist pencil races

683
00:28:40,021 --> 00:28:43,230
because they were gentle enough for
the ranch would giggle ultrasonically

684
00:28:43,231 --> 00:28:44,430
because he recorded their,

685
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,890
their,

686
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,020
their vocalizations,

687
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:47,610
and they gave a little too sonically.

688
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,501
You couldn't tell them,

689
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:49,260
listen,

690
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,150
I don't know how to help
you ever figured it out,

691
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,550
but if you record them and
then slow down the tape,

692
00:28:53,551 --> 00:28:54,384
you can hear them.

693
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:57,060
And so that would entice them into life.

694
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:57,751
So,

695
00:28:57,751 --> 00:28:58,411
but the point is,

696
00:28:58,411 --> 00:29:00,130
is that even among rats,

697
00:29:00,131 --> 00:29:02,010
which are very social animals by the way,

698
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:02,910
um,

699
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:06,900
there are serious constraints on
interpersonal behavior that had ethical,

700
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:08,400
essentially ethical nature.

701
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,020
And so that's so cool because one of
the things that's really hard on her

702
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:15,570
culture is this emerging
sense of moral relativism.

703
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:19,200
That's it's a consequence of
an excess of rational thinking,

704
00:29:19,201 --> 00:29:24,201
I think because rational thinker can
optimize any step of propositions and if

705
00:29:24,611 --> 00:29:25,680
there's utility in that,

706
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:29,030
because it's part of thinking to be
critical and to be able to destroy things

707
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:29,873
and rebuild them,

708
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,650
but you don't want to destroy everything.

709
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,560
And one of the issues that's
immersed in the 20th century,

710
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:35,150
the drugs,

711
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:38,070
both nihilism and totalitarianism
as far as I'm concerned,

712
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:42,340
is the proposition that all value
propositions are something arbitrary and

713
00:29:42,341 --> 00:29:43,720
equally print a sizable.

714
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,070
And I don't think that there's any.

715
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,590
I think we have enough evidence down
from categorically state the best.

716
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,750
That's just not true.

717
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:54,340
That whatever ethics constitutes isn't
arbitrary even though it's complex and

718
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,360
sophisticated,

719
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:59,620
but if there's any eradicable core and
it's predicated on something like the

720
00:29:59,621 --> 00:30:04,120
necessity of iterating gates and all of
that emergence of morality that we can

721
00:30:04,121 --> 00:30:04,930
then map.

722
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,350
And you know what this like.

723
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,990
Here's an example of this.

724
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:13,650
So imagine that you have no fun going to
get past the one actually magic pageant

725
00:30:14,891 --> 00:30:15,724
that you're even,

726
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:21,430
let's say a talking to your son about
playing hockey or your daughter playing

727
00:30:21,641 --> 00:30:22,720
soccer or whatever,

728
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:23,943
and um,

729
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:24,311
you know,

730
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:24,521
you,

731
00:30:24,521 --> 00:30:27,780
you see them all the field and
they're kind of walking football,

732
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:28,511
you know,

733
00:30:28,511 --> 00:30:33,511
and if you bring it back the way it made
me think of your soccer player and she

734
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:33,791
wins,

735
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,110
maybe she scores the winning goal,

736
00:30:35,111 --> 00:30:39,640
but there's part of you this not too
happy about that because you know,

737
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,160
there wasn't any branded
scan along with it.

738
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,840
And so you're and off
the field and you say,

739
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:46,860
look Kiddo,

740
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,770
you know,

741
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,640
he did a great job in,

742
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,830
or maybe you're even the best
soccer player up there on the field,

743
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:51,850
but you know,

744
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,660
you read the play fair
and that's that idea.

745
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,553
And she says,

746
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:57,890
what do you mean I'm the best?

747
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,070
They're up there and I won.

748
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:00,483
And you're thinking,

749
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,073
well that's true.

750
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,870
And then you show up
because what do you know?

751
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,110
What are you going to say?

752
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,000
Because you don't know how to explain it.

753
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,560
You've gotten a sense that
something went wrong and he said,

754
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:10,751
well,

755
00:31:10,751 --> 00:31:10,931
you know,

756
00:31:10,931 --> 00:31:12,820
you have to let other
people have a chance.

757
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:13,481
Maybe she says,

758
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:13,691
well,

759
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:13,901
yeah,

760
00:31:13,901 --> 00:31:15,040
but then we won't win.

761
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,233
So like,

762
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,103
no,

763
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,330
and you don't want to sleep.

764
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,090
You don't want to teach your daughter
to have Katie on the other players.

765
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
That's not what you're saying,

766
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,131
but,

767
00:31:27,131 --> 00:31:27,700
but here's,

768
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,533
here's what,

769
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,950
here's what you know,

770
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,090
and this is so cool.

771
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,620
This is a good example of how it use the,

772
00:31:32,621 --> 00:31:33,011
you know,

773
00:31:33,011 --> 00:31:34,270
way more than you know,

774
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:37,450
which is also something really worth
knowing because you're really complicated.

775
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,710
You're way more complicated than you
think and way more complicated than you

776
00:31:41,711 --> 00:31:42,461
even could know.

777
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:42,911
And you know,

778
00:31:42,911 --> 00:31:45,370
all sorts of things that you
don't know that they'll have it.

779
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:50,371
You can't say so as you're quieter
than you are smart and some ways,

780
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,191
right?

781
00:31:51,191 --> 00:31:51,880
Because otherwise we,

782
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,960
with Nita psychology,

783
00:31:52,961 --> 00:31:56,130
we would have to figure ourselves out
and just be transparent to each other or

784
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,740
not.

785
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,260
So you have your daughter and you say,

786
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,980
so you were this little Kiddo.

787
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:03,520
There isn't a soccer game.

788
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:04,900
It's an illusion.

789
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,120
There's a sequence of soccer games.

790
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,970
And so if you are trying
to win the soccer game,

791
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:14,500
you're trying to win the sec of soccer
game and the rules for winning the

792
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:19,501
surface soccer games in not exactly the
same as winning what soccer game and you

793
00:32:19,631 --> 00:32:22,540
don't want a win one soccer game in
a way that stops you from wanting to

794
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:22,990
separate.

795
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:23,910
Also forget.

796
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,380
And if you're gonna to
said of all soccer games,

797
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,710
maybe you're going to play
soccer for the next 10 years.

798
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,590
So what does that mean?

799
00:32:29,591 --> 00:32:34,120
It means you have to learn how to develop
your teammates because not every team

800
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:36,880
you're going to be on as a winning team
and sometimes you're not going to be the

801
00:32:36,881 --> 00:32:37,750
best player.

802
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:41,330
And so you better figure out how to going
to figure out how to bring those with

803
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:42,164
you up,

804
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:44,180
up in the developmental course.

805
00:32:44,181 --> 00:32:47,540
And you better learn how to treat
your opponents with respect.

806
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,750
You're going to learn how to play properly
because then you'll be able to leave

807
00:32:50,751 --> 00:32:52,530
the second of all possible soccer games.

808
00:32:52,531 --> 00:32:53,870
So that's way better price.

809
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:58,990
And then you might start
seeing more complicated than
that because it is the set

810
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:00,190
of all soccer games.

811
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,033
That's the issue.

812
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:05,510
It's the set of possible games and
that's what they're trying to win.

813
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:09,800
And so how do you in the set of all
possible games or that that's the real

814
00:33:09,801 --> 00:33:10,670
ethical question.

815
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:14,090
How is it that you conduct yourself
in life so that you maximize your

816
00:33:14,091 --> 00:33:16,680
probability of winning
the set of possible gates?

817
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,830
Because that means that
wherever you're sat down,

818
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,480
you're going to do well,

819
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,280
and that's something
that you want to know,

820
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:24,410
that that's what it
means to have character.

821
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,420
That's what it means to be a good person.

822
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:29,270
It's not that you don't do bad
things because they're afraid of the

823
00:33:29,271 --> 00:33:30,140
consequences.

824
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,640
That's not it at all.

825
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,310
It's that no matter
where you are in place,

826
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,860
you're ready and that's because he's got
a Cherokee as because to learn to play

827
00:33:39,861 --> 00:33:40,760
the property.

828
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:41,610
As soon as you say,

829
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:41,751
well,

830
00:33:41,751 --> 00:33:42,584
what do you want?

831
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,150
What do you want for your child?

832
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:48,350
You want to teach them how to play so
that everyone always invites them to play

833
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,184
games.

834
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,400
Because Nicole,

835
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,320
everyone says,

836
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:51,431
well,

837
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:52,280
do you want to play?

838
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:56,600
And then it wherever me know that's
what they did to do and you know there's

839
00:33:56,601 --> 00:34:00,020
some of you in the audience who were
extraordinarily successful perhaps as a

840
00:34:00,021 --> 00:34:03,480
consequences of your own marriage as
well as let's say the grace of God.

841
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,471
Part of that is,

842
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:08,330
but you know you play well with
others and so wherever you go,

843
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,190
you drop a reputation around you.

844
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,920
Maybe you're a little more
generous than you have to be.

845
00:34:12,921 --> 00:34:17,210
Even maybe share a little more credit
that would be perfectly justifiable and

846
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:17,741
you go off,

847
00:34:17,741 --> 00:34:18,210
you're waiting,

848
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:19,490
develop other people,

849
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:19,950
right,

850
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:23,270
and it's because you don't
care if you planned right now,

851
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,710
you're just trying to set yourself up
and everyone else for something way,

852
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:28,520
way,

853
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,140
way better than that,

854
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:34,610
and that's the purpose of the development
of character and that's a real thing.

855
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,650
It's not something statement.

856
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:40,640
It's not some arbitrary statement for
people who are easy going kind of finger

857
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:41,750
wagging morality.

858
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:45,950
It's not something that can easily
dismiss by oral relative to say,

859
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:46,610
well,

860
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,890
our culture is radically
different everywhere.

861
00:34:48,891 --> 00:34:49,440
It's like,

862
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,273
yeah,

863
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,910
like the languages are
radically different everywhere,

864
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,830
but there's a core down there.

865
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:56,960
Then we don't just share
it with other human beings.

866
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,400
We share them with other animals,

867
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,530
which is why you can get
along with the dog fruits,

868
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,130
apple,

869
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,900
because if you have a dog in the door,

870
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:07,760
so it's at least in part because we're
playing fair with the dog and if you're

871
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,570
playing with a rope,

872
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:12,200
but the adults pulling on
it and he insulated dog,

873
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:17,210
little horrible noisy dog
and your political role is
it sometimes let the dorm

874
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:19,740
with enhance a little fit.

875
00:35:19,741 --> 00:35:21,040
That happiness rating sheets,

876
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:21,950
the wrote back and forth,

877
00:35:21,951 --> 00:35:23,030
but he runs around in circles.

878
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:23,720
It's like,

879
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,230
you know,

880
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:27,530
you don't have to be top dog for a
minute and then maybe he'll play with you

881
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:27,891
again.

882
00:35:27,891 --> 00:35:30,740
So you're smart after you it with dogs.

883
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,700
And the fact that you know how to play
therapy with dogs indicates that there's

884
00:35:34,701 --> 00:35:38,820
something about playing
fairly transcends position.

885
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,190
So one of the things I've learned,

886
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,560
I think this is so cool.

887
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:46,110
It's really what I'd be trying to express
what I turned from express tonight

888
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,030
because it's such an amazing idea.

889
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:51,180
It's just ever since I realized this idea,

890
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:56,210
just it's just I can't even think that
are just absolutely blowing me away.

891
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,700
So favorable,

892
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,100
not feel about this.

893
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:03,450
So imagine you have a game and
there's a way to play the game to win.

894
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,790
We already said why you need game,

895
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,011
right?

896
00:36:05,011 --> 00:36:07,680
Because you have your purpose in life.

897
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:10,590
We'll call that an eight because there's
a bunch of different ways you could do

898
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:10,740
it.

899
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,180
So that's how you do it.

900
00:36:12,181 --> 00:36:14,790
Even in a game you play monopoly,

901
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,120
you're goal is to fill the pool,

902
00:36:17,121 --> 00:36:18,450
the money and you're like,

903
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,520
isn't the meaning to
your life momentarily?

904
00:36:20,521 --> 00:36:22,830
Because it's a little
microcosm of reality,

905
00:36:22,831 --> 00:36:24,450
which is why you play the game.

906
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,284
And so,

907
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:26,131
okay,

908
00:36:26,131 --> 00:36:31,090
so now imagine there's gain single game
and there's a way to play it so that you

909
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:31,924
can win,

910
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,060
right?

911
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,700
But then we're gonna and
that's why the pyramid,

912
00:36:36,170 --> 00:36:36,420
again,

913
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:41,310
I'm asking if there's a whole set of
those pyramids and then you can imagine

914
00:36:41,311 --> 00:36:45,120
that each waiting to win in each of
those games is slightly different,

915
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:46,340
but there's.

916
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,610
There's commonality across stuff that
will be being a good sport plane fair or

917
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:51,271
something like that.

918
00:36:51,271 --> 00:36:52,870
There's commonality across the board.

919
00:36:53,490 --> 00:36:53,731
Okay.

920
00:36:53,731 --> 00:36:53,911
Now,

921
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:54,721
so imaginative.

922
00:36:54,721 --> 00:36:59,220
What you're trying to do is to set
yourself up so you're the best player no

923
00:36:59,221 --> 00:37:00,680
matter what game comes up.

924
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:01,621
Okay?

925
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,690
So again,

926
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,230
it's more complicated than that too,

927
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,660
because then it has been.

928
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,050
You were trying to figure out what that
would look like because what you want to

929
00:37:10,051 --> 00:37:13,600
be able to grasp it and articulate
it in representative because you.

930
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:16,680
Because help you act it out and it would
help you teach on people that acted

931
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:17,150
out.

932
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:20,930
And so that's what have
been doing for thousands.

933
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,770
Tens of thousands of years.

934
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,470
We've been watching how things work,

935
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:26,251
how people work.

936
00:37:26,251 --> 00:37:29,370
We'd be watching the fact that we wouldn't
in hierarchies and that there's a set

937
00:37:29,371 --> 00:37:30,280
of hierarchies,

938
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,890
and then we'd be watching and seeing,

939
00:37:31,891 --> 00:37:32,640
okay,

940
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,880
some people are successful in moving
up these hierarchies of going out hard

941
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,310
because that's too limited.

942
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:39,530
The second hierarchies.

943
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,180
So then imagine that there's a
pattern that characterize this.

944
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,550
A person who tends to rise to
the crop set at all hierarchies.

945
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:48,840
Okay,

946
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,220
that's a mythological hero.

947
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,710
That's what the logical hero is.

948
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,610
And then pattern.

949
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:57,500
There's a pattern to that and it's
been recognized cross culturally,

950
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,540
which is why continually pops up
in mythology and popular culture.

951
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,740
So part of that,

952
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,810
part of that category is the willingness
to confront that you don't know,

953
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:07,711
right?

954
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:08,281
Because you think,

955
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:08,760
well,

956
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,780
how do you expand your ability?

957
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:12,660
You don't just hide and what you know,

958
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:14,100
you don't just stay in one game.

959
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,200
You don't think that's the total world
because what's your name falls apart.

960
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,830
We'll have you lost,

961
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,980
or what if it's a perfect game and
you went to Mexico catastrophe.

962
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,120
None of that's good.

963
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:26,640
You can't just be the
pastor of a single game.

964
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,661
You have to look.

965
00:38:27,661 --> 00:38:30,330
I'll try not to have to open
yourself up to the unknown.

966
00:38:30,331 --> 00:38:34,680
You have to always understand that there's
a bunch of things that you don't know

967
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:35,723
and

968
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:37,723
no,

969
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:38,060
no,

970
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,860
I didn't see her again
in the knowledge center.

971
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:47,040
If you could open yourself up so the
white you don't know so you can interact

972
00:38:47,201 --> 00:38:48,020
and what you don't know,

973
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,340
you can make yourself more than you
are and so that's the stance to take,

974
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:55,610
which is why in chapter one I ask
people to stand up straight with your

975
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,690
shoulders back because that's how
you expose yourself to the world.

976
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:03,580
It's a confident stance and it means that
you're ready to take on that which is

977
00:39:03,581 --> 00:39:04,600
still beyond you,

978
00:39:04,601 --> 00:39:07,840
and so that's what the characteristics
of the heroes that they hero voluntarily

979
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:10,180
confronts the on your
own and that's an old,

980
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,073
old,

981
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,980
old,

982
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,090
old story.

983
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,280
It might be the oldest story.

984
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:20,260
It might be the story of matter of time
and now that there's more to the story

985
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,110
than not because the next
question mark people,

986
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,210
what happens if you do
open yourself up to that?

987
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,083
No.

988
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:26,620
Well,

989
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,280
you all know that already you die,

990
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:30,100
then you die.

991
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Multiple deaths do that
so we know if when you,

992
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:36,970
when you stumble across something you
don't understand and it knocks you for a

993
00:39:36,971 --> 00:39:37,750
loop,

994
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,100
that's often very painful.

995
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,840
Even if you've prepared yourself for it,

996
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:42,460
you know so you know perfectly well,

997
00:39:42,461 --> 00:39:47,461
but those times in your life where
you learn what you needed to learn,

998
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:48,820
that didn't come up,

999
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,210
that incompetence of blood right,

1000
00:39:51,211 --> 00:39:54,310
if that's when you have a crisis
and maybe you heartbeat bloody well,

1001
00:39:54,311 --> 00:39:59,311
get through and and you're suffering from
it and maybe doubting the validity of

1002
00:39:59,441 --> 00:40:00,191
your existence.

1003
00:40:00,191 --> 00:40:02,920
It's like the worst thing that ever
happened to you and then you come out the

1004
00:40:02,921 --> 00:40:03,754
other end.

1005
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:05,051
Saturday,

1006
00:40:05,051 --> 00:40:06,060
maybe budweiser,

1007
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,570
but also more competent,

1008
00:40:07,670 --> 00:40:08,860
maybe more compassionate,

1009
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:09,830
maybe wiser,

1010
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,960
and you think whole path.

1011
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:15,010
I went down into the underworld and I
came back out with it and that's the

1012
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,030
pathway through life.

1013
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:16,540
It's,

1014
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,620
that's how you learn.

1015
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,280
You're here and you're trying to
get there and there is better,

1016
00:40:21,281 --> 00:40:22,990
but it isn't a linear pathway.

1017
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,650
If you want to get from here to there,

1018
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,810
we usually go down first and
add up and so that's the best,

1019
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,340
the hearables into the underworld,

1020
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,510
to face the dragon,

1021
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:32,710
to get the goal,

1022
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:35,020
to emerge backup triathlete,

1023
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:39,400
and to share that with the community and
we know that the oldest written story

1024
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:44,220
we have is exactly that story that stick
a new dish or you do a image for me

1025
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,470
from the Dantians is the Oxford story we
have and it's the basis of all so much

1026
00:40:49,751 --> 00:40:53,320
with what you watch is the basis of the
advantages and it's the basis of star

1027
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:57,280
wars and it's the basis of star Trek and
all this mythology that you see all the

1028
00:40:57,281 --> 00:41:01,810
screaming as plugged in to replace our
religious preconceptions with the same

1029
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:02,710
old material.

1030
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,970
It's Harry Potter.

1031
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,751
It's all of that.

1032
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:07,990
I've been hearing partner dies
in this reform to overcome evil.

1033
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,910
If you ever heard that story before,

1034
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,530
a chest bone with curiosity,

1035
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:15,430
that is what happens
is it is what happens.

1036
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:19,990
Because like some of the times when you
encounter something terrible in your

1037
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:20,280
life,

1038
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,450
when you're moving
forward towards the goal,

1039
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:26,790
what you've encountered might be the
terrible part of another person or maybe a

1040
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,340
bb trade terribly by someone you trusted,

1041
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:30,060
but they don't.

1042
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,070
It's not not all that uncommon for that,

1043
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:36,980
and that's even worse.

1044
00:41:36,981 --> 00:41:37,221
You know,

1045
00:41:37,221 --> 00:41:37,821
it's very,

1046
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:42,130
very common for people who develop post
traumatic stress disorder to develop

1047
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:44,300
because they be trained themselves,

1048
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:44,960
right?

1049
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,600
They saw them develop
posttraumatic stress disorder.

1050
00:41:47,601 --> 00:41:51,290
This happens in military and accomplish
a lot the person who watched themselves

1051
00:41:51,350 --> 00:41:53,430
do something so fruit don't make your own.

1052
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:58,340
Imagine how we put it possibly has done
it and maybe they enjoy and then they're

1053
00:41:58,341 --> 00:41:59,510
never the same again.

1054
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,350
And what that means is what made it
had an encounter with malevolence.

1055
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:07,550
They had an encounter with evil monster
wave up to put and it's not in front of

1056
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:10,710
and strong into that world
and half destroyed them.

1057
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,290
And sometimes you don't get out of that.

1058
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,210
Sometimes you do not recover from that.

1059
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,350
This is real.

1060
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,090
It's a real place,

1061
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:17,933
the underworld,

1062
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,610
and you could easily get dropped it,

1063
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,200
but the mythological hero goes into the
underworld and this recording comes out

1064
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:26,570
triumphant and that's the story of life.

1065
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:30,530
And you'll do that on your way to
developing this ability to move up the

1066
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,373
hierarchy.

1067
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:32,703
Know.

1068
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,940
So maybe if I can hear something,

1069
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,070
it's also extraordinarily cool.

1070
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,443
So imagine

1071
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,710
there's a hierarchy between soccer game.

1072
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:45,830
If you wait the game that you're
at the top of the hierarchy,

1073
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:49,130
everybody puts you off on their shoulders
and they turn me around the field.

1074
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,790
A field that's an indication that you're.

1075
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,010
You're top boxster for a
moment and then you think,

1076
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:55,581
well,

1077
00:42:55,581 --> 00:42:57,020
is there anything about that?

1078
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:01,860
Is there anything above the painful of
the pyramid and raise different ideas?

1079
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,580
It's about the pyramid
that had been denied.

1080
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:06,260
The idea that you go
through the eye by a horus,

1081
00:43:06,261 --> 00:43:06,861
the Egyptian,

1082
00:43:06,861 --> 00:43:11,861
I find a bit of attention and it's above
the pyramid because the first thing

1083
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,040
winds to Senegal Games is the victor
over the person who wins the single gay,

1084
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,610
and that means there's something
outside each parent that's above it and

1085
00:43:19,611 --> 00:43:20,310
transcendent.

1086
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:24,300
That's the ultimate value and that's
the idea of the king of all kings and

1087
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:28,180
something like that and hero of all heroes
and that's an image that you call it

1088
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:32,920
your imagination and you can identify
with you see it and calls to forward.

1089
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,930
Because this has been going on for so
long while since rostered xbox $350

1090
00:43:38,931 --> 00:43:39,710
million years.

1091
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,570
It's really a long time.

1092
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,820
It's longer than their whiskey trees.

1093
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,650
It's really a long time.

1094
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:49,820
This has been going on forever
and we understand that.

1095
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:54,470
We can recognize it even if we can't
articulate it and when you spontaneously

1096
00:43:54,471 --> 00:43:55,370
admire someone,

1097
00:43:55,371 --> 00:43:56,990
especially for a long period of time.

1098
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:00,590
The reason that you environment because
they've manifested a fragment of the

1099
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:02,780
behavior that makes a person a heroin.

1100
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:06,710
Victor across sets of gates and that's
the person who's courageous enough to

1101
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:10,650
take on what they will get
an understanding and let
the part of the Mideast

1102
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:13,970
worthy or sufficient
parish as a consequence.

1103
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,940
And that can be very painful
and that's part of the.

1104
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,420
In the additional substrate
which the idea of the desert,

1105
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,850
the resurrected savior emergence.

1106
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:24,820
That's part of the legacy.

1107
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:29,690
And so the idea that our
religious presuppositions
are religious reconceptualize

1108
00:44:29,691 --> 00:44:34,691
say the ones in which western or on the
superstitions is seriously wrong and we

1109
00:44:36,871 --> 00:44:39,480
don't really know the limit
of that because you know,

1110
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,590
we don't know how good we have some sense
about how terrible and and Kevin Straw

1111
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:45,841
person can be,

1112
00:44:45,841 --> 00:44:48,990
but we don't know how good nurses can be
and we don't know what you wouldn't be

1113
00:44:48,991 --> 00:44:53,730
like if you adopted the pattern of the
victor of the set of games that made that

1114
00:44:53,731 --> 00:44:58,260
your goal in life and you had the highest
school you can possibly conceive of

1115
00:44:58,261 --> 00:44:58,360
it.

1116
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:00,930
You made that your name
would not be something.

1117
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,340
And why not do it?

1118
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:04,130
What the Hell's the alternative?

1119
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:04,330
Well,

1120
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,980
some of it is that sort of
bitterness and catastrophe.

1121
00:45:07,140 --> 00:45:09,090
Maybe that would be a good thing to avoid.

1122
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:11,610
But who knows how far obvious.

1123
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:11,911
Oh,

1124
00:45:11,911 --> 00:45:14,070
so wrong way up and you know,

1125
00:45:14,071 --> 00:45:15,510
you don't have anything better to do that,

1126
00:45:15,550 --> 00:45:16,050
David,

1127
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:16,590
that.

1128
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,720
And it's the adventure of your life.

1129
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,400
There's no doubt about that.

1130
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:24,510
And it's the only thing beyond the
deeply pessimistic person that many ways,

1131
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:24,751
you know,

1132
00:45:24,751 --> 00:45:29,751
because I'm not naive about the depth
of suffering that characterizes the

1133
00:45:30,350 --> 00:45:32,130
existence for all sorts of reasons,

1134
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:34,410
partly because I woke
as deeply as I could.

1135
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,790
It took the atrocities that people are
taking bullets big during war time,

1136
00:45:38,791 --> 00:45:39,271
for example,

1137
00:45:39,271 --> 00:45:43,140
ordinary people to do
things he can't imagine.

1138
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,280
They can do things so terrible.

1139
00:45:44,281 --> 00:45:48,120
They're just reading about the will
leave a mark on you that you can never

1140
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:48,954
erase.

1141
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,680
And then people suffered
terribly and their you don't.

1142
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:52,930
No matter how materially.

1143
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:56,820
Fortunately our life is a very brutal
business and there's no doubt that it's

1144
00:45:56,821 --> 00:46:00,780
painted seriously with malevolence
and evil and that's the landscape.

1145
00:46:00,781 --> 00:46:03,900
But people were unbelievably

1146
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,270
unbelievable sources of future potential.

1147
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:11,790
And maybe it's different if
it's some sentence in August,

1148
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:12,820
I think about us.

1149
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,750
I don't think of us as
determined creatures,

1150
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,960
deterministic creatures that
money on our type like clockwork.

1151
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:24,060
I look at a his creatures who face
against the landscape of possibility of

1152
00:46:24,061 --> 00:46:25,650
potential that's in front of us.

1153
00:46:25,830 --> 00:46:28,430
And then we transform that
intentional rejection.

1154
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:32,430
All the partner of choice and our choices
are between what stood at what is not

1155
00:46:32,431 --> 00:46:33,030
going to,

1156
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:36,930
what's good and what's evil live as the
choice we're making all the time in the

1157
00:46:36,931 --> 00:46:40,980
landscape of the quest and be making
those choices when we confront,

1158
00:46:40,990 --> 00:46:45,990
potentially take the potential is very
trump recently turned it into the reality

1159
00:46:46,051 --> 00:46:49,470
that we have and that we actually do that.

1160
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,330
That's the consciousness ducks.

1161
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:53,010
And I think that the idea,

1162
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:55,080
and I made this up in my old lectures,

1163
00:46:55,490 --> 00:46:56,070
um,

1164
00:46:56,070 --> 00:47:00,390
I think the idea that human beings
are made in the image of God,

1165
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,940
God being that force of consciousness,

1166
00:47:02,941 --> 00:47:07,941
let's say that use this communication
conscious communication structure

1167
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:09,143
potential.

1168
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:13,200
I do think that that's an accurate
description of what human beings are.

1169
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,340
I do think that's the role
of consciousness and I
think that not only do we

1170
00:47:17,341 --> 00:47:20,970
construct a landscape of infinite
potential instream as we are,

1171
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:26,030
but we also bring to that landscape are
constrained infinite potential that we

1172
00:47:26,041 --> 00:47:29,100
can release if we have
the courage to release it.

1173
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:34,300
We released that by aiming as high as
we care about having the courage to tell

1174
00:47:34,301 --> 00:47:34,721
the truth.

1175
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:35,410
And to ask for,

1176
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:35,620
right,

1177
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,080
we have to conduct themselves
properly in the world.

1178
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:39,400
And you know,

1179
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:41,380
deeply pessimistic as I.

1180
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,030
I thought that idea more
powerful than the pessimism.

1181
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:47,770
I actually think it's.

1182
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:52,890
I haven't found an idea that I think is
more true than that and it's all taken

1183
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:57,730
hamline tones to it because
I wasn't looking for an
idea that can be just taking

1184
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:00,520
the first cohort comes along.

1185
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:01,483
You need something.

1186
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,570
You need a book that you
can be in during a storm.

1187
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:05,730
You know what?

1188
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:08,230
That's a boat and you
can be during the storm.

1189
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:10,060
Putting yourself together,

1190
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,980
back to your own best interests,

1191
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,870
put things together for your family,

1192
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:15,970
put things together for your community.

1193
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:17,410
A high take,

1194
00:48:17,411 --> 00:48:22,120
the potential that's in front of you and
cast it to the world that you wish to

1195
00:48:22,121 --> 00:48:23,560
live in that dorm.

1196
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,390
We have you do that.

1197
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:26,560
That's what you do.

1198
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:28,090
Whether you know it or not,

1199
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:30,820
and that's why it's also true that the,

1200
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,900
the destiny of the world and maybe more
than the world rests on each of our

1201
00:48:34,901 --> 00:48:35,800
shoulders.

1202
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:37,120
It's really the case.

1203
00:48:37,510 --> 00:48:40,720
It's because the individual
is a very strange creature.

1204
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,080
You know,

1205
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:45,250
it's easy to think of yourself as over
7 billion people in the that what the

1206
00:48:45,251 --> 00:48:46,990
hell difference does it make what you do?

1207
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:48,123
Well,

1208
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:49,721
first of all,

1209
00:48:49,721 --> 00:48:51,910
you know that that's
not a good way to think.

1210
00:48:52,430 --> 00:48:53,263
You know what I mean?

1211
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:58,320
You may not be able to think your way
of thinking that because you can make a

1212
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:03,940
logical and compelling case for the
fact that you just the dust mote among 7

1213
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:08,300
billion decimals in some corner of the
galaxy and what the hell difference is

1214
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,200
going to make it 100 million years anyway,

1215
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,880
but there's a part of you that knows that.

1216
00:49:12,881 --> 00:49:16,930
That's no philosophy to sustain
yourself with through life.

1217
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:19,720
You know that and so you
can't fake your way out of it,

1218
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:22,300
but you know that isn't what a person is.

1219
00:49:22,301 --> 00:49:23,230
As far as I can tell.

1220
00:49:23,230 --> 00:49:27,730
You're a divine locus of consciousness
and you are taking the process of

1221
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,760
bringing order into Ba and you decided
by your people decisions whether that

1222
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:37,870
order is going to be tilted towards
heaven or tilted towards health,

1223
00:49:37,930 --> 00:49:42,160
and if you don't believe that you should
read your fair share of 20th century

1224
00:49:42,161 --> 00:49:46,000
history and the hundreds of billions
of people who are who are killed and

1225
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:51,020
destroyed the trade in prison can start
brewed by people who were clearly aiming

1226
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,210
down and then you ask yourself,

1227
00:49:55,211 --> 00:49:55,361
well,

1228
00:49:55,361 --> 00:49:56,650
do you just believe that?

1229
00:49:56,710 --> 00:49:57,640
You just believe that?

1230
00:49:57,641 --> 00:50:02,590
That's down to just believe that that's
how it certainly close enough to help

1231
00:50:02,591 --> 00:50:07,591
for me and thinking if if it exists at
that matter will then the opposite of

1232
00:50:07,991 --> 00:50:12,730
that exists dogs or whatever
to the one from Auschwitz,

1233
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:13,300
right?

1234
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,910
That's where you're
having wherever that is.

1235
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,470
It's not so easy to specify,

1236
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,090
but it's.

1237
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,020
It's at least we're.

1238
00:50:19,021 --> 00:50:20,200
That isn't term,

1239
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,950
and you can start by making yourself
into the sort of person who wouldn't take

1240
00:50:23,951 --> 00:50:28,110
that path that was put in front
of the eye movement while you sure

1241
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,410
people do.

1242
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:42,620
Thank you.

1243
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:50,523
So

1244
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:55,613
I'm

1245
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,383
going

1246
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:05,410
to tell you,

1247
00:51:05,410 --> 00:51:08,440
if you're interested in doing two things,

1248
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,143
you know,

1249
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:12,610
in the upcoming weeks,

1250
00:51:13,090 --> 00:51:16,440
I just record the audio version of the

1251
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:28,700
and 12 rules

1252
00:51:30,830 --> 00:51:33,240
for the work I did on that initial call.

1253
00:51:33,640 --> 00:51:35,740
I wrote in 1985 until 19.

1254
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,820
I worked on it for about $3 a day just

1255
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:41,510
to get the safe Taco.

1256
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:46,511
It was very intense until I was trying
to address the question that I kind of

1257
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:48,010
started with debate,

1258
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,240
which is

1259
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:55,400
reasonable that there's such
a thing as an epic universal.

1260
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,710
Is that reasonable or is it just on?

1261
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:01,050
No,

1262
00:52:01,050 --> 00:52:01,280
no.

1263
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:02,540
I didn't know when I started working,

1264
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:06,750
which can be the case because
I'd say to me in the beginning,

1265
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,820
and it was probably more like,

1266
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:09,610
it was just a little
arbitrary interpretation.

1267
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,650
This is eastern 50 rationally know,

1268
00:52:12,651 --> 00:52:15,200
so it was a shock to me
to just start with that.

1269
00:52:15,201 --> 00:52:19,670
That was wrong and was a real shock
because it's really shocking to disturb

1270
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:24,120
one thing when you're sort of at of evil.

1271
00:52:24,230 --> 00:52:28,370
You think religious metaphor,

1272
00:52:28,371 --> 00:52:29,980
it's remote.

1273
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,291
It's like,

1274
00:52:30,291 --> 00:52:30,531
yeah,

1275
00:52:30,531 --> 00:52:32,120
I actually just really real.

1276
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:34,070
It's the most real thing.

1277
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:38,470
It's unbelievable to be real
and I do think it manifested,

1278
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:43,010
manifested itself in a terrible place
in the 20th century as far as I'm

1279
00:52:43,011 --> 00:52:43,700
concerned.

1280
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,910
It's no wonder people don't
like this idea around me.

1281
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:49,560
It means normally for rocking,

1282
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:53,810
just a physical in the sense
that he's done the ideas,

1283
00:52:53,830 --> 00:52:54,650
wanted to be involved,

1284
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:59,650
but it's also existentially terrifying
to understand that in some real sense,

1285
00:52:59,661 --> 00:53:02,060
the weight of the world
is on your shoulders.

1286
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,960
It reviews on your shoulders
and that's a question burden.

1287
00:53:04,990 --> 00:53:06,920
It's no wonder people
want to fly from that.

1288
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,390
It's actually nice because people think,

1289
00:53:09,391 --> 00:53:09,830
well,

1290
00:53:09,830 --> 00:53:11,480
I'd like to have meaningful life,

1291
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,201
you know,

1292
00:53:12,201 --> 00:53:13,360
because what's the alternative?

1293
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,800
A life that isn't.

1294
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,380
You don't have to do anything.

1295
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,920
That's the big payoff for being nihilistic
and perhaps was just like it doesn't

1296
00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:28,660
even 100 million years.

1297
00:53:28,661 --> 00:53:29,860
It isn't that bad word,

1298
00:53:29,861 --> 00:53:34,861
is it a higher use that pretty much
eliminates any responsibility from your

1299
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:36,653
world,

1300
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,440
but if you're actually responsible for
things or that natural whole different

1301
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:43,231
situation,

1302
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:45,900
that means that it actually
matters what you do.

1303
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:49,970
It really that it doesn't
just matter to you and Baxter,

1304
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,650
everyone you know you're
networked with other people.

1305
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:52,801
Well,

1306
00:53:52,801 --> 00:53:53,670
first of all,

1307
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:56,760
I learned this partly a
variety of different ways,

1308
00:53:56,761 --> 00:54:00,000
but I've learned a lot by reading
about what happened in LLC,

1309
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,040
Germany and in the Soviet Union.

1310
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:02,640
Also.

1311
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,860
I was trying all the other
terrible totalitarian states
because people debated.

1312
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,200
Academics debated for a long time
about why those things happened.

1313
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:11,000
You know,

1314
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:11,731
one theory is,

1315
00:54:11,731 --> 00:54:12,210
well,

1316
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,160
people are bad and so you get corrupt.

1317
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,330
Leaders have to talk board,

1318
00:54:15,331 --> 00:54:20,000
been emulating the masses and then the
order perfectly good ordinary people to

1319
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:24,380
do terrible things and that people are
terrified and serving that are kind of

1320
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,790
like sheep or they're terrified and
then they go implement the malevolent to

1321
00:54:27,930 --> 00:54:32,370
dastardly plans of the leaders
and that's a pretty credible idea,

1322
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,140
but it's wrong.

1323
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,543
It's wrong.

1324
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:40,660
It's like in a totalitarian
state like Nazi Germany or or,

1325
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,660
or stokers Soviet Union.

1326
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:44,760
Everyone was totalitarian.

1327
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:45,960
Everyone.

1328
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,650
It was bottom up and top down at the same
time and so everybody in that society

1329
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,830
was responsible for what
the society was doing.

1330
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,750
And I learned that by reading the
people who really thought about those

1331
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,630
societies.

1332
00:54:57,690 --> 00:54:59,190
If Viktor Frankl is a good example,

1333
00:54:59,191 --> 00:55:00,870
he wrote a book called
Man's search for meaning,

1334
00:55:00,871 --> 00:55:02,250
which I highly recommend.

1335
00:55:02,520 --> 00:55:04,230
You know what Frankel's conclusions was,

1336
00:55:04,231 --> 00:55:08,900
that it was the proclivity
of the normative person to
lie and deceive the vent

1337
00:55:08,901 --> 00:55:10,930
to the excesses of the state.

1338
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,990
The avoidance of responsibility.

1339
00:55:13,080 --> 00:55:13,940
As so as you said,

1340
00:55:13,941 --> 00:55:17,970
it's exactly the same thing about what
happened in the Soviet Union in eastern

1341
00:55:17,971 --> 00:55:18,510
Germany.

1342
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:19,343
Nice journey.

1343
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,310
One third of people were
government informants,

1344
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,060
so you might number one,

1345
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,940
it could have been convinced,

1346
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:27,770
right?

1347
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,040
Went back distance.

1348
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,690
One out of three people.

1349
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,940
So it means if you've got
a family of six people,

1350
00:55:32,941 --> 00:55:37,941
two of your close family members were
informing or you to a murderous machine,

1351
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,580
and so that's the responsibility.

1352
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:45,060
And so and so's netsuite and
other people have said the same.

1353
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,930
If you stand up and crib line
that you can defeat a tyranny.

1354
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:49,621
It's like,

1355
00:55:49,621 --> 00:55:49,741
well,

1356
00:55:49,741 --> 00:55:51,110
who the hell would ever get stopped?

1357
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:51,361
Well,

1358
00:55:51,361 --> 00:55:53,580
go under estimate the power of the truth.

1359
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,490
You mean why is the term so powerful?

1360
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,460
Because it's true.

1361
00:55:58,490 --> 00:55:59,520
It's reality,

1362
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:00,720
you know,

1363
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,350
what are you going to do?

1364
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,120
You're going to have an
argument with reality.

1365
00:56:03,570 --> 00:56:04,740
You think that's going work do,

1366
00:56:04,741 --> 00:56:05,600
yet you don't.

1367
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:08,230
The only reason you ever
think that is that you're.

1368
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:09,540
You're willfully blind to get.

1369
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:14,500
He refused to view the consequences of
your actions or you think deep down in

1370
00:56:14,501 --> 00:56:17,640
your soul goes deep down
at the theological level,

1371
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,830
way below your conscious apprehensions.

1372
00:56:19,831 --> 00:56:21,600
Wave along your political sentiments.

1373
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:22,950
When you blow your philosophy,

1374
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:26,190
believe you can get away with it.

1375
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,920
There's an arrogant beyond comprehension,

1376
00:56:30,370 --> 00:56:34,300
and you believe that you can tweak and
twist the fabric of reality with your

1377
00:56:34,301 --> 00:56:35,760
thoughts and your actions at that.

1378
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:39,880
Somehow you will be the
beneficiary of that.

1379
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:40,601
Well,

1380
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:41,800
good luck with that.

1381
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:42,610
That's it.

1382
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:47,610
That's all you have to think about that
idea for about a year because it take

1383
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:52,150
about a year to thinking through what
is the possibility that that's true,

1384
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:57,600
but you can take the structure of one
is at twisted for your own purposes and

1385
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:03,160
have that workout for you.

1386
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,930
That's not,

1387
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:05,893
that's,

1388
00:57:05,910 --> 00:57:06,940
that's just not.

1389
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:08,500
That's just not going anywhere.

1390
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:13,240
That archaea all these people who go
tangled up with you still tell it to her,

1391
00:57:13,250 --> 00:57:13,960
even jeans,

1392
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:14,530
you know,

1393
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:16,930
they advocated through a
little personal responsibility.

1394
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,080
They thought their lives didn't matter
or maybe they were willing to go along

1395
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:21,340
for the sake of the vulnerability.

1396
00:57:21,490 --> 00:57:24,230
They have their reasons
because these robots machines,

1397
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,650
but the consequences,

1398
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:30,340
but everything around with people did
to hell blaming that on the leaders.

1399
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:33,100
The leaders were manifestations of the,

1400
00:57:33,190 --> 00:57:35,170
of the metaphysical process,

1401
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:35,471
you know,

1402
00:57:35,471 --> 00:57:37,660
and they aren't spending
along with the charisma.

1403
00:57:37,661 --> 00:57:38,380
But you know,

1404
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,790
I read a lot about how Hitler figuring
out how to talk to the crowd because

1405
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:46,630
really interesting because Hitler was
against the door door and you always want

1406
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:48,130
to give the devil his due,

1407
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:48,730
you know.

1408
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:53,730
So what he would do is he talk to
the crowd and then he listened.

1409
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:00,030
I've never said anything but the
angry crowd was excited about that.

1410
00:58:01,541 --> 00:58:06,541
He kept that and sort of became a master
app telling the angry crowd what they

1411
00:58:07,811 --> 00:58:08,710
wanted to hear.

1412
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:12,170
What that meant in some sense
was that he allowed the product,

1413
00:58:12,210 --> 00:58:13,150
produced him.

1414
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,660
And the thing about an angry
crowd is that an angry crowd,

1415
00:58:16,661 --> 00:58:20,680
he's made it individually so I can
block your right when you're right,

1416
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,550
you're right and you're not
reading individually because
not be held accountable

1417
00:58:24,551 --> 00:58:25,384
for your actions.

1418
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:26,710
You can hide your path,

1419
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:31,410
log into the group and some of your
addressing on Bob and you want to rob you.

1420
00:58:31,450 --> 00:58:34,800
Then you have to tell the
paintings wants to hear me.

1421
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:37,470
Maybe if you do that for five
years and you're really good at it,

1422
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:40,570
you get it to be an absolute expert and
telling me a remark what it wants to

1423
00:58:40,571 --> 00:58:41,290
hear,

1424
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:42,710
and then maybe that's how Hitler,

1425
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,920
the German people created each other.

1426
00:58:45,470 --> 00:58:46,000
Unextended.

1427
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,680
Everyone's participated in that.

1428
00:58:47,681 --> 00:58:52,300
It's not Hitler who somehow genius
benches that does this all by itself.

1429
00:58:53,080 --> 00:58:57,460
It's the bitterness and resentment of
badly lived rights that manifested itself

1430
00:58:57,461 --> 00:58:59,530
in the desire for a totalitarian leader,

1431
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,970
finds a scapegoat that can be tortured
and tormented so that everybody could get

1432
00:59:03,971 --> 00:59:04,541
the revenge.

1433
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:05,680
He gets gone.

1434
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,780
That's essentially the proposition.

1435
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:14,790
Thank people can do terrible
things intently in rule sets.

1436
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:22,740
So now says

1437
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:32,840
saying it's the perfect order before
you criticize the world and it's a good

1438
00:59:32,841 --> 00:59:35,390
rule to talk about tonight because
of what happened in Toronto.

1439
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:36,280
So recently,

1440
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:38,300
you know that I'm ready.

1441
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:39,590
I'm not sure if this is correct.

1442
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,190
Even if it is technically correct,

1443
00:59:42,191 --> 00:59:43,370
this metaphysical correct.

1444
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,660
So it will give a of the trick,

1445
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:46,250
if I remember correctly,

1446
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:48,970
if I control that back and
drove it for 12 blocks,

1447
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:50,240
is that.

1448
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,073
Is that correct?

1449
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:51,891
Okay.

1450
00:59:51,891 --> 00:59:55,250
Now you to think about that even though
you don't want to because who wants to

1451
00:59:55,251 --> 00:59:56,150
think about that?

1452
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:02,080
Maybe you're unstable and angry and
see rick and now I'm going to see when

1453
01:00:02,090 --> 01:00:02,960
you're bitter,

1454
01:00:03,050 --> 01:00:05,630
you're driving your van and there
was a crowd of people and you think,

1455
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,021
oh,

1456
01:00:06,021 --> 01:00:06,721
to hell with it.

1457
01:00:06,721 --> 01:00:10,430
And you step on the gas and the mold
out of three people right in and that's

1458
01:00:10,431 --> 01:00:11,264
that.

1459
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:11,870
Okay.

1460
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:12,490
Less.

1461
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:15,230
You have to be in a pretty
damn dark place to do that,

1462
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:18,740
but that is anything compared
to the place that you're in.

1463
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:22,940
If you're going to drive on the sidewalk
for 12 blocks and you're going to take

1464
01:00:22,941 --> 01:00:24,940
people off one by one,

1465
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:29,210
knowing full well what you're
doing and what in reveling in it.

1466
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:33,340
I've heard it reported the next day
he called me up to talk about this.

1467
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:37,370
She said she watched the young
man who perpetrated this massacre,

1468
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:38,480
walked into the clock,

1469
01:00:38,510 --> 01:00:42,410
into the courtroom and she said it looked
like he was there to receive an award

1470
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,580
and so that's something else that has
to be factored in and we don't like to

1471
01:00:46,581 --> 01:00:47,660
think about these things.

1472
01:00:47,661 --> 01:00:48,260
You know,

1473
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:48,531
we don't,

1474
01:00:48,531 --> 01:00:52,590
we don't like because we might to think
even maybe that the person was oppressed

1475
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,750
to the predictive buys two subsets
and that's why they turn and take what

1476
01:00:56,751 --> 01:00:57,170
beginners.

1477
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:01,670
There's lots of old press people and very
few of them take a 12 blocks and take

1478
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:03,380
out the Mrs. April and then I knew,

1479
01:01:03,381 --> 01:01:04,670
we hear well he hated women.

1480
01:01:04,671 --> 01:01:04,971
It's like,

1481
01:01:04,971 --> 01:01:06,320
why you didn't just kill women.

1482
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,800
I mean certainly getting killed
mentor that had rejected him.

1483
01:01:09,890 --> 01:01:14,200
This was something far deeper and far
darker and it's a cannon to certain

1484
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,670
situation that can actually
only be contemplated,

1485
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,490
can only be understood using
something like theological language,

1486
01:01:19,491 --> 01:01:22,880
which is why I think theological language
actually exists because there are

1487
01:01:22,881 --> 01:01:27,320
things that are so terrible that there's
no way you can understand them unless

1488
01:01:27,321 --> 01:01:28,910
you use the white ones with good and evil.

1489
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:32,480
You're just not even
anything in the right domain.

1490
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:37,670
You have no idea where you have to go in
your fantasies to months and months and

1491
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:41,630
months until you start thinking of renting
a van and drive it down the sidewalk

1492
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:45,470
for 12 blocks and taking out into some
people is exactly what you should be

1493
01:01:45,471 --> 01:01:46,640
doing that day.

1494
01:01:46,850 --> 01:01:48,240
That's no wind band.

1495
01:01:48,650 --> 01:01:53,270
You've got some pretty damn dark places
before you get there and God only knows

1496
01:01:53,271 --> 01:01:55,130
what you need to those dark places.

1497
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,800
It's the same with high school shooters.

1498
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:02,890
These people plan and dream and fantasize
about the destruction that are going

1499
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:06,380
to wreak right then and
there and they're doing it.

1500
01:02:06,530 --> 01:02:07,190
You see,

1501
01:02:07,190 --> 01:02:07,500
you think,

1502
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:07,621
well,

1503
01:02:07,621 --> 01:02:08,570
why are they doing it?

1504
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,210
Maybe it's a mystery that the
columbine kids that come from,

1505
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,290
I remember correctly often for high
school shooters killed themselves.

1506
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,540
I think that's what happened
with the columbine kids.

1507
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:19,453
You might.

1508
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:21,420
Why in the world when you go home,

1509
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,410
the trouble when you say
it was a hopeless thing,

1510
01:02:25,411 --> 01:02:28,830
you're suicidal and people
get that way and you think,

1511
01:02:28,831 --> 01:02:29,101
okay,

1512
01:02:29,101 --> 01:02:30,180
well you're so hopeless.

1513
01:02:30,240 --> 01:02:31,830
Maybe your bitterly resentful.

1514
01:02:32,010 --> 01:02:34,020
Wife has dealt bad cards.

1515
01:02:34,090 --> 01:02:35,060
Maybe it really has.

1516
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:35,760
If you think,

1517
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,290
I just can't stand this anymore,

1518
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:40,530
you go down into the base took and you
know you put a pistol under your hand,

1519
01:02:42,540 --> 01:02:47,070
but that's a whole different thing that
going to to the school and shoot up a

1520
01:02:47,071 --> 01:02:50,580
bunch of people and authentic
killing yourself because it's.

1521
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:53,760
I call why bother with the whole murder?

1522
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:54,991
What's the point?

1523
01:02:54,991 --> 01:02:55,824
Exactly.

1524
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,020
You know you're not there anymore.

1525
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:00,180
Why don't you just do the
world a favor so to speak,

1526
01:03:00,181 --> 01:03:02,130
and I skipped the first part.

1527
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,300
The second part is the thing that you
should be pursuing or you're trying to

1528
01:03:06,301 --> 01:03:09,970
make a point in trying to
make some kind of point here.

1529
01:03:09,971 --> 01:03:10,860
Aiming at something.

1530
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:11,670
Right?

1531
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:14,340
You never know what you're trying to make
an appointment because they would give

1532
01:03:14,341 --> 01:03:17,580
you 100 million dollars for the
free publicity the next day.

1533
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:21,030
If you to effectively make your
point on what's your point.

1534
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:21,864
Exactly,

1535
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:25,050
exactly what's exactly your point.

1536
01:03:25,860 --> 01:03:28,740
Why are you killing innocent
people who like kicking?

1537
01:03:28,750 --> 01:03:32,340
The guy went into the elementary school
in Connecticut and shot elementary

1538
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,270
school kids.

1539
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:34,111
You think,

1540
01:03:34,111 --> 01:03:34,321
well,

1541
01:03:34,321 --> 01:03:35,690
why would you go back through them?

1542
01:03:35,710 --> 01:03:36,543
They're so innocent.

1543
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,110
It's like,

1544
01:03:37,110 --> 01:03:37,531
no,

1545
01:03:37,531 --> 01:03:38,490
you don't get it.

1546
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:40,620
That's why you go ask.

1547
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:42,930
I felt that a mystery.

1548
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:44,550
That's the reason.

1549
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:47,100
If you're going to extract revenge,

1550
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:48,870
why don't we go after the guilty?

1551
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:50,760
They deserve it.

1552
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,250
If you're really after revenge,

1553
01:03:53,550 --> 01:03:58,390
you go after the answer because it's
more vengeful to punish the innocent.

1554
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,910
That is to publish with
guilty and then you might ask,

1555
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,081
well,

1556
01:04:01,081 --> 01:04:02,100
why don't you want to punish?

1557
01:04:02,101 --> 01:04:04,140
The innocent told us

1558
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:12,320
is because your bitterness knows no bonds
is because you set yourself up as the

1559
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,290
judge of existence.

1560
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:21,500
The judge of being itself and the founding
of wanting in your estimation of your

1561
01:04:23,241 --> 01:04:27,230
own for revenge as a consequence and
the best way to conceptualize it.

1562
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:30,060
It's revenge against God and you think,

1563
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:30,271
well,

1564
01:04:30,271 --> 01:04:35,271
I don't believe when you
are in a situation like the
one we're describing what

1565
01:04:37,321 --> 01:04:41,790
you think you believe has almost
no bearing on the situation at all.

1566
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:47,250
You're acting on eternal little drama and
it's contract with a person who shoots

1567
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:52,251
his fist at the sky and
says how comfortable beating
of this nature possibly be

1568
01:04:52,771 --> 01:04:53,820
constituted.

1569
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:58,140
Everything should suffer for the outrage
of its existence and I'm just the

1570
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:02,490
person to make it suffer and that's
where we go with you want to shoot up the

1571
01:05:02,491 --> 01:05:06,450
high school and there's darker places
than that to have no one wants to

1572
01:05:06,451 --> 01:05:07,980
understand that because of the park,

1573
01:05:07,981 --> 01:05:10,050
because that's a bit
too close to the ball,

1574
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:11,400
but also partly because it's.

1575
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,370
It's a very terrible place
to revenge unoccupied.

1576
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:16,910
You'd kind of don't understand those.

1577
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:22,470
You're willing to take yourself and to
see the association would be people who

1578
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:27,280
do not start at the darkest
corners of your own psyche.

1579
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:28,983
Alright.

1580
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,010
People had an unbelievable
capacity for some people,

1581
01:05:33,011 --> 01:05:37,000
that's all of us and it comes out with
all sorts of ways and most of us are

1582
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:41,800
fortunate enough or well controlled enough
or lucky enough or good enough not to

1583
01:05:41,801 --> 01:05:46,360
hold those terribly dark places because
we're not capable of doing it and it

1584
01:05:46,361 --> 01:05:49,750
certainly the that could lead
sound around us constantly.

1585
01:05:54,730 --> 01:05:56,790
So what's the alternative to that?

1586
01:05:57,650 --> 01:05:59,560
The guy did this apparently.

1587
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,910
Was it in of I guess idea.

1588
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:05,770
He was rejected by rejected by women.

1589
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,220
I got him for man.

1590
01:06:07,221 --> 01:06:08,380
Generally speaking,

1591
01:06:08,650 --> 01:06:10,420
if all you've ever approached you,

1592
01:06:10,421 --> 01:06:13,150
do you have to do is ask him
something wrong with you,

1593
01:06:21,830 --> 01:06:22,663
right?

1594
01:06:24,410 --> 01:06:29,410
If you're trying to jury of your peers
and they find wanting is always the

1595
01:06:30,921 --> 01:06:35,390
possibility that you're just not quite
up to scratch and then you might think,

1596
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,990
well,

1597
01:06:35,990 --> 01:06:37,520
what should you do about that?

1598
01:06:37,610 --> 01:06:37,750
Well,

1599
01:06:37,750 --> 01:06:38,350
that's.

1600
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:39,183
You might think,

1601
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:39,740
well,

1602
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:42,530
there is some good grounds for revenge,

1603
01:06:42,560 --> 01:06:43,070
right?

1604
01:06:43,070 --> 01:06:47,150
I could refile half of the human
race because they rejected me,

1605
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:48,590
or the alternative is,

1606
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:49,070
well,

1607
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:53,240
maybe you might think about something
about yourself that could be improved and

1608
01:06:54,210 --> 01:06:59,180
that's daunting obviously because if
you have to accept that value that the

1609
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:03,520
reason you're being rejected is that the
reasons you're being rejected or coffee

1610
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,590
pretty damn d and that's
a bitter pill to swallow,

1611
01:07:06,591 --> 01:07:08,750
but what's the alternative?

1612
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,130
Well,

1613
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,290
the alternative is if you.

1614
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:12,221
It's failure,

1615
01:07:12,221 --> 01:07:13,230
it's abject failure.

1616
01:07:13,231 --> 01:07:18,050
You're constant existence to misery and
resentment and brief and that just keeps

1617
01:07:18,051 --> 01:07:18,831
the ball rolling.

1618
01:07:18,831 --> 01:07:19,370
Again,

1619
01:07:19,370 --> 01:07:23,060
the ultimate endpoint of that kind of
thought process is exactly what happened

1620
01:07:23,061 --> 01:07:23,894
in Toronto.

1621
01:07:24,370 --> 01:07:28,610
I don't want to have the courage to face
the unknown because people are always

1622
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:29,960
telling you what's wrong with you.

1623
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:33,980
If you listen because everyone else is
everyone else in homes that they can be

1624
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:37,040
more than they are because
everywhere you go you think,

1625
01:07:37,220 --> 01:07:37,971
wouldn't it be better?

1626
01:07:37,971 --> 01:07:41,280
Would it be good if I met someone
who was born and they are and they're

1627
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:42,620
disappointed when someone isn't.

1628
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:45,080
Be Interesting to talk to her when
they're jokes aren't funny or what?

1629
01:07:45,090 --> 01:07:46,880
They don't have anything
intelligent to say.

1630
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,400
What would they be turning
a little bit cooperative.

1631
01:07:49,401 --> 01:07:50,380
You can't trust them.

1632
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:55,540
You're deeply disappointing to me because
he couldn't be and so take as long as

1633
01:07:56,870 --> 01:08:00,050
you pay attention to what people are
talking and then they'll tell you what

1634
01:08:00,170 --> 01:08:02,090
about you and then if you listed the back,

1635
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:06,770
you can start to fix what's not good
about you and he'll be somewhat better and

1636
01:08:06,771 --> 01:08:11,771
that's a lot better than taking the
murderous route to resentment and full you

1637
01:08:13,310 --> 01:08:13,640
on.

1638
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,910
One of the things I really
admire the Old Testament Hebrews,

1639
01:08:16,911 --> 01:08:18,800
it's quite a remarkable thing.

1640
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,860
I think this is one of the things
that gives the biblical stories.

1641
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:23,150
They're immense.

1642
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:28,580
Archetypical power is flat so that all
the time their societies fall apart

1643
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,530
because they get very harsh wives,

1644
01:08:30,770 --> 01:08:32,060
very punished lives,

1645
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:33,620
and often you know what they've done,

1646
01:08:33,621 --> 01:08:36,830
the things that would enable them
to preserve that sort of faith,

1647
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:42,160
but the point is is that the old testament
is a rather brutal book and there's

1648
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:46,460
no shortage of multigenerational failure,

1649
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:51,850
but the one thing that he was constantly
refuse to do is to reject the idea that

1650
01:08:52,011 --> 01:08:56,210
the structure of existence
is five positive.

1651
01:08:57,230 --> 01:08:58,580
When they come to their senses,

1652
01:08:58,581 --> 01:09:03,320
they always think the reason that things
are impossible for us is because we're

1653
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:07,490
not able to think we could
be and that's very much more,

1654
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:09,650
what would you call it?

1655
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:12,050
Productive Line of meditation,

1656
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,110
and it's also much more optimistic.

1657
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:14,390
Now.

1658
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:18,320
One of the things I've really been struck
about while talking to so many people

1659
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:19,154
is that,

1660
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:20,150
you know,

1661
01:09:20,150 --> 01:09:25,150
for 30 or 40 years we've had this idea
that it's being promoted by psychologist,

1662
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:30,990
the luxury good ones that you should
feel good about yourself and should have

1663
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:33,140
some self esteem.

1664
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,280
You should feel good about yourself.

1665
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:36,200
I think that's complete rubbish.

1666
01:09:36,590 --> 01:09:40,100
I also think that people don't know that
that's rubbish and then it's actually a

1667
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:45,020
really pessimistic thing to tell
people because most people are not.

1668
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:46,153
Not everyone.

1669
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:51,310
Many people are not satisfied until they
are or what their likes are and it's

1670
01:09:52,380 --> 01:09:55,730
painful and maybe it's because they're
too judgmental about themselves to harm

1671
01:09:55,790 --> 01:09:56,180
themselves.

1672
01:09:56,180 --> 01:09:57,013
That happens,

1673
01:09:57,110 --> 01:09:59,960
but it's over because they know perfectly
well that they're doing everything

1674
01:09:59,961 --> 01:10:04,280
they could be and IPO that they could
be beckons and an ideal as a judge.

1675
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:05,180
At the same time.

1676
01:10:05,270 --> 01:10:07,070
One of the most brilliant
things I've ever read.

1677
01:10:07,071 --> 01:10:07,820
This was quite fertile.

1678
01:10:07,820 --> 01:10:08,360
You know,

1679
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:12,290
he was very interested in why the book
of revelation was appended to the end of

1680
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,590
the new testament because it's this
weird hallucinogenic psilocybin mushroom

1681
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,190
trip.

1682
01:10:17,190 --> 01:10:18,023
You know,

1683
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,340
it's a crazy,

1684
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:24,341
crazy book full of this saying it's
saying imagery and in that book,

1685
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:28,250
Christ comes back as the judge
with a sword coming on this device.

1686
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:32,270
People into the damp and the
elected her not her many elect.

1687
01:10:32,290 --> 01:10:32,900
You know,

1688
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,660
as a hell of a thing for
a failure of mercy to do.

1689
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:39,920
But one of the things you have pointed
out was that an ideal is always a judge

1690
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,020
and are something that really struck me
when I first read it because I thought,

1691
01:10:44,021 --> 01:10:44,111
well,

1692
01:10:44,111 --> 01:10:45,250
of course that's the case.

1693
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:46,580
If you put something,

1694
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,890
if you deposit stuff
has nothing to do with,

1695
01:10:49,200 --> 01:10:49,530
with,

1696
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:50,530
with with the.

1697
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:52,670
This is a psychological statement.

1698
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:54,620
If you positive an ideal,

1699
01:10:54,710 --> 01:10:55,470
if your idea,

1700
01:10:55,470 --> 01:10:58,910
if you imagine who you could be if
you were saying that you could make,

1701
01:10:59,260 --> 01:10:59,600
I'd say,

1702
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:03,380
and that sort of starts to shade it
to the idea of the mythological hero.

1703
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,860
I mean that starts to shape me into
the idea of the Messiah and the Savior.

1704
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,730
You start to imagine everything
that could be that you're not.

1705
01:11:09,770 --> 01:11:13,410
That's a terrible judge and
that's why that image is up.

1706
01:11:13,470 --> 01:11:18,470
The empathy that series of books is
because even if the ideal is all merciful,

1707
01:11:18,790 --> 01:11:22,260
just probably say how Christ is presented
in the new testament the judge has

1708
01:11:22,261 --> 01:11:26,820
missing and something that's perfect
as a judge and that we would come back.

1709
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,010
And so that was extraordinarily useful,

1710
01:11:29,070 --> 01:11:30,030
but it also.

1711
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:30,913
But he didn't let it take.

1712
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:34,690
It's an indication to have the price
he paid for participating in the value

1713
01:11:35,140 --> 01:11:36,030
because we can pause,

1714
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:37,200
we could be.

1715
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:40,530
Then you're instantly ashamed
in front of your own ideal,

1716
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,330
and I think it's appropriate.

1717
01:11:42,450 --> 01:11:43,890
I think that's exactly right.

1718
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:47,490
I don't mean that people should crush
themselves with guilt because I don't

1719
01:11:47,491 --> 01:11:48,870
think that's constructive,

1720
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,280
but if you think you have a
child that you turned to foster,

1721
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,770
you don't tell the child
everything they could be.

1722
01:11:56,250 --> 01:11:57,090
You don't ever do that.

1723
01:11:57,091 --> 01:11:57,400
You say,

1724
01:11:57,400 --> 01:11:59,370
look like you're on the right path,

1725
01:11:59,400 --> 01:11:59,880
man.

1726
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,410
You're developing your.

1727
01:12:01,470 --> 01:12:05,250
You encourage them to expand
themselves into the world and then say,

1728
01:12:05,251 --> 01:12:05,760
no,

1729
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:07,390
you're not gonna compare to one.

1730
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:08,250
You're going to be,

1731
01:12:08,650 --> 01:12:10,200
what are you going to be so great?

1732
01:12:10,590 --> 01:12:11,450
It's so great.

1733
01:12:11,480 --> 01:12:13,090
I'm lucky half laying
in front of him dead.

1734
01:12:13,500 --> 01:12:16,680
The fact that you're insufficient in
relationship to that is fine and then you

1735
01:12:16,681 --> 01:12:20,940
give them a destiny in the pathway and
one of the things that struck me so much

1736
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:25,590
since I've been talking to groups of
about this size is how how captivated

1737
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:28,770
people are by that idea because
they actually don't want to be told,

1738
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:29,071
yeah,

1739
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:30,090
you're okay the way you are,

1740
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,030
so I'm probably going to
do go home and you know,

1741
01:12:32,040 --> 01:12:32,750
be in your film,

1742
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:37,310
the bedroom and eventually your the bed
in box with bitter and depressed and

1743
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:39,420
take more self esteem.

1744
01:12:41,870 --> 01:12:46,870
Thank you.

1745
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:57,380
Start with small things and not an
works even starting permanently.

1746
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:57,990
You know,

1747
01:12:57,990 --> 01:13:00,120
so it's chapter four,

1748
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:03,420
which is a chapter above the alternative.

1749
01:13:03,430 --> 01:13:04,231
DMV says,

1750
01:13:04,231 --> 01:13:07,200
you should prepare yourself and who you
were yesterday instead of who someone

1751
01:13:07,201 --> 01:13:08,280
else's today.

1752
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:08,731
It's like,

1753
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:08,851
well,

1754
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,320
who knows what your destiny is?

1755
01:13:10,321 --> 01:13:11,010
The onset.

1756
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:14,550
It's a problem to comparing yourself to
other people who are successful because

1757
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:18,000
those other people aren't you
and you're a peculiar thing.

1758
01:13:18,150 --> 01:13:23,150
I get a singular thing and what's good
for you in the truest sense is going to

1759
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:27,420
be in the category of what's
good for other people,

1760
01:13:27,421 --> 01:13:30,930
but it's going to be an
idiosyncratic mortgage and circle.

1761
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:32,640
If you're going everything you could be,

1762
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:36,330
you can be bitter about that because
other people have more often the delusion

1763
01:13:36,380 --> 01:13:36,781
anyways,

1764
01:13:36,781 --> 01:13:38,010
although not always,

1765
01:13:38,190 --> 01:13:40,230
but you can get a tremendous way.

1766
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,480
You can get a tremendous
distance by thinking,

1767
01:13:42,481 --> 01:13:42,781
okay,

1768
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:43,440
well,

1769
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:44,070
you know,

1770
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:48,090
here I am and here's a bunch of
things that I know I'm doing wrong.

1771
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:50,850
There is a good thing to think
about that slight confession.

1772
01:13:50,851 --> 01:13:53,130
That's what the Catholics
were trying to do.

1773
01:13:53,250 --> 01:13:54,330
You know it's brilliant.

1774
01:13:54,331 --> 01:13:55,400
We've lost that idea.

1775
01:13:55,401 --> 01:14:00,401
Ideas go somewhere once a week and
tell someone why you're pathetic and

1776
01:14:02,450 --> 01:14:03,283
well,

1777
01:14:03,300 --> 01:14:07,200
it's not something that you think that
you're pathetic and useless and so that

1778
01:14:07,201 --> 01:14:11,070
you can get one isn't so good about
you right here in front of you

1779
01:14:13,590 --> 01:14:14,423
and

1780
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,370
me and Brian and you
know now otherwise empty.

1781
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:21,090
You could have killed me.

1782
01:14:21,390 --> 01:14:26,390
Them some possibility that I could take
attendance step towards setting in a

1783
01:14:27,340 --> 01:14:27,610
second.

1784
01:14:27,610 --> 01:14:29,050
That's a tome I'm right.

1785
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:30,430
That's redemption,

1786
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:31,761
right?

1787
01:14:31,761 --> 01:14:32,290
That's,

1788
01:14:32,290 --> 01:14:37,000
that's the recreation of your spirit and
the resurrection of your relationship

1789
01:14:37,001 --> 01:14:39,520
with divinity that it's part of,

1790
01:14:39,521 --> 01:14:40,271
you know,

1791
01:14:40,271 --> 01:14:40,610
yes.

1792
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:41,590
What that is.

1793
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:45,400
It's the right way you're thinking about
and you can get there by admission on

1794
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:49,530
the hour and that's why humility is one
of the fundamental religious virtues.

1795
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,330
It took me a long time to figure
that out because humility,

1796
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:55,730
it sounds like such a wretched
and pathetic virtual learning.

1797
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:56,590
So humble.

1798
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:57,513
It's like

1799
01:14:58,920 --> 01:15:00,830
that's my narratives but.

1800
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:02,480
But that isn't it.

1801
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:03,990
Like the humility is,

1802
01:15:03,991 --> 01:15:08,991
is that there's things you don't know
and they're really important and you

1803
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,680
should be doing is opening
yourself up and thinking bad.

1804
01:15:11,830 --> 01:15:16,830
There was no learning is going to strip
me as soon as strip me of all my bad

1805
01:15:16,871 --> 01:15:17,231
habits.

1806
01:15:17,231 --> 01:15:17,410
No.

1807
01:15:17,410 --> 01:15:20,350
My debt would it be like
passing through a fire,

1808
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:21,910
but I'm open to it as well.

1809
01:15:21,911 --> 01:15:24,160
I'm always locate to
see what I don't know.

1810
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,990
I'm always looking to
see what's wrong with me.

1811
01:15:25,991 --> 01:15:26,801
That can be set,

1812
01:15:26,801 --> 01:15:27,634
right?

1813
01:15:27,670 --> 01:15:27,821
Well,

1814
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:32,110
that's humility and you know there's
a lot more that you don't know that,

1815
01:15:32,111 --> 01:15:34,680
that you do know and you
might also ask your questions,

1816
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:35,470
ask yourself,

1817
01:15:35,470 --> 01:15:35,800
well,

1818
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:38,200
how well is what you know working for you,

1819
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:38,950
right?

1820
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:39,430
If you can,

1821
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:40,840
are you who you should be,

1822
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,790
are you who you couldn't be happy,

1823
01:15:42,791 --> 01:15:44,650
you the world right around you?

1824
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:45,880
Or if the answer is no,

1825
01:15:45,881 --> 01:15:47,830
then what you know is to not obviously,

1826
01:15:47,831 --> 01:15:49,570
because what are you doing?

1827
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,530
There's always things that you couldn't
be doing that you're not doing it,

1828
01:15:52,540 --> 01:15:54,370
so you have a lot to learn.

1829
01:15:55,000 --> 01:16:00,000
You know I wrote in chapter nine that
you should assume that the person you're

1830
01:16:00,971 --> 01:16:01,600
listening to,

1831
01:16:01,600 --> 01:16:03,010
those something you build,

1832
01:16:03,700 --> 01:16:05,050
and this is a great thing.

1833
01:16:05,080 --> 01:16:06,780
This is a really intermarriage I can.

1834
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:07,900
I can tell you this.

1835
01:16:07,990 --> 01:16:09,100
If you want to improve your parents,

1836
01:16:09,101 --> 01:16:10,270
your relationship with your kids,

1837
01:16:10,271 --> 01:16:11,650
any intimate relationship,

1838
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:13,430
this is something really worth knowing.

1839
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:16,930
You don't have your children
or your wife and your husband,

1840
01:16:16,960 --> 01:16:18,610
her unbelievably annoying.

1841
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:20,540
You have to live with her was wrong,

1842
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:20,740
bro.

1843
01:16:20,740 --> 01:16:24,030
Everything I saw them,

1844
01:16:25,030 --> 01:16:30,030
but here's the things that even if 90
percent of what they're telling you is

1845
01:16:30,071 --> 01:16:30,904
wrong,

1846
01:16:31,390 --> 01:16:33,650
10 percent of these right now,

1847
01:16:33,700 --> 01:16:35,290
if your wife was criticizing you,

1848
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:37,350
which is a high probability of error,

1849
01:16:38,580 --> 01:16:43,580
you have to help her figure out her
criticisms as accurate as possible and you

1850
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,960
want to defend myself a go.

1851
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:49,370
Fair enough assumption of
innocence and all of that,

1852
01:16:49,860 --> 01:16:51,040
but that's not the point.

1853
01:16:51,220 --> 01:16:55,150
The point is you're going to have to
play this game with her and hopefully you

1854
01:16:55,151 --> 01:17:00,010
would like again to approve across time
and the probability that you're carrying

1855
01:17:00,011 --> 01:17:02,580
some baggage along that isn't babies.

1856
01:17:02,700 --> 01:17:06,760
It's three high earnings for percent.

1857
01:17:10,210 --> 01:17:11,620
Listen to her.

1858
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:15,890
Someone around with her and criticisms

1859
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:19,380
one one.

1860
01:17:19,380 --> 01:17:20,690
Are you on target?

1861
01:17:20,691 --> 01:17:21,170
Anything?

1862
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:21,840
Oh my God,

1863
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:22,220
no,

1864
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:24,080
I really stupid like that.

1865
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:29,850
And then you favor because stupid people
fall into a pit when they walk more and

1866
01:17:30,711 --> 01:17:35,711
so maybe not being hit that you could
avoid and so well in mass and then it's a

1867
01:17:36,711 --> 01:17:36,981
so,

1868
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:37,730
so,

1869
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:39,250
so you.

1870
01:17:39,770 --> 01:17:42,770
You listened to people as if they might
have something to tell you because

1871
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:45,920
there's the off chance that they can
provide you with a bit of information that

1872
01:17:45,921 --> 01:17:50,921
would be not be so stupid as your down
and if you really understand that there's

1873
01:17:51,321 --> 01:17:54,170
all sorts of things that you have to go
right and then you're not doing great at

1874
01:17:54,171 --> 01:17:54,770
that you're not.

1875
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,890
You shouldn't be or could be added.

1876
01:17:56,930 --> 01:18:00,470
That's actually important that you can
come out and maybe you're desperate and

1877
01:18:00,471 --> 01:18:03,610
you're grasping every time you'd
have a conversation with someone,

1878
01:18:03,750 --> 01:18:08,370
a little bit of truth that they might
be struggling to articulate that so you

1879
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:11,140
can walk away with the
gold from the dragging.

1880
01:18:11,870 --> 01:18:12,081
Right,

1881
01:18:12,081 --> 01:18:14,390
because it's still fun
confronting and a response,

1882
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:15,091
that's for sure,

1883
01:18:15,091 --> 01:18:18,770
but maybe they flannel in every direction
and try to hack you into ribbons,

1884
01:18:18,771 --> 01:18:19,070
you know,

1885
01:18:19,070 --> 01:18:21,410
because they're not very good
at pointing their criticisms.

1886
01:18:21,411 --> 01:18:23,900
But it is possible that if you listened,

1887
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:26,090
God made man.

1888
01:18:26,430 --> 01:18:27,800
I truly out and like,

1889
01:18:27,801 --> 01:18:27,991
you know,

1890
01:18:27,991 --> 01:18:29,080
we're going to horrible itch,

1891
01:18:29,090 --> 01:18:29,923
but

1892
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:37,220
definitely something that will make
me slightly stupid that I have.

1893
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:47,060
Thank you.

1894
01:18:54,210 --> 01:18:57,460
So to recap,

1895
01:18:59,550 --> 01:19:02,180
set forth a set of propositions.

1896
01:19:04,220 --> 01:19:07,760
The first proposition is that there
is a very large number of ways of

1897
01:19:07,761 --> 01:19:12,390
interpreting the world and so that leads
us into the domain of horrible belt

1898
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:13,263
visit.

1899
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,980
There's all sorts of
horrors that lurk there,

1900
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:18,770
but it's a powerful idea.

1901
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:21,980
There's some truth to it because the
world is very complex and there's lots of

1902
01:19:21,981 --> 01:19:25,400
ways of looking at and maybe but then,

1903
01:19:25,450 --> 01:19:26,690
but then that's constraint.

1904
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,640
We talked about how it
might be constraints.

1905
01:19:28,641 --> 01:19:33,260
Constraint is constrained by the SSS
necessity of planning integrative social

1906
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:35,870
gates and also being
not only social games,

1907
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:40,250
games that don't have the natural world
kill you as well because there's always

1908
01:19:40,251 --> 01:19:40,551
that,

1909
01:19:40,551 --> 01:19:40,970
right.

1910
01:19:40,970 --> 01:19:44,810
You have to conduct yourself in a way
that makes other people except you,

1911
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:46,130
including your future self,

1912
01:19:46,131 --> 01:19:50,570
but you also have to not just die and
so that's another set of very powerful

1913
01:19:50,571 --> 01:19:52,480
constraints and then be foreign law.

1914
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:58,000
Maybe there's a pattern to the bones of
being that fulfill those criteria and

1915
01:19:58,311 --> 01:20:02,900
maybe as human beings have observed
themselves over centuries or millennia and

1916
01:20:02,901 --> 01:20:07,100
we've crafted stories about
figures of good fingers of evil.

1917
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,100
We be trying to do is to represent
that pattern that allows us to sustain

1918
01:20:11,101 --> 01:20:15,060
ourselves to thrive across the multiple
sets of ethical games that were played

1919
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:15,970
and then it's not,

1920
01:20:15,970 --> 01:20:17,880
in fact the idea of the mental health,

1921
01:20:17,970 --> 01:20:18,181
human,

1922
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:19,140
what we send out,

1923
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:24,980
our deepest religious preconceptions
emerge and their branded an accurate

1924
01:20:25,051 --> 01:20:28,200
reflection of the way that people conduct
themselves in the world and that's the

1925
01:20:28,201 --> 01:20:30,000
ideal app which to me,

1926
01:20:30,650 --> 01:20:32,880
and that requires

1927
01:20:36,140 --> 01:20:36,801
and requirements.

1928
01:20:36,801 --> 01:20:40,070
The willingness to understand what that
what you don't know is more important

1929
01:20:40,071 --> 01:20:44,960
than what you know and it requires the
willingness to lay yourself open to the

1930
01:20:44,961 --> 01:20:48,830
fire that consumes it destroys
a you and it's a very,

1931
01:20:48,831 --> 01:20:50,180
very difficult thing to.

1932
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:51,531
It's a very,

1933
01:20:51,531 --> 01:20:52,940
very difficult thing to submit to you,

1934
01:20:52,941 --> 01:20:57,560
which is where people don't submit to it
and it's no wonder that the rewards are

1935
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:01,580
tremendous and their punishments
for not doing it as hell.

1936
01:21:15,330 --> 01:21:16,680
I think I'll stop with that.

1937
01:21:18,550 --> 01:21:23,550
Thank you.

1938
01:21:37,470 --> 01:21:42,470
Thank you.

1939
01:21:43,390 --> 01:21:48,390
Thank you.

1940
01:21:54,950 --> 01:21:55,783
After

1941
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,560
number one,

1942
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:02,870
thinking on your feet,

1943
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:06,850
all these talks,

1944
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:11,890
that gives me an opportunity to continue
to develop thinking about and also to

1945
01:22:12,381 --> 01:22:15,650
see what the consequences
of that are real time.

1946
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:17,650
So I think that the BDC,

1947
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:18,900
these talks,

1948
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:23,240
they're not hear their
conversations and you might think,

1949
01:22:23,241 --> 01:22:26,760
well they can be because
I'm the only one talking

1950
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:29,283
terms.

1951
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:34,500
It's not true because people communicate
box of what we communicate with words,

1952
01:22:35,091 --> 01:22:40,040
but we also communicate with our facial
expressions and with our bodily posture

1953
01:22:40,041 --> 01:22:41,710
and with our our movements.

1954
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:42,220
I can.

1955
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:45,710
I can tell if I'm wanting to
something that's working properly,

1956
01:22:45,711 --> 01:22:50,711
I can tell because no one in the
audience moves and it's so cool.

1957
01:22:50,751 --> 01:22:51,250
It's.

1958
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:52,071
It's the same reason to.

1959
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:53,930
The rabbit doesn't move
when it looks at a wolf.

1960
01:22:54,810 --> 01:22:55,880
It's the same thing.

1961
01:22:56,100 --> 01:22:59,600
If it's the same cycle
physiological systems and it's.

1962
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:03,550
It's the art part of your brain
that evolved to Dka predators.

1963
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:06,220
These transfixed an idea

1964
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:10,470
because the idea has the idea
has something that's inspiring,

1965
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:11,620
wrapped up inside of it,

1966
01:23:12,040 --> 01:23:17,040
and you can detect that and so you
freeze and so I've known that I wanted to

1967
01:23:17,291 --> 01:23:19,570
something that has the same
archetipal significance.

1968
01:23:19,571 --> 01:23:22,570
If everybody in the audience
doesn't move and so,

1969
01:23:22,660 --> 01:23:27,660
but that's kind of what you want for
the talk is to see to see how much the

1970
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:32,620
dining and keep the audience transfixed
in some sense and that transaction is so

1971
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:37,621
interesting because it's a manifestation
of their instinct for being held so

1972
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:39,190
because when you're.

1973
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:42,970
When you're,

1974
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:43,780
when you're,

1975
01:23:43,780 --> 01:23:46,570
when you encounter something meaningful
drugs to the encounter and what the

1976
01:23:46,571 --> 01:23:47,570
world is made up,

1977
01:23:47,860 --> 01:23:48,540
that's a very,

1978
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,180
very concrete.

1979
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:51,640
What matters in the world
is made out of what matters.

1980
01:23:51,820 --> 01:23:53,640
It really is Beethoven for practice.

1981
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:55,153
There's two.

1982
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:58,090
There's two definitions for that.

1983
01:23:58,530 --> 01:23:59,410
For that word.

1984
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:03,790
We act like the world is data and Madison
and then when you encountered that,

1985
01:24:03,791 --> 01:24:05,080
that it transfixes you,

1986
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:09,130
and so if you're speaking to an audience
and you're paying attention by watching

1987
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:11,250
the audience because you're
not afraid of the audience,

1988
01:24:11,251 --> 01:24:13,000
let's say apprehensive of the audience,

1989
01:24:13,001 --> 01:24:13,990
but not afraid of it,

1990
01:24:14,200 --> 01:24:17,920
then you can tell when you're
pursuing a pathway that has,

1991
01:24:18,190 --> 01:24:23,190
it has substance and so it's
a great opportunity to to
communicate in real time.

1992
01:24:25,710 --> 01:24:26,770
It's a good example.

1993
01:24:26,890 --> 01:24:30,070
I think it's the best example of a very
good example of what free speech is so

1994
01:24:30,071 --> 01:24:31,360
important because see,

1995
01:24:31,361 --> 01:24:33,980
this is how you can fake
because you can't think,

1996
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:34,310
oh,

1997
01:24:34,310 --> 01:24:37,720
because you're too stupid and
bias and ignorant and curriculum,

1998
01:24:37,810 --> 01:24:41,590
narrow minded and unidimensional
and so you can take a little bit,

1999
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:45,100
but he can't really think to get your
thoughts out there and other people can

2000
01:24:45,101 --> 01:24:46,150
kind of fall on them.

2001
01:24:46,450 --> 01:24:47,201
In some sense.

2002
01:24:47,201 --> 01:24:50,360
That's the free market of ideas
that sharpens you up with your,

2003
01:24:50,390 --> 01:24:51,040
with your.

2004
01:24:51,040 --> 01:24:56,040
If you're willing and able to let that
opinion habits the way we were thinking.

2005
01:24:56,470 --> 01:24:57,010
No,

2006
01:24:57,010 --> 01:25:00,070
it doesn't mean that you're
blind follower if the crowd.

2007
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,370
It's not the life that it has to
be more sophisticated than that,

2008
01:25:03,371 --> 01:25:03,980
but,

2009
01:25:03,980 --> 01:25:04,850
but uh,

2010
01:25:06,580 --> 01:25:06,791
but uh,

2011
01:25:06,791 --> 01:25:08,470
so I don't care if I
get through the rules,

2012
01:25:08,490 --> 01:25:08,711
you know,

2013
01:25:08,711 --> 01:25:11,830
it's not because it's about the
process that generates the rules.

2014
01:25:11,950 --> 01:25:12,910
That's what it's about.

2015
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,240
And a good talk is,

2016
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:15,300
is that it's,

2017
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:20,240
it's active participation in the
process that transforms potential into

2018
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:23,830
actuality that African women last
participated in that because that's,

2019
01:25:24,130 --> 01:25:25,450
that's the core of the world,

2020
01:25:25,451 --> 01:25:25,960
that,

2021
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,190
that's the core of the work.

2022
01:25:27,880 --> 01:25:28,713
So.

2023
01:25:28,810 --> 01:25:29,643
Well

2024
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,910
thanks.

2025
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:36,160
Have a great lesson

2026
01:25:37,910 --> 01:25:38,390
here.

2027
01:25:38,390 --> 01:25:39,970
What I was saying about
this week that I got.

2028
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:42,880
Did you guys ever offered.

2029
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:43,460
Okay,

2030
01:25:43,460 --> 01:25:44,000
so,

2031
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:47,980
so there's an affiliate that there
will be picture that I think it's his

2032
01:25:47,981 --> 01:25:50,690
girlfriend and showed all
the people in the audience.

2033
01:25:52,830 --> 01:25:57,830
It was so great to be here with so many
peers in bed because he doesn't talk

2034
01:25:58,001 --> 01:25:59,840
about his daily life basically.

2035
01:26:00,270 --> 01:26:01,103
So

2036
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:03,933
was

2037
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:12,380
sort of a coming out coming out like
I'm okay with listening to ideas that

2038
01:26:13,661 --> 01:26:18,661
that's fascinating to me that people
in their regular life that Peterson got

2039
01:26:19,540 --> 01:26:20,930
that somehow controversial

2040
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:31,140
thank in some ways because I think the
reason that uncontroversial most quite

2041
01:26:33,531 --> 01:26:34,590
ridiculous because

2042
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:41,210
being painted with this sort of Albright
depressed from time to time because I

2043
01:26:41,220 --> 01:26:46,220
stood up against art stood up against I
suppose what I regarded as some of the

2044
01:26:46,551 --> 01:26:51,551
excesses of the 11th and one was
about the transgender program issue.

2045
01:26:53,050 --> 01:26:56,720
It's like I fought for a long time
ever since I started teaching.

2046
01:26:58,400 --> 01:27:02,060
I started teaching him to gale and I went
to Boston and then I came to Toronto.

2047
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:05,180
I thought for years that if anybody
ever actually figured out what I was

2048
01:27:05,181 --> 01:27:06,680
teaching about health debate,

2049
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:12,860
because honestly radical until
ridiculously rapid though,

2050
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:18,000
the political radical part
of it is just surface noise.

2051
01:27:18,380 --> 01:27:23,380
I would say there's things underneath
editor way more than that because I really

2052
01:27:24,651 --> 01:27:25,940
do believe what I told him tonight.

2053
01:27:25,941 --> 01:27:29,810
I do believe that human beings are
divine locus of consciousness and I do

2054
01:27:29,811 --> 01:27:32,420
believe that consciousness
creates or from potential,

2055
01:27:32,770 --> 01:27:36,080
and I do believe that our wines are
fundamentally ethical and then they make a

2056
01:27:36,081 --> 01:27:38,390
decision between heaven and
hell every time we have.

2057
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:40,100
I think those things are true.

2058
01:27:40,340 --> 01:27:40,761
In fact,

2059
01:27:40,761 --> 01:27:44,440
I think the neurological evidence
suggests that they're true of really

2060
01:27:44,450 --> 01:27:46,810
interesting conversation
with the Ian Mcgilchrist,

2061
01:27:46,811 --> 01:27:48,440
which you guys might
want to look up on that.

2062
01:27:48,441 --> 01:27:49,940
We're going to talk about that more.

2063
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:54,890
I think these fundamental benefits of
presuppositions are the truest things

2064
01:27:54,891 --> 01:27:55,760
there are,

2065
01:27:56,120 --> 01:27:59,770
and so that's crazy radical and so we
probably shouldn't have listened to the

2066
01:27:59,771 --> 01:28:00,270
beach front.

2067
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:04,790
Just go home and hide under
your bed longer than out here.

2068
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:08,960
I guess we'll do a couple of
questions to asked me all the time.

2069
01:28:08,961 --> 01:28:11,950
What is Jordan like La Capra,

2070
01:28:12,540 --> 01:28:13,180
this,

2071
01:28:13,180 --> 01:28:16,140
this is the bad all the time by sharing.

2072
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:17,030
This is the real deal.

2073
01:28:17,290 --> 01:28:18,650
There's a ton of great stuff here.

2074
01:28:18,700 --> 01:28:18,890
Uh,

2075
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:19,820
so first off,

2076
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:23,650
will you consider doing a guest
appearance on kind of these new album

2077
01:28:28,060 --> 01:28:32,670
trying lot of weird things that the
penalty in the last year and that's

2078
01:28:32,690 --> 01:28:34,690
certainly up there with the weirdness.

2079
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,740
There's lots of things that have happened
to make it very difficult for me to

2080
01:28:42,741 --> 01:28:44,810
say anything and believe it or not.

2081
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:49,970
And that's one of them and just I
can see you with a little blade.

2082
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:53,660
I like this one.

2083
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:58,170
How do you know when you give up on
something when it's not worth pursuing

2084
01:28:58,230 --> 01:28:59,063
anymore?

2085
01:28:59,570 --> 01:29:00,710
That's a great question.

2086
01:29:02,210 --> 01:29:02,430
Well,

2087
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:03,500
I would say one,

2088
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,980
one way of going to have
a viable alternative,

2089
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,450
right?

2090
01:29:09,450 --> 01:29:09,960
I mean,

2091
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,450
so let's say you know,

2092
01:29:11,610 --> 01:29:14,430
you've dealt with the pathway
and you might take well shit

2093
01:29:17,280 --> 01:29:17,460
on,

2094
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:17,911
you know,

2095
01:29:17,911 --> 01:29:18,180
maybe,

2096
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:18,970
maybe if you just,

2097
01:29:18,970 --> 01:29:23,700
persistence will pay off not just one of
the real complicated things about life

2098
01:29:23,701 --> 01:29:26,280
because it's harder to
tell the difference between

2099
01:29:28,380 --> 01:29:33,380
persistence and blind stupidity because
you should obviously steve versus the

2100
01:29:34,450 --> 01:29:38,960
things that are due to failure of the is
you can't predict what comes one of the

2101
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,570
clinical practices and people were
doubtful about what they were doing.

2102
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:50,060
We would look at their fantasies and
dreams because technically I think the

2103
01:29:50,430 --> 01:29:52,520
neurological evidence
for this is quite clear.

2104
01:29:53,130 --> 01:29:57,210
Your left hemisphere tends to impose on
the world a structured and predictable

2105
01:29:57,211 --> 01:30:02,211
wall and your right hemisphere looks for
exceptions out the normal ones and all

2106
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:06,290
of those exceptions and anomalies
attempts to generate fantasies.

2107
01:30:06,390 --> 01:30:09,630
All my clients and you're
having a relationship that
you're trying to maintain

2108
01:30:09,631 --> 01:30:11,010
it when it's not very satisfying.

2109
01:30:11,011 --> 01:30:13,290
So we start having fantasies
about other people.

2110
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:13,561
Well,

2111
01:30:13,561 --> 01:30:16,530
what's happening in your right hemisphere?

2112
01:30:16,590 --> 01:30:17,900
This is broadly speaking,

2113
01:30:17,901 --> 01:30:18,710
you know,

2114
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:20,460
so forgive me for that.

2115
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:24,600
For the oversimplification of your right
hemisphere is starting to tentatively

2116
01:30:24,601 --> 01:30:29,190
lay on alternative pathways that you
might pursue and so if you're wondering

2117
01:30:29,191 --> 01:30:32,250
about whether what you're doing is worth
doing and then what you might want to

2118
01:30:32,251 --> 01:30:36,510
do is sit down and make about three plans
and talk to someone who you can trust

2119
01:30:36,511 --> 01:30:36,691
and say,

2120
01:30:36,691 --> 01:30:36,931
okay,

2121
01:30:36,931 --> 01:30:38,670
if I wasn't doing this,

2122
01:30:38,760 --> 01:30:43,050
what else could I be doing that would be
approximately is difficult because you

2123
01:30:43,051 --> 01:30:47,190
don't want to fool yourself into thinking
you should stop just because what

2124
01:30:47,220 --> 01:30:50,830
you're doing these car and pretend
that that was because you failed.

2125
01:30:51,150 --> 01:30:53,100
You have to be careful so
you don't fool yourself.

2126
01:30:53,101 --> 01:30:53,371
You say,

2127
01:30:53,371 --> 01:30:53,761
well look,

2128
01:30:53,761 --> 01:30:57,750
I'm giving lay out three alternative
paths that are just as difficult.

2129
01:30:57,810 --> 01:31:00,710
They would also be worthwhile
and then I have some options.

2130
01:31:00,740 --> 01:31:03,840
Then you have to do the difficult things
necessary to ensure that those will be

2131
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:07,800
launched and actually have what
might constitute a genuine choice,

2132
01:31:08,250 --> 01:31:10,800
and so that's how I would deal with that.

2133
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:15,160
I love this one because someone
is clearly paying attention.

2134
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:16,160
What's going on?

2135
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:17,480
Just at the moment,

2136
01:31:17,780 --> 01:31:19,780
our friend Eric Weinstein coined a phrase,

2137
01:31:19,820 --> 01:31:24,820
the phrase this morning that I really
love all of our I he say is his selection

2138
01:31:26,841 --> 01:31:30,110
of writers who are constantly feeding.

2139
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:32,660
So the question is what,

2140
01:31:32,661 --> 01:31:35,540
if anything should we do about the w,

2141
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:38,020
r I t continuing to spirit?

2142
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,700
You and your supporters as all right.

2143
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:41,490
We talked a little.

2144
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:44,010
I don't really think I
should do anything about it.

2145
01:31:45,230 --> 01:31:50,230
I think that the time for me to be
taken down except by my own stupidity is

2146
01:31:50,870 --> 01:31:53,200
maybe gone and so

2147
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:03,673
no,

2148
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:04,653
I'm

2149
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:14,260
perfectly aware of how on all decisions
with how easy it would be for me too.

2150
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:20,150
You've made a major error and to
suffer the consequences later,

2151
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:22,890
but right now what's
happened and that's it.

2152
01:32:22,891 --> 01:32:24,000
This has been the case,

2153
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,430
probably six that Catholic
newman interviewed,

2154
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,890
but maybe a little bit before that

2155
01:32:29,470 --> 01:32:30,750
I can keep.

2156
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:31,920
This isn't.

2157
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,020
These criticisms aren't hurting me.

2158
01:32:34,530 --> 01:32:39,530
All these seem to be doing is drawing
more attention to what I'm doing and then

2159
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:40,591
okay,

2160
01:32:40,591 --> 01:32:44,070
that's just fine as far as I'm
concerned because I've asked myself,

2161
01:32:44,071 --> 01:32:44,181
well,

2162
01:32:44,181 --> 01:32:45,090
what am I doing?

2163
01:32:45,480 --> 01:32:46,570
Hell No.

2164
01:32:48,870 --> 01:32:49,703
What?

2165
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:51,940
What I'm doing is what we're doing here.

2166
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:57,510
You know what I find most
gratifying is autonomous story.

2167
01:32:57,540 --> 01:32:57,820
Okay.

2168
01:32:57,820 --> 01:32:58,630
Because,

2169
01:32:58,630 --> 01:32:59,463
because Mrs.

2170
01:33:01,110 --> 01:33:01,943
so

2171
01:33:04,020 --> 01:33:04,980
you were a.

2172
01:33:05,650 --> 01:33:10,650
It became a New York.

2173
01:33:15,740 --> 01:33:17,420
Downtown colleagues is pretty rough.

2174
01:33:17,490 --> 01:33:18,740
There's places you don't want to go.

2175
01:33:18,820 --> 01:33:20,380
And I went to some of them.

2176
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:21,673
I'm

2177
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,640
walking around with my wife.

2178
01:33:26,340 --> 01:33:28,760
We were walking down the
street car pulled up,

2179
01:33:28,761 --> 01:33:33,290
you started this and this kid
walked out the stylish 21,

2180
01:33:33,291 --> 01:33:37,790
22 year old and he came running
up and you joined pinterest.

2181
01:33:37,800 --> 01:33:38,633
And I said yes.

2182
01:33:38,660 --> 01:33:39,170
He said,

2183
01:33:39,170 --> 01:33:39,351
Oh,

2184
01:33:39,351 --> 01:33:40,670
I'm so happy to meet you.

2185
01:33:40,671 --> 01:33:42,280
And he shook my hand and he said,

2186
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:45,960
I've been watching your lectures and they
really helped me get my life together,

2187
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:46,760
you know?

2188
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:47,181
And I said,

2189
01:33:47,181 --> 01:33:49,320
oh that's great because
I do think that's crazy.

2190
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:50,720
That's crazy.

2191
01:33:51,990 --> 01:33:53,510
How far would you like them?

2192
01:33:53,511 --> 01:33:57,050
And then to go to some city that you
haven't been to in a rough neighborhood in

2193
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:03,010
the car comes running up
to you and telling you that
their license because they

2194
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:05,570
want to be popped

2195
01:34:13,010 --> 01:34:13,970
store.

2196
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:18,340
Wait,

2197
01:34:18,340 --> 01:34:19,173
wait,

2198
01:34:20,260 --> 01:34:21,093
wait a minute.

2199
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:23,550
Just stay here a minute.

2200
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:24,720
I said,

2201
01:34:24,720 --> 01:34:25,553
okay.

2202
01:34:26,690 --> 01:34:31,040
And he came home with
his father and mother.

2203
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:32,300
They were both smart,

2204
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:33,800
really smart,

2205
01:34:33,830 --> 01:34:34,061
you know,

2206
01:34:34,061 --> 01:34:35,420
like that kind of smiling,

2207
01:34:35,620 --> 01:34:36,453
just sort of car.

2208
01:34:36,700 --> 01:34:41,110
That's the Duchenne smile technically by
the way that you do with your eyes and

2209
01:34:42,130 --> 01:34:42,963
you're

2210
01:34:47,410 --> 01:34:50,180
looking for all place with each other.

2211
01:34:50,181 --> 01:34:51,180
With the kids.

2212
01:34:52,820 --> 01:34:56,570
I've been rescuing my father from
the belly of the beast basically.

2213
01:34:58,150 --> 01:34:59,720
Well now

2214
01:35:12,380 --> 01:35:17,190
he will come running up to me and
they tell me stories like slaves.

2215
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:22,150
If if the balloon size,

2216
01:35:24,650 --> 01:35:28,450
you don't jump up and down about
what I'm doing and ignore all that,

2217
01:35:28,570 --> 01:35:29,210
that's fine.

2218
01:35:29,210 --> 01:35:30,710
Because I'm a psychologist.

2219
01:35:31,410 --> 01:35:32,840
I kind of just started a long time ago.

2220
01:35:32,870 --> 01:35:35,390
The locus of concern was individuals,

2221
01:35:35,630 --> 01:35:37,940
and I do believe what I told you tonight.

2222
01:35:37,941 --> 01:35:42,941
I believe that each person is a divided
focus of consciousness and that any step

2223
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:47,710
forward to making someone's
life trauma better.

2224
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:49,040
I don't mean easier.

2225
01:35:49,130 --> 01:35:51,380
I do not mean that to making it better.

2226
01:35:51,440 --> 01:35:55,220
Making them more responsible and more
awake and more attentive and more truthful

2227
01:35:55,221 --> 01:35:56,100
and more properly,

2228
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,770
even farther away from hell.

2229
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,610
It's like,

2230
01:35:58,610 --> 01:35:59,710
that's a great thing,

2231
01:35:59,711 --> 01:36:00,470
man.

2232
01:36:00,470 --> 01:36:02,960
So I don't care about the rest of it,

2233
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:03,980
I mean it's a pain,

2234
01:36:03,981 --> 01:36:04,151
you know,

2235
01:36:04,151 --> 01:36:05,780
and it hurts I suppose,

2236
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:07,213
I suppose

2237
01:36:08,690 --> 01:36:13,690
entertaining to be pilloried say the
national press on many journalists and

2238
01:36:13,741 --> 01:36:16,270
supportive to me and so I've
got nothing to complain about,

2239
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,800
but whatever,

2240
01:36:19,100 --> 01:36:21,150
nothing worth doing is you see,

2241
01:36:22,040 --> 01:36:23,990
it wouldn't be any
interesting if it wasn't,

2242
01:36:24,340 --> 01:36:29,270
so I think I can just ignore it and
just try to do what I'm doing with these

2243
01:36:29,271 --> 01:36:29,960
talks.

2244
01:36:29,960 --> 01:36:31,580
So we'll see.

2245
01:36:35,860 --> 01:36:40,860
Thank you.

2246
01:36:41,730 --> 01:36:46,270
A school teacher and I'm seeing more and
more ideologies push on the students.

2247
01:36:46,340 --> 01:36:50,420
How do I navigate this landscape
and not jeopardize my job?

2248
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:51,463
I get this.

2249
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:53,970
How do you speak up?

2250
01:36:54,590 --> 01:36:57,170
The first thing that you going to
figure out your job's in jeopardy

2251
01:36:58,670 --> 01:37:03,520
because on the one hand it's jeopardy
because you might lose it and the other

2252
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:05,960
habits in jeopardy because
you might have to keep it

2253
01:37:08,270 --> 01:37:10,250
five years of selling your soul.

2254
01:37:10,251 --> 01:37:11,490
As a teacher,

2255
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:15,020
you're going to be one story character
and are going to see that with trump.

2256
01:37:15,021 --> 01:37:17,750
Sympathy like I'm not trying to be high.

2257
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,720
You're prescribed both ways.

2258
01:37:21,440 --> 01:37:25,760
Sometimes it's useful to know that
because the problem is people often

2259
01:37:25,761 --> 01:37:29,900
overestimate the degree of security that
they currently have and so you might

2260
01:37:29,901 --> 01:37:30,561
ask yourself,

2261
01:37:30,561 --> 01:37:31,394
well,

2262
01:37:32,150 --> 01:37:33,690
what are you going to
look like in five years?

2263
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:35,090
If you have to swallow that,

2264
01:37:35,690 --> 01:37:38,050
you have to teach it
because you don't oppose it.

2265
01:37:38,480 --> 01:37:39,290
Believe me,

2266
01:37:39,290 --> 01:37:43,100
there'll be no end to it because those
sorts of things don't stop until someone

2267
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:47,830
stops because the people who are pushing
the limit and then he'll just push them

2268
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:50,240
to go take another little
piece of your soul,

2269
01:37:50,420 --> 01:37:51,570
and so sometimes you think,

2270
01:37:52,290 --> 01:37:53,123
oh good.

2271
01:37:53,630 --> 01:37:55,130
That means I can do what I want.

2272
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:56,281
Now,

2273
01:37:56,281 --> 01:37:58,060
that doesn't mean you
shouldn't be stupid about it.

2274
01:37:58,530 --> 01:37:58,721
You know,

2275
01:37:58,721 --> 01:38:00,350
and lots of people have
asked me this question.

2276
01:38:00,351 --> 01:38:00,570
It's like,

2277
01:38:00,570 --> 01:38:00,850
well sure,

2278
01:38:00,850 --> 01:38:04,860
I stand up against the creeping in
theology in high school as a teacher.

2279
01:38:04,861 --> 01:38:05,190
It's like,

2280
01:38:05,190 --> 01:38:06,023
Oh,

2281
01:38:06,080 --> 01:38:06,930
you have family,

2282
01:38:06,931 --> 01:38:07,711
you have kids.

2283
01:38:07,711 --> 01:38:09,270
Do you have people who are relying on you?

2284
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:14,150
You can't just let yourself on fiber
protests and the little pile bash and

2285
01:38:14,220 --> 01:38:14,361
there.

2286
01:38:14,361 --> 01:38:17,430
Although it is true that
start with a good plan.

2287
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:21,830
So what do you need to do
with your secretary kind of
smart and how often you go

2288
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:22,430
to figure out,

2289
01:38:22,430 --> 01:38:22,891
you've got to think,

2290
01:38:22,891 --> 01:38:23,191
okay,

2291
01:38:23,191 --> 01:38:23,730
well I'm,

2292
01:38:23,730 --> 01:38:28,690
I'm in a war and a war is a sequence of
balanced and the smaller the battle of

2293
01:38:28,691 --> 01:38:31,980
the better and they're starting to
think strategically and you lay out your

2294
01:38:31,981 --> 01:38:36,690
options and have you had you fortify your
territory and shove it the tongue and

2295
01:38:36,691 --> 01:38:38,800
you decided that you're going
to do something about you.

2296
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:42,210
Don't get all the impulsive that can
stand back and yelling at the principal

2297
01:38:42,211 --> 01:38:43,440
because he's maybe logical,

2298
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:45,870
moral because you're just done.

2299
01:38:45,900 --> 01:38:47,250
What the hell good is that?

2300
01:38:47,700 --> 01:38:51,690
So if you know that your soul
is being corrupted by the logs,

2301
01:38:51,691 --> 01:38:55,800
then it's time to wake the hell up
and to start thinking and acting

2302
01:38:55,801 --> 01:38:56,634
strategically.

2303
01:38:56,760 --> 01:38:57,211
First of all,

2304
01:38:57,211 --> 01:39:02,211
you might want to lay out three options
for other employment so you know that if

2305
01:39:02,581 --> 01:39:06,060
he could come off at the nice to have
options because otherwise you've got so

2306
01:39:06,061 --> 01:39:08,370
much at stake and won't
be able to be courageous.

2307
01:39:08,910 --> 01:39:12,570
So when you notice that you stand back.

2308
01:39:12,660 --> 01:39:14,230
We up with these types of things,

2309
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:17,280
it maybe you're into the adventure
of your life at that point.

2310
01:39:17,550 --> 01:39:22,440
It only ever know so they won't do it
impulsively or careless with the customer.

2311
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,670
It's just not as useful
as feeding the cattle,

2312
01:39:26,730 --> 01:39:31,730
the snake in the snake like and windows
in an informed way and with some humor

2313
01:39:34,651 --> 01:39:37,860
and some detachment and and some care.

2314
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,120
So it's a war going on and you
don't want to lose the warmth.

2315
01:39:41,150 --> 01:39:46,150
The first vowel is not
helpful so I like thank you.

2316
01:39:52,420 --> 01:39:53,253
Ready.

2317
01:39:54,150 --> 01:39:59,150
Would you please reconsider your
decision not to run for Prime Minister

2318
01:40:02,180 --> 01:40:07,180
Thatcher?

2319
01:40:09,960 --> 01:40:14,880
Like I've thought about
political career since I was 14.

2320
01:40:15,120 --> 01:40:20,120
I ran for vice president for the Elbert
met Peter and Stuart teeth are lost by

2321
01:40:20,510 --> 01:40:22,340
nine votes at 800.

2322
01:40:22,350 --> 01:40:26,970
So that was the first time I spoke in
front of a group and the first time the

2323
01:40:26,971 --> 01:40:27,804
press line,

2324
01:40:28,170 --> 01:40:29,110
which is

2325
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:34,810
so fun.

2326
01:40:37,590 --> 01:40:42,590
I've always decided not to do it
because it's not perfect enough for.

2327
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:43,810
Don't fake.

2328
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:47,310
I mean I found repeatedly
throughout my life but.

2329
01:40:47,970 --> 01:40:50,820
But first of all,

2330
01:40:50,850 --> 01:40:52,830
it's not obvious to me that I know enough.

2331
01:40:54,220 --> 01:40:54,480
No.

2332
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:56,390
Like are trained as a psychologist,

2333
01:40:56,680 --> 01:41:00,830
I know all this arcade material that I've
been talking to you about tonight and

2334
01:41:00,910 --> 01:41:02,680
I have a bit of practical knowledge,

2335
01:41:02,681 --> 01:41:04,450
but go out and you know,

2336
01:41:04,550 --> 01:41:09,550
being being a politician and running
something as complicated saves Ontario and

2337
01:41:11,610 --> 01:41:11,920
not much.

2338
01:41:11,920 --> 01:41:15,400
You'd have to study in order
to be really good at that.

2339
01:41:15,680 --> 01:41:17,430
We look at what's happened to her,

2340
01:41:17,550 --> 01:41:18,383
like our,

2341
01:41:18,420 --> 01:41:23,290
our hydro power grid and the utilities
don't target people that are going to

2342
01:41:23,291 --> 01:41:26,070
what the hell are you doing running them
and it's just a bloody catastrophe and

2343
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:27,780
that's just a training every

2344
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:34,330
thank.

2345
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:35,950
I've talked to my wife about 30.

2346
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:39,010
We had talked about it from
the Conservative Party.

2347
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:42,190
Started moving closer to your
neck in Ontario three months ago.

2348
01:41:42,191 --> 01:41:42,551
I thought,

2349
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:43,384
well you know,

2350
01:41:44,340 --> 01:41:46,720
particularly there are
supposed to take it.

2351
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:47,141
And I thought,

2352
01:41:47,141 --> 01:41:47,531
Jesus,

2353
01:41:47,531 --> 01:41:52,531
I have to sit in my house
and study economics intensely
for like 16 hours a day

2354
01:41:56,171 --> 01:42:01,000
for a whole year before I could even be
ready to even contemplate the idea that

2355
01:42:01,001 --> 01:42:04,780
I could be safety competent to deal
with the sorts of things that have to be

2356
01:42:04,781 --> 01:42:05,614
dealt with them.

2357
01:42:05,900 --> 01:42:07,410
Is just so of,

2358
01:42:07,720 --> 01:42:12,040
and then the other part is I don't
think there's anything wrong with what I

2359
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:13,120
currently do it.

2360
01:42:17,530 --> 01:42:21,560
Thanks.

2361
01:42:21,990 --> 01:42:23,220
I think we

2362
01:42:25,030 --> 01:42:27,130
took a detour to the political agreement.

2363
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:32,890
See what I thought about with the
parents to the conservative government.

2364
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,620
In turn it was,

2365
01:42:34,630 --> 01:42:35,650
here's the worst case

2366
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:38,761
I run,

2367
01:42:38,761 --> 01:42:39,594
I win,

2368
01:42:39,910 --> 01:42:42,880
I win the election that
I got off the premium.

2369
01:42:43,910 --> 01:42:44,700
It's like what they.

2370
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:46,410
That's not a lab,

2371
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:49,190
a stupid plan,

2372
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,110
so don't go in there.

2373
01:42:52,310 --> 01:42:53,470
I'm just not prepared for it,

2374
01:42:53,480 --> 01:42:54,670
but again,

2375
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:56,420
like the risk of repeating myself,

2376
01:42:58,370 --> 01:43:02,590
I'm interested in something
that's deeper than that.

2377
01:43:02,620 --> 01:43:05,770
Not that I don't need more important,

2378
01:43:05,771 --> 01:43:08,980
but I mean more fundamentally
in a hierarchical way.

2379
01:43:09,220 --> 01:43:11,590
I really do believe that our culture,

2380
01:43:12,330 --> 01:43:13,300
a modern culture,

2381
01:43:13,301 --> 01:43:18,301
but particularly the modern Western
culture is fractured and that weren't in

2382
01:43:18,401 --> 01:43:23,401
danger because of that tractor and that
things need to be so back together and

2383
01:43:24,730 --> 01:43:26,830
that's a better.

2384
01:43:27,700 --> 01:43:28,421
That's for me,

2385
01:43:28,421 --> 01:43:32,620
that's a better thing to a map and I'm
more qualified to do it and so that's

2386
01:43:32,621 --> 01:43:33,490
where I should be doing,

2387
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:38,750
so that's thank pretty sure
if Justin Trudeau can do it.

2388
01:43:56,100 --> 01:44:01,100
How much longer will initiate
the left to come back to center?

2389
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:11,820
This as far as I can tell,

2390
01:44:14,540 --> 01:44:16,240
we set up a system,

2391
01:44:16,241 --> 01:44:21,241
particularly when universities were insane
radical leftists and those are people

2392
01:44:22,401 --> 01:44:25,450
who still harbor the suspicion,

2393
01:44:25,590 --> 01:44:27,630
real communism as the tribe.

2394
01:44:27,690 --> 01:44:32,520
Let's say that there are some stuff like
they figured out about a gender in the

2395
01:44:32,521 --> 01:44:36,320
subsidy for your activism and as
long as that continues to happen,

2396
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:40,510
there's no possibility that things
are going to become more saying,

2397
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:40,900
okay,

2398
01:44:40,900 --> 01:44:44,270
I think what will probably
happen in the next 50 years.

2399
01:44:44,390 --> 01:44:45,970
This isn't the only mind projection,

2400
01:44:45,971 --> 01:44:49,010
so there's lots of economists
have been working on this idea.

2401
01:44:49,570 --> 01:44:54,570
I'm gonna say 30 to 40 percent higher
educational institutes in the US and

2402
01:44:54,891 --> 01:44:57,980
probably go bankrupt in the
next 10 years and that'll.

2403
01:44:58,070 --> 01:45:01,520
That'll happen because there
just isn't sustainable.

2404
01:45:01,930 --> 01:45:02,763
I mean,

2405
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:08,080
and so that's what I see
as the most likely outcome.

2406
01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:11,820
Assuming there is a likelihood
that he stays on this,

2407
01:45:12,470 --> 01:45:14,810
run themselves out to
the audit conclusion.

2408
01:45:14,900 --> 01:45:19,220
Now I'm not necessarily all that confident
about that because one of the things

2409
01:45:19,221 --> 01:45:20,650
I do see that now

2410
01:45:22,370 --> 01:45:25,450
is the same identity all takes.

2411
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,890
Insanity is fading in the corporate world,

2412
01:45:28,130 --> 01:45:31,850
which is really a shock to me because
you think they're greedy capitalists who

2413
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:36,870
have enough sense not to lead fifth
called radical leftist organizations,

2414
01:45:37,340 --> 01:45:39,940
but they don't seem to
have that much sense.

2415
01:45:39,980 --> 01:45:42,010
Just shows you that
they're not as malevolent,

2416
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:44,180
as tiny as you might
hope that it would be.

2417
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:51,520
So I think I don't think there's any
predictably charting the course of the

2418
01:45:52,971 --> 01:45:54,200
future for us right now.

2419
01:45:54,201 --> 01:45:59,090
I think that we're in a time of strange
crisis and the what will determine the

2420
01:45:59,091 --> 01:46:02,870
direction and the decisions that all
human people make me go back out into the

2421
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:03,350
world.

2422
01:46:03,350 --> 01:46:08,320
You're already going to be sensible and
articulate and responsible and we're

2423
01:46:08,321 --> 01:46:13,321
awake and attentive or able to contribute
to the idiot chaos of polarization,

2424
01:46:15,770 --> 01:46:20,770
and if enough people decided
that the going to me awake then

2425
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,950
knows can be,

2426
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:29,420
but we get rid of the whole thing gone
wrong ourselves and have done that many

2427
01:46:29,421 --> 01:46:30,410
times in the past.

2428
01:46:31,100 --> 01:46:31,933
So

2429
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:36,193
let's see.

2430
01:46:37,620 --> 01:46:42,380
Thank you.

2431
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:46,590
How do you help someone
who's too afraid and a,

2432
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:48,210
for example,

2433
01:46:51,590 --> 01:46:54,840
it's the same people
ask me to help someone.

2434
01:46:56,670 --> 01:46:57,503
Well,

2435
01:46:57,540 --> 01:47:01,350
first of quit helping them
because you're working,

2436
01:47:01,351 --> 01:47:06,180
so you have to launch and see it in the
viewer attempts to help are not working.

2437
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:07,400
Then the not wanting to do this,

2438
01:47:07,570 --> 01:47:12,570
the right time for her to get her to
detached yourself with grace and with

2439
01:47:12,931 --> 01:47:14,250
compassion with the tennis.

2440
01:47:14,390 --> 01:47:15,480
But then you sit back,

2441
01:47:15,570 --> 01:47:20,340
watch all watched and merge the patient.

2442
01:47:20,790 --> 01:47:21,650
Um,

2443
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:24,750
but in the meantime was
definitely more powerful.

2444
01:47:24,751 --> 01:47:25,584
An example,

2445
01:47:26,640 --> 01:47:29,940
if you want to change someone who doesn't
want to be changed the best way to do

2446
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:31,163
example,

2447
01:47:31,590 --> 01:47:33,990
here's the better way to
do anything by example.

2448
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:36,540
So that's,

2449
01:47:38,020 --> 01:47:39,960
you want to be an example to yourself too.

2450
01:47:40,010 --> 01:47:40,830
You know,

2451
01:47:40,830 --> 01:47:41,850
because why not?

2452
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:46,440
So the thing that I've learned
about me and good person,

2453
01:47:46,441 --> 01:47:46,831
let's say,

2454
01:47:46,831 --> 01:47:48,840
and I'm not claiming
that I'm a good person,

2455
01:47:48,841 --> 01:47:49,674
by the way,

2456
01:47:51,150 --> 01:47:52,260
there isn't a banner,

2457
01:47:52,320 --> 01:47:53,730
there is better England.

2458
01:47:54,270 --> 01:47:57,120
There isn't anything that's more
adventurous than you possibly do,

2459
01:47:57,121 --> 01:48:01,240
that it really gives your life a depth.

2460
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:02,690
It's almost,

2461
01:48:02,890 --> 01:48:04,690
it's an exhaustible and reuse things.

2462
01:48:04,840 --> 01:48:08,880
It's like there's a lot of things out
there that can be putting in an order and

2463
01:48:08,910 --> 01:48:10,230
you can put some of them in order.

2464
01:48:10,231 --> 01:48:10,740
It's like,

2465
01:48:10,740 --> 01:48:11,550
how much is that?

2466
01:48:11,550 --> 01:48:12,383
Can you do?

2467
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,493
Who knows what?

2468
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:15,270
What you can do if you
put your mind into it.

2469
01:48:15,420 --> 01:48:20,010
It's so fun because I see these young
young people come up to me and they said,

2470
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:20,251
look,

2471
01:48:20,251 --> 01:48:25,040
I've really started to apply myself state
university and I are going to need it

2472
01:48:25,410 --> 01:48:26,920
and I'm starting to apply myself.

2473
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:30,330
I think tell them it's like
great and guard yourself.

2474
01:48:30,450 --> 01:48:31,360
Half put together.

2475
01:48:31,361 --> 01:48:31,981
You're 21.

2476
01:48:31,981 --> 01:48:34,350
It's like he could be dead
by the time you're 30.

2477
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,740
You can just be fixing things like map.

2478
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,970
You can be competent in
10 different domains.

2479
01:48:39,390 --> 01:48:39,870
BBS,

2480
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:41,040
force of nature.

2481
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:41,960
It's like,

2482
01:48:41,960 --> 01:48:42,650
oh,

2483
01:48:42,650 --> 01:48:43,920
there is an ambition.

2484
01:48:43,980 --> 01:48:46,170
That's what we should be
teaching our young people.

2485
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:49,820
It's like make yourself so competent
that you would just terrify,

2486
01:48:50,130 --> 01:48:54,270
get the hell out there doing everything
you possibly can to make things better

2487
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,820
before the complain about
the structure for world.

2488
01:48:57,330 --> 01:48:57,541
Right,

2489
01:48:57,541 --> 01:48:58,500
and they're so happy.

2490
01:48:58,501 --> 01:49:03,501
You tell the kids that they just smiling
away site because that's what they want

2491
01:49:03,841 --> 01:49:04,674
to hear this.

2492
01:49:05,010 --> 01:49:06,150
They want a pat on the back,

2493
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:09,060
not because of what they've already
accomplished with because they're on the

2494
01:49:09,120 --> 01:49:13,090
path to something greater
and it's just vigorous.

2495
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:14,120
I'm wondering,

2496
01:49:14,120 --> 01:49:17,140
one of the things that's so fun about
all this is on the lead executive for

2497
01:49:17,141 --> 01:49:20,060
people because there's thousands
and thousands of letting you know,

2498
01:49:20,070 --> 01:49:21,210
they say the same thing.

2499
01:49:21,211 --> 01:49:23,330
It's like doing my best said,

2500
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:29,000
put my foot forward and to step forth
into the world and to tell the truth and

2501
01:49:31,600 --> 01:49:35,790
reporting in on getting along with
my girlfriend or my boyfriend.

2502
01:49:35,800 --> 01:49:37,560
The getting along better with my parents.

2503
01:49:37,561 --> 01:49:41,070
I'm doing good at school and you know,

2504
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:41,890
here's a bunch of.

2505
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:42,610
I'm excited.

2506
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:44,850
Dropped and cycling man.

2507
01:49:45,270 --> 01:49:47,010
Come forward and see what.

2508
01:49:47,290 --> 01:49:48,123
No,

2509
01:49:48,250 --> 01:49:49,420
it's so good.

2510
01:49:49,870 --> 01:49:50,703
So

2511
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:58,280
thank

2512
01:50:01,720 --> 01:50:05,460
stress surrounding the problem
that is out of your control

2513
01:50:12,700 --> 01:50:13,490
now.

2514
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:18,490
I've had problems for a long time now
for the last 10 years and my daughter is

2515
01:50:19,481 --> 01:50:21,550
just unbelievably sick.

2516
01:50:22,360 --> 01:50:23,200
I'm worried about that.

2517
01:50:23,201 --> 01:50:24,070
Chapter 12,

2518
01:50:24,100 --> 01:50:24,933
you know,

2519
01:50:26,680 --> 01:50:28,030
sometimes you just don't,

2520
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:28,893
you know,

2521
01:50:29,270 --> 01:50:31,600
and that's part of the
catastrophe in life.

2522
01:50:32,090 --> 01:50:32,380
You know,

2523
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:35,500
some people get panchromatic
counselor and they're done.

2524
01:50:35,501 --> 01:50:36,580
They're done in six months.

2525
01:50:36,581 --> 01:50:41,581
Then all the heroes in the world is going
to save them from a particular faith

2526
01:50:43,130 --> 01:50:44,260
is heroic idea,

2527
01:50:44,261 --> 01:50:45,094
you know,

2528
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:45,670
need,

2529
01:50:45,670 --> 01:50:47,440
despite the best of your life,

2530
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,920
it's your best back by any
stretch of the imagination.

2531
01:50:50,921 --> 01:50:55,600
It's also the best approach you how
to actually fixing the catastrophe,

2532
01:50:55,660 --> 01:50:57,250
but you know,

2533
01:50:57,650 --> 01:51:01,750
still bounded by your mortality
and your and your insufficiency.

2534
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:05,700
If you really take care of your sick.

2535
01:51:05,900 --> 01:51:08,410
Part of what you have to do
is shrink your timeframe.

2536
01:51:10,090 --> 01:51:15,090
When we were dealing with landowners and
she was well on the way to parishes and

2537
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:17,680
in the very painful manner,

2538
01:51:18,050 --> 01:51:18,883
um,

2539
01:51:19,980 --> 01:51:22,140
you don't think about a week from now,

2540
01:51:22,170 --> 01:51:23,610
a month from now or a year from now,

2541
01:51:23,630 --> 01:51:26,420
you think about today and you think,

2542
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:26,741
okay,

2543
01:51:26,741 --> 01:51:26,951
well,

2544
01:51:26,951 --> 01:51:28,840
I'm going to make today's
lit as I can make.

2545
01:51:29,380 --> 01:51:31,110
And then sometimes you
don't think about today.

2546
01:51:31,111 --> 01:51:35,980
You think about the next morning and
sometimes you can lead you to think about

2547
01:51:35,981 --> 01:51:36,300
that.

2548
01:51:36,300 --> 01:51:39,040
You get to the next hour
or maybe the next minute,

2549
01:51:40,060 --> 01:51:41,240
someone's deathbed,

2550
01:51:41,970 --> 01:51:42,970
it's the next minute,

2551
01:51:43,000 --> 01:51:43,833
you know,

2552
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:47,710
and what you do is try to make that the
least amount of horrible it can possibly

2553
01:51:47,711 --> 01:51:49,720
be and that this really matters.

2554
01:51:50,410 --> 01:51:51,670
One of the things that struck me,

2555
01:51:51,671 --> 01:51:52,504
I was,

2556
01:51:52,660 --> 01:51:54,460
I was around,

2557
01:51:55,060 --> 01:51:58,090
my mother belonged to Steph and she had,

2558
01:51:58,180 --> 01:51:58,691
for example,

2559
01:51:58,691 --> 01:51:59,201
dimension,

2560
01:51:59,201 --> 01:52:04,201
which is a particularly nasty way to go
and it took her quite a long time to in

2561
01:52:05,620 --> 01:52:06,830
the final throws,

2562
01:52:06,890 --> 01:52:07,723
the realness.

2563
01:52:08,940 --> 01:52:11,770
It's rough to be in a situation like that.

2564
01:52:11,970 --> 01:52:16,060
I guess the person that everyone loves
us to Sharon with the former self and a

2565
01:52:16,061 --> 01:52:18,850
skeletal without the family old,

2566
01:52:18,851 --> 01:52:19,684
their.

2567
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:21,450
The person's in an agony,

2568
01:52:21,451 --> 01:52:21,700
you know,

2569
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:23,620
because dieting a snuff for the week,

2570
01:52:23,621 --> 01:52:24,520
that's for sure.

2571
01:52:25,950 --> 01:52:27,880
But my sisters,

2572
01:52:28,260 --> 01:52:31,010
my wife's family are
quite an admirable law.

2573
01:52:31,690 --> 01:52:35,140
My wife was statistic value term work
and his work as a social therapist and

2574
01:52:35,141 --> 01:52:39,940
she's a tough cookie and her sister is
a palliative care nurse and her other

2575
01:52:39,941 --> 01:52:44,540
sister was a pharmacist and they're
pretty sensible as a family and you know,

2576
01:52:44,590 --> 01:52:49,590
they all around the
monitors with their father.

2577
01:52:51,990 --> 01:52:53,000
The beginning,

2578
01:52:53,090 --> 01:52:53,530
right,

2579
01:52:53,530 --> 01:52:54,740
it only pulled together.

2580
01:52:55,220 --> 01:52:58,730
They didn't fight when she was dying.

2581
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:03,770
They called together and when I saw half,

2582
01:53:03,790 --> 01:53:05,320
of course it turned.

2583
01:53:05,321 --> 01:53:10,321
The situation that was determining tragic
into was it had something knowable,

2584
01:53:11,170 --> 01:53:15,470
love it to spray this catastrophe and
certainly didn't deep generated into a

2585
01:53:15,471 --> 01:53:17,060
squabbling hell,

2586
01:53:17,061 --> 01:53:18,430
which could have easily happened.

2587
01:53:19,310 --> 01:53:21,050
They actually gained something from it.

2588
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:26,540
I think the family became closer
afterwards because of what they had gone

2589
01:53:27,411 --> 01:53:29,410
through and their mother was closed,

2590
01:53:29,411 --> 01:53:32,710
but they all know along better after that,

2591
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:38,020
and they were all closer to the father
was an absolute star during his wife

2592
01:53:38,480 --> 01:53:39,130
sale.

2593
01:53:39,130 --> 01:53:40,740
He was isn't interest to God.

2594
01:53:40,741 --> 01:53:41,574
He's still alive.

2595
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:42,080
Stickiness.

2596
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:47,080
Tell Robertson he was he money knew
of in this little town I grew up in is

2597
01:53:47,870 --> 01:53:50,420
unbelievably extroverted in a comical guy.

2598
01:53:50,510 --> 01:53:53,120
Tended to drink too much and
he was the wife of the party.

2599
01:53:53,390 --> 01:53:54,410
Loud guy.

2600
01:53:54,470 --> 01:53:59,430
I gave a far more labor t shirt for
Christmas one year and she proudly.

2601
01:54:00,070 --> 01:54:01,790
It's kind of a party animal,

2602
01:54:01,940 --> 01:54:03,820
but I'm also very solid manner.

2603
01:54:03,860 --> 01:54:05,470
I really liked him and respected him.

2604
01:54:05,900 --> 01:54:07,310
God and his wife got sick.

2605
01:54:07,311 --> 01:54:07,910
He was.

2606
01:54:07,910 --> 01:54:12,910
He was something else that he took care
of her like patiently and every time

2607
01:54:13,401 --> 01:54:14,490
someone offered to help them,

2608
01:54:14,491 --> 01:54:15,360
he thought it would help me,

2609
01:54:15,370 --> 01:54:20,370
took the hill and he was happy that he
garnered the respect of his children in a

2610
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:24,860
really profound way and so well.

2611
01:54:24,861 --> 01:54:27,170
So what can you do in
a terrible situation?

2612
01:54:27,171 --> 01:54:28,004
This you can.

2613
01:54:28,190 --> 01:54:29,740
I don't want to say it lightly,

2614
01:54:29,780 --> 01:54:30,830
to make the best of it.

2615
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:34,940
You know you could stop it from
degenerating into absolute hell.

2616
01:54:35,210 --> 01:54:37,600
You can do everything he can
to stave that off the partner.

2617
01:54:37,601 --> 01:54:39,470
You do that by narrowing your timeframe.

2618
01:54:39,770 --> 01:54:40,603
It's like if,

2619
01:54:40,670 --> 01:54:44,170
if the week is too much that it's today
and if the day is too much debt is to

2620
01:54:44,171 --> 01:54:45,800
our hours too much,

2621
01:54:46,070 --> 01:54:48,200
then it's the minute you think,

2622
01:54:48,380 --> 01:54:48,651
well hell,

2623
01:54:48,651 --> 01:54:50,210
I have to get through this next minute.

2624
01:54:50,211 --> 01:54:52,150
I'm going to do it the best I can,

2625
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:56,570
and then it's the next
minute that sometimes that's
going to go up that shoulder

2626
01:54:56,571 --> 01:54:57,590
against the wheel.

2627
01:54:57,640 --> 01:55:02,640
Brutal uphill struggle and hopefully you
can do it as normally as you can manage

2628
01:55:05,990 --> 01:55:06,823
and that's.

2629
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:10,400
That's the best you have in
some situations and it's a
hell of a lot better than

2630
01:55:10,401 --> 01:55:11,234
the alternative.

2631
01:55:13,160 --> 01:55:18,160
Thanks a ton of great stuff here.

2632
01:55:22,051 --> 01:55:24,020
So I'm just sort of
randomly jumping around.

2633
01:55:24,260 --> 01:55:25,093
I love this one.

2634
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:27,080
How you find your passion.

2635
01:55:37,340 --> 01:55:38,930
Well look,

2636
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:40,101
you know,

2637
01:55:40,101 --> 01:55:42,890
everybody has a problem and you might.

2638
01:55:43,500 --> 01:55:44,370
That's terrible.

2639
01:55:47,990 --> 01:55:48,420
You don't.

2640
01:55:48,420 --> 01:55:50,340
When you think about all
the problems in the world,

2641
01:55:50,670 --> 01:55:55,670
there's walkable kind of all your
problems and then we can tell that some of

2642
01:55:56,291 --> 01:55:57,124
them,

2643
01:55:57,890 --> 01:55:59,190
even though there are problems,

2644
01:55:59,220 --> 01:55:59,820
you know,

2645
01:55:59,820 --> 01:56:03,720
maybe their problem if you work
with other people are politically,

2646
01:56:03,810 --> 01:56:05,940
they don't bug you have some problems,

2647
01:56:05,941 --> 01:56:06,774
but you.

2648
01:56:07,400 --> 01:56:11,640
And if those are your problems and so
you sort of find your destiny in your

2649
01:56:11,641 --> 01:56:12,211
problems,

2650
01:56:12,211 --> 01:56:13,980
I would say something bought you,

2651
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:15,803
fix it.

2652
01:56:16,490 --> 01:56:17,520
You know,

2653
01:56:17,750 --> 01:56:20,040
maybe you want to pick
the right sized problem.

2654
01:56:20,190 --> 01:56:20,730
Don't,

2655
01:56:20,730 --> 01:56:24,720
don't get all Arabic trying to fix
something you don't know how to fix.

2656
01:56:25,140 --> 01:56:27,190
But if something's been see you,

2657
01:56:27,370 --> 01:56:29,130
well that's your problem.

2658
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:30,280
And then there's,

2659
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:32,490
that's your destiny will fix that problem.

2660
01:56:32,670 --> 01:56:35,600
And we can do this in local environments.

2661
01:56:36,150 --> 01:56:37,410
You can go to the room.

2662
01:56:38,580 --> 01:56:41,400
That's kind of funny that this whole
clean your room thing is become a thing.

2663
01:56:41,401 --> 01:56:42,234
I mean

2664
01:56:43,530 --> 01:56:45,060
there's a reason for that is because it's.

2665
01:56:45,080 --> 01:56:45,280
It's,

2666
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,700
it's humbled in the right way that he's
not that easy to clean around matching,

2667
01:56:48,720 --> 01:56:52,680
especially if you live in a
really dysfunctional family
because if you live in a

2668
01:56:52,681 --> 01:56:54,060
really dysfunctional family,

2669
01:56:54,360 --> 01:56:58,980
they will get really angry at you when
you start to do things right and then

2670
01:56:59,030 --> 01:57:00,390
then you're in a battle that,

2671
01:57:00,450 --> 01:57:02,170
and that might be as simple as male.

2672
01:57:02,250 --> 01:57:06,900
Do you think you are when you're doing
something like trying to remove some of

2673
01:57:06,901 --> 01:57:10,680
the grime and the catastrophe that
happens to be part of your living space?

2674
01:57:10,681 --> 01:57:10,870
No,

2675
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:13,470
because just by taking a
step in the right direction,

2676
01:57:13,471 --> 01:57:17,430
you shoved in dim light on everyone
who's groping around in the dirt,

2677
01:57:17,460 --> 01:57:18,720
trying to make things worse,

2678
01:57:18,721 --> 01:57:22,230
and so trying to clean up the room
to be a real metaphysical battle.

2679
01:57:22,310 --> 01:57:23,101
The camp,

2680
01:57:23,101 --> 01:57:25,170
because the room is a microcosm,

2681
01:57:25,230 --> 01:57:26,063
you know,

2682
01:57:26,110 --> 01:57:26,821
it's also,

2683
01:57:26,821 --> 01:57:30,420
they're part of reality that you
have a grip on that you could set,

2684
01:57:30,430 --> 01:57:30,850
right?

2685
01:57:30,850 --> 01:57:35,330
You could learn how to live with him and
it's the right level of humility that

2686
01:57:35,640 --> 01:57:37,300
you might be able to clean up your room.

2687
01:57:37,330 --> 01:57:38,610
You might be able to send in an order.

2688
01:57:38,611 --> 01:57:40,470
You might even be able
to make it beautiful.

2689
01:57:40,710 --> 01:57:42,030
If you've got an ambitious,

2690
01:57:42,120 --> 01:57:44,700
you know you can make the little
place that you have control over.

2691
01:57:44,760 --> 01:57:45,450
Beautiful.

2692
01:57:45,450 --> 01:57:50,450
That's a real difficult thing to
manage and so now I've got an question.

2693
01:57:53,220 --> 01:57:54,053
That question

2694
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:00,490
that you should take,

2695
01:58:01,930 --> 01:58:02,763
you should take.

2696
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:06,290
You should take your problem with
seriously because you know me.

2697
01:58:06,340 --> 01:58:07,600
Branded stories.

2698
01:58:08,880 --> 01:58:13,000
Abraham in particular is called
by the adventure of his life.

2699
01:58:13,001 --> 01:58:17,360
Not only does encounter trouble like
storage are so comical because garden

2700
01:58:17,361 --> 01:58:21,640
basically tells him to get
up entrepreneurs gas in
it and he's been hanging

2701
01:58:21,660 --> 01:58:25,230
around as far as camp for way too long
goes out into the world and there's

2702
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:26,480
nothing about a catastrophe.

2703
01:58:26,490 --> 01:58:30,810
The younger parents like
would it be better to stay
at home and the 10th that's,

2704
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:31,703
that's not.

2705
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:35,130
It's not right because it's like the
problems in your life or here are the

2706
01:58:35,131 --> 01:58:39,180
portal to your great advantage of like
the question with the high school teacher

2707
01:58:39,590 --> 01:58:40,410
after a cycle,

2708
01:58:40,410 --> 01:58:41,660
how do I stand up against?

2709
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:43,070
It's just like exactly.

2710
01:58:43,920 --> 01:58:48,920
You're in position of the potential
mythological hero who has handled through

2711
01:58:48,970 --> 01:58:50,770
the tire was sea of clay.

2712
01:58:51,130 --> 01:58:51,401
It's like,

2713
01:58:51,401 --> 01:58:52,480
how do you do that?

2714
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:55,390
You transform yourself into warrior.

2715
01:58:55,720 --> 01:58:56,720
That's how you do it,

2716
01:58:56,950 --> 01:58:58,960
and then that changes
everything about you.

2717
01:58:58,961 --> 01:58:59,321
It's like,

2718
01:58:59,321 --> 01:58:59,501
well,

2719
01:58:59,501 --> 01:59:01,030
it's terrible that I have this wrong.

2720
01:59:01,050 --> 01:59:01,660
It's like,

2721
01:59:01,660 --> 01:59:02,021
yeah,

2722
01:59:02,021 --> 01:59:02,851
it is terrible,

2723
01:59:02,851 --> 01:59:07,851
but it's also the greatest thing that can
happen to you and so look and see what

2724
01:59:08,681 --> 01:59:13,681
your problems are and then off that set
of things that manifest themselves as

2725
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:14,920
your promos.

2726
01:59:15,160 --> 01:59:20,160
Look for the smaller subset of things
that you can fix and start fixing them and

2727
01:59:20,550 --> 01:59:24,130
you'll get better and better and better
app and then who knows where you'll end

2728
01:59:24,131 --> 01:59:26,560
up and then you will
find yourself that way.

2729
01:59:27,150 --> 01:59:29,530
And so it's kind of painful,

2730
01:59:29,531 --> 01:59:29,860
you know,

2731
01:59:29,860 --> 01:59:31,750
because you have to pick up the problems,

2732
01:59:31,751 --> 01:59:33,790
but don't be so sure if you want to have.

2733
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:36,490
Get almost like that
would be very interesting.

2734
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:41,230
So maybe whatever compelling
problem that grips you completely.

2735
01:59:41,750 --> 01:59:42,400
Well,

2736
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:43,960
you could probably find one of those,

2737
01:59:44,290 --> 01:59:46,420
so that's what I would recommend

2738
01:59:48,270 --> 01:59:48,991
and be humble.

2739
01:59:48,991 --> 01:59:52,390
Like you don't maybe want me some
little trivial things you can fix.

2740
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:53,890
Well that's probably all you're good for.

2741
01:59:53,891 --> 01:59:54,724
Anyways.

2742
01:59:58,300 --> 01:59:59,920
Your job go well,

2743
01:59:59,980 --> 02:00:00,800
I'm fine.

2744
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:04,730
I'm a little better at this
than I might've made it so
that maybe you could try

2745
02:00:04,760 --> 02:00:05,700
like a medium sized,

2746
02:00:06,740 --> 02:00:08,490
but Carl Jung said,

2747
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:09,490
monitor people don't see,

2748
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:11,320
don't look low enough.

2749
02:00:11,740 --> 02:00:12,580
I love that.

2750
02:00:12,610 --> 02:00:13,690
He's so smart.

2751
02:00:13,870 --> 02:00:14,550
Terrifying,

2752
02:00:14,550 --> 02:00:15,383
but smart.

2753
02:00:15,670 --> 02:00:17,020
But that's a lovely idea.

2754
02:00:17,021 --> 02:00:19,420
It's like there's something
out there going for you.

2755
02:00:19,460 --> 02:00:22,570
You're too damn hurricane to bargain with
it because you think you're above it.

2756
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:24,880
You're not humble,

2757
02:00:25,210 --> 02:00:27,160
so down on your knees,

2758
02:00:27,161 --> 02:00:27,851
so to speak.

2759
02:00:27,851 --> 02:00:32,710
He looked for the parole is small enough
so that you're the right size warrior.

2760
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:35,500
Combat that particular
tiny dragons and you think,

2761
02:00:35,501 --> 02:00:36,550
well that was pretty pathetic.

2762
02:00:36,551 --> 02:00:36,881
It's like,

2763
02:00:36,881 --> 02:00:37,170
yeah,

2764
02:00:37,170 --> 02:00:38,040
it was to begin with,

2765
02:00:38,110 --> 02:00:39,220
but not for all.

2766
02:00:39,730 --> 02:00:40,563
So

2767
02:00:42,260 --> 02:00:47,260
thank you.

2768
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:50,583
This is,

2769
02:00:51,140 --> 02:00:53,230
what would you say were streaming?

2770
02:00:57,130 --> 02:00:58,400
What would I say that Arla?

2771
02:00:58,750 --> 02:00:59,050
Well,

2772
02:00:59,050 --> 02:01:00,350
if you say to them,

2773
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:01,353
if they,

2774
02:01:01,640 --> 02:01:04,020
you have some followers
that believe in things,

2775
02:01:04,470 --> 02:01:06,480
you don't believe that extremism.

2776
02:01:06,870 --> 02:01:08,830
So I think if there are people,

2777
02:01:09,370 --> 02:01:10,580
there are people with like,

2778
02:01:11,430 --> 02:01:12,010
you know,

2779
02:01:12,010 --> 02:01:12,843
the search

2780
02:01:14,850 --> 02:01:16,720
that we find old reasonably regardless,

2781
02:01:16,721 --> 02:01:19,810
recognizable thing that I have
an Avatar for their viewpoint.

2782
02:01:19,811 --> 02:01:20,860
They're not my followers.

2783
02:01:20,861 --> 02:01:24,750
They just repeat to take the paid
understand why it might be because we have

2784
02:01:24,760 --> 02:01:28,690
some casual acquaintance with the fact
that I've criticized the radical left.

2785
02:01:29,110 --> 02:01:29,943
It's like,

2786
02:01:30,780 --> 02:01:31,613
no,

2787
02:01:33,690 --> 02:01:36,310
I'd be lecturing about the
same things for 30 years.

2788
02:01:37,410 --> 02:01:38,330
One hundred one.

2789
02:01:38,350 --> 02:01:40,500
Have I been telling if you want to,

2790
02:01:40,501 --> 02:01:42,840
Nazi Germany can probably be anoxic.

2791
02:01:44,290 --> 02:01:44,700
No,

2792
02:01:44,700 --> 02:01:48,260
I spend about 30 hours trying to convince
my students that that's the truth.

2793
02:01:48,450 --> 02:01:50,000
It's like it's a bitter bloody truth.

2794
02:01:50,550 --> 02:01:51,220
What are you going to do?

2795
02:01:51,220 --> 02:01:54,950
You're going to take that as a message
to transform that into some political

2796
02:01:54,951 --> 02:01:57,380
crusade that's going to make
you feel like it all right?

2797
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:58,213
If your own.

2798
02:01:58,460 --> 02:02:00,940
Because he admitted that and
you understand what that means.

2799
02:02:00,950 --> 02:02:05,950
To admit that if he would
have been announcing it's
occurring in a phone me and

2800
02:02:06,080 --> 02:02:11,080
have that as the best can make that some
sort of political tribalism and if you

2801
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:11,984
don't get,

2802
02:02:12,550 --> 02:02:14,690
if you don't get that core message,

2803
02:02:14,780 --> 02:02:17,260
you know that the evil of the
world resides with the video.

2804
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:19,010
If you don't get that core message,

2805
02:02:19,070 --> 02:02:23,270
you haven't missed anything that are
saying because that's certainly what I've

2806
02:02:23,271 --> 02:02:24,104
been saying.

2807
02:02:24,140 --> 02:02:24,973
No,

2808
02:02:25,490 --> 02:02:27,610
take on the burden of malevolence.

2809
02:02:28,010 --> 02:02:33,010
Don't project it on work and straighten
yourself up because the world depends on

2810
02:02:33,501 --> 02:02:34,334
that.

2811
02:02:34,390 --> 02:02:38,660
It's like people can turn to make
political hay out about the good luck man,

2812
02:02:38,780 --> 02:02:39,700
because that's just,

2813
02:02:39,850 --> 02:02:43,560
it's just not a story that transforms
itself into the ideological wether easily.

2814
02:02:44,540 --> 02:02:46,670
So go back to those people.

2815
02:02:46,671 --> 02:02:48,390
I don't think I have followers on,

2816
02:02:48,490 --> 02:02:48,800
you know,

2817
02:02:48,800 --> 02:02:49,940
I don't like that idea.

2818
02:02:50,380 --> 02:02:51,560
Never have followers.

2819
02:02:51,561 --> 02:02:53,810
It's like you don't have followers.

2820
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:55,120
Please pick up your guard,

2821
02:02:55,121 --> 02:02:56,930
their burden and struggle up the hill.

2822
02:02:57,770 --> 02:02:59,550
I saw something that
you have fall restore,

2823
02:02:59,620 --> 02:03:00,453
that's a cold.

2824
02:03:00,540 --> 02:03:02,270
Each person's individual destiny.

2825
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:04,360
And that's not.

2826
02:03:05,150 --> 02:03:07,210
There's nothing in that for followers.

2827
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:08,993
Like

2828
02:03:12,790 --> 02:03:17,790
thats last important.

2829
02:03:20,840 --> 02:03:21,673
Zach.

2830
02:03:24,200 --> 02:03:24,650
No,

2831
02:03:24,650 --> 02:03:26,300
but we achieve it.

2832
02:03:26,750 --> 02:03:29,420
You should forgive those
who trespass against you.

2833
02:03:29,550 --> 02:03:31,260
It's like you haven't.

2834
02:03:31,270 --> 02:03:32,600
It's pretty hard to do that.

2835
02:03:33,410 --> 02:03:35,980
You don't do that just by
waking up one morning and say,

2836
02:03:35,990 --> 02:03:36,823
I forgive you.

2837
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:37,893
I forgive you.

2838
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:41,660
That's.

2839
02:03:41,660 --> 02:03:43,590
That's the part that hasn't

2840
02:03:45,170 --> 02:03:46,150
forgiven at all.

2841
02:03:46,200 --> 02:03:47,033
I mean,

2842
02:03:47,210 --> 02:03:47,691
first of all,

2843
02:03:47,691 --> 02:03:49,850
you want to ask when you
should forgive someone,

2844
02:03:51,620 --> 02:03:52,453
no.

2845
02:03:54,590 --> 02:03:57,200
Forgiveness is associated with repentance.

2846
02:03:58,040 --> 02:04:00,470
Now let's say that someone
will be traded and seriously,

2847
02:04:00,471 --> 02:04:02,090
or even you'd be treated yourself.

2848
02:04:02,091 --> 02:04:02,850
Let's do that.

2849
02:04:02,850 --> 02:04:03,860
You betrayed yourself.

2850
02:04:03,890 --> 02:04:04,723
You know,

2851
02:04:05,120 --> 02:04:05,451
you think,

2852
02:04:05,451 --> 02:04:05,601
well,

2853
02:04:05,601 --> 02:04:06,740
she'd be forgiving yourself.

2854
02:04:06,750 --> 02:04:07,070
In fact,

2855
02:04:07,070 --> 02:04:07,550
I'll tell you,

2856
02:04:07,550 --> 02:04:11,530
learned your goddamn lesson now until
you come to your cell phone in your hands

2857
02:04:11,540 --> 02:04:12,111
nice and say,

2858
02:04:12,111 --> 02:04:12,740
look,

2859
02:04:12,740 --> 02:04:16,400
here's the periodic ways that was foolish.

2860
02:04:16,670 --> 02:04:19,500
Blind like an exhaustive accommodated,

2861
02:04:19,640 --> 02:04:21,080
and here's what I'm going to do.

2862
02:04:21,140 --> 02:04:25,430
Here's what I've already started to
do to put it right or do you allow me

2863
02:04:25,460 --> 02:04:26,660
another chance?

2864
02:04:27,110 --> 02:04:32,110
That's and then that forgiveness
is because this justice to right.

2865
02:04:33,180 --> 02:04:34,250
There's not just mercy.

2866
02:04:34,251 --> 02:04:35,570
There's also justice.

2867
02:04:35,720 --> 02:04:37,040
You can throw a whole justice,

2868
02:04:37,120 --> 02:04:38,220
no proceeded mercy.

2869
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:43,430
It doesn't work that way and so you
want to forgive if you can because why?

2870
02:04:43,891 --> 02:04:46,020
Carrying with you if you don't have to,

2871
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:52,160
but forgiveness requires
repentance clearly.

2872
02:04:53,430 --> 02:04:55,750
Otherwise it's just
application of responsibility.

2873
02:04:56,310 --> 02:05:01,040
You don't forgive your job for doing
something stupid so easily because all you

2874
02:05:01,041 --> 02:05:02,700
do is encourage them to do stupid things.

2875
02:05:02,701 --> 02:05:02,951
He say,

2876
02:05:02,951 --> 02:05:03,271
well look,

2877
02:05:03,271 --> 02:05:04,740
you did something stupid like,

2878
02:05:04,741 --> 02:05:04,891
well,

2879
02:05:04,891 --> 02:05:05,551
can you forgive me?

2880
02:05:05,551 --> 02:05:05,851
It's like,

2881
02:05:05,851 --> 02:05:06,684
okay,

2882
02:05:07,140 --> 02:05:08,640
what can you do those stupid.

2883
02:05:09,450 --> 02:05:10,283
Exactly.

2884
02:05:10,560 --> 02:05:11,700
Why didn't you do it?

2885
02:05:12,810 --> 02:05:16,920
How is it likely that you're not
going to do it again in the future?

2886
02:05:17,190 --> 02:05:18,900
Can you convince me of that?

2887
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:22,320
And he don't want to let your kid off
easily with that because you don't want

2888
02:05:22,321 --> 02:05:24,120
them to them the same
stupid thing to feature.

2889
02:05:24,150 --> 02:05:25,460
So if they don't understand it,

2890
02:05:25,470 --> 02:05:28,560
they don't have an alternative
plan and they haven't repented,

2891
02:05:28,660 --> 02:05:32,490
then what the hell is what good
is it to forgive them so I get it?

2892
02:05:32,491 --> 02:05:32,731
Yeah,

2893
02:05:32,731 --> 02:05:33,250
no problem.

2894
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:35,760
Can go do it again so that to you,

2895
02:05:35,790 --> 02:05:36,750
that's not love,

2896
02:05:37,890 --> 02:05:42,000
that's not locked office turned to help
the person not doing the same stupid

2897
02:05:42,001 --> 02:05:42,810
thing again.

2898
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:45,480
Sometimes you have to hold
someone's foot to the cold,

2899
02:05:45,481 --> 02:05:46,350
so to speak,

2900
02:05:46,680 --> 02:05:46,951
you know,

2901
02:05:46,951 --> 02:05:47,281
and say,

2902
02:05:47,281 --> 02:05:47,551
look,

2903
02:05:47,551 --> 02:05:50,520
I see what you're doing and you're not
going to get away with it because it's

2904
02:05:50,521 --> 02:05:51,540
not good for you.

2905
02:05:52,640 --> 02:05:53,520
That's

2906
02:05:56,220 --> 02:05:58,440
forgiveness is not the only moral virtue.

2907
02:05:59,900 --> 02:06:01,170
Stretch to the imagination.

2908
02:06:01,171 --> 02:06:03,870
Just like compassion is
not the only moral virtue.

2909
02:06:04,610 --> 02:06:06,180
So all.

2910
02:06:06,250 --> 02:06:06,810
Well,

2911
02:06:06,810 --> 02:06:08,460
we've got time for one more.

2912
02:06:08,970 --> 02:06:10,560
This is probably the appropriate,

2913
02:06:10,561 --> 02:06:11,910
what you mentioned,

2914
02:06:11,911 --> 02:06:16,911
consistency consistently had a goal in
life and when you say that yours has

2915
02:06:17,281 --> 02:06:19,440
changed after you released your book,

2916
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:21,900
so right now as we begin this tour,

2917
02:06:22,310 --> 02:06:24,810
is your job,

2918
02:06:25,260 --> 02:06:26,093
your goal.

2919
02:06:26,310 --> 02:06:27,400
I want to do a good job,

2920
02:06:27,410 --> 02:06:28,260
a snore.

2921
02:06:28,850 --> 02:06:31,520
That's my whole flipping
out about six months later.

2922
02:06:32,130 --> 02:06:36,690
I don't think I can look any farther than
that because the landscape is changing

2923
02:06:36,691 --> 02:06:39,720
very rapidly and I don't
know what to make of it all.

2924
02:06:40,110 --> 02:06:41,060
Not even a bit,

2925
02:06:41,820 --> 02:06:44,750
but I know why you would
have some touchstones.

2926
02:06:45,060 --> 02:06:46,620
This seems worthwhile.

2927
02:06:47,080 --> 02:06:47,400
I mean,

2928
02:06:47,400 --> 02:06:48,420
I enjoyed doing it.

2929
02:06:48,421 --> 02:06:49,870
I'm extraordinarily pleased.

2930
02:06:52,220 --> 02:06:57,220
Thanks.

2931
02:07:00,190 --> 02:07:05,190
We'll talk to 100,000 people
live in the next two months,

2932
02:07:05,941 --> 02:07:07,050
something like that,

2933
02:07:07,200 --> 02:07:11,820
and so I'll try to concentrate on
making this is part of shrinking the

2934
02:07:11,821 --> 02:07:12,420
timeframe.

2935
02:07:12,420 --> 02:07:13,250
Do you know?

2936
02:07:13,250 --> 02:07:14,100
It's very busy.

2937
02:07:14,101 --> 02:07:19,101
I try to concentrate on the property
as the big has sufficient people.

2938
02:07:19,291 --> 02:07:19,880
They're off,

2939
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:20,713
let's say,

2940
02:07:21,090 --> 02:07:26,090
and then I can come and talk to audiences
like audiences have individuals like

2941
02:07:26,371 --> 02:07:29,310
you and we can make a little
progress to say to kids,

2942
02:07:29,311 --> 02:07:30,144
right.

2943
02:07:30,510 --> 02:07:32,130
That's great.

2944
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:33,240
As far as I'm concerned,

2945
02:07:33,241 --> 02:07:38,241
like I can't think of anything that could
more worth doing than that and so and

2946
02:07:39,461 --> 02:07:43,180
hopefully I can do that credibly over
the next six months that I've been

2947
02:07:43,181 --> 02:07:48,181
building a kind of structural
infrastructure underneath
vs because this is God,

2948
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:53,900
this is whatever this is has taken on
kind of a life of its own and I've had to

2949
02:07:55,031 --> 02:07:58,540
build a management structure underneath
it to make sure that it works properly.

2950
02:07:58,950 --> 02:08:00,040
As a creative artist,

2951
02:08:00,100 --> 02:08:00,933
agents,

2952
02:08:00,980 --> 02:08:01,331
artist,

2953
02:08:01,331 --> 02:08:02,560
agency in La,

2954
02:08:02,650 --> 02:08:04,450
it's been helping me set up this tour.

2955
02:08:04,451 --> 02:08:05,980
They've been unbelievably helpful.

2956
02:08:05,981 --> 02:08:06,900
They're so competent,

2957
02:08:06,920 --> 02:08:09,640
but just a pleasure to
work with is thinking.

2958
02:08:09,700 --> 02:08:11,190
It's just going so smoothly,

2959
02:08:11,340 --> 02:08:11,591
you know,

2960
02:08:11,591 --> 02:08:13,930
Dave's been given me a hand
and I think that's great.

2961
02:08:13,931 --> 02:08:14,780
And um,

2962
02:08:15,280 --> 02:08:20,280
so I'm concentrating on making sure that
these folks are alive and real and then

2963
02:08:21,971 --> 02:08:25,510
building the technical infrastructure
around all this to make sure that it goes

2964
02:08:25,570 --> 02:08:30,400
smoothly as possible and hoping that I
can concentrate on getting that property

2965
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:35,200
at the highest level that I'm incapable
over the next six months and we'll see

2966
02:08:35,201 --> 02:08:35,950
what happens.

2967
02:08:35,950 --> 02:08:37,420
This is another thing that's cool.

2968
02:08:37,450 --> 02:08:39,160
This is something to really think about.

2969
02:08:39,370 --> 02:08:41,370
It's one of the best things
that I've ever learned.

2970
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:45,070
There's some real is something
about telling the truth,

2971
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:48,160
which is rule eight,

2972
02:08:48,220 --> 02:08:49,420
if I remember correctly,

2973
02:08:50,850 --> 02:08:53,470
the rule is to tell the
truth or at least to apply,

2974
02:08:54,880 --> 02:08:55,713
you know,

2975
02:08:56,290 --> 02:08:59,770
if you say what you think and you have
to do this carefully and you have to know

2976
02:08:59,771 --> 02:09:01,320
what you think and you have to watch it.

2977
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:02,620
So it's not an easy thing,

2978
02:09:02,950 --> 02:09:05,830
but it's so incredibly adventurous.

2979
02:09:06,150 --> 02:09:07,240
It never bored.

2980
02:09:07,770 --> 02:09:07,960
No.

2981
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:08,950
Because if you say,

2982
02:09:08,951 --> 02:09:09,461
what do you think?

2983
02:09:09,461 --> 02:09:10,640
You don't know what's going to happen.

2984
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:13,270
God knows what happened,

2985
02:09:13,271 --> 02:09:16,630
like all sorts of weird things will
happen that you might not cope with them,

2986
02:09:16,631 --> 02:09:17,330
but I'll tell you,

2987
02:09:17,330 --> 02:09:18,200
you're not going to find.

2988
02:09:18,220 --> 02:09:21,190
You can see this white.

2989
02:09:21,340 --> 02:09:25,210
The idea though of telling the truth
is associated with the idea of faith

2990
02:09:25,420 --> 02:09:29,320
because there's a proposition and it's
laid out in the first chapter of genesis

2991
02:09:29,321 --> 02:09:32,200
and the proposition basically
if something like this,

2992
02:09:32,201 --> 02:09:37,090
if you wanted to express it sort of
psychological language that the being that

2993
02:09:37,091 --> 02:09:42,091
you bring into mediating by telling them
the truth is the being that is good,

2994
02:09:42,850 --> 02:09:44,230
so that's a proposition.

2995
02:09:44,320 --> 02:09:46,000
It's like an axiom of faith.

2996
02:09:46,030 --> 02:09:46,321
He said,

2997
02:09:46,321 --> 02:09:47,154
well,

2998
02:09:47,320 --> 02:09:51,460
that the universe is constituted so
that whatever you bring into being by

2999
02:09:51,461 --> 02:09:53,830
telling the truth is is good,

3000
02:09:54,700 --> 02:09:58,000
but it doesn't necessarily manifest
itself that way in the moment.

3001
02:09:58,450 --> 02:09:58,780
You know,

3002
02:09:58,780 --> 02:10:00,460
because good is really complicated,

3003
02:10:00,520 --> 02:10:01,000
right?

3004
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:03,970
Something can be terrible at the moment
and then turn out to be pretty damn

3005
02:10:03,971 --> 02:10:04,480
good.

3006
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:09,010
That's happening with a
lot of these protests which
were unbelievably painful in

3007
02:10:09,011 --> 02:10:09,401
the moment,

3008
02:10:09,401 --> 02:10:10,420
like the one I'm queens,

3009
02:10:10,421 --> 02:10:15,370
which was just an
absolute Zombie nightmare.

3010
02:10:16,840 --> 02:10:17,501
Talk about,

3011
02:10:17,501 --> 02:10:18,880
we'll get an audience,

3012
02:10:18,881 --> 02:10:22,110
we're afraid it this really uncanny but,

3013
02:10:22,820 --> 02:10:27,820
but it unfolded well as progressed
and so I decided a long time ago,

3014
02:10:29,830 --> 02:10:34,830
probably 30 years ago that I was going
to be fairly careful with what I said I

3015
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:38,330
was going to watch every word I said and
every word that I wrote and see if the

3016
02:10:38,331 --> 02:10:42,980
words maverick as if they really mattered
and now I'm supposed to say what I

3017
02:10:43,010 --> 02:10:48,010
thought carefully and let whatever
happened happen no matter what it was.

3018
02:10:48,980 --> 02:10:49,813
And

3019
02:10:52,460 --> 02:10:55,150
if you're looking for an adventure man,

3020
02:10:55,910 --> 02:10:56,760
you do that,

3021
02:10:56,790 --> 02:10:57,920
you'll have your adventure.

3022
02:10:58,130 --> 02:10:58,963
That's for sure.

3023
02:10:59,540 --> 02:11:00,373
And so,

3024
02:11:04,330 --> 02:11:07,150
well that's what I'm trying to
see the limits of that I guess.

3025
02:11:07,160 --> 02:11:07,570
No,

3026
02:11:07,570 --> 02:11:12,570
it's like I wrote that whole being and
that'd be lectured them on time and

3027
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,051
successfully,

3028
02:11:14,051 --> 02:11:14,331
you know,

3029
02:11:14,331 --> 02:11:16,280
the students have really responded to it.

3030
02:11:16,281 --> 02:11:19,450
Then for whatever reason,

3031
02:11:20,060 --> 02:11:25,060
now it's very crazily distributed.

3032
02:11:26,390 --> 02:11:28,940
You know right now on youtube,

3033
02:11:29,840 --> 02:11:34,840
people are making 4,000 videos
go week about my videos.

3034
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:38,020
So it's,

3035
02:11:38,190 --> 02:11:40,310
it's absolutely.

3036
02:11:40,490 --> 02:11:43,300
I'd have to say what to make of it,

3037
02:11:43,310 --> 02:11:44,143
but

3038
02:11:46,430 --> 02:11:47,990
we'll see how it plays out.

3039
02:11:49,050 --> 02:11:54,050
I'm gonna try to do it as well as I can
and watch what happens because I'll tell

3040
02:11:54,290 --> 02:11:55,123
you it's,

3041
02:11:55,130 --> 02:11:56,510
it's not dog.

3042
02:11:59,080 --> 02:12:04,080
Thank you.

3043
02:12:12,970 --> 02:12:16,380
I just want to thank you for
letting me be part of this role,

3044
02:12:16,570 --> 02:12:17,403
but more importantly,

3045
02:12:17,620 --> 02:12:18,250
it's an honor.

3046
02:12:18,250 --> 02:12:20,960
I mean the things they eat better.

3047
02:12:21,060 --> 02:12:22,510
It's still a work in progress,

3048
02:12:22,860 --> 02:12:26,170
but I'm honored to be part of this and
I can't wait to see what the next two

3049
02:12:26,171 --> 02:12:28,360
months brand for all of us.

3050
02:12:28,361 --> 02:12:28,691
So,

3051
02:12:28,691 --> 02:12:29,480
uh,

3052
02:12:29,480 --> 02:12:30,313
give it up.

3053
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:35,900
Thank you.

3054
02:12:36,930 --> 02:12:37,231
Hey,

3055
02:12:37,231 --> 02:12:38,100
congratulations.

3056
02:12:38,101 --> 02:12:38,970
You made it to the end.

3057
02:12:39,180 --> 02:12:40,013
Thanks for listening.

3058
02:12:40,270 --> 02:12:41,430
Hope you enjoyed the talk.

3059
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:41,911
I know.

3060
02:12:41,911 --> 02:12:42,744
I really did.

3061
02:12:42,780 --> 02:12:45,720
At some points I felt like Peterson
was speaking directly to me.

3062
02:12:45,810 --> 02:12:48,750
Like when he says you've got
yourself half put together,

3063
02:12:48,810 --> 02:12:49,650
you're 21,

3064
02:12:50,050 --> 02:12:51,690
it can be deadly by the time you're 30.

3065
02:12:52,110 --> 02:12:55,230
I'm 21 myself and I feel like that's
incredibly encouraging for me.

3066
02:12:55,560 --> 02:12:58,230
I felt like I've been a mess
for the last 20 years at least,

3067
02:12:58,231 --> 02:13:01,320
and it's only been this past year that
I've been trying to improve myself for

3068
02:13:01,321 --> 02:13:02,154
the better.

3069
02:13:02,240 --> 02:13:05,300
Here's some of the other inspiring things
that he said that I especially took

3070
02:13:05,301 --> 02:13:06,134
note of.

3071
02:13:06,140 --> 02:13:07,850
You want to be an example to yourself.

3072
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,490
You can be competent in
10 different domains.

3073
02:13:10,491 --> 02:13:12,110
You can be a force of nature.

3074
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:15,530
Make yourself so competent
that you're just terrifying.

3075
02:13:16,010 --> 02:13:19,370
Another thing I particularly enjoyed was
when he was talking about people such

3076
02:13:19,371 --> 02:13:20,204
as myself,

3077
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:22,880
people who have been inspired
by what he's been saying,

3078
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:23,540
uh,

3079
02:13:23,540 --> 02:13:26,240
he said that referring
to people such as myself,

3080
02:13:26,420 --> 02:13:27,680
they want a pat on the back,

3081
02:13:28,160 --> 02:13:29,210
not for what they've done,

3082
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:31,440
but because they're on the
path to something greater.

3083
02:13:31,740 --> 02:13:36,740
And I felt like for most of my life I've
been told to be myself and to accept

3084
02:13:36,931 --> 02:13:41,931
myself for who I am and I could never
really take that advice because I didn't

3085
02:13:42,121 --> 02:13:44,940
really like myself and I
didn't really know who I was,

3086
02:13:44,941 --> 02:13:46,530
who this person was.

3087
02:13:46,531 --> 02:13:49,080
So I felt like that advice
was just lost on me.

3088
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:52,260
But I think it's great to
hear that you can transform.

3089
02:13:52,261 --> 02:13:53,610
If you don't like what you are,

3090
02:13:53,611 --> 02:13:55,290
you can become better.

3091
02:13:55,291 --> 02:13:58,050
You can transform into a warrior.

3092
02:13:58,260 --> 02:13:59,880
That's another thing I
really liked that he said,

3093
02:13:59,881 --> 02:14:02,460
transform yourself into a warrior.

3094
02:14:03,040 --> 02:14:04,410
That's exactly what I want to do,

3095
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:05,244
you know?

3096
02:14:05,280 --> 02:14:06,113
Anyway,

3097
02:14:06,120 --> 02:14:08,550
I know you clicked on this
video to hear Dr Pearson speak,

3098
02:14:08,551 --> 02:14:09,930
but if you like what I've been saying,

3099
02:14:10,170 --> 02:14:14,460
please consider subscribing for more

3101
02:14:15,360 --> 02:14:16,193
Thanks for listening.

3102
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:17,100
Have a beautiful day.
