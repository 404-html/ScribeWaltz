1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,120
It isn't that the only that,
because if you're healthy and energetic,

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:06,330
you're much more likely to be successful
because it's very hard to be successful

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,170
if you're ill obviously.
I mean so because the competition is

4
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:11,730
just too high.
And both,

5
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:14,100
both genders,
both sexes select each other for

6
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,050
attractiveness,
both select for intelligence,

7
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:19,590
both at select for personality,
although the different,

8
00:00:19,591 --> 00:00:22,590
there are differences there in terms of
what's what stressed.

9
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,050
But so,
so,

10
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,170
so I think you can derive a couple of
things out of out of this.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,240
And this is where I think people are
different than,

12
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:32,820
than other animals.
Importantly different is that,

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,120
so you imagine that there's tremendous
selection pressure to,

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,290
uh,
towards the production,

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,830
let's say of men who are good at
climbing male dominance hierarchies or

16
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,200
are climbing the male dominance
hierarchy.

17
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:49,860
But the thing that's so interesting
about people is that we've multiplied

18
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:51,120
our dominance hierarchies.

19
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,340
You know,
if you take an animal that's got a

20
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:57,000
rather static behavioral pattern,
then there's,

21
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:59,880
there's a single hierarchy.
Elephant seals are a good example of

22
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:00,960
that.
So elephant seals,

23
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:03,120
the males are absolutely massive.
They're way,

24
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:06,570
way bigger than the females.
And they basically have harems roughly

25
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:10,830
speaking,
and they use physical prowess as their

26
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,550
marker of status essentially.
And obviously size is a huge part of

27
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:17,170
that because otherwise the male elephant
seals wouldn't be as,

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,190
they're massive.
These things are absolutely enormous.

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,450
And so it's just power slash health,
you know,

30
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,100
maybe aggression,
something like that.

31
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,280
It's whatever makes them more um,
suitable for the kind of physical combat

32
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,250
that elephant seals engage it.
So,

33
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,720
and the degree to which power is
associated with dominance status in

34
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:44,940
those sorts of situations seems to be
associated with the size differential

35
00:01:44,941 --> 00:01:49,800
between males and females.
So the more power is an issue with

36
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:52,710
regards to male competence,
the larger the bales are compared to the

37
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:56,250
females and the more likely the males
are going to have a harem relationship

38
00:01:56,251 --> 00:01:57,084
with the females.

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,940
And you see that a little bit in human
beings because men are bigger than

40
00:01:59,941 --> 00:02:02,550
women.
They're not overwhelmingly bigger.

41
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,440
That's sexual dimorphism.
And you know,

42
00:02:04,441 --> 00:02:06,390
there's some men that are smaller than
some women,

43
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:09,780
but on average men are tolerant there.
They have more upper body strength and

44
00:02:09,781 --> 00:02:12,030
so forth.
So there is a power element to male

45
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:15,960
competition,
but it's not as extended as it would be

46
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,040
among animals.
Say like,

47
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,550
like elephant seals.
So in the elephant seal you see maybe

48
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:25,551
there's one stable set of traits that's
being selected for that makes the males

49
00:02:26,341 --> 00:02:28,500
more likely to reproduce.
But human beings,

50
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:32,550
we're very weird creatures because we're
so conceptually flexible.

51
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:37,551
And so what seems to have happened,
maybe we started males started selecting

52
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,310
each other for don in dominance
competitions for something like

53
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,070
cognitive flexibility and
conscientiousness.

54
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:48,090
It's something like that.
So that would be the ability to

55
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:51,570
abstractly represent the world and then
the ability to operate effectively

56
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:54,270
within it,
to represent yourself socially in a way.

57
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:57,330
And then to carry through with that
because that enables people to trust

58
00:02:57,331 --> 00:02:58,860
you.
So it's something like,

59
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:05,010
and so that produced cortical expansion
and then women were selecting men who

60
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:07,720
are good at that,
in that produce cortical expansion.

61
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,710
And then there's an arms race between
women and men with regards to

62
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:15,130
intelligence.
So the women kept up or they certainly

63
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:16,200
kept up with,
with,

64
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,200
with intelligence as,
as the evolutionary cycle continued.

65
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:25,950
But one of the consequences of selection
for cortical expansion and increased

66
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:32,110
cognitive flexibility was that the
number of dominance hierarchies that

67
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,420
human beings could produce started to
multiply,

68
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,250
right?
Because there's all sorts of ways that

69
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:39,400
you can be successful.
There's you think about how many ways

70
00:03:39,401 --> 00:03:43,180
you can be successful in a modern
culture and and you can be successful in

71
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,670
dimensions that aren't really even
associated with each other.

72
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,450
So you can be successful socially that
that's what an extrovert would do.

73
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,210
You could be successful in terms of
intimate relationships.

74
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,200
That's what a agreeable person would do.
A disagreeable person would be more

75
00:03:56,201 --> 00:04:00,220
successful with regards to competition.
A person who's high in neuroticism would

76
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:02,440
be,
would be tried to protect themselves and

77
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:06,100
to establish some sort of security and
open person would be looking for a

78
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:10,020
flexible creative environment.
And so there's this multiplicity of,

79
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,430
of ways that you can establish a
dominance hierarchy and be successful in

80
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:16,360
it.
And if you're creative,

81
00:04:16,361 --> 00:04:18,370
you can come up with your own damn
dominance hierarchy,

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,830
which is exactly what you're doing.
If you're creative,

83
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:21,360
right?
You,

84
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,610
you spin up a game that's your game and
then you,

85
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,370
you make the rules.
And that's hard because if you make a

86
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:29,500
new game with new rule,
if it's hard to monetize it,

87
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,290
but you can be the best at playing that
game.

88
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,860
And so that's a huge advantage to being
creative if you can pull it off.

89
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,300
So then you think,
well,

90
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:42,250
what's happened among human beings is
the multiplication of the set of

91
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:45,220
possible dominance hierarchies.
So it's become very broad.

92
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,570
And then you could say,
well,

93
00:04:46,571 --> 00:04:48,550
what's,
what's driving selection now is the

94
00:04:48,551 --> 00:04:51,340
ability to be successful across multiple
sets of dominance,

95
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,840
hierarchies.
And that accounts,

96
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:54,910
at least in part for our cognitive
flexibility.

97
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,040
And so that's really what a human being
is.

98
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:01,570
A human being is a creature that has
high potential for succeeding across a

99
00:05:01,571 --> 00:05:04,510
very wide range of potential human
dominance hierarchies.

100
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,840
And so that gives us our transformative
psyche.

101
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:11,290
That's the niche that,
that's the niche that we've both

102
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:14,080
produced and occupy.
And I think it's out of that,

103
00:05:14,081 --> 00:05:17,620
that hero mythology emerges
fundamentally because I think what the

104
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,930
hero is,
the mythological hero is a

105
00:05:19,931 --> 00:05:24,400
representation of that part of the
psyche that's particularly good at being

106
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:26,860
successful across sets of dominance
hierarchies.

107
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,040
It's a very,
very biological way of thinking about

108
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,650
it.
And I thought about this for a long

109
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,590
time.
I can't see any way that that just can't

110
00:05:35,591 --> 00:05:37,750
be the case.
And how else,

111
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,840
how else could it work if we had a fixed
behavioral pattern like beavers,

112
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,130
you know you're the most successful
beaver.

113
00:05:45,131 --> 00:05:47,130
If you build the best damn,
it's like fine.

114
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,790
Then you know what's going to be
selected for it.

115
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:52,510
But that isn't what people are like and
it's also why we're so multipurpose.

116
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,540
You know we have hands.
What's a hand for?

117
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,900
What's the evolutionary of a hand?
Well you,

118
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:01,850
you can't specify that.
You could say it's something like,

119
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,060
well the hand is useful for doing a
whole bunch of different things with

120
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,850
well and mouth.
Tongue,

121
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:10,520
same thing.
What are words for while it's the same

122
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:13,190
thing,
therefore very there for communicating a

123
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,260
very wide range of information.

124
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:18,830
It's something like that.
So were were these weird general purpose

125
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:19,611
animals,
you know,

126
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:24,611
we're not great at any one thing,
but we can swim better than most

127
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,140
terrestrial animals.
You know,

128
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:31,370
we can run faster than most animals and
we could certainly run longer.

129
00:06:31,371 --> 00:06:35,180
Like a human being can run a horse to
death over the course of a week if

130
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:37,070
they're in good shape.
So like,

131
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,760
we're really good at being multipurpose
entity,

132
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,870
like a rat,
you know,

133
00:06:41,871 --> 00:06:45,230
were they call rats,
weedy species because they can be

134
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,080
anywhere.
They don't have a specific niche.

135
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:48,741
Like,
you know,

136
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,390
there's animals down in,
in,

137
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,940
uh,
the Amazon that are specialized for like

138
00:06:52,941 --> 00:06:54,380
one tree,
you know,

139
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,080
or one type of tree in one tiny little
area.

140
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,660
That's not what human beings like is,
were we're like,

141
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:02,540
cockroaches are rats,
which is nasty comparison,

142
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,510
but we can go anywhere and thrive.
And so,

143
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,570
and so being particularly good at that,
being particularly good at being able to

144
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:15,650
go anywhere and thrive also seems to me
to be a canonical element of the hero

145
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,300
mythology.
So,

146
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,913
so,
okay.

147
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,630
All right.
Now.
