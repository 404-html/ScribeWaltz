1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,890
One of the things you learned as a
clinical psychologist contra the anti

2
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:12,891
psychiatrists let's say is that
diagnosis is often a relief to people.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,590
You know there's a problem with being
diagnosed because then you might be

4
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:20,040
labeled and then the label can follow
you for the rest of your life and once

5
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:21,810
you're labeled as something,

6
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:26,250
then strange things happen around you
that is often reinforced that label.

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,280
Maybe you start acting it out more
or you adopt it as an identity,

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:33,540
but there's a flip side of that which is
that the last thing that you ever want

9
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,260
to hear when you go see a
physician or psychologist is,

10
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,363
you know,

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,620
I've never seen a case like yours before.

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:42,271
Right?

13
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:46,280
That is not a relief man
because if the messages,

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,980
I've never heard anything
like what you're telling me,

15
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,640
the outcome is either going to be not so
good for you or you're not going to get

16
00:00:53,641 --> 00:00:54,480
listened to it all.

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:54,751
Right.

18
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:56,700
Because you're such an
anomaly that you're,

19
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,780
you're actually in your existence is
annoying to the integrated knowledge

20
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:04,200
structure of the medical professional
that you are attempting to receive advice

21
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:04,770
from.

22
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:04,951
Well,

23
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:06,990
it's definitely the case
because they didn't,

24
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:07,824
you know,

25
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,420
if you can be put in a box,

26
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:13,170
then the box tells the
doctor what to do with you.

27
00:01:13,171 --> 00:01:14,970
And that's actually a
relief to the doctor,

28
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,680
but also a relief to you.

29
00:01:16,681 --> 00:01:16,921
Right?

30
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,754
Because you want to know,

31
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,701
so you come in,

32
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:19,051
you say,

33
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:19,351
look,

34
00:01:19,351 --> 00:01:21,630
I can't go out of my house much anymore.

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,280
I'm afraid on elevators.

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,720
I have heart palpitations and I sometimes
they end up in the emergency room.

37
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,550
Increasingly my,

38
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:30,570
uh,

39
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,280
interactions in the world are restricted.

40
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:33,690
I find myself staying at home,

41
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,460
I'm afraid I'm going to
die of a heart attack.

42
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,590
And the psychologist says,

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:37,801
well,

44
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:38,880
you have egg or a phobia.

45
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,980
It's like lots of people have that.

46
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:44,880
And here's usually how it develops and
here's the treatment course and you know,

47
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:46,470
we can probably do something about that.

48
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,304
And it's like,

49
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,923
well,

50
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,120
you're not going to die of
a heart attack now probably.

51
00:01:51,121 --> 00:01:52,140
That's a real relief.

52
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,290
You're not crazy in a completely unique
way and you're crazy in a way that might

53
00:01:57,691 --> 00:01:59,100
be treatable,

54
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,401
you know?

55
00:01:59,401 --> 00:01:59,731
And it's so,

56
00:01:59,731 --> 00:02:03,540
it's such a relief because people
come in there with a pile of snakes of

57
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,010
indeterminate magnitude,

58
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:07,140
and they walk out with
one manageable snake,

59
00:02:07,141 --> 00:02:08,190
and it's still a snake,

60
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,180
but you know,

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,540
one manageable snake beats a hydra right.
