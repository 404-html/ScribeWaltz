1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,440
Looking at myself,

2
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:07,981
honestly,

3
00:00:07,981 --> 00:00:08,551
John says,

4
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,490
I'm deeply envious and
resentful of others happiness.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,780
How do I turn this around?

6
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,490
Where all John,

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:20,150
I would say you've started to turn it
down around already because you have at

8
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:24,630
least come to the conclusion that you're
deeply envious and resentful of others

9
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:25,171
happiness.

10
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:27,360
So you did have the
damn problem diagnosed.

11
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:32,100
So one of the things you might do is
figure out what you would like instead.

12
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,770
Like how would you like
to feel about the world,

13
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,810
you know,

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:39,720
because you're implying that being deeply
envious and resentful isn't for the

15
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:40,554
best.

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,620
So let's assume that you would rather be
pleased about other people's successes

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,110
and not envious.

18
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:49,710
Well,

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:49,981
you know,

20
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,480
the first thing you might think is,

21
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:55,290
well maybe you have to do some
writing or at least some thinking.

22
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:58,950
It's like maybe the
alternative would be happy,

23
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,680
be happy about other's
success and happiness.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,570
Well maybe you should start by thinking
about why you might be happy about their

25
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:07,021
happiness.

26
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,270
It's not like happiness
is a zero sum game,

27
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:09,481
you know,

28
00:01:09,481 --> 00:01:11,400
it's not like it's not.

29
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:12,300
And I believe me,

30
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:15,300
I'm taking your question seriously
and I think that what you're saying

31
00:01:15,301 --> 00:01:19,770
characterized as plenty of people and I
think that you're being deeply honest,

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,700
noticing it,

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,580
happiness isn't a zero sum game.

34
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:24,414
You know,

35
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,970
lots of people can be
happy at the same time.

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,040
And do you really want to live in a world
where other people are less happy in

37
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:36,030
what possible manner would that be
useful and good for you in the medium to

38
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:36,420
longterm?

39
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,620
It might make you feel,

40
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,060
you know,

41
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,500
grudgingly a satisfied,

42
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:43,711
you know,

43
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:45,450
in a dark way temporarily,

44
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:47,610
but it's not a very
good long term strategy.

45
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:49,650
So I would say you got
to think it through,

46
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,490
you know,

47
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:50,970
what,

48
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,190
how is it that you would
like to view the world?

49
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,960
How do you think that
would be best for you?

50
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:59,370
I mean as if you were taking
care of yourself like you,

51
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,650
like you're someone who
deserves to be taken care of.

52
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:03,780
Think about how you'd
like to have the world,

53
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,880
how he'd like to view the world.

54
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,800
And one of the ways you can do that too,

55
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:12,801
is to think about some people that you
admire and try to figure out how they

56
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,610
look at the world or even ask them,

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:15,511
you know,

58
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:19,860
because maybe then you can find out what
it is about your thought patterns that

59
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:20,940
are driving you down.

60
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,200
This sort of dark road.
