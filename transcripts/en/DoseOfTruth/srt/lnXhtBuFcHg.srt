1
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:04,110
Where does the information
and dreams come from?

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,710
And I think what the w w where it comes
from is that we watch the patterns that

3
00:00:10,891 --> 00:00:13,830
everyone acts out.

4
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:18,840
We've watched that forever and we've got
some representations of those patterns.

5
00:00:18,841 --> 00:00:20,280
That's part of our cultural history.

6
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,990
That's what's embedded in stories,

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,430
in fictional accounts of,

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,050
of the story between good and evil,

9
00:00:25,051 --> 00:00:26,940
the bad guy and the good
guy and the romance,

10
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:27,121
you know,

11
00:00:27,121 --> 00:00:27,720
these are,

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:31,650
these are canonical patterns of being
for people in and they deeply affect us

13
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:34,920
because they represent what it is
that we will act out in the world.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,280
And then we fleshed that out with the
individual information we have about

15
00:00:38,281 --> 00:00:39,540
ourselves and other people.

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,490
And so it's like there's a,

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:42,540
there's a,

18
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,540
there's waves of a behavioral patterns
that manifest themselves in the crowd

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,160
across time that great dramas are
played on the crowd across time.

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,160
And the artists watched that and,

21
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,010
and they get intimations of what that is
and they write it down and they tell us

22
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:01,230
and then we're a little
clearer about what we're up to.

23
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,010
No.

24
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,730
Like a great dramatists like Shakespeare
let's say is we know that what he wrote

25
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:06,960
is fiction and then we say,

26
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:08,400
well fiction isn't true.

27
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,541
But then you think,

28
00:01:09,541 --> 00:01:10,380
well wait a minute.

29
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,430
Maybe it's true.

30
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:12,930
Like numbers are true.

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,010
You know,

32
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,890
numbers are an abstraction
from the underlying reality,

33
00:01:16,891 --> 00:01:20,700
but no one in their right mind would
really think numbers aren't true.

34
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,510
You could even make a case that the
numbers are more real than the things that

35
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:25,350
they represent,

36
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:25,561
right?

37
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:28,230
Cause the obstruction
is so insanely powerful.

38
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,730
Once you have mathematics,

39
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,020
you're just deadly.

40
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,300
You can move the world with mathematics.

41
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,990
And so it's not obvious that the
abstraction is less real than the,

42
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:37,970
than the,

43
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,560
than the more concrete reality.

44
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,530
And you take a work of fiction
like hamlet and you think,

45
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,800
well is that it's,

46
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,890
it's not true because it's fiction.

47
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:47,491
But then you think,

48
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:48,061
wait a minute,

49
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:49,590
what kind of explanation is that?

50
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,300
Like maybe it's more true than nonfiction
because it takes what the story that

51
00:01:54,301 --> 00:01:57,930
needs to be told about you and the story
that needs to be told about you and you

52
00:01:57,931 --> 00:02:00,160
and you and you and abstracts that out.

53
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:00,451
And says,

54
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:00,870
look,

55
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:05,160
here's something that's a key part
of the human experience as such,

56
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:05,971
right,

57
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:06,271
so it's,

58
00:02:06,271 --> 00:02:11,271
it's an abstraction from this underlying
noisy substrate and people are affected

59
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:17,160
by it because they see that the thing
that's represented as part of the pattern

60
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,030
of their being,

61
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,560
that's the right way to think about it.

62
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:21,510
And then with these old stories,

63
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,590
these ancient stories,

64
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:26,460
it seems to me like that process has
been occurring for thousands of years.

65
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,210
It's like we watched ourselves
and we extracted out some stories,

66
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:35,070
we imitated each other and we represented
that in drama and then we distilled

67
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:39,150
the drama and we got a representation
of the distillation and then we did it

68
00:02:39,151 --> 00:02:43,570
again at the end of that process
that took God only knows how long.

69
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,510
I think some of these stories,

70
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,290
they've traced fairytales
back 10,000 years,

71
00:02:49,291 --> 00:02:51,960
some fairy tales in
relatively unchanged for him.

72
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:56,250
And it certainly seems to me that the
archeological evidence for example,

73
00:02:56,251 --> 00:02:59,060
suggests that the really
old stories that that,

74
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,820
that the Bible begins with our,

75
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:05,410
at least that old and likely embedded
in a prehistory that's far older than

76
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:05,890
that.

77
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:06,611
And you might think,

78
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:07,444
well,

79
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,070
how can you be so sure?

80
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,090
The answer to that in part is
that cultures that don't change,

81
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,620
like the ancient cultures,

82
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:14,861
right?

83
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,530
They didn't change as fast
as they stayed the same.

84
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,180
That's the answer.

85
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:19,961
So they call it,

86
00:03:19,961 --> 00:03:22,840
they keep their information
moving generation to generation.

87
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:24,520
That's how they stay the same.

88
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:25,781
And so we know,

89
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:27,400
again in the archaeological record,

90
00:03:27,401 --> 00:03:31,360
there are records of rituals that have
remained relatively unbroken for up to

91
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,530
20,000 years.

92
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:36,940
It was discovered in caves in Japan that
were set up for a particular kind of

93
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:40,570
bare worship that was also
characteristic of western Europe.

94
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,210
So these things can last for
very long periods of time.

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,310
We're watching each
other act in the world.

96
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
And then the question is,

97
00:03:50,901 --> 00:03:51,051
well,

98
00:03:51,051 --> 00:03:53,090
how long have we been watching each other?

99
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:55,420
And the answered that in some senses,

100
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:00,080
while as long as there's been creatures
with nervous systems and that's a long

101
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:00,471
time,

102
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:00,720
you know,

103
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,660
that's some hundreds of millions of years,

104
00:04:02,661 --> 00:04:03,980
perhaps longer than that.

105
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:07,580
We'd been watching each other trying to
figure out what we're up to across that

106
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:08,780
entire span of time.

107
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:11,420
Some of that knowledge is
built right into our bodies,

108
00:04:11,421 --> 00:04:13,160
which is why we can dance with each other,

109
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:13,821
for example.

110
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:14,061
Right?

111
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:18,200
Because understanding isn't
just something that you,

112
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,060
that you have as an abstraction.

113
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:21,500
It's something that you act out.

114
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:22,130
You know,

115
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,100
that's what children are
doing when they're learning
to rough and tumble plays.

116
00:04:25,101 --> 00:04:29,150
They're learning to integrate their
body with the body of someone else in a

117
00:04:29,151 --> 00:04:30,200
harmonious way,

118
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,730
learning to cooperate and compete,

119
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:34,610
and that's all instantiated
right into their body.

120
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,020
It's not abstract knowledge.

121
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,700
They don't know that they're doing that.

122
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,930
They're just doing it.

123
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:42,740
And so we can even use our body
as a representational platform.

124
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,710
So we've been studying
each other for a long time.

125
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,060
Abstracting out what is it that
we're up to and that's that.

126
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,680
That's what is it we're up to,

127
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:53,300
what should we be up to?

128
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,250
That's even a more fundamental question.

129
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,400
If you're going to live in the world
and you're going to do it properly,

130
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,390
what does properly mean and how is
it that you might go about that?

131
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,320
Well,

132
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,670
it's the right question,

133
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:04,941
right?

134
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:06,200
It's what everyone wants to know.

135
00:05:06,201 --> 00:05:07,490
How do you live in the world?

136
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:09,050
Not what is the world made of.

137
00:05:09,051 --> 00:05:10,370
It's not the same question.

138
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,900
How do you live in the world?

139
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,040
It's the eternal question of human
beings and I guess we're the only species

140
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:19,070
that has ever really asked that
question because all the other animals,

141
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,720
they just go and do whatever they do,

142
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,883
not us.

143
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,510
It's a question for us.

144
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,710
We've had to,

145
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,240
we have to become aware of it.

146
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,740
We have to be able to speak it.

147
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,270
God only knows why,

148
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,700
but that seems to be the situation.

149
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,400
So

150
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,710
we act that acting is shaped by the world,

151
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:41,010
that acting is shaped by society into
something that we don't understand,

152
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:43,080
but that we can model that.

153
00:05:43,081 --> 00:05:43,841
We can model it.

154
00:05:43,841 --> 00:05:45,210
We model it in our stories,

155
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:49,710
we Marlett with our bodies and that's
where the dream gets its information.

156
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,910
The dream is part of the process that's
watching everything and then trying to

157
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,380
formulate it and trying to say,

158
00:05:55,381 --> 00:05:55,830
well,

159
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:59,780
trying to get the signal from the
noise and to portrayed in dramatic form

160
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:01,250
because the dream is little drama.

161
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:06,460
And then you get the chairs to s park
about what that dream is and then you have

162
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:07,340
it.

163
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,040
You have something like articulated
knowledge at that point.

164
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,470
And so the Bible I would say is,

165
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,360
is it sort of,

166
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,860
it exists in that space that's half
into the dream and half into articulated

167
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:19,550
knowledge.

168
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,660
It's something like that.

169
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,480
And going into it to find out
what the stories are about Ken,

170
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,600
what can it can aid
our self understanding.

171
00:06:29,601 --> 00:06:31,250
And then the other issue is,

172
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,660
is that if nene,

173
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:37,280
she was correct and if Dostoevsky or
young was correct and Dostoevsky as well

174
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,430
without the cornerstone that
that understanding provides,

175
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,480
we're lost.

176
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,580
And that's not good because then
we're susceptible to psych pathology.

177
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,500
That's psychological pathology.

178
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:52,650
You know,

179
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,610
the people who are ad adamant,

180
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,740
anti religious thinkers seem to believe
that if we abandoned our immersement in

181
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:02,870
the underlying dream,

182
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:07,340
that we'd all instantly
become rationalists like
Descartes or bacon or you know,

183
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,210
intelligent,

184
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,260
clear thinking,

185
00:07:09,261 --> 00:07:11,120
rational scientific people.

186
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,270
I don't believe that for a moment because
I don't think there's any evidence for

187
00:07:14,271 --> 00:07:14,361
it.

188
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:19,361
I think we would become so irrational so
rapidly that the weirdest mysteries of

189
00:07:19,461 --> 00:07:23,570
Catholicism would see
positively rational by contrast,

190
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:25,010
and I think that's already happening.
