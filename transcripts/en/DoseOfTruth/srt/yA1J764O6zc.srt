1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
One of the things you should know is
that you actually die into your brain.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,130
So one of the things you
might wonder is why is,

3
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,870
why is it the death evolved?

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:09,991
It,

5
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:12,630
it doesn't really make that much
sense from a Darwinian perspective,

6
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:12,811
right?

7
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:16,230
Because you'd make the presupposition
that if you could just stick around and

8
00:00:16,231 --> 00:00:18,750
farther children safe for 250 years,

9
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:22,530
you'd be doing a lot better job than the
poor SAP who only live to be 30 so why

10
00:00:22,531 --> 00:00:25,650
is it that you only live
to be 70 and really your,

11
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:25,891
you know,

12
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:27,220
your period of fertility is over,

13
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:29,850
say by the time you're
40 why would that be?

14
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,680
What's the utility of death?

15
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,061
And then you remember,

16
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:33,894
well,

17
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:35,790
the environment's always changing,

18
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,001
right?

19
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:38,940
In this chaotic manner that's
represented by the great mother.

20
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,430
Can you change with it?

21
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,070
And the answer to that is yes,

22
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,870
but only to a certain point,

23
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,970
which is why as people age,

24
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:51,570
they stay tend to become more and more
alienated from the current culture,

25
00:00:51,571 --> 00:00:51,840
right?

26
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,500
They've,

27
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,740
they've adopted their
position of being say,

28
00:00:55,741 --> 00:00:58,740
which is a word more or less fixed
by the time they're 25 or so.

29
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,940
Once their prefrontal cortex matures
and then after that the world gets away

30
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:03,181
from,

31
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:07,080
they don't have enough biological
resources left to constantly undergo new

32
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:09,630
revolutionary neurological processes.

33
00:01:09,631 --> 00:01:11,580
And part of the reason is this,

34
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,650
you have more neural connections in
your brain when you're first born,

35
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,950
then you do for the rest of your
life any other time in your life.

36
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:24,120
And as you learn when you're an infant
and as you learn say over the first two

37
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:24,840
years,

38
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,730
what happens is that there's a plentitude
of circuits and they die off leaving

39
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:31,560
only those circuits that have a function.

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,550
And you think about that,

41
00:01:32,551 --> 00:01:34,620
it's kind of a quasi Darwinian process.

42
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,000
And so what that means is that as you
mature and become fixed in your form,

43
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:39,241
you know,

44
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:40,830
to adopt your personality,

45
00:01:40,831 --> 00:01:40,991
what,

46
00:01:40,991 --> 00:01:42,270
whatever it becomes,

47
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,340
what's happening is that the excess
possibility in some sense is being

48
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,920
demolished by experience.

49
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:55,140
So the Tirana cull aspect of enculturation
is something that's real because it

50
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:56,010
makes you,

51
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,020
in large part what you are.

52
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,400
And you have to understand as well that
that's necessary because it's better to

53
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,880
be something in the final analysis.

54
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,190
It's better to be something
than to be nothing.

55
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:09,930
But you know,

56
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:14,080
we still have residual dreams
like those expressed by Peter Pan,

57
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:17,430
say who's the boy that never wants to
grow up because he doesn't want to attain

58
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,470
any final and fixed form.

59
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,830
And it's interesting
because in one respect,

60
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:24,360
as you progress through your life,

61
00:02:24,361 --> 00:02:25,290
you're climbing,

62
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,580
assuming things are going well,

63
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,860
you're climbing to ever new heights.

64
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:29,890
But on the other hand,

65
00:02:29,891 --> 00:02:30,480
the,

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,200
the direction that you're going
in constantly narrows as you age.

67
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:36,000
So there's a real trade off there.

68
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:36,091
And,

69
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:36,380
and,

70
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:40,470
and I think the existential angst that's
caused as a consequence of that trade

71
00:02:40,471 --> 00:02:42,060
off is often real.

72
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,230
And I also think that adolescents and
early adults feel this most intently,

73
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:50,520
which is part of the reason why they tend
to rebel against social structures in

74
00:02:50,521 --> 00:02:51,001
general.

75
00:02:51,001 --> 00:02:51,331
You know,

76
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:51,491
the,

77
00:02:51,491 --> 00:02:55,050
whether it's the military industrial
complex or the corporate world or

78
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:56,700
globalization or what have you,

79
00:02:56,701 --> 00:03:00,940
is that you have these large structures
that represent the tier radical aspect

80
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:01,860
of social being.

81
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:02,200
And,

82
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:07,200
and it's no wonder that the fact of
those structures in genders rebellion,

83
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
it should.

84
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,281
On the other hand,

85
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:12,370
it's also no wonder that structures
like that exist because if they didn't

86
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:12,761
exist,

87
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:16,070
then people would have no
way of interrelating there.

88
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,260
There are social being,

89
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:19,700
and we would revert back
to the sort of hogs,

90
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,160
Ian State of war,

91
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:24,040
where everybody's arms are
around everybody else's throat.

92
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:26,410
That doesn't mean the
payoff is always good.
