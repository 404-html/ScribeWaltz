1
00:00:07,150 --> 00:00:12,150
Idea of individual responsibility
through through 12 rules,

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,440
while we might say we might begin by
thinking about how that's related to the

3
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,770
idea of free speech.
It's like

4
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:27,340
you have to find your way in the world,
let's say with all of your

5
00:00:27,341 --> 00:00:30,670
peculiarities,
your idiosyncrasies and your differences

6
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,090
and the way you do that is by acting in
the world,

7
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,510
but the way you prepare to act is by
thinking and really what you're doing

8
00:00:39,761 --> 00:00:42,970
when you're thinking.
There's a philosopher named Alfred North

9
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,100
Whitehead who said something very
intelligent about thinking.

10
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,180
He said that the reason we think is so
that our thoughts can die instead of us.

11
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,210
Right?
And it's a Darwinian idea.

12
00:00:52,211 --> 00:00:57,211
So the way animals adapt to the world
across time is that animals produced

13
00:00:57,821 --> 00:01:01,240
variance very into offspring.
Many of them,

14
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,120
and most of them were unsuccessful and
die,

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,780
but a few of them are successful enough
in that time and place to reproduce.

16
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,030
And so the animal keeps living across
the millennia varying slightly as it

17
00:01:16,061 --> 00:01:18,580
does.
So to adapt to the transformations of

18
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,580
the environment.
Human beings do the same thing,

19
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,450
but we also have figured out how to
abstract that and so what we do when we

20
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:30,451
think is that we produce a fictional
world that's a simulation of the real

21
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:36,391
world and we populate that simulated
world with simulations of us and then we

22
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:40,960
let those simulations play out in the
simulated world and the ones that are

23
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:44,140
successful,
we embody and act out and the ones that

24
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:48,130
are unsuccessful.
We abandoned and let die and we do that.

25
00:01:48,131 --> 00:01:53,131
When we're thinking in dreams and we do
that when we think in stories and we

26
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:57,730
even do that when we think in words.
Although it's not as obvious when you

27
00:01:57,731 --> 00:02:00,760
argue internally,
which is what you do when you think you

28
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,780
have an Avatar that manifests itself as
one point of view and an Avatar that

29
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:09,781
manifests itself as another and you let
them engage in conflict and the one that

30
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:11,800
loses you let go off.

31
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:15,400
That's a sacrifice and if you're
discussing something with someone and

32
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:19,660
it's important that you both put your
viewpoints forward and you analyze the

33
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:23,500
consequences of the dispute and then you
walk away with any luck,

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,940
why is there then you were so that you
can embody a motive being that's more

35
00:02:27,941 --> 00:02:32,941
likely to be successful and you do that
in part in large part by exercising your

36
00:02:33,221 --> 00:02:35,860
freedom of speech and you might think,
well,

37
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:37,930
why?
Freedom of speech and freedom of

38
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:40,390
thought,
and the answer to that is don't be

39
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:45,391
thinking that you think because thinking
is very hard and most people can't think

40
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:50,290
at all and even if you can think you're
not very good at it.

41
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:53,500
I mean think about what you have to do
technically to think.

42
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,380
First of all,
you have to formulate the problem that's

43
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:58,480
hard enough and you have to formulate it
precisely.

44
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,760
Then have to generate multiple potential
solutions to the problem and then you

45
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:08,761
have to let those solutions argue
themselves into a hierarchy internally

46
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,090
and so you have to be able to tolerate
that stress,

47
00:03:13,091 --> 00:03:14,740
right?
You can't just be one thing if you're

48
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:16,990
going to think because thinking isn't
just saying that.

49
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,780
What I think is right,
that's not thinking at all.

50
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:23,380
Thinking is questioning whether or not
what you think is right is right and

51
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:27,160
that's really hard.
It's very demanding and so and you can

52
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:29,440
do that to some degree,
but you're not as good at it as you

53
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,150
think.
Even if you're a pretty good thinker.

54
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:36,390
Mostly the way you think is by talking
and you talk and mostly when you talk

55
00:03:37,241 --> 00:03:41,980
and think it's contentious as you know
if you've ever had an intimate

56
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:45,940
relationship with someone because an
intimate relationship,

57
00:03:45,941 --> 00:03:47,740
if it,
if it has any worth at all,

58
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,630
is a place where there's tremendous
contention but it's bounded within

59
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:56,860
something approximating mutual respect
and the willingness to continue to play

60
00:03:56,861 --> 00:04:01,010
the game across time and the reason that
an intimate relationship is contentious

61
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,090
because life is very,
very difficult and people are different

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,450
and we face extraordinarily complex
problems together.

63
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,400
Like how to make a living and how to.
How to operate properly in our careers

64
00:04:12,401 --> 00:04:15,190
and how to rank order the importance of
our careers and how to manage our

65
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:19,360
domestic economies and how to discipline
our kids and whether or not to have kids

66
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:24,361
and how to enter middle age and how to
grow old gracefully and how to live

67
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,390
productively and where to vacation and
all of these things which are

68
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:31,750
extraordinarily difficult problems and
the only way that we can solve them is

69
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:36,250
by butting heads to some degree and
communicating freely about what the

70
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:41,020
possibilities are and negotiating a
solution and that's thinking and in

71
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:44,560
order to do that thinking,
you have to be able to speak freely and

72
00:04:44,561 --> 00:04:47,950
you certainly have to be willing to
offend someone.

73
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,140
I mean,
of all the stupid questions I've ever

74
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:53,050
been asked by journalists,
the question,

75
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:57,850
what makes you think you have the right
to offend someone by what you say is by

76
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:02,851
far the most miraculously ignorant and I
say that because,

77
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,253
well,

78
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,640
no,
it just.

79
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,450
It just sets me back on my heels to some
degree because I think,

80
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,540
well,
what's your claim here?

81
00:05:15,541 --> 00:05:20,541
Your claim is.
Your first claim is we could

82
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:24,510
hypothetically discussed something
important without one of us getting

83
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:26,350
upset.
It's like,

84
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,330
that's not gonna happen.
If you ever discuss anything important

85
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:33,780
with anyone,
including just discussing it with

86
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:37,080
yourself,
not only are you going to get upset,

87
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,530
you're going to get so upset that you
probably won't even do it.

88
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,731
You know,
you think,

89
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:43,110
well,
I have a difficult problem.

90
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,360
What do you.
What's your first reaction?

91
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:47,430
Well,
I'm going to sit right here and think

92
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:48,420
about that.
It's like,

93
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:49,620
no,
that isn't your reaction.

94
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:53,640
Your reaction is to go like play a video
game or watch a youtube video or or

95
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:58,641
vacuum your bedroom or do the dishes or
whatever can do not to think about that.

96
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,290
That's what you're going to do.
So you know,

97
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,270
and then if you're going to have a
discussion with your wife or your

98
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,030
husband or your kids and it's about
something important.

99
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:12,770
It's like if you're a normal person,
your heart rate goes up and it's like

100
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,200
it's demanding and then you have to
think it through and then you're

101
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:18,380
probably wrong and you're going to
stumble over your words and God only

102
00:06:18,381 --> 00:06:20,870
knows if you're going to reach a
solution and you can't tell if it's

103
00:06:20,871 --> 00:06:25,190
going to mean the end of your damn
relationship and like the catastrophe

104
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:28,490
lurks everywhere when you're discussing
difficult issues and the rule is

105
00:06:28,491 --> 00:06:31,160
something like,
but you can't offend anyone.

106
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:32,480
It's like,
well then okay,

107
00:06:32,481 --> 00:06:33,830
fine.
Then you never get to talk about

108
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,680
anything that's important with anyone
ever including yourself.

109
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,320
So like that's supposed to be the rule.
Then you think,

110
00:06:39,321 --> 00:06:42,350
well even if it's not quite that bad,
it's like let's say,

111
00:06:42,351 --> 00:06:45,980
so here I'm addressing about 850 people,
something like that.

112
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,130
It's like,
what's the probability that I could talk

113
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:52,700
about anything that any of you would
ever want to listen to for more than

114
00:06:52,701 --> 00:06:54,540
about 15 seconds,
you know,

115
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,820
that would grip your interest without me
or offending at least one person in this

116
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:02,390
room with each sentence.
There's a thousand people in here,

117
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,750
you know,
and some people are unbelievably easy to

118
00:07:05,751 --> 00:07:06,980
offend.
There's that.

119
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,230
They're just looking for a reason to be
offended,

120
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,150
so,
so there's that problem.

121
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,610
But if we're going to deal with things
that are,

122
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,670
that are solid and contentious and why,
talk about things that we already all

123
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,440
agree on.
We've already solved those problems.

124
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,290
We can only really talk about things we
don't agree on.

125
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,780
It's the only thing worth talking about.
Well,

126
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,580
of course everyone's going to be
offended.

127
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,790
And so for a journalist to ask that,
it's like,

128
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,860
what the Hell's with you?
What?

129
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,930
What planet do you inhabit?
Don't you understand that your entire

130
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,990
discipline is predicated on not only
your right to offend someone,

131
00:07:44,991 --> 00:07:48,890
but the responsibility that you have to
offend people.

132
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,220
It's like that's it's

133
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,720
cool thinking isn't offensive act,
which is why tyrants hated,

134
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,880
right?
Because one of the rules and tyranny is

135
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:20,310
don't think why?
Because I already know all the answers

136
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:25,920
and you're supposed to accept my answers
as the tyrant and so there's no need for

137
00:08:25,921 --> 00:08:28,230
your thinking.
And you might be saying,

138
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:30,330
well,
my life isn't going as well as it could,

139
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,820
and the tyrant says,
well,

140
00:08:32,821 --> 00:08:36,480
you don't get to think that because in
my utopian tyranny,

141
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,660
everything's perfect.
And if you're suffering,

142
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,550
that means you're politically suspect
because you're suffering.

143
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:48,540
Your inability to recognize that the
utopia has already manifested itself.

144
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,210
Your unhappiness is actually a political
crime,

145
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,510
but if you just keep it to yourself,
well we'll let you keep your head,

146
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,900
but you have the the.
If you're driven to the extreme where

147
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:03,810
you have to express the fact that you're
unhappy,

148
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,090
perhaps that your child doesn't have
enough to eat,

149
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,360
then it's off to the Gulag with you and
all your family as well because there'll

150
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,890
be no thinking here and even if there
is,

151
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,540
they'll certainly be no talking.

152
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,470
Here's something that happened recently
in Venezuela,

153
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:25,070
Mrs. Worth Thinking about for all the
people who harbor collectivist Utopian

154
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,260
Dreams,
Venezuela,

155
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,170
the Venezuelan government about two
months ago,

156
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:35,220
this was reported in the New York Times,
which is not a newspaper.

157
00:09:35,221 --> 00:09:38,270
I would say that would be intrinsically
biased against Venezuela.

158
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:44,060
Said that it was now illegal to diagnose
the cause of a child's death in a

159
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:49,641
Venezuelan hospital as starvation
because the Venezuelans,

160
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,280
Venezuelan government's answer to the
problem of children starving was to make

161
00:09:55,980 --> 00:10:00,980
it illegal to notice it in hospitals.
And that's a tyranny,

162
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:03,660
right?
That's a place where thought is not

163
00:10:03,661 --> 00:10:05,760
allowed.
That's a place where free speech is not

164
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:10,020
allowed.
So it seems to me that that's not a good

165
00:10:10,021 --> 00:10:14,310
place to go to say the least.
And we've gone there many times in the

166
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:17,460
last one,
hundred and 50 years and we should

167
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:20,730
perhaps think very hard about whether or
not we ever want to go there again.
