1
00:00:03,050 --> 00:00:06,160
Two years ago or whatever it is,

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,733
maybe

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,430
you don't want you to face on.

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:13,980
And Great Clinical thinkers
of the 20th century,

5
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,050
you know,

6
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,670
some centers will be surprised is that
tried to take what I'm ready to is still

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:24,450
proudly useful.

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:24,680
You know,

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,680
I'm not taking credit and bad credit
for that red [inaudible] work of many,

10
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:32,320
many extraordinary awful.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,180
It's held meetings about,

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,210
they say I was having a rough time,

13
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:40,860
one thing or another and I started,

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,430
you know,

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:45,600
formulating a vision for my life and I'm
starting to try to tell it to them more

16
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,780
and take more responsibility
and things are way there.

17
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,940
And thank you.

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,080
And so we got that.

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,300
Do you ask people what
I want for my birthday?

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,030
Well,

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:55,940
this is curt now.

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:58,620
Our next like a dozen people.

23
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,510
And what paypal was the finger?

24
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:02,170
Very happy with the counter.

25
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:07,190
What I've been doing it the
device and how [inaudible]

26
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,173
feminism

27
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,170
[inaudible] or on slips

28
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,470
[inaudible] form because

29
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,050
I do the crowd sitting here.

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:02,060
We [inaudible].

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,433
So,

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,300
um,

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,300
and so here's the theory and but what,

34
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,180
that's not the boring,

35
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,060
but here's the point will be
visual that they're happy,

36
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,213
encouraged.

37
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,280
I know I'm,

38
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,800
you're going to call
home because I see it.

39
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:31,560
I'm Pena and ms argument,

40
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,270
the constant clinical workers

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,600
who are afraid of have a problem,

42
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,180
they're afraid to do be a in fair enough
[inaudible] but they're not nearly

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,890
enough of launching.

44
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:52,680
[inaudible] can feel better about change.

45
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:53,381
Jogging.

46
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:58,381
You feel way worse about [inaudible]

47
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,553
forgive

48
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,300
me the path

49
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,200
you would just discount this
and maybe your retirement,

50
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:14,843
your boss,

51
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,340
it's made me bitter and cynical and
resentful and cost are impressive and got

52
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:23,320
all of those where you go from there,

53
00:03:23,321 --> 00:03:24,040
addicted,

54
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:24,820
violent,

55
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,820
and then work.

56
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,140
So it's like what do you frame it?

57
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,230
How nature interview early frame.

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,180
That one,

59
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,530
she free fat.

60
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,350
And that's [inaudible] bones,

61
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:38,223
right?

62
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,890
You don't want to be lulled into thinking
that you've got an option in terms of

63
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,250
goal terror.

64
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,440
And so of we want to do is take your
terror please to the right place.

65
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,970
We say the fear of God was
the beginning of wisdom.

66
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:50,470
Right now,

67
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,420
I'm not making a
religious cease to matter.

68
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,380
I don't think I'm brave

69
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:58,923
face.

70
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:04,140
And so the loose start started talking
over in general for years goals because

71
00:04:05,051 --> 00:04:05,884
about her,

72
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,810
even when I put my foot on the
political now in Canada years ago,

73
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,550
each issue,

74
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,190
you know,

75
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,560
personally nervous,

76
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:15,640
I go to three anyway,

77
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,800
put asleep and I thought,

78
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,450
wow,

79
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,860
what's turned out in farming
in the city in that regard,

80
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,550
we think we'll want to take the risk

81
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:30,350
with the alternative is
to take out the risk,

82
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,810
which was to not say something.

83
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,621
It's like,

84
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:32,861
no,

85
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:35,710
I wasn't taking notes down
as a worsened his plan,

86
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,544
a huge,

87
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:37,923
massive,

88
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,990
no separatism,

89
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,330
Tiernan free [inaudible] becoming worse
because good people shop [inaudible]

90
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,780
well

91
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,993
okay,

92
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,670
we'll just refer to us just to get worse.

93
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:13,890
It's a real nabb [inaudible] early in
the knock on effect because you've never

94
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,574
been,

95
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,520
well I didn't want to recall

96
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:24,643
turnoff.

97
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,220
So that's just one group.

98
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:29,891
We say,

99
00:05:29,891 --> 00:05:31,120
well that's small,

100
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,180
like the outlaw,

101
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:33,620
which most social settings,

102
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,143
so

103
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,293
20 of

104
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,103
us.

105
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,060
I'm probably wrong because I'm assuming,

106
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,020
can you tell me

107
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,250
if you're in your apartment,

108
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,180
but at least to get you to say,

109
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,340
maybe we can offer a kit

110
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:49,410
[inaudible]

111
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,110
work as well,

112
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,010
where in the case if you think something,

113
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:05,910
the probability than most other
people also thinking very hot,

114
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:13,450
a spectacular jeans and just
absolutely original [inaudible].

115
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:14,620
You know,

116
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:19,300
it's hard to [inaudible] but anonymously,

117
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,810
so,

118
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,770
but other than that,

119
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,250
if you're a reasonable person face on,

120
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,570
everyone else is thinking too.

121
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,260
And just we'll say,

122
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,180
if you say,

123
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:31,870
well then maybe we'll say,

124
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,440
and you've been talking about convenience,

125
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:35,420
you know,

126
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:40,420
[inaudible] types of comedian because
comedians to that whole entire Taiwanese

127
00:07:40,601 --> 00:07:41,211
was thinking off,

128
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,044
say,

129
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,550
here's some of the whole thing.

130
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:44,630
And they're going to say,

131
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
can we say,

132
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:47,043
yeah,

133
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:53,540
the gesture a short term,

134
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,090
right?

135
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:57,260
Because he's the [inaudible] committee.

136
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,740
Here's what we're really about.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,590
And everyone,

138
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:03,330
certainly me through life like that,

139
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,780
we have to be careful.

140
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,950
You have to be weighed.

141
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:06,920
You know,

142
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:10,700
if you're a reasonable person for thinking
usable things that probably everyone

143
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:15,610
else has the suspicion that indicate soon
so then they don't have to do anything

144
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,300
in forced silence.

145
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,510
So in crushing story we'll do it

146
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,930
[inaudible] here

147
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,270
at least in part,

148
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,493
the

149
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,940
profits that are critical for

150
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,450
the [inaudible].

151
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,960
I know I can't say I'm in the gym.

152
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:29,360
You can't listen

153
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,160
to the client.

154
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,220
Most of the people that are

155
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:45,120
[inaudible] as well
[inaudible] that's the gym.

156
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:53,880
It's so much different
than the front in the car.

157
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,151
You know,

158
00:09:54,151 --> 00:09:56,510
we don't start through the door.

159
00:09:56,511 --> 00:10:00,050
I can't assume Google.

160
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:03,601
As soon,

161
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,240
as soon as we go on a
complete waste of space,

162
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,410
it's not battling with people,

163
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,410
which is one of

164
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,260
the downs.

165
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:19,260
If you allow something causing

166
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:27,870
increased the phone them and
still and and do that in a team.

167
00:10:28,741 --> 00:10:30,830
And so with my

168
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,990
[inaudible] [inaudible]

169
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,810
[inaudible] [inaudible]

170
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,590
[inaudible] [inaudible]

171
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:54,660
[inaudible] [inaudible] said,

172
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,800
look,

173
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,630
just set it up and I have a series of
images that you take that apart for

174
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,620
related stuff going on.

175
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:10,920
I didn't understand what the benefit can
you clarify that seems to contradict.

176
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:12,710
You said minutes ago,

177
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,250
that's not an assault.

178
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,680
Just our Turner's.

179
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,230
He said,

180
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,700
hey,

181
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,490
I'm seeing nodding like we're going to,

182
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,480
so here's what I think you said that

183
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,300
[inaudible] [inaudible]

184
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,570
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] to coach your

185
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,970
staff.

186
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:41,020
You know your agendas in your camper
boots in the way disrupt describing color.

187
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:47,070
It's a really good step to allow your
clause to there instead of manipulating

188
00:11:49,241 --> 00:11:50,530
the world and the rules,

189
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:51,550
rules,

190
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,080
rules,

191
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,913
rules set up.

192
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,261
No,

193
00:11:56,261 --> 00:12:01,020
I don't want her to succeed and
if you've never meditated or

194
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:06,860
if [inaudible] to how,

195
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,980
and I'm going to do what's necessary in
order to facilitate despite the fall.

196
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,360
Let's play that out and see what happens.

197
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,370
Then you listen to your staff and then
those things will come to you and I do to

198
00:12:21,131 --> 00:12:22,030
talk to you about that.

199
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,900
Rule check is the
percentage of each species.

200
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,670
It's about the importance of aim.

201
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:27,820
If you eat

202
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,881
the higher up,

203
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:31,780
you wait.

204
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,880
The more the world
receivable alliance and that,

205
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:39,550
this is the why that is.

206
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:44,470
That is the state of the most
sophisticated neurosciences
and the percentage.

207
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,940
That's how perceptions they Oregon.

208
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,990
The more we

209
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:53,110
stand on faith,

210
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,180
it's only going to be late.

211
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:58,760
He killed the last 50 years has
come to a better conclusion.

212
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,143
Conclusion.

213
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:06,270
What would you see the world and the way
you talk emotionally is the same time

214
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:12,880
you're going in fact Medicalese
to determining now that see,

215
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:14,663
you know,

216
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,600
you could maybe not be
practically at a counselor.

217
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,610
I'm not saying it's a panacea.

218
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,950
You know there's limits,

219
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:27,510
but fundamentally the world manifests
itself in accordance with [inaudible] and

220
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,960
not [inaudible].

221
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:34,290
If it means that if you're not
positioned properly in the world,

222
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,600
but the world was,

223
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,090
he would manage that.

224
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,970
We can tolerate.

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,190
If we bitter,

226
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:44,250
there's a high probability that you're
aiming Raul [inaudible] sectors hosted

227
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,153
perfect origin,

228
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,770
criticize the world.

229
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,540
It's a miraculous fig.

230
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:54,630
It's true about an sequence
teacher so that some,

231
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,710
because it couldn't be,

232
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:57,800
I really believe this.

233
00:13:57,801 --> 00:13:58,350
This is a,

234
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,670
this is optimism.

235
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,230
That's the counterpart to
the tracking [inaudible].

236
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:10,560
There's no better way to
[inaudible] that works for you,

237
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,150
works for your family,

238
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,350
for your community.

239
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,730
It works for everything.

240
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,720
It works.

241
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,340
It's actually true.

242
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:23,760
So that's [inaudible]
estrogen is actually the case.

243
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:29,910
[inaudible] are you worried
about potential for teaching?

244
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,020
Give us some worried about

245
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,500
[inaudible]

246
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:55,940
first of all,

247
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,833
I have,

248
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,250
I have three sisters first and I would
say a lot of them to be difficult.

249
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:08,900
And so that's given me
a certain to perceptive.

250
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,100
Um,

251
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:15,100
there isn't anything in fame that give
me more than our cows kill many important

252
00:15:18,411 --> 00:15:18,710
ways.

253
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:23,710
Like I have a very good [inaudible],

254
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,150
you know,

255
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,350
be someone else but

256
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:43,783
because

257
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,060
of the

258
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,890
[inaudible]

259
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:15,820
family and my community and friends and
so I'm not going to miss that because

260
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:18,630
that would be suited and John

261
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:28,590
[inaudible] at all.

262
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:34,930
So my family is very smart and the re
re re re watching may have blooper for

263
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:41,350
quite a long time and there's stupid,

264
00:16:41,351 --> 00:16:42,184
they get older,

265
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,160
you get the same thing.

266
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,220
It's super that we should be doing again.

267
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,193
Gail smart,

268
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,260

She this [inaudible] to Susan too
many times that made you go well.

270
00:16:57,351 --> 00:16:58,240
And so my thing,

271
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,330
I think I have 70 with maybe in a
[inaudible] oriented and so we'll see.

272
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,210
But so far so good.

273
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,870
[inaudible]

274
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:50,400
I like to watch certain shows

275
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,483
or

276
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,541
Canadian.

277
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:06,374
That's why

278
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:12,983
you

279
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:16,400
ever seen the trailer park boys.

280
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,241
Oh my God,

281
00:18:17,241 --> 00:18:18,074
Dude.

282
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,050
[inaudible]

283
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,270
talk about low brow.

284
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,973
Okay.

285
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,170
Oh,

286
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,830
so it was safe.

287
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,723
Oh

288
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,183
No,

289
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:30,950
it was the German war.

290
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:31,820
Um,

291
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,653
he,

292
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,860
I mean it was through
[inaudible] not good.

293
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,013
So

294
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,620
there and we're trying don't have to do,

295
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,860
that's my whole

296
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,733
life.

297
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:02,643
There's

298
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:04,613
work

299
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:08,860
on the goals,

300
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:10,211
man.

301
00:20:10,211 --> 00:20:11,300
Things are so much better.

302
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,710
For example,

303
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,660
I tell my

304
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,893
law,

305
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:26,570
which is what it was.

306
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,613
It's

307
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,693
like we hit,

308
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,620
that's a funny miracle.

309
00:20:56,621 --> 00:20:57,560
That wasn't the case.

310
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,433
It

311
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,060
was lagging behind them assisting cash.

312
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:07,260
Nama hardly enough
consequences of dissemination.

313
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,240
This tremendous Salvadorian community.

314
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:15,190
Suddenly technology putting a tremendous
amount of power in the hands of

315
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:15,941
individuals.

316
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,890
And so that looks real good.

317
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,430
There's more horse to the northern answer
and there wasn't a hundred years ago

318
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,050
you never even knew about now.

319
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:23,340
No.

320
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:26,380
One of the conferences are more
carbon monoxide is in the world.

321
00:21:26,381 --> 00:21:27,730
Won't get me for sending

322
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,620
you that will rectify department
home entirely new level.

323
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:36,790
We have enough food for everyone.

324
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:37,720
And then I won't see.

325
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,340
You mentioned it was,

326
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:39,700
you know,

327
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,420
there's,

328
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,253
we have some,

329
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,520
we have some Finnish disorder on the
relationship between the bowling,

330
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,590
but compared to start one,

331
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,790
that's a real problem.

332
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,624
And how,

333
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,000
you know,

334
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
he's waiting on fat people in the rural
Starbucks [inaudible] I think each other

335
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,100
than healthspring Martin systems work,

336
00:22:06,101 --> 00:22:10,540
we mentioned with the political systems
can been celebrating some of the jewel

337
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:15,590
and those [inaudible] biological jewel
scientific can feel old [inaudible] tale.
