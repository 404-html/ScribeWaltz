1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,850
Told you about some of the symbolic
associations that that gather around say

2
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,230
images of the unknown.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,110
You could also think of the
unknown has unexplored territory,

4
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:19,100
but it's a tricky kind of territory
because if the person beside you does

5
00:00:19,101 --> 00:00:21,020
something spectacularly weird,

6
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:25,610
you move from explored territory to
unexplored territory as soon as you don't

7
00:00:25,611 --> 00:00:26,870
understand what they're doing.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,900
So it's not exactly
spacial temper territory.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,460
It's more like it's more like
temporal spacial territory.

10
00:00:34,461 --> 00:00:38,720
It's time and space because the same
place can be a different place from one

11
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:39,740
moment to the next.

12
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,240
Not happens all the time when some event
that you don't expect occurs in the

13
00:00:44,241 --> 00:00:49,241
place that you are so and your
body is prepared to react,

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:53,870
it's instinctively prepared to react to
the emergence of chaotic circumstances.

15
00:00:53,871 --> 00:00:58,230
It basically does that by hyper
activating your preparation for action and

16
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,570
increasing your capacity to pay attention
and preparing you to do a very large

17
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:05,210
number of things at once because
you don't know what to do.

18
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,740
It's a high stress reaction,

19
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:08,000
but it's built into you.

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,450
And it's so interesting because what
that means that is part of what's built

21
00:01:11,451 --> 00:01:14,450
into people is the ability to deal
with what they don't understand.

22
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,710
This is a real paradox,

23
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:15,951
right?

24
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:18,410
Because how can you deal with
what you don't understand?

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:19,940
You don't understand it.

26
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:20,840
So,

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,740
but the answer is,

28
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:22,400
well,

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,400
you ramp up your ability to react in a
very large number of ways and you do that

30
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:30,620
by increasing your general level
of arousal and your attention.

31
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:31,813
And it's a good,

32
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,750
that also increases the probability
that you're going to be attentive to new

33
00:01:35,751 --> 00:01:39,440
information and pull it in and utilize
it so that you can decide how to act

34
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:40,274
rapidly.

35
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:42,650
So other things happen.

36
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,670
For example,

37
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:44,331
you know,

38
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:48,140
some of you may have been in car accidents
or events like that where you knew

39
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,970
for a few seconds that the event was
going to occur and time slowed down.

40
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,260
It's quite a common,

41
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:54,860
uh,

42
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,360
commonly reported phenomena.

43
00:01:56,361 --> 00:01:58,460
I've experienced it a
number of times actually.

44
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,181
And,

45
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:00,014
uh,

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,600
it was actually experimentally tested.

47
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,291
They,

48
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,100
uh,

49
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,030
threw people off Bungee cord apparatuses,

50
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:08,301
you know,

51
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,530
so apparatuses,

52
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,150
so they were plummeting down,

53
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:11,631
you know,

54
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,680
in a quite frightening manner.

55
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:16,580
And had them look at digital timers that
were flashing information while they

56
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:17,211
were falling.

57
00:02:17,211 --> 00:02:20,630
And it turned out that the people who
are falling could process the digital

58
00:02:20,631 --> 00:02:24,650
information faster than people who
are just standing there under normal

59
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:25,484
circumstances.

60
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:28,010
How they got that passed an
ethics committee is beyond me.

61
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:28,550
But,

62
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,420
but it's a brilliant,

63
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:31,100
it really is a brilliant experiment.
