1
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:13,983
Mistake.

2
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:25,911
No,

3
00:00:25,911 --> 00:00:30,590
this is one of the reasons that I did I
take the biblical elections I did last

4
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,610
year were so helpful for me.

5
00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:36,611
And I think one of the things that's
quite interesting about those stories,

6
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:38,410
even having stories in particular,

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,550
those bloody people,

8
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:42,560
they just make mistakes all the time.

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,120
Absolutely.

10
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:45,501
So Abraham,

11
00:00:45,501 --> 00:00:46,334
for example,

12
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:46,940
no,

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:48,110
he was chosen by God.

14
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,430
I politically like all the people there
and I mean he just pick one absolutely

15
00:00:55,161 --> 00:00:57,050
catastrophic mistake after another.

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:02,680
And so that's life man making
in regretting huge mistakes.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:07,190
Now that doesn't mean that you should
just go on and drop again the mistakes.

18
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:12,680
So you have to take responsibility for
the people that I watched in my life

19
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:18,290
lived probably that say they
learned from the mistakes,

20
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,920
but they didn't beat themselves
to death because of the,

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:22,731
you know,

22
00:01:22,731 --> 00:01:23,181
when you think,

23
00:01:23,181 --> 00:01:24,014
well,

24
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,021
so this says,

25
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:27,590
well this was a regretted it to validate.

26
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:27,921
It's like,

27
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,370
well we don't take adult term is
out in the public square and stone.

28
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,900
And so you probably shouldn't
do that to yourself.

29
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,000
You know,

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,930
if you regret it,

31
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,420
well then what you have to do is if you
have to repent and you have to atone.

32
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:43,770
Okay.

33
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,470
And so what's reprint unrepentant,

34
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:45,720
Nate?

35
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,531
It meets well,

36
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:51,531
it means you have to go over what you
did and you have to figure out now that

37
00:01:51,721 --> 00:01:52,710
you know it was a mistake,

38
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:54,990
who after figuring out why
you were Sadam clueless,

39
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:58,560
it's a damn stupid and
exactly what we did wrong.

40
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:00,180
Like with each the decision point,

41
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,830
like you know when you first met the
person that you have the affair with,

42
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:09,390
you probably flirted with him
a little bit more than that.

43
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,450
Then you probably flirted with them to
a degree that you regarded as risky and

44
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,593
access,

45
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,660
but you did it anyways.

46
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,231
Snow.

47
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:19,951
You have to figure out,

48
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:20,784
well,

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
why in the world did I
think that was a good idea?

50
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:24,840
Then you have to know exactly.

51
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,210
So if you're,

52
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,790
if you're walking down a path and you'd
get lost and you wander off the path and

53
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:32,820
you get lost,

54
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,240
you have to figure out how it is
that you wandered off the path.

55
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:41,750
Because the purpose of of repaired take
let's say is so good when you're back on

56
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:42,930
the path.

57
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,441
First of all,

58
00:02:43,441 --> 00:02:44,520
you can find your way back.

59
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:48,330
That would be the first purpose and the
second is so you don't wonder off again.

60
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,920
And if you wondered off once that your
pro for wandering off in that matter and

61
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:56,280
so then you'd have to figure out why
your program to wandering off for that

62
00:02:56,281 --> 00:03:00,670
matter right down into the most painful
level of detail and then you have to

63
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:04,630
figure out how not to do it again and
then as soon as you figure out how not to

64
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:06,010
do it again,

65
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,490
then you should start beating yourself up.

66
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,511
You know,

67
00:03:10,511 --> 00:03:12,340
because you've learned your lesson.

68
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,070
That's sort of the principle.

69
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:19,860
I tried out bloods in
principles of discipline for
children in chapter five what

70
00:03:19,861 --> 00:03:20,890
is the best principles?

71
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,891
Is you still more forced than this
necessarily minimal necessary for us,

72
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:27,564
it's a great,

73
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:32,470
it's a great rule of thumb and you use
that on yourself when you make mistakes,

74
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,890
you know and make you so
you have to figure out thing
when you get wrong by your

75
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:39,700
own criteria.

76
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,350
When you said you did something wrong,

77
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,550
you said you regretted it.

78
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:42,911
Okay,

79
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:45,610
you did something wrong because
otherwise you would regret it.

80
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,260
Or Nesbitt,

81
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,810
you're just regretting the fact that
fucked up your life and you actually,

82
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,680
you know what that's,

83
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,330
that's feeling sorry for yourself.

84
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,350
That's not regretting.

85
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:53,590
It's,

86
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,170
you're going to have to sort those
things out because you don't get to feel

87
00:03:56,171 --> 00:03:57,130
sorry for yourself.

88
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,110
You just get to regret it.

89
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,290
And if you've read regretted
me to did something wrong,

90
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,570
and then you have to
out what you did wrong.

91
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,560
Exactly right down to the detailed
levels and what was wrong with your

92
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:11,080
perception and your beliefs
that led you in that direction.

93
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:15,490
Everyone would have to do to put that
right and then you have to put it right

94
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,330
and then maybe you have to go around and
make it manage to over people that you

95
00:04:19,331 --> 00:04:20,164
heard.

96
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,150
And then you have to be that.

97
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:24,790
And then perhaps you'll find
yourself back on the path.

98
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,360
And then you have to stay
on the path as best you can.

99
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:33,260
And if that's the case in some sense,

100
00:04:33,261 --> 00:04:37,330
because if we all had to pay
the ultimate price for our sins,

101
00:04:37,331 --> 00:04:40,200
every single one of us
would be [inaudible].

102
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,920
So we are just as part of why the
concept of original sin and so useful and

103
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,630
everyone feels it because
everyone's guilty.

104
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,810
Never one's ashamed of themselves.

105
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,420
So we have this inbuilt sense of something
going wrong and if we can name it

106
00:04:58,640 --> 00:04:59,590
haunts us.

107
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,200
And that's why the idea of
original sin is so useful,

108
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:05,490
even though it has perhaps some
conceptual problems associated with it.

109
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,960
And perhaps it's not all good.

110
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:12,190
But in this particular situation,

111
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
you know you're a bad person
but soon as everyone else.

112
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,230
So it doesn't mark you out
as a particularly horrible.

113
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,840
That doesn't mean the
horribleness isn't real,

114
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:27,730
but it's not just you.

115
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:31,870
And then what you do about it
is you're trying to be better.

116
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,350
And that's what you do about what's
wrong with you to begin with.

117
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,400
Every,

118
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,390
every one of us,

119
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,880
we've all got things to learn,

120
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:40,181
man.

121
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,050
And plenty of them.

122
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:42,410
The world is what it could be in.

123
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,690
That's our fault.

124
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,030
And so we've got lots
to learn and so to you,

125
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:50,800
and you try and learn and you
treat yourself with affirm enough,

126
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:55,510
had something you learn and not a harsh
enough handsome that you've died while

127
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:56,344
you're learning.

128
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,423
That's

129
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,180
[inaudible] zero.

130
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,680
That's the end of the night.

131
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:15,490
[inaudible].
