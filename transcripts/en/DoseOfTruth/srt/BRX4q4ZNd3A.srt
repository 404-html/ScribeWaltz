1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,810
I think part of the problem
with the classical media,

2
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:10,590
let's say,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,430
trying to make a transition to the
digital age is that they have no idea what

4
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:15,630
the digital media is.

5
00:00:15,631 --> 00:00:16,170
Like.

6
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:18,090
I was watching an MSNBC,

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,450
a clip the other day about this robot.

8
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,710
I think her name is Sophia,

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,360
who,

10
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:23,730
who,

11
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,350
who has a fairly advanced degree
of artificial intelligence
and who can manifest

12
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,630
pretty realistic human facial emotions.

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:31,531
And,

14
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:32,364
uh,

15
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,430
it was a four minute clip and add a
32nd ad at the beginning of it and you

16
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,810
couldn't skip the ad.

17
00:00:36,811 --> 00:00:40,320
And I thought there's a real
arrogance on the part of the MBA,

18
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,760
ms NBC people to put that on youtube
because anybody who's familiar with the

19
00:00:44,761 --> 00:00:45,594
youtube,

20
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,111
let's say,

21
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:50,550
culture knows that what you get to put
a ten second ad on and then you get to

22
00:00:50,551 --> 00:00:52,530
skip it after five seconds if you want.

23
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:57,390
Like you can't ask people to pay 30
seconds of attention for four minutes of

24
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:57,900
content.

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,280
It violates the norms.

26
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,650
And so it had only had about 12,000 views.

27
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,910
And that's a really interesting example
of Marshall Mcluhan's idea that the

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,380
medium is the message,

29
00:01:07,381 --> 00:01:07,591
right?

30
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:09,810
As you build a new
technological infrastructure.

31
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:13,890
And it's sort of like the old thing
because youtube is sort of like a TV

32
00:01:13,891 --> 00:01:14,724
network,

33
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,130
but it's also not like
a TV network at all,

34
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:18,330
partly for example,

35
00:01:18,331 --> 00:01:19,890
because when you put something on Youtube,

36
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,724
it's permanent.

37
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,430
And that's way different
than broadcast TV.

38
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,540
Like it's raw,

39
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:27,540
it's seriously revolutionarily different.

40
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:28,883
And so,

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,990
and it's also the case too,

42
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:35,490
that this is a strange thing and I don't
think the classic media understands

43
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:35,941
this either,

44
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,610
is that youtube people don't
like high production values.

45
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,151
In fact,

46
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:40,470
they're very cynical about them.

47
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,740
And I think that's because they've come
to identify advanced editing and Glitz

48
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,980
as markers that the information
is actually being manipulated,

49
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,980
which of course it is
now for better or worse.

50
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,380
I mean editing doesn't
have to be manipulating,

51
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:56,670
but it certainly can be.

52
00:01:57,090 --> 00:01:57,923
And so,

53
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,771
and besides that,

54
00:01:58,771 --> 00:02:02,730
a lot of the more tech savvy people that
watch youtube can duplicate those sort

55
00:02:02,731 --> 00:02:05,100
of special effects in their
own home in half an hour.

56
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:06,780
So they're not there.

57
00:02:06,781 --> 00:02:11,400
They're no longer markers of the kind
of competence and technological prowess

58
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:15,030
that would signal the sort of
competence that you could trust.

59
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,320
So,

60
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:21,320
so what youtube viewers seem to like is
basically ordinary people more or less

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,820
trying to have an intelligent
conversation about something confusing and

62
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:31,821
important and the attention span that
people are willing to devote to that is

63
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:36,300
actually quite remarkable for for a medium
that was nothing but cute cat videos

64
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,440
say five years ago.

65
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,520
The fact that like a lot of my lectures
and like Joe Rogan's podcast like three

66
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:42,480
hours long,

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,770
it's like what the hell?

68
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:47,490
People weren't supposed to have that
capacity to pay attention in this era of

69
00:02:47,491 --> 00:02:49,290
fragmented attention.

70
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:49,801
You know,

71
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:50,634
in Rogan,

72
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:52,290
I don't know if you know this or not,

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,700
he has 120 million downloads a month now.

74
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,340
So that's 1.5 billion a year.

75
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
And so the last time I saw him,

76
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:03,760
and that was with Brett who just spoke,

77
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,893
um,

78
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:05,400
I,

79
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,560
I asked him what it was like to be the
most powerful interview or the world has

80
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:10,810
ever seen because I think he probably is,

81
00:03:10,811 --> 00:03:12,280
if you think about it and sheer numbers.

82
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:12,491
I mean,

83
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,510
maybe Walter Cronkite back in the
60s had some comparable influence,

84
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:17,530
but he said,

85
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,700
I just don't think about it.

86
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,901
And we're like,

87
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:20,080
what,

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,910
what the hell is he
supposed to think about it?

89
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,430
Because no one knows
what to think about that.

90
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,360
And so he just has the conversations
and posts them and way he goes,

91
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,740
but he has no idea what role
he's currently playing in
society and we don't have

92
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:36,550
proper metrics for measuring it
and we don't understand it at all.

93
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,953
So anyways,

94
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,420
I did these big idea lectures with,

95
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,340
with Whoa deck and,

96
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,520
and uh,

97
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,660
they were ranked on,

98
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,410
on,

99
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,710
uh,

100
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,540
the Dvo channel and the five lectures or
six lectures I did all ended up in the

101
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,201
top 20,

102
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:51,670
which really surprised me.

103
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:55,360
But it was an indication that there was
something about what I was talking about

104
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,070
that for which there was a market.

105
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,900
And now there's,

106
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,010
there's some reasons for that.

107
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:00,401
I think,

108
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:00,980
you know,

109
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:01,510
when I.
