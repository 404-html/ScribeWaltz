1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,740
So I'm going to briefly review some of
what I told you last time and then I'm

2
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:13,730
going to walk through,

3
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:14,751
as I mentioned,

4
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:19,751
I'm going to walk through the Disney Film
Pinocchio and which I presume most of

5
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:20,834
you have seen.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,400
How many have you seen it?

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,081
Yeah.

8
00:00:24,081 --> 00:00:24,740
Okay.

9
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,190
That's,

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,410
that's so as I think I mentioned,

11
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,760
that's something in and of itself,

12
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:29,030
right?

13
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:29,301
I mean,

14
00:00:29,301 --> 00:00:33,200
the fact that you've all seen it means
that it's an production of cultural

15
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:36,200
significance and because
it's such a strange artifact,

16
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:37,520
that's one way of looking at it.

17
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:41,990
It might be worth trying to take
it apart to understand why it is,

18
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,741
for example,

19
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:44,180
that you even understand it.

20
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:50,140
And so I offered you the proposition
last week that we view the world

21
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:52,880
essentially through a narrative lens.

22
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,690
And I believe that we view the world
through a narrative lens because of the

23
00:00:56,691 --> 00:01:01,160
fundamental problem that we have to solve
as living creatures is how we should

24
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:02,180
act in the world.

25
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:07,880
And that means how we should
act to maintain ourselves,

26
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:13,040
but also how we need to act
in relationship to other
people and in relationship

27
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:14,120
to the broader world.

28
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,210
In order to maintain
ourselves across time.

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:19,580
So that's a complicated problem,

30
00:01:19,581 --> 00:01:19,821
right?

31
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,560
It's not just how you survive,

32
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,860
it's how you survive now and next week
and next month and next year and 50 years

33
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:28,580
from now and maybe your,

34
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,330
your,

35
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:29,810
uh,

36
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,100
your descendants as well if the culture
is going to stabilize and then not only

37
00:01:34,101 --> 00:01:37,820
you across all those timeframes but
you and everyone else across all those

38
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:40,640
timeframes to viciously difficult problem.

39
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:46,450
And so I would say that we have
evolved mechanisms to solve that.

40
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,210
Um,

41
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:50,420
I think that's self evident in
some sense because for example,

42
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:55,340
one of the mechanisms that animals have
evolved to deal with the problem of

43
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:56,570
social being,

44
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,150
even if they're not
particularly social animals,

45
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,950
is the dominance hierarchy.

46
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,341
Right?

47
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:04,010
Or You could call it a
hierarchy of authority or power.

48
00:02:04,011 --> 00:02:08,090
Because I think considering
human structures,

49
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:13,091
social structures as mirror power
structures is a terrible mistake.

50
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,950
It's a terrible oversimplification

51
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,220
because power is by no means the
only like force is what I mean.

52
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:27,230
Force is not a stable way of solving the
problem of how to live together across

53
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:28,424
time.

54
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:33,380
The question is what is the stable way
of solving how to live together across

55
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:33,711
time?

56
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:37,640
And that really is the question and it's
part of the question that I'm trying to

57
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:42,140
answer partly because
it's a perennial problem,

58
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:42,500
right?

59
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:42,830
We,

60
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:47,830
we faced the problem of how to organize
ourselves in small social units without

61
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:49,010
undue conflict.

62
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:53,000
And then we faced the larger problem
of how to organize ourselves into large

63
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,610
social units without undue conflict.

64
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:59,450
And that conflict can be
absolutely devastating and,

65
00:02:59,480 --> 00:02:59,810
and,

66
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,170
and frequently is so.

67
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,510
So then I would also say that the
first way of solving this problem isn't

68
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:08,350
conscious.

69
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,700
You say not at all.

70
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,290
And you know,

71
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,530
you may know and you may
not know that there are,

72
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,350
there are different forms of memory,

73
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,310
right?

74
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,320
Really technically
different forms of memory.

75
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:21,250
So for example,

76
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:23,980
there's short term working memory,

77
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:28,840
which is the memory that you use to hold
things like telephone numbers in your

78
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:29,890
act of imagination.

79
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:31,300
It decays very rapidly.

80
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,550
It's only about four to seven bits,

81
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,593
which is why,

82
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:35,201
well,

83
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:40,000
it's white phone numbers or
were at least seven digits long.

84
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,660
You know,

85
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:44,080
you can kind of manage that as a loop.

86
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,040
That,

87
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,990
and then there's um,

88
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,550
episodic memory and that has two elements.

89
00:03:51,551 --> 00:03:55,690
One is semantic and the
other is a episodic.

90
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,730
It's a help.

91
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:57,940
What's the name of that?

92
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,590
Someone said something?

93
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:04,751
Yes.

94
00:04:04,751 --> 00:04:06,610
Well there's procedural
memory and then there's,

95
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,840
there's another,

96
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,910
the kind of memory that you use to
represent your experiences to yourself.

97
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:17,911
So let's say it's image Laden and the
other one is semantic and semantic is your

98
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:19,030
memory for facts.

99
00:04:19,031 --> 00:04:20,470
And those are quite different.

100
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:21,430
So for example,

101
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,230
procedural memory,

102
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,390
that's how you ride a bike.

103
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,710
That's how you play the piano.

104
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,330
That's how you play jazz music.

105
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:29,440
If you're in a combo,

106
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:30,483
it's,

107
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,630
it's the memory.

108
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,360
It's,

109
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:32,640
it's,

110
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,560
it's a funny kind of memory cause
it's actually built right into you.

111
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:35,891
You know,

112
00:04:35,891 --> 00:04:40,750
I mean so as so as the kind of memory
that used to represent your life,

113
00:04:40,751 --> 00:04:42,760
but it's much more
malleable in some sense.

114
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:47,440
So what that means is
that in your procedures,

115
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,080
there is information that you don't
know about pattern information that you

116
00:04:53,081 --> 00:04:53,914
don't know about.

117
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,390
Part of that is how to act.

118
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:55,961
You know,

119
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:58,540
like when you walk into
a social gathering,

120
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,210
you don't really think through
how you're going to act.

121
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,410
You,

122
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,920
you know how to act and if someone
asked you exactly what it is that you're

123
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,100
doing and why you could
formulate a story about it,

124
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,140
but the probability that that it's the
existence of that story that enabled you

125
00:05:14,141 --> 00:05:18,250
to act that way as zero because you
have to react way faster than that.

126
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:18,761
And so,

127
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:18,971
you know,

128
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:23,470
you have social knowledge built into
your nervous system because you've

129
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,680
practiced being a social being
for a very long period of time.

130
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:32,250
And of course then that social being
has been shaped for forever really.

131
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,120
And it's the right way
of thinking about it.

132
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:34,750
You know,

133
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:39,750
we know that animals organize themselves
into hierarchies and we'll say of

134
00:05:39,971 --> 00:05:41,170
dominance because it's more,

135
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,240
more true the farther back you go in time,

136
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,910
at least since the time
of the crustaceans.

137
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,271
You know,

138
00:05:46,271 --> 00:05:50,350
when we split from our common
ancestor 300 million years ago.

139
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:50,950
And so,

140
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,680
and it's true for social
animals and non social animals.

141
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:58,681
So even animals that don't live together
in groups have to organize themselves

142
00:05:58,851 --> 00:06:01,620
into a hierarchy in
the space they inhabit.

143
00:06:01,621 --> 00:06:03,170
Songbirds are a good example.

144
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,240
And they have dominance
disputes all the time.

145
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,350
Partly that's,

146
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,800
you can hear them having their little
dominance disputes in the spring when

147
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:13,280
they're singing because basically what
they're singing is I'm pretty damn

148
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:14,810
healthy and I'm ready to go.

149
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:16,310
And if you're another bird like me,

150
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:17,960
you better steer clear this tree.

151
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:18,990
And,

152
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:19,823
and the,

153
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:21,580
the dominant song birds,

154
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:22,940
you know,

155
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,710
they don't live together crozer social,

156
00:06:24,711 --> 00:06:25,880
but most songbirds aren't.

157
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:31,280
The dominant songbirds get the best
nest and the best nest is the one that

158
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,700
doesn't get rained on isn't,

159
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:37,730
it's not too windy and it's close
to food sources and you know,

160
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:41,450
and so then they have the healthiest
chicks and they attract the best mates.

161
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:44,540
And like it's really important where
you're positioned in the hierarchy,

162
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:47,930
even if you're not like
a flock or herd creature.

163
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,610
Now we're more like herd creatures.

164
00:06:49,611 --> 00:06:50,600
So it's even more,

165
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,580
it's even,

166
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,030
it's even more relevant to us,

167
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:58,031
but there's just no escaping
a hierarchical arrangement
in social being that is

168
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:00,530
social being.

169
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,580
And,

170
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,180
and,

171
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,170
and it's evolutionarily
ancient beyond conception.

172
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:09,170
So 300 million years
ago there weren't trees,

173
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:09,651
you know,

174
00:07:09,651 --> 00:07:09,921
I mean,

175
00:07:09,921 --> 00:07:13,010
so the dominance hierarchy
is older than trees.

176
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:15,140
So that's really something to think about.

177
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:15,771
And then you know,

178
00:07:15,771 --> 00:07:20,570
when you're thinking about the reality
that shaped us say from an evolutionary

179
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,231
perspective,

180
00:07:21,231 --> 00:07:23,000
but also from a cultural perspective,

181
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:28,160
what you have to understand is that the
things that have shaped us most are the

182
00:07:28,161 --> 00:07:30,320
things that have been around the longest.

183
00:07:30,321 --> 00:07:35,180
And so you could say those are the most
real things and you can't even see some

184
00:07:35,181 --> 00:07:35,450
of them.

185
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,130
Like it's not like you can come in here.

186
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,690
Well it's not exactly true.

187
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,290
You can't come in here and see the
multiple dominance hierarchies that are at

188
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:42,770
work.

189
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,700
You can in a way,

190
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:48,620
because the chairs are set up to face
this way and I'm facing that way.

191
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,730
That gives you some clues about the
social order here and you take the cues

192
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:53,331
instantly,

193
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:53,780
right?

194
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,613
You come down,

195
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,000
you sit in the chairs,

196
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,290
you organize yourselves according to
mutual expectation and that's part of your

197
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:04,130
procedural knowledge about how
to behave as a social creature.

198
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,890
Now that knowledge is really,

199
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:07,551
really deep.

200
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:12,050
And a lot of it's coded in your behavior
now and another people's behavior as

201
00:08:12,051 --> 00:08:12,740
well.

202
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,101
And that's,

203
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:13,401
you know,

204
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:13,910
that's,

205
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:16,340
that's the expectations
you have of other people,

206
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:17,270
end of yourself.

207
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,590
And a lot of those are implicit,

208
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,250
right?

209
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,020
So when we're interacting,

210
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:21,321
there's,

211
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:21,820
there's a,

212
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,490
there's a very large number of
things that you just don't get to do.

213
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,110
And you know that too,

214
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,340
and you won't do them.

215
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:31,880
And that way we can act as
if we understand each other,

216
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,260
even though we don't,

217
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:35,090
because you're really complicated.

218
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,990
And I'm really complicated and there's
lots of situations where we might really

219
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:39,920
be in conflict,

220
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:43,850
but because we share a map of the culture,

221
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,320
the cultural expectations,

222
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,460
it makes part of our,

223
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,470
it's built right into our perception.

224
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,560
You will act out that set of expectations.

225
00:08:51,561 --> 00:08:52,640
And so will I,

226
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,430
and if neither of us can do that,

227
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,750
even if one of us can't,

228
00:08:56,751 --> 00:08:57,560
we're going to stay.

229
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,520
We're either going to immediately devolve
into conflict or we're going to avoid

230
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,720
each other like the plague.

231
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,850
And that's exactly the right thing to do.
