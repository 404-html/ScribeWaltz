1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,150
We don't from a statistical
perspective that if you're intelligent.

2
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:12,320
So if you have a high Iq,

3
00:00:12,321 --> 00:00:14,030
which just some degrees matter of chance,

4
00:00:14,031 --> 00:00:14,864
by the way,

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,853
um,

6
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:20,120
unless you think you had some choice in
picking your parents or if their entire

7
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:21,260
evolutionary history.

8
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:22,341
So if you're,

9
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:24,410
if you have a high Iq
and your conscientious,

10
00:00:24,411 --> 00:00:25,460
which is another trait,

11
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,480
then you're more likely to be
financials financially successful,

12
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,250
say by the time you in middle age.

13
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,340
And so that looks like a temperamental,

14
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:39,130
too temperamental traits whose presence
enables you to beat randomness over

15
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:39,964
time.

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,410
But you could object to that and say,

17
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:42,621
well,

18
00:00:42,621 --> 00:00:46,190
that happens to be true for this
society at this point in time.

19
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,430
And that's probably true because I think
imagine conscientious people store more

20
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:52,424
value,

21
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:56,600
they hoard more things well in a different
society that would just make you a

22
00:00:56,601 --> 00:00:57,560
target for murder.

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,990
Okay.

24
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,711
So those,

25
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:01,990
those traits work very well
in this society at that,

26
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:02,531
this time.

27
00:01:02,531 --> 00:01:06,580
But you could also argue that that's
also a matter of chance because there

28
00:01:06,581 --> 00:01:11,581
wouldn't be unconscientious people if at
some point in the past unconscientious

29
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:13,690
snus hadn't aided their survival.

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,570
Yeah.

31
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:20,310
So what constitutes beating a system
depends on the parameters that you put

32
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:23,820
around the system and you know that
you can think the same thing about,

33
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:24,481
well,

34
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:26,220
look at how successful he is.

35
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,293
Okay.

36
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,500
You mean financially?

37
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,371
All right,

38
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,090
so then,

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:30,331
well,

40
00:01:30,331 --> 00:01:31,200
how's his health?

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,490
How was his marriage?

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:33,090
However,

43
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,770
his relationships with his children,

44
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,750
what price did he pay for his wealth?

45
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,471
You know,

46
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,304
like as you,

47
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,520
as you add dimensions of the valuation,

48
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,540
whether that particular person won
or lost might not be so self evident.
