1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,630
Going to read something from [inaudible],

2
00:00:07,631 --> 00:00:09,190
which is one of the
readings that you have,

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,460
I should like even now to stress the
fact that the psychopathology of the

4
00:00:12,461 --> 00:00:14,410
shamanic vocation is not profane.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,080
It does not belong to
ordinary symptomatology.

6
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:20,080
So what he's saying is that
it's not psychopathological,

7
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:22,270
it's part of normative
personalities development.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,290
It has an initiatory structure in
significance and signification.

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,161
In short,

10
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:29,650
it reproduces a traditional
mystical pattern.

11
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,910
The total crisis of the future
Sharman sometimes leading to complete

12
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:38,320
disintegration of the personality and to
madness can be evaluated not only as an

13
00:00:38,321 --> 00:00:39,730
initiatory death,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
but also as a symbolic return to the pre
cosmotronic chaos to the amorphous and

15
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:48,700
indescribable state that
precedes any cosmogony cause.

16
00:00:48,701 --> 00:00:52,840
Margariney is the account of
the initial creation of being.

17
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:54,760
So in the Judeo Christian tradition,

18
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:55,331
for example,

19
00:00:55,331 --> 00:00:58,930
that would be the emergence of order
out of the initial state of chaos.

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,510
That's,

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:01,270
that's produced by God's word.

22
00:01:01,271 --> 00:01:01,850
So,

23
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,180
and that's another
symbolic representation.

24
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:05,140
There's chaos,

25
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,540
there's the active word and there's order.

26
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:10,270
And those are the three
initial elements of being.

27
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,860
And so the Shaman in some senses reducing
himself as a consequence of exposure

28
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:19,420
to something radical to the initial
components of his being and then being

29
00:01:19,421 --> 00:01:20,770
reconstructed out of that.

30
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:22,510
And that happens to you all the time.

31
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:27,100
In some sense when you encounter an
obstacle that really sets you back because

32
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,060
you know you've ordered the world and
then what you find out is the ordering of

33
00:01:31,061 --> 00:01:35,620
the world is incorrect and before you
can reorder it has to become chaotic.

34
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,060
It does become chaotic.

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,680
That's what sets you back.

36
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:42,820
And then out of that chaos you have
to bring out a new order if you can,

37
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:43,601
you know.

38
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:44,470
So for example,

39
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:46,240
you get betrayed by someone that you love.

40
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,571
It's like,

41
00:01:46,571 --> 00:01:47,260
okay,

42
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,560
it's time to update your
world model now can you?

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,970
Well maybe not,

44
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:52,751
you know,

45
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:54,760
because if you really update it,

46
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:55,660
you have to come.

47
00:01:56,110 --> 00:01:59,710
You have to come to terms with
the fact that that individual,

48
00:01:59,711 --> 00:02:01,090
which would also include you,

49
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,600
is capable of radically immoral act
because betrayal is a radically immoral,

50
00:02:07,521 --> 00:02:08,111
moral locked,

51
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:08,351
right?

52
00:02:08,351 --> 00:02:10,840
If there's any thing
that's actually a moral,

53
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,230
it's people telling you one thing and
then doing a whole bunch of other things

54
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:15,160
behind your back.

55
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,260
And then that brings up a question,

56
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:17,890
which is,

57
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,011
well,

58
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:19,690
how the hell can people be like that?

59
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,790
Especially because I'm also a person.

60
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:25,480
And then also how can I be so naive
and moronic that that can happen to me?

61
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:26,561
So,

62
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,180
and those are not trivial questions.

63
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:28,780
You know,

64
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,501
if you can't,

65
00:02:29,501 --> 00:02:31,780
if you don't have an
answer to them at hand,

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,110
what it means is that there's half
the world you haven't mapped out,

67
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:36,460
which would be the negative half.

68
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,170
And you may have to revisit and revise
and destroy virtually all of your

69
00:02:41,171 --> 00:02:42,490
assumptions about the world.

70
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,140
So that's a reduction to chaos.

71
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,520
It is not fun,

72
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,750
especially if it happens accidentally
and it can be traumatic enough so you

73
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:50,830
never recover from it.

74
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,200
Post traumatic stress disorders like that.

75
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:56,230
Like if you watch soldiers in battle
and they get post traumatic stress

76
00:02:56,231 --> 00:02:56,920
disorder,

77
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,030
it's very frequent that they get it
because something they did not because of

78
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,200
something that happened to them,

79
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:02,801
you know,

80
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,490
so they're out on a mission of some sort
and they shoot a three year old child.

81
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,150
It's like,

82
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,760
and maybe they do it consciously and then,

83
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:09,941
you know,

84
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,220
they wake up after they
do it and they think,

85
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,780
well that's not me.

86
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,320
It's like,

87
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,580
Oh yes it is.

88
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,880
It's just not the you that you think
you are and the you that did that man in

89
00:03:21,191 --> 00:03:21,540
countering,

90
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,800
that's going to be enough to
damage your consciousness.

91
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,440
And that is what happened to people
with post traumatic stress disorder.

92
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:30,790
Like it blows them apart so badly
and not just psychologically right.

93
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,120
It,

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,140
it radically alters them physiologically
their amygdalas grow in their

95
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:36,400
hippocampus by shrink.

96
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,080
If you have post
traumatic stress disorder,

97
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:39,550
it's a whole brain transformation.

98
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,440
It's like it's no joke.

99
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:44,380
And the human capacity
for evil is so deep that,

100
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,220
well young,

101
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:45,821
for example,

102
00:03:45,821 --> 00:03:47,080
he thought that that uh,

103
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,381
you know,

104
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:49,130
an accidental encounter with it.

105
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:53,350
It was enough to well enough to
lead to madness in some cases,

106
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,184
and it's,

107
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,810
it's no joke.
