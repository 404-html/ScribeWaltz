1
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,480
So back to the story of Jacob and his
ladder so that I can come again to my

2
00:00:15,111 --> 00:00:16,370
father's house in peace.

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,650
Then shall the Lord be
my God and this stone,

4
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:20,690
which I've said for a
pillar shall be God's house.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,580
And of all that that thou shalt give me,

6
00:00:22,581 --> 00:00:24,530
I will surely give the 10th unto the,

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,300
so that's,

8
00:00:26,301 --> 00:00:27,470
that's also an echo,

9
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,071
I would say,

10
00:00:28,071 --> 00:00:33,071
of the obligation of those who climb the
power hierarchy hierarchy to attend to

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,450
those who are at the bottom.

12
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:36,171
Right?

13
00:00:36,171 --> 00:00:40,490
Because if you think about the tie
thing as a form of wealth distribution,

14
00:00:40,491 --> 00:00:41,960
which is essentially what it is,

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,560
the part of the ethic that defines the
proper moral endeavor that's related to

16
00:00:47,901 --> 00:00:52,901
that center is not to advance yourself
at the expense of the entire community.

17
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,573
So if you're,

18
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,560
if you're fortunate enough
so that you can rise in,

19
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,800
in authority and Power and competence
within the confines of a community,

20
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:08,450
you still have a obligation
to maintain the structure,

21
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:11,960
maintain and further the structure of
the community within which you rose.

22
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,250
And that's obvious,

23
00:01:13,251 --> 00:01:13,491
right?

24
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:15,170
Because if people didn't do that,

25
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:16,370
after a couple of generations,

26
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:17,690
the whole thing would fall apart.

27
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:18,700
So you know,

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,090
you,

29
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:19,690
you,

30
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:20,230
you,

31
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:20,660
it's,

32
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,500
it's not reasonable to destroy
the game that you're winning.

33
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,590
It's reasonable to strengthen
the game that you're winning.

34
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,390
And so that's another thing because that
also describes the ethic that should

35
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:36,530
allow you to be an active member
of the community around which that,

36
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,770
that gathers around that center.

37
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,430
So,

38
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,263
so,

39
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,810
so one of the things I've learned
about the hero mythology that I really,

40
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:45,644
really like his,

41
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,830
so you see this pretty clearly
in the figure of Christ,

42
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:52,030
but because two things are conjoined in,

43
00:01:52,031 --> 00:01:52,940
in that story,

44
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,880
but Christ is also the here,

45
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:56,990
there's two kinds of heroes.

46
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:57,101
Hey,

47
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:01,640
there's the hero that goes out into chaos
and confronts the dragon of chaos and

48
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,540
gathers the,

49
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,870
the treasure as a consequence and
then shares it with the community.

50
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,670
That's,

51
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:07,000
that's,

52
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,640
that's one.

53
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:12,380
The other form of hero is the hero who
stands up against the corrupt state and

54
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,750
rattles the foundation of the state,

55
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,330
has it collapse and then reconstruct it.

56
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:17,631
Right?

57
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:20,510
So because the two great
dangers to human beings are

58
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:26,540
protected exposure to the catastrophes
of the natural world and subjugation to

59
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,374
tyranny,

60
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,681
right?

61
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,420
Those are the two major dangerous.

62
00:02:29,421 --> 00:02:34,421
And so a hero is their ultimate hero
is the person who reconstructs the

63
00:02:35,451 --> 00:02:39,650
structure of the state by using the
information that he gathered by going out

64
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,990
into the unknown that unites them both.

65
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,430
And so what that means,

66
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,170
here's the,

67
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,260
here's the rub as far as I can tell.

68
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,640
So a structure,

69
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,870
a center has to risks associated with it.

70
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,570
One is that it will degenerate into chaos.

71
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,140
And the other is that we'll rigidified
into and it'll degenerate into chaos even

72
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:06,610
if it just stays doing what it's doing.

73
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:09,910
So if it just does exactly what
it's doing and it doesn't change,

74
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,120
it will degenerate because things change.

75
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,310
And if it doesn't change to keep up,

76
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,790
then it gets farther and farther
away from the environment and it'll

77
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:20,200
precipitously collapse.

78
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,281
And so,

79
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:26,281
and then if it just changes willy nilly
so that nobody can establish a stable

80
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,630
centralize a game than a degenerates
into chaos immediately and no one can get

81
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:32,464
along.

82
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:37,740
So there's a rule for being longing to
the community and the rule has to be two

83
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,480
that you have to act in a manner that
sustains and that sustains the community

84
00:03:44,201 --> 00:03:45,790
and increases its competence.

85
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:49,540
That's the fundamental moral
obligation for belonging.

86
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,400
And while an obviously so,

87
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:51,641
right,

88
00:03:51,641 --> 00:03:53,580
because why would you belong to a,

89
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,680
why would you walk into a
club House that was on fire?

90
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:58,450
Like that's just not smart,

91
00:03:58,451 --> 00:03:58,930
right?

92
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,730
If you're going to be part of the game,

93
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,150
if you've decided that being
part of the game is worthwhile,

94
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,270
you've also taken on the moral.

95
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,220
You've also decided,

96
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,570
even if you didn't notice it,

97
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,800
that you have to work to support that
game because by deciding to play that

98
00:04:14,801 --> 00:04:15,071
game,

99
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:16,870
you've said that it's valuable.

100
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,370
And if it's valuable,

101
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:22,660
then obviously you should work to
sustain and expand it because that's the

102
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:25,780
definition of having a relationship
with something that's valuable.

103
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:31,440
And so that's the criteria for
membership in the community.

104
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,340
And that's partly why,

105
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,770
if you regard the cross,

106
00:04:35,771 --> 00:04:38,680
say as the symbol of voluntary suffering,

107
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:39,791
suffering,

108
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,020
excepted voluntarily,

109
00:04:41,021 --> 00:04:41,980
something like that,

110
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,430
which is means that there's
another element of that too.

111
00:04:45,431 --> 00:04:46,570
That's worth thinking about.

112
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:47,860
So you know,

113
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:52,300
the reason that came gets so out of hand
is because he's suffering and he won't

114
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:53,134
accept it.

115
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,970
He certainly won't accept
responsibility for it.

116
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,030
He's angry and bitter
about it and no wonder,

117
00:04:58,031 --> 00:04:58,301
right?

118
00:04:58,301 --> 00:04:58,780
I mean,

119
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,850
we have to be realistic
about these sorts of things.

120
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:01,961
They're your guys,

121
00:05:01,961 --> 00:05:06,010
all of you people are going to suffer
at some point in your life to the point

122
00:05:06,011 --> 00:05:07,870
where you're angry and bitter about it.

123
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,141
I mean,

124
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,240
there's just absolutely
no doubt about that.

125
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,500
And you're even going to think,

126
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:11,651
well,

127
00:05:11,651 --> 00:05:14,710
it's no bloody wonder that
I'm angry and bitter about it.

128
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,910
Everyone would be,

129
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,710
and things are so god awful that there's
no excuse for them to even exist.

130
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,860
And like that's a powerful argument.

131
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:27,160
Although I think it's
ultimately self-defeating.

132
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,520
Well that's kind of what
the story of Cain and Abel,

133
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:32,980
that's kind of what the
story of Cain and Abel,

134
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,360
what would you say?

135
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,300
That's the moral of the story
of Cain enable essentially.

136
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:43,810
So what that means instead is that even
under those conditions of relatively

137
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:44,710
intense suffering,

138
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:48,970
you have to accept it voluntarily because
otherwise it turns you against being

139
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,100
and then you start to act in this terrible
manner that makes everything worse.

140
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,770
And it seems to me that there's
a contradiction in that if,

141
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,630
if the reason you're complaining
is that things are bad,

142
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:04,190
then it isn't reasonable for you to
act in a manner that makes them worse.

143
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,380
Right.

144
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,720
I mean,

145
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,090
even if it's no wonder
that people do that,

146
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:09,860
but it's a degenerating game.

147
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:11,293
And so that's,

148
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:14,420
so the idea,

149
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:19,370
part of the idea of the cross and the
suffering that it represents is that if

150
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,350
you could accept that voluntarily,

151
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,780
regardless of its intensity,

152
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:29,110
then you won't become embittered and
resentful and vengeful to the point where

153
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:33,260
you pose a danger to the
stability of the community.

154
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,730
So,

155
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,680
or to your own stability for that matter,

156
00:06:36,681 --> 00:06:37,310
cause it's,

157
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:37,581
you know,

158
00:06:37,581 --> 00:06:38,930
it might be your own stability,

159
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,130
the stability of your family,

160
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:42,620
the stability of the community
and the stability of the world.

161
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,030
It might be all of that.

162
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,850
And increasingly I
think it is all of that.
