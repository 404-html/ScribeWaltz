1
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:08,860
It's weird because normally for animals,

2
00:00:08,861 --> 00:00:10,420
what would be in the
box of what should be,

3
00:00:10,421 --> 00:00:14,470
would be deep motivational states
that are biological in origin.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,570
So maybe an animal
hasn't had enough to eat.

5
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,640
And so park it's feeling hungry.

6
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:19,810
That's undesirable.

7
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:21,520
It wants to have something to eat.

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,890
And so these different
underlying biological systems
like hunger and thirst and

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:29,710
and sexual lost and aggression and
temperature regulation and so on.

10
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:32,860
They are what set the goals
and the perceptual frame.

11
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,551
So,

12
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:35,140
and the emotional responses.

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,430
But in human beings we're so damn abstract
that we can take that structure and

14
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:41,650
we can put almost
anything in that goal box.

15
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:42,911
So for example,

16
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:45,370
you can go to a soccer
game and you can say,

17
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:48,260
well I'm going to identify with my team.

18
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:52,090
So you expand the boundaries of your
current state of existence to incorporate

19
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:52,924
the team.

20
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,853
And then you say,

21
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,680
well it's really important to me that
these kicked that little round sphere

22
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,610
through that net.

23
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:59,470
And so your whole nervous system says,

24
00:00:59,471 --> 00:00:59,831
okay,

25
00:00:59,831 --> 00:01:01,090
well if that's the goal,

26
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:03,400
we're going to align
our emotions with that.

27
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,480
And then you know,

28
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,560
guys you don't know,

29
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:09,910
run down the field and kick a little
sphere through a nat and you're like up

30
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:10,450
there,

31
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:10,901
you know,

32
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:14,110
is celebrating in a way that you'd
never do in your actual life.

33
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,920
It's like you don't do that when
you get a good grade on an exam,

34
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:18,220
you know,

35
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,360
jump up in the air and
hug all your friends.

36
00:01:20,361 --> 00:01:20,560
It's,

37
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,580
you'll do that at a soccer game.

38
00:01:22,581 --> 00:01:24,340
It's like what the Hell is wrong with you?

39
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,360
So,

40
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,360
but you do that because this is a very
malleable and extendable frame and you're

41
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,750
using it for everything.

42
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,680
When you go into a movie theater
and you watch the protagonist,

43
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,400
you basically adopt his or her frame
of reference and then you see the whole

44
00:01:39,401 --> 00:01:43,230
world that's portrayed on the screen
through the eyes of the person that you're

45
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,180
identifying with as part of
our capacity for imitation.

46
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,890
So basically what you do,

47
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:48,670
what it seems,

48
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,503
what you do there,

49
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,750
it's like if you're talking to someone
else and you adopt their frame of

50
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:53,560
reference,

51
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,630
it's not exactly a cognitive operation.

52
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,880
What you seem to do is first of all,

53
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,410
come with to some understanding
about what it is that they want.

54
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,790
And so that's the goal.

55
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:05,320
Once you know what they want,

56
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:07,510
you can represent them in your body.

57
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,500
So it's almost like you're playing them
as a simulation on your own biological

58
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,363
platform.

59
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:17,140
And then you can infer from your own
emotional responses if you also simulate

60
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:18,490
the situation that they're in,

61
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,750
what their emotions are,

62
00:02:19,751 --> 00:02:21,620
and that enables you to
understand other people.

63
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:26,170
So were these weird biological computers
that are capable of running other

64
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:28,390
psyches on our biological platform.

65
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:31,390
And that makes us able to imitate
and also to understand each other.
