1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,420
The moral presuppositions of a culture
are instantiated in its stories.

2
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:14,270
They're not instantiated then
it's explicit philosophy.

3
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:18,140
There might be a layer of
explicit philosophy and of
course there is in the West

4
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:19,490
in a layer of explicit law.

5
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:23,540
But underneath that there are stories and
there isn't anything under the stories

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,260
except maybe haven,

7
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:25,791
you know,

8
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:26,960
and that's so implicit.

9
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:28,670
It doesn't even actually count.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:30,590
It's not a cognitive operation.

11
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,630
And so this is the story.

12
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,640
These are the stories that
are underneath our culture.

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:38,420
And so there better be something to them.

14
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:39,920
That's what we hope.

15
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,540
And but more importantly
maybe we shouldn't toss them
away without knowing what

16
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:44,991
they mean.

17
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:49,580
Because if we tossed them away then we're
throwing everything that we depend on

18
00:00:49,581 --> 00:00:50,930
a way as far as I can tell.

19
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:51,710
And we will,

20
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,760
we will pay for it.

21
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,190
We'll pay for it individually
because we'll be weak.

22
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:55,940
You know?

23
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,920
Cause if you're not firm
in your convictions,

24
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,040
then someone else who's
from their convictions can,

25
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,990
you're their puppet like instantly.

26
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:05,090
And then you're also the
puppet of your own doubts,

27
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:05,361
right?

28
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:07,610
Because unless you have convictions,

29
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:10,850
you're going to generate doubts
like mad cause everyone does.

30
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:12,200
And then the doubts when,

31
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:14,720
and you'll be paralyzed
because there'll be,

32
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,080
you know,

33
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,230
50% of you moving forward
and 50% of you frozen,

34
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:21,980
stiff and that'll be enough
just to lodge you in place.

35
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,293
And so,

36
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:26,811
okay,

37
00:01:26,811 --> 00:01:29,270
so there's a psychologist [inaudible]
of the idea of leadership,

38
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:30,170
which is very important.

39
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:32,230
And then it's associated
with the idea of character,

40
00:01:32,231 --> 00:01:33,170
logical development.

41
00:01:33,171 --> 00:01:35,330
And it's associated with
the idea of struggle,

42
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:36,710
not happiness.

43
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,470
And it's also associated
with this Abrahamic idea,

44
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:40,310
which I really liked.

45
00:01:40,311 --> 00:01:44,390
And which was something that's been very
useful to me as a consequence of doing

46
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:44,930
these lectures.

47
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:48,200
Because remember at the beginning
of the Abrahamic stories,

48
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,970
Abraham's like a stay at home guy,

49
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:50,181
right?

50
00:01:50,181 --> 00:01:52,400
He's like the guy who's 40
years old living in his,

51
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:52,880
in his,

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,160
in his mother's basement
and God says like,

53
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:55,311
get,

54
00:01:55,311 --> 00:01:56,180
get the hell out of there.

55
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:56,540
You know,

56
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,250
get out in the world where you belong.

57
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,230
Go do something difficult because
what you're doing isn't acceptable.

58
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:03,531
And you know,

59
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:04,880
the first thing he does is go somewhere,

60
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:06,080
there's a terrible famine,

61
00:02:06,081 --> 00:02:06,831
and then he goes somewhere.

62
00:02:06,831 --> 00:02:07,670
There's a tyranny.

63
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:08,420
So,

64
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:08,780
you know,

65
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:09,030
it's,

66
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,861
it's pretty funny.

67
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:14,510
He follows God's call and it's not
like sweetness and light and paradise

68
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,201
immediately.

69
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:16,220
It's nothing like that.

70
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:16,381
It's,

71
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:18,860
it's instantaneous combat,

72
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,161
you know,

73
00:02:19,161 --> 00:02:20,930
of the most difficult kind.
