Hi Dr Peterson,
thanks for coming.

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:13,010
My question is a little bit off topic
from everything else tonight,

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:14,940
but I really wanted to hear what you had
to say about it.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,980
Um,
I work in residence life here at UBC and

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:25,920
in the community where I am.
We were recently effected by a suicide

6
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:29,640
of someone who lived in our community
and I was upset about it,

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,220
not just because obviously it's a
horrible thing to have happen,

8
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,760
but also because res life in the
university,

9
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:40,200
like they talk all this talk about like
self care and your mental health is so

10
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,780
important to us.
But then things like this still

11
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:45,570
happened.
So I wanted to know like if you think

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:48,090
like,
what do you think the university should

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,910
be doing to keep stuff like this from
happening in the future?

14
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:55,503
Well,

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:03,400
it's not self evident that it's the
university's responsibility and the

16
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:06,200
reason for that.
I'm not saying it isn't.

17
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,870
Okay,
I'm saying it's not self evident that it

18
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:13,280
is because different institutions can
only do so many things,

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,890
you know?
And,

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,890
and we were already requiring the
universities to educate and to act as

21
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,530
substitute parents.
Increasingly.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:26,770
And to take on the role of judge,
jury and executioner as there are more,

23
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,340
what should be criminal cases are being
handled within the university.

24
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,174
Say,

25
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,583
um,

26
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:42,790
having said that,
you could ask the broader question is,

27
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:46,600
well,
what do you do to help people be

28
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:50,920
sufficiently in love with life so that
they don't wish to end it now?

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,060
And I've tried to puzzle through that
for a long time and that's partly why

30
00:01:55,061 --> 00:01:56,590
I've written the things that I've
written.

31
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,980
It's partly why I've produced the online
programs that I've produced.

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,360
No one.
So we know that if you do,

33
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,490
if you have students do the future
authoring program,

34
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:08,590
for example,
they're much less likely to drop out of

35
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,530
university about 30 percent less likely
and their grades go up.

36
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:16,000
And that's especially true if they're
male and marginalized.

37
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,340
It has a bigger impact on those
communities.

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,720
And so,
you know,

39
00:02:19,721 --> 00:02:22,270
I've tried to get universities interests
now the data's there,

40
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:24,940
but they're not.
And it's very difficult to get a big

41
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:25,930
bureaucracy to move.

42
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,650
A big,
big is immobile.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,210
So I'm not sure there's anything they
can really do about it.

44
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:37,450
It's certainly possible that the things
that they're trying to do about it or

45
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:38,860
making it worse.
Yeah.

46
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,620
That's another thing that you learn if
you're a good social scientists,

47
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,770
just like there was evidence,
and I don't know if this is still the

48
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:45,350
case,
but,

49
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:49,000
but there was good evidence.
I looked into this about 15 years ago.

50
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,100
Say you want to prevent suicides or
suicide hotline in your town and you

51
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:55,630
advertise it.
What happens?

52
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:59,200
Suicide rate goes up because you're
advertising suicide,

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,620
right?
And lots of lots of interventions are

54
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:03,790
like that.
It's really,

55
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,850
really hard to make things better and
it's really,

56
00:03:06,851 --> 00:03:10,180
really easy to make them worse.
And so that's another problem.

57
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:12,580
You get these big bureaucracies,
let's say,

58
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:15,940
and there hypothetically motivated by
positive intentions and I would say

59
00:03:15,941 --> 00:03:16,960
hypothetically,
again,

60
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:20,170
because it takes an awful lot of work to
help someone straightened out.

61
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:22,900
It's no joke,
especially if they're in real trouble

62
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,380
and they put in place these
structures that are designed to help but

63
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:32,850
they don't ever evaluate them and they
could easily be making it worse.

64
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,583
So.

65
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,490
So I don't have a straightforward answer
to that question.

66
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,430
Um,
I think that.

67
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,760
Well,
that's,

68
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,270
that's the only answer I have.
Yeah.
