1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,750
So,
all right,

2
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:11,710
so the individual as like culture,
like nature also has its negative

3
00:00:11,711 --> 00:00:14,110
element.
You would call that the shadow.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,370
You know,
and we're going to,

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,970
we're going to discuss the shadow in
some detail because one of the things

6
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:23,971
that you believed and he kind of got
this idea from nature was that when you

7
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:27,250
grow up and maybe as a consequence of
your temperament,

8
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:30,610
you tend to think that some of your
attributes are good and some of them are

9
00:00:30,611 --> 00:00:31,510
negative,
you know,

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,790
so you make moral judgments about them
then.

11
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:34,990
Fair enough.
So you know,

12
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:39,991
you might think for the psychoanalysts,
the two elements of human being that

13
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:45,361
we're commonly regarded as negative from
a moral perspective or sexuality and

14
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,150
aggression and but yoga of notion is
that,

15
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:49,871
well,
you know,

16
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:54,550
you might be someone who's modest and
careful and never causes any conflict.

17
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:57,190
And then we might say,
well you're a well socialized person,

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,630
but you,
his point would be,

19
00:00:58,631 --> 00:01:00,040
yeah,
but you've got no power,

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,360
you've got no power.

21
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,790
And so people are just going to roll
right over you.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,470
So you better dive into that morass of
sexuality and aggression and pull out

23
00:01:08,471 --> 00:01:12,160
those powers and integrate them into
your psyche so that you can use them

24
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:14,200
consciously.
Because without that,

25
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,800
you're harmless.
But you know,

26
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,340
I don't think that's a very good
ambition.

27
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,080
You know,
what do you want to be when you're 30

28
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,430
well,
I want to be harmless.

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,140
It's like,
you know,

30
00:01:23,141 --> 00:01:26,050
really that's what you want to be.
It's like you might as well not even be

31
00:01:26,051 --> 00:01:28,240
if that's your goal.
So,

32
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,180
so you know,
this dichotomy between the positive

33
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:32,980
individual and the negative individuals,
very,

34
00:01:32,981 --> 00:01:37,180
very complex because what's positive and
what's negative is not obvious from the

35
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:40,300
beginning.
And arbitrary judgments don't help.

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:43,930
It's very difficult for a given
individual to look at themselves and

37
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:44,890
say,
well,

38
00:01:44,891 --> 00:01:48,100
what is it about me that's actually
worth developing?

39
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:51,360
And I can tie this into some degree and
to big five theories.

40
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,370
So one of the big five characteristics
is

41
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,520
agreeableness safe.
And people tend to think of

42
00:02:00,521 --> 00:02:02,470
agreeableness has a virtue,
which is a complete,

43
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:06,340
it's completely idiotic to think that
because every virtue has its vice.

44
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,610
But agreeable people are sympathetic and
empathetic.

45
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:12,340
And Compassionate and polite.
And those all sound like good things.

46
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,460
But they're also part of being an e
DePaul parent by the way.

47
00:02:15,461 --> 00:02:16,750
But,
but anyways,

48
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:20,470
the problem with being agreeable is that
people take advantage of you and then

49
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:23,950
you get resentful.
So I'm sure there's a whole pile of you

50
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:25,690
in here that are agreeable and
resentful.

51
00:02:25,691 --> 00:02:27,430
You know,
I'm sure you know who you are.

52
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,370
And one of the things I would mention,
and you should think about this cause

53
00:02:30,371 --> 00:02:34,150
it'll help you a lot if you do it,
is that resentment is your best friend.

54
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,830
If something makes you resentful,
do not do it.

55
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,410
So,
or there's a more sophisticated rule,

56
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,660
which is if something makes you
resentful,

57
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:47,140
there's only two possibilities.
One is that you're sniffling and

58
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:50,110
immature and you won't adopt your
responsibilities and you're whining

59
00:02:50,111 --> 00:02:52,810
about it.
The other is that you're being pushed

60
00:02:52,811 --> 00:02:55,000
around and people are attempting to
enslave you.

61
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,810
So you want to eliminate the first
possibility,

62
00:02:58,811 --> 00:02:59,650
right?
Got To think,

63
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:01,540
well,
am I just being immature and whining

64
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:04,090
about this?
Is it something that people are

65
00:03:04,091 --> 00:03:07,900
reasonably demanding of me?
And if you think that through and maybe

66
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:09,370
you talked to some people about it and
you think,

67
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:09,700
no,
no,

68
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,510
this isn't reasonable,
then the resentment is telling you act,

69
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,570
act because otherwise that's what you'll
be.

70
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,810
You'll end up 15 years,
especially if you're married or

71
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:23,860
something like that with 8,000 things
you're resentful about and then you know

72
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,680
you'll be in some kind of painful
divorce that lasts for 10 years.

73
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,000
So better to nip it in the bud.
If someone is after you to do something

74
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:35,230
and you don't feel like you're getting
proper regard or proper response or you

75
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:40,231
don't think it's fair,
it's like have some courage and get a

76
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,810
hold of your anger and use it.
It doesn't mean you're right,

77
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,960
but at least it means you can push the
person hard enough so they have to

78
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:50,200
engage in a dialogue with you and you
know this is,

79
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,140
these are necessary skills.
Like if you cannot do this,

80
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,390
you have to be able to say no to
negotiate.

81
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,360
You have to be able to say no.
So you always want to put yourself in a

82
00:03:58,361 --> 00:04:00,940
position where you can do that.
That's part of being,

83
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:04,150
that's part of power.
And the other thing is do not let people

84
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,210
push you around because you'll get
pushed right into a corner and you'll

85
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:10,480
end up as a slave.
And that's because there's tyranny,

86
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,190
slavery,
or negotiation.

87
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,600
That's what you've got.
