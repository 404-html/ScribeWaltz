1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,293
Sure

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,870
you often give advice to young adults to
help them avoid some of the pitfalls of

3
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:11,380
life.

4
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,620
Any advice for those of us who are
40 plus who have already faltered?

5
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,530
Look first I'm,

6
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:18,364
this is Graham.

7
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:21,320
Everybody who 40 pluses
as already fault her,

8
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:22,030
but,

9
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,680
but I'm presuming that you mean faltered
in a manner that it appears to you to

10
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:28,450
be above out above the average.

11
00:00:28,451 --> 00:00:29,050
Right.

12
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:29,883
Well,

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,080
okay.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,720
What I would really recommend
is I think that you should,

15
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:34,590
if you haven't already,

16
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:37,410
you should go do the future authoring
program and maybe the past authoring

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,101
program too,

18
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:42,060
because you should figure
out exactly how you faltered.

19
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:47,430
Like what exactly did you do wrong
by your own buy your own analysis,

20
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:47,641
right?

21
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:48,271
I'm not saying,

22
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,310
well what social rules did you break?

23
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,200
Although that's not a
bad initial guideline.

24
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:52,800
It's like,

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,290
so in the self authoring suite,

26
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:59,520
there's a past authoring module and it
asks you to break your life I to 70 parks

27
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,050
and then to consider the emotionally
significant or practically significant

28
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:06,600
events within each epoch
in the detail out there,

29
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,850
emotional nature and their
consequences and so on.

30
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:11,220
And one of the things you
might want to figure out is,

31
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,611
well,

32
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:13,200
when you say that you faltered,

33
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,420
like what do you mean exactly?

34
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:19,590
And I mean exactly go over your
life with a fine tooth comb.

35
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:22,020
This is what Aleksandr
Solzhenitsyn did by the way,

36
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,690
in the Gulag before he
wrote the Gulag archipelago,

37
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:25,950
he went over his life and said,

38
00:01:25,951 --> 00:01:26,221
okay,

39
00:01:26,221 --> 00:01:28,500
well like where did I go wrong?

40
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,820
What did I squander?

41
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:34,080
What mistakes did I make and what did I
do right so that you can orient yourself

42
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:35,670
now and then you want to think,

43
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,070
and this is why we built the
future authoring program.

44
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:39,120
Well look,

45
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:40,740
you got 40 years left man.

46
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,190
So what do you want them to be like?

47
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,500
So what do you want to aim at?

48
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,820
You know at least how are you
going to minimize the misery if,

49
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:49,170
if,

50
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,210
if nothing else.

51
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:55,100
And so you need a plan and then what you
need to do is to figure out how to work

52
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:59,540
day to day so that you
incrementally approach that plan.

53
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:04,541
So I have another chapter in this new
book called compare yourself to who you

54
00:02:04,881 --> 00:02:05,541
were yesterday.

55
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,550
Rather than to who someone else's today.

56
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,760
That's really a useful psychological
stance for someone who's 30 and over in

57
00:02:13,521 --> 00:02:17,360
particular to a 20 year olds can still
kind of compare themselves to other 20

58
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:20,090
year olds because all 20 year
olds in some way are the same,

59
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,840
but 40 year olds are really
different from each other and so,

60
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,170
or 30 year olds for that matter.

61
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,880
So you might think,

62
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:26,181
okay,

63
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:27,014
well

64
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,040
ear,

65
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,461
here's a,

66
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:33,120
here's a meditative strategy
for for ceasing to falter.

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,300
You could wake up in the morning or you
could do this at night before you go to

68
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,111
bed and you could think,

69
00:02:37,111 --> 00:02:37,381
okay,

70
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:37,950
look,

71
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,130
I want to structure my day
tomorrow so that when I,

72
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,340
when I'm done with the day,

73
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,880
my life is in slightly better order
than it was when I woke up this morning.

74
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:54,810
Just slightly better because
incremental progress is massively,

75
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:59,500
massively effective because
it bears a exponential fruit.

76
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,390
I just like a bank account,

77
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,590
um,

78
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,460
compounds,

79
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:06,220
incremental progress compounds with time.

80
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,170
So you can get up in the
morning and you could think,

81
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:08,650
okay,

82
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,740
there's some things in my life
that I could put in order today.

83
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,210
They're usually things
you don't want to do.

84
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:14,170
As I mentioned earlier,

85
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,440
what could I do today that would help
put my life in order that I wouldn't do?

86
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,150
And you have to ask yourself.

87
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,110
You can't tell yourself.

88
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:25,420
You have to ask yourself
what would you do?

89
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,800
And then maybe you have to say,

90
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,340
well,

91
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:30,820
or maybe you have to say under what
conditions would I be willing to do

92
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,550
something to put my life
in further ordered today?

93
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,740
What little reward would
I need to give myself?

94
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:39,490
And these have to be questions you
can't like take out the whip and boss

95
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:42,540
yourself wrong because you'll find that
you're a terrible master and a worst

96
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,374
slave.

97
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,440
And so you can get a long
ways if you look low enough.

98
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,270
One of the things Carl Jung said,

99
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,390
which I really liked was that modern
people don't see God because they don't

100
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:53,201
look low enough.

101
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:54,370
They don't have the humility.

102
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,830
Now you said that you
have already faulted.

103
00:03:56,831 --> 00:03:59,960
So it sounds like you've got
to humility already intact.

104
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,040
So I would say think about what you want.

105
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,330
Think about what you know
around you isn't set right.

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,820
Cause you'll know it.

107
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,770
Make a list of things that are
around you that aren't right.

108
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,130
And then start thinking about
small things you can do,

109
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:19,600
like trivial things that even a fool
like yourself could manage that would

110
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,830
orient you in the right direction and
help straighten out your life and try that

111
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,110
for a year before you decide
that you're a failure.

112
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:27,003
You know?

113
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:30,010
Because you'll find that if you
put that into practice for a year,

114
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,170
that things will be a lot better.

115
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,160
And like I said,

116
00:04:33,161 --> 00:04:34,300
you got 40 years left,

117
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:34,900
so you're not,

118
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,830
you're not done yet.

119
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,180
And so

120
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,280
the other thing I would say too is

121
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,310
it isn't exactly that.

122
00:04:43,311 --> 00:04:45,530
I would say forgive
yourself because you know,

123
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:46,550
that's just a cliche.

124
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,010
But I would say that once you've decided,

125
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:49,490
once you,

126
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,420
what you've done wrong and
you've put into practice some,

127
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,000
some strategies to rectify that,

128
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:57,350
that don't,

129
00:04:57,351 --> 00:05:01,550
you don't have to beat yourself any
more than is necessary for you to learn,

130
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:05,630
which is a good rule of thumb with
regards to treating yourself and also to

131
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:06,620
treating other people.

132
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,173
So

133
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,330
yeah.
