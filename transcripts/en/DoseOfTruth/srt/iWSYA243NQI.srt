1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,570
Okay

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,403
for the decree.

3
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:02,090
Okay.

4
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:02,541
Why does it,

5
00:00:02,541 --> 00:00:03,740
why do you care about the degree?

6
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:05,353
To get a job.

7
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:05,990
Okay.

8
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,350
Whose decision was it that you
took the degree that you're taking?

9
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,060
Your S.

10
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,540
Okay.

11
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:13,250
Did your parents have
any influence on that?

12
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,600
No.

13
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:14,960
No?

14
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:15,620
Okay.

15
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:16,130
Okay.

16
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,210
What job are you after?

17
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:18,523
Psychology.

18
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:19,370
Psychology.

19
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,080
Clinical?

20
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:20,510
Yes.

21
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:21,430
Clinical psychologist.

22
00:00:21,431 --> 00:00:24,350
Why do you want to do that again?

23
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:24,770
You don't,

24
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:27,260
I'm going to question you
till you run out of answers.

25
00:00:27,261 --> 00:00:28,460
You will run out of answers.

26
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:29,390
So if this is the time,

27
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:29,811
that's fine.

28
00:00:29,811 --> 00:00:30,950
Why do you want to do,

29
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:31,551
what do you want to do?

30
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,580
Clinical psychology to help people.

31
00:00:34,581 --> 00:00:35,060
Okay.

32
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,480
Okay.

33
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,370
Why is that more important
to you than making money?

34
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:41,350
Because it helps me interact.

35
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,953
How

36
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,290
it sort of makes me happy to
see other people get over there,

37
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:49,020
bro.

38
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,350
Okay.

39
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:49,820
Okay.

40
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,131
All right,

41
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:50,490
good.

42
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:50,790
Good.

43
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:51,540
Well that's pretty good.

44
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,140
You had lots of answers so sometimes
you can run people out of answers with

45
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,160
about three questions,

46
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,060
so,

47
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,401
all right,

48
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:58,234
so

49
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,820
small action perception nested in larger
action perception nested in larger

50
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:07,020
action perception all the way out too.

51
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:07,681
Well,

52
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,700
until you run out of answers.

53
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:09,420
Fundamentally,

54
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,050
right?

55
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:10,261
So,

56
00:01:10,261 --> 00:01:13,410
and that's where at the edge
where you run out of answers,

57
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:17,700
that's where metaphysics takes over
because there's not an irrational domain

58
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:18,180
anymore.

59
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,010
You're in a metaphysical
domain at that point.

60
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,670
And so you have implicit assumptions
that you don't even know about that are

61
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,390
working on,

62
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:24,621
on,

63
00:01:24,621 --> 00:01:25,454
on the fringes.

64
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,000
And we'll talk about that a little bit.

65
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:27,241
Okay?

66
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,074
So,

67
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:28,943
so then

68
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,620
we could take a category like,

69
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:33,663
hmm,

70
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:36,570
we'll do a micro analysis the same way.

71
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:39,990
So you're at home and
you're a tickling the baby.

72
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:40,980
All right?

73
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:41,850
So we'll note first.

74
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,020
That's not an abstraction,

75
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:43,741
right?

76
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:46,050
There's an actual baby and
you're moving your fingers.

77
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:50,460
And so that's not just an
abstract conceptualization.

78
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:50,900
It's,

79
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,860
it's also where your consciousness ends.

80
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,241
You're tickling the baby,

81
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:55,620
but you don't know how you're doing it.

82
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:56,880
You don't know the musculature,

83
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,090
you don't know how to manipulate
the little organs and everything.

84
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,140
You can just do it.

85
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,160
So Bang,

86
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,740
you're out of the perceptual
domain at that point.

87
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,900
It grounds out in voluntary action.

88
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:07,861
All right,

89
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:08,820
so you're tickling the baby.

90
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,540
What are you doing when you're tickling
the baby while you're making the baby

91
00:02:12,541 --> 00:02:12,931
laugh?

92
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:13,171
Okay,

93
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:14,790
that's one way you're
playing with the baby.

94
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,091
Okay?

95
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,924
So fine.

96
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,120
That's a subset of the activity play with
baby and you can play peekaboo with a

97
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:22,350
baby or you can take tickle the baby,

98
00:02:22,351 --> 00:02:23,310
you can clean the baby.

99
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,800
Those and all of that
could be part of playing.

100
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,761
And you might say,

101
00:02:26,761 --> 00:02:26,941
well,

102
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:28,680
what are you doing when
you're playing with a baby?

103
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,161
And you'd say,

104
00:02:29,161 --> 00:02:29,341
well,

105
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:32,010
I'm taking care of my family and fine.

106
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:32,701
And then you think,

107
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:33,750
well what?

108
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,790
What are you doing when you're
taking care of your family?

109
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,271
And you might say,

110
00:02:36,271 --> 00:02:36,421
well,

111
00:02:36,421 --> 00:02:37,530
I'm being a good parent.

112
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,940
And then you might say,

113
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:39,091
well,

114
00:02:39,091 --> 00:02:40,860
what am I doing when
I'm being a good parent?

115
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,251
You might say,

116
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:41,431
well,

117
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,450
I'm being a good person.

118
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,071
And then you could say,

119
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:44,191
well,

120
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:45,480
why should you be a good person?

121
00:02:45,481 --> 00:02:46,980
But we won't go any farther than that.

122
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:47,281
It's sort of,

123
00:02:47,281 --> 00:02:48,780
because you can see
that that's sort of the,

124
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,771
in some sense,

125
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:51,720
that's an ultimate level of abstraction.

126
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:52,861
Okay,

127
00:02:52,861 --> 00:02:54,210
so you could,

128
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,230
what do you do?

129
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,270
Someone comes up to you and you
tickling the baby and you say,

130
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:57,421
well,

131
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,410
I'm being a good person.

132
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,230
What they,

133
00:02:59,230 --> 00:02:59,800
what are you doing?

134
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,730
I'm being a good person.

135
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:04,090
It's like it's a bit disjointed.

136
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,400
It isn't what the person
would expect as an answer.

137
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,230
They'd expect something more local.

138
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,640
But it's still true.

139
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:14,940
And so what's interesting is that
when you're doing something that's

140
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:18,540
what,

141
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:18,721
well,

142
00:03:18,721 --> 00:03:19,770
I would say worthwhile.

143
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,170
That's probably the right
way of thinking about it.

144
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,580
You're doing a whole bunch of things
simultaneously and you're not really aware

145
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:27,361
of all those things,

146
00:03:27,361 --> 00:03:28,770
but you are in some sense,

147
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:29,011
you know,

148
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:30,100
because if the purse,

149
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,440
someone might come along and say,

150
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:34,410
well what kind of idiot
tickles a baby like that?

151
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,191
It's like,

152
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,870
well what have they said?

153
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,620
Well they've kind of nailed you
here down on the micro tickle level,

154
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,030
but they're sort of also,

155
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,380
yeah,

156
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,040
taking a pretty good crack at this
high level system as well now.

157
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,150
And that's a problem.

158
00:03:48,151 --> 00:03:48,721
So let's say,

159
00:03:48,721 --> 00:03:51,750
well good parent is a subset
of being a good person,

160
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,670
but there's all sorts of other baby.

161
00:03:53,671 --> 00:03:55,740
You have to be a good partner.

162
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,480
Maybe you have to be a good daughter.

163
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,620
Maybe you have to be a good,

164
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,330
nice,

165
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:01,673
you know,

166
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,340
your,

167
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,173
your,

168
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:08,570
your ability to function as a good person
is composed of a very large number of

169
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:11,250
hierarchically nested subsystems.

170
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,630
And so when the person goes,

171
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,120
only an idiot would
take the baby like that.

172
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,890
And they go after that.

173
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,611
You might think,

174
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:17,731
well,

175
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:18,720
how upset you should,

176
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,700
should you get an answer is,

177
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:20,971
well,

178
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:22,950
how valid do you think their complaint is?

179
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,580
So let's say maybe it only an idiot
would tickle a baby like that and you

180
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:27,750
happened to be that idiot.

181
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:28,081
And so,

182
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:28,261
well,

183
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:29,460
maybe you're not a good person.

184
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,600
And so what does that mean?

185
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,740
It means that the map that consists
of all these nested subsystems has now

186
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,630
become unreliable.

187
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,750
And so how upset are you
going to get about that?

188
00:04:39,751 --> 00:04:40,051
Well,

189
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:40,291
you know,

190
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,170
maybe you had a bad day at work and you're
kind of hypoglycemic and you had too

191
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,310
much to drink the night before.

192
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:45,210
And so someone says,

193
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:45,690
you know,

194
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,160
that's not how you tickle a baby.

195
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,630
You idiot and you cry.

196
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,183
Well why?

197
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,330
Well,

198
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,010
it's a pretty high level blow.

199
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,280
And so it's the sort of thing
you want to do if you want to do,

200
00:04:56,281 --> 00:04:57,240
if you want to hurt someone,

201
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:01,500
it's not a good way to teach
someone because you teach
them down at the smallest

202
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:02,281
possible level.

203
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:02,671
The micro,

204
00:05:02,671 --> 00:05:02,821
no,

205
00:05:02,821 --> 00:05:03,000
no,

206
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,680
you don't tickle a baby like that.

207
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:09,180
He'd tickle the baby like this and you're
doing a good job on everything else.

208
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,500
But if you're going to take a baby,

209
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:11,520
this is how you go about it.

210
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:12,181
And the person thinks,

211
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:12,391
well,

212
00:05:12,391 --> 00:05:13,020
you know,

213
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,220
I'm doing a fairly good job,

214
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:18,240
but I've got this little thing I have
to work on and maybe I can manage it.

215
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,820
And so that works and how that works.

216
00:05:20,821 --> 00:05:23,700
And you can have some sympathy for the
person at the same time because you might

217
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:23,881
say,

218
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:24,270
well,

219
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,061
I used to take a baby.

220
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:25,920
He's like an idiot too.

221
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:26,880
But you know it's,

222
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,680
it's fixable and most of use.

223
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:29,543
Okay.

224
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,920
And that's a nice thing to do
when you're arguing with someone.

225
00:05:31,921 --> 00:05:32,191
You say,

226
00:05:32,191 --> 00:05:33,024
look,

227
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,780
here's a bunch of things you're doing
right that are related to this that are

228
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:39,614
important.

229
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,980
Here's a small thing that maybe you
could alter slightly and it would make me

230
00:05:42,981 --> 00:05:46,010
happy and maybe I'll return the
favor at some point and they think,

231
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:48,500
oh well maybe,

232
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,060
maybe I'll do that maybe.

233
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,380
And then they practice doing it.

234
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,590
You can give them a pat on the head
and then you're both happy about that.

235
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,240
That really works with people.

236
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,950
It really works.

237
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,083
So

238
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,650
okay,

239
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,483
so

240
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,720
what you see is that these
high level abstractions,

241
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,670
let's call them ethical abstractions,

242
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,130
are related to actions.

243
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,270
They're related.

244
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,170
And so you can see that relationship
from the good person to doing something

245
00:06:15,171 --> 00:06:18,020
like tickle the baby
properly and then you can,

246
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,910
you can conceptualize it this way,

247
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,730
that you have this
massive overarching map,

248
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,770
which is something like
the story of your life,

249
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,500
including its extension future.

250
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:31,880
And then it consists of these subordinate
maps which can be broken down all the

251
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,560
way down to the level of actions.

252
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,040
And so then that explains
to you to some degree,

253
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:42,041
how you can do the impossible
job of calibrating your
emotional response because

254
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,130
roughly speaking,

255
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:47,120
your emotional response should be
proportionate to the level that's being

256
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:48,560
assaulted by the anomaly.
