1
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,720
I'm still going to chase you back to
that story about both the PR company,

2
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:13,190
but I have another question for you.

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,623
So,

4
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,081
you know,

5
00:00:15,081 --> 00:00:15,650
you,

6
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:20,650
you are detailing out the
kind of childhood that in
principle could have left

7
00:00:20,841 --> 00:00:22,310
you bitter and resentful.

8
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,070
So why didn't it,

9
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:24,490
like,

10
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:25,600
why didn't that happen to you?

11
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:26,111
Why?

12
00:00:26,111 --> 00:00:27,520
I think because of my father,

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,580
my mother was a deep pessimists.

14
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,750
My father was a profound optimist
and I must've had my father's genes

15
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:37,260
predominating over.

16
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,094
I got them both,

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,260
um,

18
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:40,550
optimism and pessimism.

19
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,870
But I'm grateful for everything
that's happened in my life.

20
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,490
I'm from every deprivation.

21
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:45,961
You know,

22
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:47,580
I was sick in bed for 15 years,

23
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,500
and even that turned out to be,

24
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:50,490
it was nightmarish.

25
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,330
It was horrible.

26
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:55,830
It inflicted pains for which there are
no words in the English language because

27
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,680
I was isolated for five
years and could not talk,

28
00:00:58,681 --> 00:01:02,340
literally could not muster
the energy to move the larynx,

29
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:04,080
to give a single syllable of sound.

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,420
MMM.

31
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:05,960
And yet,

32
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,350
I as nightmarish,

33
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:09,780
horrible and monstrous does,

34
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:10,760
it was I,

35
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:12,880
I found it to international
scientific groups.

36
00:01:12,881 --> 00:01:13,714
So at that time,

37
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:14,640
um,

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,660
I wrote three books,

39
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,410
uh,

40
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,130
and I learned what it's like to be at
that extreme of the human experience,

41
00:01:20,131 --> 00:01:21,510
extreme isolation,

42
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,560
um,

43
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,820
extreme pain.

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:24,913
What happened to you?

45
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:25,590
What,

46
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,000
what were you suffering from?

47
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:27,841
Well,

48
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:28,740
we figured it out.

49
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:28,951
I mean,

50
00:01:28,951 --> 00:01:31,710
I figured it out on my own and
then taught my doctor about it.

51
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:33,420
It's called chronic fatigue syndrome.

52
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:38,010
It's better sometimes known as Myalgic
encephalomyelitis and nobody knows what

53
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:38,671
causes it.

54
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,960
But in 1988,

55
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,630
I really have been working on my book,

56
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,850
um,

57
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,560
for a long enough to have fifth to
first 15 chapters of my first book.

58
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,960
I really wanted to get out of publicity.

59
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:53,330
There's no way I could've
because I was a legend.

60
00:01:53,331 --> 00:01:53,601
I mean,

61
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:58,220
the billboard guy to music publicity
had 20 pages of nothing but me.

62
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,593
MMM.

63
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,823
So yeah,

64
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,091
you know,

65
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:05,110
your wife is not going to let
you out of a successful career.

66
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,500
And if she's,

67
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,950
she doesn't want to lose the money,

68
00:02:07,951 --> 00:02:09,480
she doesn't want to lose the status.

69
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:10,360
Um,

70
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,860
and all of a sudden wank.

71
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,770
I didn't know what was happening to me.

72
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:16,590
It was 90 degrees out and I'd
be freezing and shivering.

73
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,370
Um,

74
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,010
it was 40 degrees out and
I would be overheated.

75
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,173
Um,

76
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,031
I was,

77
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:23,470
I was losing strengths.

78
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:25,300
I was losing the strength
to pick up coach.

79
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,050
Hmm.

80
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:26,883
MMM.

81
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,310
And I had no idea of what was happening.

82
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:32,550
And I went to doctors and the doctors
had no idea of what was happening.

83
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:34,230
And I walked into my office one day,

84
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,280
it was the biggest PR firm in the
music industry and said to my staff,

85
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,480
I don't know what's happening.

86
00:02:40,481 --> 00:02:41,380
I could be dying,

87
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,660
but I'm going to be out of here in two
weeks and I'm giving you the business.

88
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,600
And the next day,

89
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:51,040
a competitor from the west coast called
and offered me a huge amount of money

90
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:51,874
for the business.

91
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,871
And I said,

92
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:53,830
I cannot sell it to you.

93
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:57,040
I just gave it to my staff yesterday
because my word is my bond.

94
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,150
And,

95
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:58,720
um,

96
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,610
I kept trying to,

97
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,590
struggling to try to do normal things.

98
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,701
Leon Uris.

99
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:06,430
When I finished my
manuscript of the first book,

100
00:03:06,431 --> 00:03:09,880
the Lucifer principle of scientific
expedition into the forces of history,

101
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,980
I got a copy to Leon Uris,

102
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:16,981
the novelist and Leon Uris read it and
called on a Sunday night and raved about

103
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,490
it for half an hour.

104
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,540
Um,

105
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,580
so I tried to get it
to New York to see him,

106
00:03:21,581 --> 00:03:22,414
but I had a rent.

107
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:23,693
Are you ready for this?

108
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,060
Cause I couldn't afford this.

109
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:30,330
I had a rental Lilo so I could lay
down in the back seat all the way into

110
00:03:30,461 --> 00:03:35,461
Manhattan to see Leon and then lay
down in the back seat all the way home.

111
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,520
That's not the world's most
glamorous limousine story.

112
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,000
Now it's not at all the world's
most glamorous limousines for any.

113
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:46,210
Eventually I learned I couldn't even do
that and eventually it became too weak

114
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:50,260
to even try because I was just lucky
to be able to get to my bathroom.

115
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,410
But if I tried to get to my
kitchen and extra 10 steps away,

116
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,280
no,

117
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,070
my body wouldn't let me do it.

118
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:59,980
And one of the lessons I
learned in my childhood,

119
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:00,251
again,

120
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:01,600
when I was 16 years old,

121
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,180
poetry was extremely important to me.

122
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,520
And I learned a lesson from two poets.

123
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,820
One was at the Saint Vincent Millay
and her poem Renascence said to see the

124
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:13,570
infinite and the tiniest of things,

125
00:04:13,571 --> 00:04:15,940
which was definitely a goal on my list.

126
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,650
You have to be able to comprehend the
suffering of every human on the face of

127
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:23,380
this planet under every
extreme circumstance.

128
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,880
And I expanded that to mean you have
to come to understand not just the

129
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:28,451
suffering,

130
00:04:28,451 --> 00:04:33,310
but the point of view of everyone who
comes from a culture that's so foreign

131
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:36,520
tiers that it seems like
was from another planet.

132
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,780
So this was what,

133
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,900
what Edna Saint Vincent Millay was
telling me was 15 years of absolute and

134
00:04:44,801 --> 00:04:49,801
unbelievable punishment is an advantage
and it will serve you well for the rest

135
00:04:49,901 --> 00:04:50,350
of your life.
