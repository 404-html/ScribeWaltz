1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,430
So,
and I also think,

2
00:00:10,431 --> 00:00:14,210
and I think this is laid out very
thoroughly in the biblical stories as

3
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:17,240
well,
is that if there are enough people who

4
00:00:17,241 --> 00:00:21,080
are admirable,
then things work and if there aren't and

5
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:24,500
things,
things are terrible,

6
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,010
you get wiped out.
You remember when Abraham is bargaining

7
00:00:28,011 --> 00:00:31,520
with God with regards to Sodom and
Gomorrah,

8
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,100
he asks God to save the city.
If there's like 40 admirable people,

9
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:38,390
right?
Respectable,

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,770
let's say admirable,
right?

11
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:42,110
I don't want it,
I don't want to say good because good is

12
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,780
being corrupted in some sense.
By casual usage.

13
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,840
I mean admirable noble people,
right?

14
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,900
Yeah.
I think Abraham bargains God down to

15
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:52,970
like 10 if there's 10 of them in the
city,

16
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,940
the city won't be destroyed.
And that,

17
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:58,010
that's not very many in this city.
So there's an interesting idea there,

18
00:00:58,011 --> 00:01:00,830
which is the there.
There doesn't have to be that many

19
00:01:00,831 --> 00:01:03,170
people in a group who have their act
together,

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,420
but zero is the wrong number.

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,400
And if it's zero then then we're
seriously in trouble.

22
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,330
And I think that goes along with the
idea of the pareto principle in

23
00:01:14,331 --> 00:01:16,820
economics too,
which is that it's a small minority of

24
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:19,550
people who do most of the productive
work in any given domain.

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,730
But so,
so a small number of,

26
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,750
of properly behaving people might have
enough of an impact to keep everything

27
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,950
moving.
And that might also,

28
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:31,160
they might actually be true,
but it can't fall below some crucial

29
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:33,830
level.
And I do think that we're in some danger

30
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:37,700
of allowing it to fall below some
crucial level because our society seems

31
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:42,701
to be at war in some ways against the
idea of the individual and individual

32
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:47,390
character per se.
And I think that's absolutely right.
