1
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:08,900
So this is a big deal that this,

2
00:00:08,901 --> 00:00:09,800
that this happens.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:14,900
Now I want to tell you a little bit about
the idea of the pillar because it's,

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:19,950
it's an unbelievably deep idea and it
orients us in ways that we still don't,

5
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,400
it's still orients us in ways
that we don't understand.

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:26,750
And in fact,

7
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:30,680
it's actually the mechanism
by which we're oriented or,

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,090
and if it's lacking,

9
00:00:32,091 --> 00:00:33,770
then we become disoriented.

10
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:36,770
And so I'll show you some
pictures and describe them first.

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:37,251
Okay.

12
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,084
So first of all,

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,100
there's a walled city.

14
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:41,001
So let,

15
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:44,600
let me tell you that you could think
about that as an archetypical human

16
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:45,434
habitation.

17
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,620
Maybe it's a reflection of something
like a fire in the middle of the plane or

18
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:53,510
the forest or the jungle for that matter.

19
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,250
Although it's kind of hard
to get a fire going there,

20
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:57,410
nudge in a fire,

21
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:01,220
ringed round with logs and perhaps
ringed around with dwellings,

22
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:01,460
right?

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,850
So the fires in the center and
the fire defines the center.

24
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:06,920
And then as you move away from the fire,

25
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:08,330
you move out into the darkness,

26
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:08,571
right?

27
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:12,980
So the fire is light and
communion and safety.

28
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,570
And as you move away from the fire,

29
00:01:14,571 --> 00:01:18,860
you move out into the darkness and what's
terrifying out beyond the perimeter.

30
00:01:18,861 --> 00:01:20,720
So what's beyond the
perimeter is terrifying.

31
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:23,660
You can feel that if you go
camping somewhere that's wild,

32
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,100
you know you're pretty damn happy.

33
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:26,480
Especially if the wolves are howling,

34
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,550
you're pretty damn happy to be sitting
by the fire because you can see there the

35
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,080
fire keeps the animals away.

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,680
And you know if you do
wander into the bush,

37
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:37,610
into the darkness,

38
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:42,530
then you're on alert and you know your
Predator detection systems are on alert.

39
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,800
And so you could think about the
classical human habitation as two places,

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:52,880
one where your Predator detection system
isn't on alert and another where your

41
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:55,790
Predator tech detection
system is alert on alert.

42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,870
And you could think about that roughly
as the distinction between explored

43
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:02,390
territory and unexplored territory.

44
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,710
And really the,

45
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,800
the founding of a place is precisely,

46
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:09,460
this is a lot of this I got
from reading your Eliana,

47
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:15,010
the founding of a place is precisely the
definition of a UN explored center set

48
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:18,500
against the unexplored periphery.

49
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,750
And you know what's
interesting about that?

50
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:23,570
So you can kind of think about that
with regards to the walled city,

51
00:02:23,571 --> 00:02:23,990
right?

52
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:28,990
Everything in the wall is cosmos and
everything outside the wall is chaos and

53
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:32,001
you know,

54
00:02:32,001 --> 00:02:36,710
but it also extends to the conceptual
realm because imagine that you're the

55
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,810
master of a field of study.

56
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:43,130
And so that's an interesting metaphor
because the field is that a geographical

57
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:43,701
metaphor,

58
00:02:43,701 --> 00:02:44,360
right?

59
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:49,010
And if in the center of the field are
those things that everyone knows really

60
00:02:49,011 --> 00:02:49,670
well,

61
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:53,630
the axioms that everyone
abides by in the field.

62
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,760
And then as you move towards the fringes,

63
00:02:55,761 --> 00:02:57,890
you get towards towards the unknown,

64
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,490
towards the frontier of the discipline.

65
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:02,710
And as you become expert,

66
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,720
you move from the center to the frontier.

67
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,100
And so then you're on the border.

68
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,660
When you're,

69
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,230
when you're,

70
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:09,310
when you're a scholar,

71
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,450
a competence call,

72
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:15,370
you're on the border between the
unexplored or the explored an unexplored,

73
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,230
and you're trying to further that border.

74
00:03:17,231 --> 00:03:19,390
So even if you're just
doing this abstractly,

75
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,860
it's the same thing.

76
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,930
And it's a reflection of the fact
that every human environment,

77
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,010
concrete or abstract,

78
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:29,080
it makes no difference.

79
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:34,710
Recapitulates the cosmos chaos
dichotomy or the order chaos dichotomy.

80
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,130
And that's why endow isn't,

81
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,003
for example,

82
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,360
it's the union of chaos and order that
constitutes being itself and that you

83
00:03:43,361 --> 00:03:47,740
stand on the border between chaos and
order because that's the proper place to

84
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:49,240
be too orderly,

85
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,280
too much in the explored.

86
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,450
You're not learning anything too much
out there where the predators lurk,

87
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,280
then you're frozen with terror.

88
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,760
And neither of those
positions are desirable.

89
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,253
So,

90
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,520
and that's what you know.

91
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,600
And so you think,

92
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,680
and this is a concrete reality obviously
as well as a psychological reality,

93
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,900
there were reasons for those walls,

94
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:11,981
right?

95
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:15,700
Because inside the walls
were all the people like us.

96
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,530
And so that begs the question,

97
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:19,900
what does it mean for
people to be like us?

98
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,030
And then outside the wall of the rows,

99
00:04:22,031 --> 00:04:23,320
all those people,

100
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,790
because they were the worst forms of
predators because people are actually the

101
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:31,240
worst forms of predators
who aren't like us.

102
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:36,610
And the wall is there to
draw a distinction between
like us and not like us.

103
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,781
And so,

104
00:04:37,781 --> 00:04:39,490
and that was a matter of life and death.

105
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,620
You can tell that because I mean,

106
00:04:41,621 --> 00:04:42,820
look at those walls.

107
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,530
They had to build those by hand.

108
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,281
And you know,

109
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:49,060
you do see walled cities that
have three rings of walls.

110
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,550
So these people were terrified,

111
00:04:51,551 --> 00:04:55,030
but not so terrified as the
people who built three walls.

112
00:04:55,031 --> 00:04:58,180
They were really terrified
and they had their reasons.
