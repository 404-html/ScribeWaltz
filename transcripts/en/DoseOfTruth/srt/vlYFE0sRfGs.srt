1
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:11,730
The player formerly known as most cops is.

2
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:14,460
What do you think the role of the
psychedelics will be in the future?

3
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:18,780
Marijuana will most likely be somewhat
legal everywhere in the u s and this may

4
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:20,160
push someone to try stronger.

5
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:20,881
Psychedelics.

6
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:21,720
Is this bad?

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,310
Let's start with the first one.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,040
I have no idea what the role was.

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,580
Psychedelics will be in the future.

10
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,770
I know that the FDA just cleared ecstasy
for use for pro post traumatic stress

11
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:32,490
disorder.

12
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,720
So that's very interesting.

13
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:37,170
I know there's some very interesting
work being done at Johns Hopkins on

14
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:38,250
silicide mushrooms,

15
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:40,350
which seemed to be very
effective for example,

16
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:41,820
in helping people stop smoking.

17
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,840
I think that we don't know
anything about psychedelics at all.

18
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:49,530
I mean we know that they seem to have
an effect on the serotonin system,

19
00:00:49,531 --> 00:00:51,710
but that's a pretty broad brush stroke.

20
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,560
Um,

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,250
I think there incalculably um,

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,710
peculiar and that they reveal things
about the structure of the world that we

23
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,700
are beyond ignorant about beyond ignorant.

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,070
But I have no idea what role
they'll play in the future.

25
00:01:08,071 --> 00:01:10,500
I don't know what to think
about psychedelics at all.

26
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:11,880
Um,

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,480
marijuana will most likely be somewhat
legal everywhere in the u s and this may

28
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,400
push some to try stronger psychedelics.

29
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,234
Is this bad?

30
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:20,670
I suppose it depends on how they're used,

31
00:01:20,671 --> 00:01:22,770
whether or not it's bad
and what the intent is.

32
00:01:22,771 --> 00:01:25,080
I think there are very bad party drugs.

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,390
Psychedelics aren't,

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,130
aren't for fun.

35
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:31,890
I don't think that that's the
right way to use them at all.

36
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:36,330
I think they need to be used seriously
and they need to be used in a manner

37
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:40,440
that's life affirming and they need to
be used in a manner that's commensurate

38
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:44,430
with genuine exploration and they need
to be used carefully or they can cause a

39
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:45,330
lot of trouble.

40
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,550
So Carl Jung said,

41
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,590
beware of unearned wisdom.

42
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:51,180
And I think that's very wise.

43
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,080
So,

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,913
um,

45
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:53,761
anyways,

46
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:58,470
I hope that we continue investigating
them scientifically because there's much

47
00:01:58,471 --> 00:02:02,940
to be learned there much more than we
can imagine as far as I'm concerned.
