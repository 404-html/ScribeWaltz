1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,380
Jesus christ founded his
religion within an empire.

2
00:00:10,381 --> 00:00:15,381
The Roman empire existed before and what
he was talking about was all religion.

3
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:18,460
Where as Mohammad on
the phone did an empire,

4
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:19,733
we forget.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:20,311
Yes.

6
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:20,611
Right.

7
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:22,170
That's a very important distinction.

8
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:23,131
I mean it really,

9
00:00:23,131 --> 00:00:26,880
and it made might be the crucial
distinction sort of speak the crucial

10
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:27,340
distinction.

11
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,840
Yeah.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,840
And there was this empire and this empire
bows and decline and fell and those

13
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:35,190
who feel that they have
inherited that legacy,

14
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,460
they want to go back to
the days of [inaudible].

15
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:38,640
Yeah.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,640
Go back to the days when his loud voice
to previous and they want to do this in

17
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,660
the 21st century.

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,073
Yeah.

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,010
All kinds.

20
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,010
It's not just that you called camp on
horseback and invade an existing empire.

21
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:54,880
The Byzantine like

22
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,770
easy and empires.

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:58,981
This,

24
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:01,110
he took off and you could
just take things off.

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,280
It's not like that,

26
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,413
but they're driven.

27
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:04,903
They're convinced.

28
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,430
They have this legacy and
they're not afraid of death.

29
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,680
And how is key because,

30
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,140
and here's why I keep going back to Dow.

31
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:18,360
All Muslim children learn that
life on this as this temple.

32
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,310
Yes.

33
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,143
As your tree.

34
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,120
And that there is something
in the here then this,

35
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:25,070
there's no point in investing
in this life except in,

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,200
and they just started that.

37
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,780
So for the Medina Muslims,

38
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,030
it really becomes easy to recruit
and inspire into their parents.

39
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,060
Muslims who have already been taught
that if they've only got to work for the

40
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,730
hereafter problems with Islam.

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:42,860
And I think it was,

42
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,000
we understand that of course,

43
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,230
the basic LMS,

44
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,600
Mohammed Straw,

45
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:49,610
all of the Koran,

46
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,210
the fall of the he after all of
these things and what should it mean?

47
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,290
And then it gets to the Dow accounts.

48
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,570
This is how they manage
to teach young people.

49
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:04,320
How do they manage the teachable for
these thousands and millions of people who

50
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:07,050
is subsidizing these
countries like Saudi Arabia,

51
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,820
Qatar.

52
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,430
We understand that.

53
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,400
I think it makes our job
as westerners western last,

54
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,700
whatever's easiest.
