1
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,780
Please tell us about your ideas of the
problem of gender integrated combat units

2
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:20,010
and how it affects morale.

3
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:24,840
Please talk about the rule trans people
should or should not serve in combat

4
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:25,674
units.

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:26,933
Huh.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,080
Well,

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:28,441
you know,

8
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,274
I wouldn't say that

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,210
exactly an expert in that regard.

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,603
Um,

11
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,330
I don't know how gender

12
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:41,221
power,

13
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:43,860
multiple gendered combat
units are going to work.

14
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:44,730
My,

15
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,540
because I'm fundamentally a
traditionalist in most ways,

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,830
mostly because I'm afraid of the
unintended consequences of radical change.

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:58,110
I would say that it's dangerous to adjust
a system that's working and it's very

18
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,510
hard for me to imagine a situation,

19
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,050
especially in a combat situation where
the women and men can actually be treated

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,490
equally.

21
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:11,850
I don't think that the broader
society would even want to see that.

22
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,660
I mean,

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,850
I suppose there are exceptions
to that sort of thing,

24
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:15,320
like,

25
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,050
like,

26
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:16,883
um,

27
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,930
the situation perhaps in Israel,

28
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,460
although I suspect even in Israel
that the women take the more,

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,580
the less combat heavy jobs.

30
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:27,060
No,

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,910
I don't know that,

32
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,050
but maybe I'm just being
prejudiced in that answer,

33
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:31,884
but

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:39,790
it just doesn't seem to
me to be a very wise idea.

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,450
Um,

36
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,730
what role trans people should serve.

37
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,020
I really can't say.

38
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:45,640
I don't have anything,

39
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,070
any advice about that.

40
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,483
I'm just not

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,730
informed enough to make,

42
00:01:51,731 --> 00:01:52,450
uh,

43
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,283
uh,

44
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:53,960
uh,

45
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,000
a conclusion about that.

46
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,950
I think it's very strange.

47
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,784
However,

48
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:02,200
I've talked to some people in the Canadian
armed forces and in recent months,

49
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:07,201
and I do think it's very strange that
this is the sort of problem that our

50
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:09,260
military is actually trying to solve for.

51
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:13,480
You think that there would be more
important things to concentrate on them?

52
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,640
Rapid Gender,

53
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:16,823
um,

54
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,790
equalization in the military.

55
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,510
I just don't see why
that's such a priority,

56
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,380
but maybe that's just my old
fashioned conservatism speaking.

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,750
It could be,

58
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:31,390
it could be that right.
