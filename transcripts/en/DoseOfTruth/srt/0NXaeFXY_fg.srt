1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,050
I
don't know what to do

2
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,490
stupid things that you're doing and
that's a good start because it starts to

3
00:00:19,531 --> 00:00:21,410
clear your,
so if you,

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:26,580
if you don't know what to do but you do
know that you're doing things that maybe

5
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,620
regret,
you could start by just eliminating it

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,240
slowly to the basket of your
started to become ethical rules.

7
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,690
Seven ethical rules with any live
long enough,

8
00:00:45,691 --> 00:00:49,440
then you'll get this,
but we have a clear vision and then you

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,500
might be received the way forward more.
You might see a way forward for more

10
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,620
intensity rather than merely what you
should avoid.

11
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,680
So that's a good initial practical issue
is because everyone knows perfectly well

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,500
that there were things you were doing.
You know you shouldn't do it,

13
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:09,570
but you don't stop.

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,270
Start stopping
because that's part of this idea about

15
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:21,750
putting your house in perfect order
before you criticize the world because

16
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,960
there's a question.
It's always open and that was the

17
00:01:24,961 --> 00:01:25,980
question,
so to speak,

18
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,890
that God placed in front of me is like,
well,

19
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:30,650
how do you get on the road?
Would be a terrible place.

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,380
He weren't such a wretched thing.
Maybe it wouldn't be.

21
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,531
You might say,
well,

22
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:38,670
that's very casual answer.
What would you say?

23
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:42,060
The people who has a parent who's dying
of Alzheimer's disease for example,

24
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,820
it's like whether they're going to get
their act together and fix that.

25
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:47,730
It's like it would make it a hell of a
lot better than it would be.

26
00:01:47,731 --> 00:01:49,380
Otherwise.
I can tell you that,

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,590
and that's something because it's nice
to have someone who's dead and your

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,540
family without having a credit of
unnecessary pathology.

29
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,230
Gather around that and make something
that could be nearly tragic into

30
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:06,231
something that sounds right and that
happens to people all the time and so

31
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,480
even if it's not a perfect solution is
the best solution that you have and then

32
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:17,100
the next part that is when I suggest to
people that they do the future authoring

33
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:18,650
program and they're.

34
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,900
They're leery about doing it.
I asked them to do that because a bad

35
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:31,260
headline is way better than no plan
because if you implemented that plan,

36
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,280
then you learn why that plan.
Exactly.

37
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:38,850
Not Hypothetically,
but exactly in the world and then in the

38
00:02:38,851 --> 00:02:42,860
news that information above your failure
to retool.

39
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,950
A better plan and so to be able to
manage,

40
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,840
if you're tracking a destination that's
moving,

41
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:52,030
it's some kind of ideal you,
your vision is blurry,

42
00:02:52,031 --> 00:02:55,110
you don't know where to look and so
you're going to go this way and then you

43
00:02:55,111 --> 00:02:58,200
can go this way,
but if you keep doing that,

44
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:03,201
then the deviations from the right path
to decrease with time and eventually

45
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:07,090
you'll be walking forward in an
efficient manner and you might have to

46
00:03:07,091 --> 00:03:09,700
be all sorts of errors before you
managed that,

47
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,970
but I've watched people long enough in
my clinical practice to know that

48
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,960
waiting for Godot was a very bad idea
and not employee.

49
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,140
That is a very bad idea.
It's like implementing the best plan to

50
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:25,150
have a camp
and learn from her and that works and

51
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,040
you get sharper at making your planners
and then the other thing that we do in

52
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:31,470
the future authoring program,
the school,

53
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:35,560
we asked people,
well maybe you can decide what your

54
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:39,690
passion for your calling you should be.
That's a pretty global question,

55
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,140
but you might ask yourself some
questions like,

56
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,920
well,
is there something you could do to

57
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:50,020
improve your interpretation ship?
One thing,

58
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:53,380
is there a way that you can improve your
friendships?

59
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:57,160
Is there something you can do at your
job that will make it better than it is

60
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,670
now?
Even if it's something you preventable?

61
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,150
Could you do something more productive
and meaningful with your time outside of

62
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:07,210
work?
Could you be slightly better handling

63
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,530
temptations that come your way?
Could you take care of yourself?

64
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,980
Something like better mentally and
physically and you know the answer is

65
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:17,020
all of those questions is Jennifer.
Yes,

66
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:21,520
and then you can even ask yourself a
simpler question which would be,

67
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:24,160
oh,
if there is something that you could do

68
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,760
that would make one of those things
married,

69
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:30,930
is there also something that you would
do and you can ask yourself that you

70
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:34,210
know instead of telling themselves that
you should,

71
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,940
which isn't the same thing might say,
well,

72
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,330
I would like my marriage to be better.
You can ask yourself,

73
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:41,680
well,
how can my marriage be better?

74
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,970
And you'll get a bunch of answers and
most of them you will,

75
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,620
because if you really ask myself a
question like that,

76
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,100
the part of their brain that's imagined
and it's looking for new answers will

77
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:54,490
tell you and it looks like a bunch of
things you don't want to hear at.

78
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:57,790
A lot of them will be things you already
know and some of them will be things

79
00:04:57,791 --> 00:05:00,910
that there's just no damn way they'll
give you know that you should,

80
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,290
but some subset of those might be things
that you should do that by your own

81
00:05:05,291 --> 00:05:10,291
definition that you actually would do.
It might be trivial things in or hooked

82
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,670
trivial,
but at least they're a step in the right

83
00:05:12,671 --> 00:05:16,090
direction.
So take whatever step in the right

84
00:05:16,091 --> 00:05:20,440
direction.
You're willing to take day by day and

85
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:24,360
that's incremental progress and it'll.
It'll spiral upward.

86
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,400
It does spiral up,
or there's a statement in the New

87
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,720
Testament,
which actually happens to be a true

88
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:31,690
statement,
which is to those who have everything

89
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:36,691
more will be given and it's a reflection
mind phenomena that looks like

90
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,540
phenomenon that looks like a natural
laws.

91
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:44,470
As things start to accrue to you,
the rate at which they will further

92
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:46,300
approved will increase.

93
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:49,810
That's a natural logs.
Price's law sometimes with the court

94
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,100
parade reflect greater distribution,
so there's a chapter in 12 rolls,

95
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,830
life called don't compare yourself.
Compare yourself to who you were

96
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,590
yesterday,
not to someone else's today,

97
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,050
and it's in conjunction for incremental
improvement.

98
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,180
If you don't know where to go in your
life,

99
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:12,050
think about where you are and see if
today you could make where are you,

100
00:06:12,051 --> 00:06:16,370
are somewhat better on some dimension so
that when you go to bed at night,

101
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,310
you're not as wretched as you were when
you woke up in the morning,

102
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,960
and so if you do that for two years,
it was one thing a day,

103
00:06:23,961 --> 00:06:26,560
just a small thing,
something you could actually do that you

104
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:29,780
would do,
then your life will be waived it and at

105
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,230
the end of that you might have enough
clarity of mind to start to understand

106
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,830
where you go if things worked out for
you properly in the world.

107
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,150
So that's the answer.
That question.

108
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,520
Thank you.
All right.

109
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,280
Here's another way that you figure out
how to act.

110
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:06,510
Let's say your child and there's a lot
you don't know almost everyone,

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,270
so how do you handle that?
Will you stay in a simplified

112
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,910
environment,
right?

113
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,970
You don't crawl out onto the street with
your 10 months old.

114
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:21,050
Parents aren't allowed to do that.
They keep you in a bounded did and they

115
00:07:21,051 --> 00:07:26,051
keep you close to them and what you do
is backed up what you know isn't very

116
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:32,060
much most based on things in your mouth
and investigate them because that's what

117
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:37,090
kids do at the smiling play,
that it's a fragile space of knowledge

118
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,800
and it's easily when it's disrupted,
you cry and not signal of disruption and

119
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:49,850
then your parents move in with greater
knowledge and they fix whatever the

120
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:54,370
problem is and what you do.
As you watched that and then you have a

121
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:55,204
job.

122
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:58,370
It's not like you don't let the rep
count because you're not sophisticated

123
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,310
enough to know what they're up to.
No child childhood give a full account

124
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:04,570
with the behavior of their parents.
Know parents will give a full account of

125
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,000
her own beginning,
so you certainly can't expect that from

126
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:09,800
a child,
but children are obviously grow up to

127
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:13,950
take care of their own children,
just like image to take care of their

128
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:16,880
own offspring,
never knowing what they're doing.

129
00:08:16,881 --> 00:08:18,890
Exactly.
So you learned about your invitation.

130
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,940
Now what that means is that collectively
we faced things that we didn't

131
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:29,530
understand for very,
very long period of time and we've

132
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,810
figured out how to act so that it works
out.

133
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,000
We don't know.
We don't know the rules that underlie

134
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:38,300
that exotic.
We don't know exactly what that means.

135
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:42,410
We just figured it out.
So there's A.

136
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:44,180
There's a way of being a good father.

137
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:48,770
Let's say there's a way of being a good
mother and mostly you understand what

138
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:52,220
that is.
When you fail or when your child accuses

139
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,710
you of failing gap,
right?

140
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,820
Because it's only in the failure,
but you realized that you deviate for

141
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,610
whatever the ideal is because you're
not.

142
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,220
Who the hell knows what the rules are
for being a good father?

143
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:05,730
It's very difficult to detail though,
but you know when you've failed.

144
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,430
Okay,
so you know how to be a control and you

145
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,250
know that because you invitation to your
father,

146
