1
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,013
Right.

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:12,550
Speaking of the universities though,

3
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:16,390
I have to talk about high schools for
a minute because following her event,

4
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,320
I find it interesting actually
before the event and post the event,

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:23,860
the most emails I've gotten are
all from high school teachers,

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,420
couple from elementary,

7
00:00:25,421 --> 00:00:26,650
but mostly high school teachers.

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,570
And the tone of these emails
is borderline desperate.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,650
They are absolutely losing their minds
because they feel that they are being

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
compelled to indoctrinate a youth
into this type of radical Marxist

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,110
postmodernist thinking.

12
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,750
And even though they don't agree with it,

13
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,630
they see the flaws in
it and many flaws in it.

14
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:51,850
They don't feel they have a voice.

15
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,360
We just are afraid to speak up
the letters from teachers too.

16
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,400
They're unionized,

17
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,450
which is interesting why
they feel so terrified,

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,550
but they,

19
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:00,850
they really feel,

20
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:04,630
they're sort of feeling like this horrible
guilt that you're teaching students

21
00:01:04,631 --> 00:01:05,021
what they know.

22
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:05,920
They shouldn't be teaching them,

23
00:01:05,921 --> 00:01:09,430
but they don't have any choice but to
teach it and they think that it's gotten

24
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:10,750
worse with the wind government.

25
00:01:10,751 --> 00:01:11,620
What's your sense?

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,121
Well,

27
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:12,601
first of all,

28
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,830
you always have a choice,

29
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,873
right?

30
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:15,600
So,

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,320
you know,

32
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,320
and the choice might be to stick your
neck out and risk and risk being targeted.

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,000
My experience has basically been as
if you could withstand that and not

34
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:27,930
apologize,

35
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,940
um,

36
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:30,900
and not backtrack,

37
00:01:30,901 --> 00:01:31,734
then you can,

38
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,940
you can weather the storm.

39
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,060
So that's a good thing
that people should know.

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,130
I think the wind government isn't
absolutely reprehensible administration.

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,100
It's my fervent with wish that there
isn't a single provincial liberal left in

42
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,810
office after the next election.

43
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:49,950
I think.

44
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,480
I don't think she's a liberal at all.

45
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:54,270
I think she's far left
of where the NDP was,

46
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:55,710
say back in the 1970s.

47
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,160
Yes.

48
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,570
Working Class Organization,

49
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,940
I think she's apart from
financially reckless.

50
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:03,870
Um,

51
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:04,703
she's,

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,693
she's,

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,670
she's dangerous in about
six different dimensions.

54
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,580
I think the Ontario human rights
commission should be strapped.

55
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,590
Scrapped along with all of strapped.

56
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:13,970
Yeah.

57
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,803
Yeah.

58
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:18,930
Scrapped along with the
social justice tribunals.

59
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:19,764
There's all sorts of,

60
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,980
I think the legislation that forced the
universities to put these quasi judicial

61
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,790
inquisitions in place.

62
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,450
Like the one that raped Lizzy
shepherd over the coal should be,

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,750
um,

64
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:32,880
should be rescinded.

65
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:34,283
Uh,

66
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,370
and I do also agree with
your initial proposition,

67
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:43,371
which is that the l the public school
system is actually in worse shape than the

68
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:45,420
universities and it's getting worse.

69
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,510
It's getting worse than it
is extraordinarily rapidly.

70
00:02:48,511 --> 00:02:53,511
If you go online to the Elementary
Teachers Federation of Ontario website and

71
00:02:54,151 --> 00:02:58,740
read their plans for
curriculum development there
basically they basically state

72
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,400
forthrightly,

73
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:01,600
um,

74
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,050
that they're attempting to indoctrinate.

75
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,400
They don't use that word.

76
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,320
Students from kindergarten to grade
eight into the social justice ideology.

77
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:11,980
That's,

78
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,420
that's the purpose of education as far
as they're concerned to rectify the sins

79
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:18,490
of the past and to bring about equity,

80
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,720
which is of course equity is a,

81
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,470
anybody who talks to you about equity,

82
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:26,740
you should immediately run away
from because they're very dangerous,

83
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,670
ignorant,

84
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,710
historically ignorant
and dangerous people.

85
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:29,981
Yeah,

86
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:30,580
it's,

87
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:31,413
it's appalling.

88
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:33,340
I'm going to make a video
for high school kids.

89
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:36,820
I'm going to tell them one of the things
I would recommend to high school kids

90
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:39,640
is that as soon as the teacher
talks to them about diversity,

91
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,620
equity and inclusiveness,

92
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:42,911
diversity,

93
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:44,110
inclusiveness and equity.

94
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:49,111
So that's an acronym that spells die
or white privilege that they should

95
00:03:49,571 --> 00:03:50,950
immediately leave the room.
