1
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,270
Listen carefully to
your teen and a lecture,

2
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:13,270
but waves of contempt
for existence itself.

3
00:00:13,271 --> 00:00:13,540
Teak.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:18,070
Tell me there's a part of me that
rebels and riding these waves waves,

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,460
but can I harness them for good God,

6
00:00:21,461 --> 00:00:21,971
you guys,

7
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:23,620
you ask the hardest questions.

8
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:28,030
Waves of contempt of exists
for existence itself.

9
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:28,864
Keep coming.

10
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:36,931
Well,

11
00:00:36,931 --> 00:00:38,520
I guess what I would say is

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,500
it's probably time for a little bit of
individual psychoanalysis and I don't

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:53,470
necessarily mean that you have
to go and find a therapist.

14
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:54,304
I would say

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,020
you're generalizing,

16
00:00:58,021 --> 00:00:58,410
you know,

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,650
you say waves of contempt for
existence itself keep coming,

18
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:05,670
but I don't believe that that's exactly
right and I'm certainly not accusing you

19
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:06,570
of being deceitful.

20
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,230
It's,

21
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,790
it's more like low resolution.

22
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,640
My suspicions are is that there's a set
of experiences that you've had that are

23
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,740
characteristic to your own personal life,

24
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:19,170
that have caused you to do,

25
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,120
caused you some bitterness and some
resentment and that those haven't been

26
00:01:24,121 --> 00:01:24,900
thought through.

27
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,490
And usually thinking through
means at least in some part,

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,190
trying to take as much
responsibility for those,

29
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,300
for altering the conditions under which
those things happen going forward into

30
00:01:36,301 --> 00:01:37,500
the future as possible.

31
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,240
Like the purpose of memory is to stop
you from doing the same stupid things in

32
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:42,780
the future,

33
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:43,260
right?

34
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,310
That that's the purpose.

35
00:01:44,311 --> 00:01:49,170
And so if you've had experiences that
have made you bitter and resentful or are

36
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,870
still engaged in experiences
that are doing that,

37
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:56,010
then you need to do a careful micro
analysis of what those are and see if you

38
00:01:56,011 --> 00:01:59,190
can see if you can flip your
attitude in some matter.

39
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,053
You know,

40
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,410
I'm not saying this is easy,

41
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,700
but the first thing you can do is at
least figure out what those memories are.

42
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:10,701
And I might recommend trying to past
Autherine program because what the past

43
00:02:11,671 --> 00:02:16,320
offering program does is ask you to
break your life up into six he parks and

44
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:21,321
then to identify the
emotionally significant
occurrences during each of those

45
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:22,021
epochs.

46
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:26,370
And you can kind of tell if something
needs work from a memory perspective,

47
00:02:26,371 --> 00:02:26,790
if,

48
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,250
if it occurred more than
about 18 months ago.

49
00:02:29,251 --> 00:02:30,960
And when you remember it,

50
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:35,760
it still causes like a wave of sadness
or anger or really any kind of negative

51
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:39,930
emotion because what that means is
that your brain is still targeting that

52
00:02:39,931 --> 00:02:44,931
experience as threatening and unexplored
and what that means is that in some

53
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:45,541
sense,

54
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,590
part of you or a part of the that could
exist is still stuck in that memory

55
00:02:49,591 --> 00:02:54,591
because you can go back and do a careful
causal analysis of the events that led

56
00:02:55,051 --> 00:03:00,051
up to the unfortunate circumstance
and try to map out your role.

57
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,470
Even if your role is minor,

58
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,890
there's going to be things that you could
have done differently to avoid it and

59
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:07,690
that's what you need to
figure out for the future.

60
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,910
I would say you try to shed
all your personal resentment.

61
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,780
A part of that too is to not
not take things too personally.

62
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,081
You know,

63
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:21,490
like one of the advantages of developing
what I would regard as a mythologically

64
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:25,000
centered view of the cosmos
is that you understand that

65
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,660
the reason there's,

66
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,880
there's nothing personal about the fact
that terrible things happen to you.

67
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:31,121
I mean,

68
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:34,510
unless you're directly causally
involved as as it says,

69
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,220
I believe in the Old Testament rains
on the just and the unjust delight.

70
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:39,490
And you know,

71
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,420
there there are,

72
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,370
this is an existentialist motif.

73
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:47,470
The tragedy and difficulty and even the
confrontation with evil are built into

74
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:48,850
the structure of existence.

75
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:52,010
And it's not aimed at
you personally and it,

76
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,051
well,

77
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:53,621
as I said,

78
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:56,290
it may be the price that we
pay for existence itself.

79
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,161
You could say,

80
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:58,990
well that price is too high to pay,

81
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,930
but well,

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:01,833
as I mentioned,

83
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,190
if you start taking that way,

84
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:04,330
then you make everything much,

85
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,164
much worse.

86
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,530
It seems better to shoulder you're cross
voluntarily and stumble forward towards

87
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:12,010
the light.

88
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,820
That's,

89
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,140
that's the best strategy.

90
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:17,420
And I would say that that just
because it's the best strategy,

91
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,020
it doesn't even necessarily mean
that it's always going to work.

92
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:24,580
Like this is no optimistic scenario
like a dragon fight is no optimistic

93
00:04:24,581 --> 00:04:25,414
scenario.

94
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,500
Confront the dragon and get the gold and
get the girl and bring it back to co to

95
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,520
share it with the community,

96
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:31,354
the gold.

97
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,400
And you know,

98
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,630
that sounds all well and good,

99
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:37,510
but after all it is a dragon and
many people get eaten by them.

100
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,261
So,

101
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:40,630
but the myth basically says,

102
00:04:40,631 --> 00:04:40,841
well,

103
00:04:40,841 --> 00:04:45,670
your best bet is to open your eyes
and speak the truth and look forward

104
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:48,550
forthright and confront
the things that are,

105
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,540
um,

106
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,500
the hydrants that are raising their
heads in their tentacles constantly to

107
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,500
frighten you and stop you
and to fight the tyranny of,

108
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,490
of,

109
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,390
of the social structure when,

110
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,270
when it's oppressing you unduly.

111
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,643
And,

112
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,880
and that's,

113
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,500
and that's what you have to do.

114
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,460
But I would say if,

115
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,340
if that contempt is their mountain,

116
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,040
that's really worth
digging into because that,

117
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,640
that would also be the source.

118
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,030
That would be the place where you discover
the union shadow because you would

119
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:19,690
discover that contempt is an
unbelievably destructive force.

120
00:05:19,691 --> 00:05:24,190
Contempt is a particularly destructive
force and it would be useful for you to

121
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,300
try to think about,

122
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,980
you can use fantasy to do this.

123
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:27,281
It's like,

124
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:27,521
okay,

125
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:32,200
if you let that contempt manifest itself
fully in like a dream or a daydream

126
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:32,840
and,

127
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,750
and you let it go on a rampage,

128
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:35,760
like what,

129
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,450
what's the vision exactly?

130
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,081
I mean,

131
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:39,880
is it the destruction of the town?

132
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,760
Is the destruction of the country?

133
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,570
You want the entire world to blow up?

134
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:47,320
Like are there specific people that
you're angry at or maybe you're angry at

135
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:47,920
yourself,

136
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:52,920
like you need to figure out those waves
of contempt are unarticulated elements

137
00:05:53,051 --> 00:05:55,660
of experience and they're
part of your shadow.

138
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,760
So can you harness them for good?

139
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,380
Well,

140
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,350
I think the more you
understand your dark urges,

141
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,300
the more likely you are to be able to
regulate and control the men to use them

142
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:09,500
as part of your power.

143
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,110
A person or authority,

144
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:16,760
let's say a person who has authority is
someone who's integrated the dangerous

145
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,720
parts of themselves,

146
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,630
and that's part of what gives
their words Gravitas and weight.

147
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,040
Um,

148
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,060
and so yes,

149
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:23,840
I think you could,

150
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,100
you could harness them for good.

151
00:06:25,101 --> 00:06:25,934
It's,

152
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,890
and I think that's the right thing to do,

153
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:31,550
but it will involve a fair bit
and painful soul searching.
