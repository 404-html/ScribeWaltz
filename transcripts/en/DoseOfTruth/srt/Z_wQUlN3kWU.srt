1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,510
You might see the value of things
before you see the object itself.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:04,411
I mean,

3
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:04,981
there are people,

4
00:00:04,981 --> 00:00:05,521
for example,

5
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:06,354
who are blind.

6
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,483
They have blindsight,

7
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:10,020
they can recognize emotions
on faces without knowing,

8
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:10,854
they can see,

9
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,990
so that's partly because their retinas
are attached to their amygdala.

10
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,930
Your retina is attached
to a lot of your body,

11
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,700
not just your visual cortex.

12
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:22,110
It's attached to your spinal cord.

13
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,840
It's attached to your nervous system
at multiple levels of analysis

14
00:00:24,841 --> 00:00:25,800
simultaneously,

15
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,030
and so you can use your eyes to detect
things that you don't know you're seeing.

16
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,540
So then what is in some sense,

17
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:37,950
what you often detect under those
circumstances is valence value.

18
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,970
So you're very good,

19
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:39,804
for example,

20
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,410
at detecting teeth and predatory eyes and
the reasons for that are self evident.

21
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,030
Fundamentally.
