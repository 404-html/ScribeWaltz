1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,670
Sacrifice and we'll,

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:04,100
we'll talk more about that too.

3
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,500
You get to pick your damn sacrifice.

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,640
That's all.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:11,000
You don't get to not make
what your sacrificial,

6
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:12,140
whether you want to be or not.

7
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:14,450
That's a good thing to know as well.

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,040
So even though it's rather,

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:16,701
you know,

10
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:17,990
it's rough thing to figure out,

11
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:20,450
but other questions

12
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:30,603
I haven't had no one else.

13
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,330
Okay.

14
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:33,820
Nothing you just said about noticing
and more and more and people live into

15
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:34,654
their 20s yeah.

16
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:37,040
What do you think about that?

17
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,010
Where do you think that comes
from in terms of culture?

18
00:00:40,011 --> 00:00:40,844
We live in,

19
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:42,790
think universities facilitated

20
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,000
because you can go to university to
not be something instead of going to

21
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,290
university to be something and,

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,180
and that's it's pleasure island

23
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,600
and the price you pay for it,

24
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:59,680
especially in the u s is debt and
you're enticed into it because the

25
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:01,180
administrators can pick your pocket.

26
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:07,110
So they rob your future self while
allowing you to pretend that you have an

27
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,134
identity.

28
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,430
Right.

29
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:10,420
Very nasty.

30
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,110
And you can't declare bankruptcy with
your student loans in the U S it's

31
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:16,540
indentured servitude and it,

32
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:17,080
it is player.

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,400
It's precisely pleasure island.

34
00:01:18,401 --> 00:01:19,330
It's exactly that.

35
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,690
And so tuition fees of
short way out of control.

36
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,870
And part of the reason that universities
don't make more demands on their

37
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:28,750
students and let them get
away with all the things,

38
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:31,090
they let them get away with
this because they're basically,

39
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,710
why the hell would you chase them out?

40
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:39,250
There are $100,000 or more so they can
do whatever they want as long as you get

41
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:42,160
to sell them to the salt mines.

42
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,073
Right.

43
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:45,671
So,

44
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:46,211
and you know,

45
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:49,210
it's not the only reason because the
other thing that's happened is that the

46
00:01:49,211 --> 00:01:52,990
rate of technological transformation is
so fast now and the rate of turnover of

47
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:53,824
things is that it's,

48
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,100
it is genuinely harder for people who
are say 18 to 20 when I was a kid,

49
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,221
roughly speaking,

50
00:02:00,221 --> 00:02:01,690
the kind of rough patch for,

51
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,770
for for life was probably 14
to 17 something like that.

52
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,700
Now it's,

53
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:09,640
I think it's 18 to 25 something like that.

54
00:02:09,641 --> 00:02:11,070
And I think the reason for that is,

55
00:02:11,071 --> 00:02:15,970
is that all the jobs that
the bloody hippies complained
about being doomed to in

56
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:17,830
the 1960s have now disappeared.

57
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,760
Their problem was,

58
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:19,511
oh my God,

59
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:19,901
I'm going to be,

60
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:23,920
I go have to work for a corporation and
get a salary for the rest of my life,

61
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:24,461
you know,

62
00:02:24,461 --> 00:02:28,060
and then I'll just end up with a
pension and that'll be my whole life.

63
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:28,691
It's like,

64
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:29,020
well,

65
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,020
it seems like a lot better deal then
an endless round of part time Starbucks

66
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:35,424
jobs.

67
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,410
So you know,

68
00:02:37,411 --> 00:02:39,240
some of it is that it's,

69
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,330
it's just,

70
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:40,700
it's,

71
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,200
it's,

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,200
there's a space now in our culture that
that is lacking for people to make that

73
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,670
transformation from,

74
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,650
from adolescence into adulthood.

75
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,783
And so it's just,

76
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,600
it's,

77
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:52,870
it's,

78
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,680
the cost of that is for stalled,

79
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,930
but it's not a good thing.

80
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,420
It's not a good thing.

81
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:04,300
Do you think this is affecting employers
picky and choosy younger people for a

82
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:04,560
job?

83
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,361
Are you saying that the,

84
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:09,220
they're seeing this Laura maturation
or this or saying this person's got a

85
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,200
degree from UFT,

86
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,010
but I've heard about things
like degrees out worth birthday.

87
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,101
Well,

88
00:03:14,101 --> 00:03:14,340
the,

89
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,280
there's a couple of problems with
the degrees is that everyone has one.

90
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,360
That's the first one,

91
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:19,700
which,

92
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,930
so because scarcity matters obviously.

93
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,353
Um,

94
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,630
the second thing is,

95
00:03:24,631 --> 00:03:28,380
is that the match between the degree in
the workplace has become less and less

96
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:29,220
self evident.

97
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,910
You know what should happen when you go
to university is you should learn how to

98
00:03:32,911 --> 00:03:34,860
think and formulate arguments.

99
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,000
You should learn to think,

100
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:37,260
speak and write.

101
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,880
That's what the humanities are for.

102
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,890
They're to make you dangerous,

103
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,550
right?

104
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,350
Because if you can think and speak and
write your deadly in a complex job,

105
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,880
you're exactly what's necessary.

106
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,170
But if you don't have that,

107
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,610
it's like what the hell
good is the degree.

108
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,260
So I mean,

109
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,200
degree in English literature
doesn't prepare you for a job.

110
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,120
It could make you think,

111
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,470
write and speak,

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,690
which prepares you for any complex job.

113
00:04:00,691 --> 00:04:01,830
And that's what's supposed to happen.

114
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,290
But increasingly I think,

115
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,150
okay,

116
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,983
that doesn't happen.

117
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,220
Okay.

118
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,040
And the employers are waking
up to this very rapidly,

119
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,630
so and there,

120
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:11,901
I mean,

121
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:14,300
they've already known that most
for most complex positions,

122
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:15,590
they have to train their people.

123
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,121
Now they're thinking,

124
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:17,301
well,

125
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:19,760
why do I have to bother with the
degree if I'm going to train them?

126
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,350
If it isn't bringing anything of value?

127
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,071
You see this.

128
00:04:22,071 --> 00:04:23,450
And even it feels like law.

129
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:26,300
When I went to do a debate at
Queen's university three weeks ago,

130
00:04:26,301 --> 00:04:28,430
I think they couldn't
get anybody to debate me.

131
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,631
You know,

132
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:29,811
they,

133
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,561
the guy had to pay,

134
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,700
play devil's advocate.

135
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,350
We were talking about bill see 16.

136
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:33,681
I thought,

137
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:34,071
Jesus,

138
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:34,940
that's so pathetic.

139
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,620
I'm talking about legal matters.

140
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,710
And I meant the word greatest didn't
one of the greatest universities in the

141
00:04:39,711 --> 00:04:40,430
West,

142
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:41,031
you know what I mean?

143
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,500
It's in the top 200,

144
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:43,334
let's say.

145
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,120
Um,

146
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,350
I couldn't get someone to argue with the
stupid psychology professor about law,

147
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,660
had to get a devil's advocate.

148
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:53,990
And so one of the things that was really
disheartening talking to the students

149
00:04:53,991 --> 00:04:56,600
was they told me four or five of them,

150
00:04:56,601 --> 00:04:59,990
they're not learning a damn thing and
lights all social justice nonsense.

151
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,130
It's like,

152
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:02,480
well good,

153
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,560
that'll do it in the profession.

154
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,890
It's being done in any ways because
lawyers being replaced by automation.

155
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,100
And so a lot of what they
do is dig up information.

156
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:10,461
It's like,

157
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:10,791
well,

158
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,960
you can do that on your own.

159
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,540
And forums are proliferating like mad.

160
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,840
So the law school should be
teaching you to be a monster.

161
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,520
You better be,

162
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,830
but you come out,

163
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,690
you're concerned with social welfare.

164
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,553
Oh God.

165
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:26,700
It's like,

166
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:26,941
well,

167
00:05:26,941 --> 00:05:28,290
there's just nothing to that.

168
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,690
It's like you can come out and say you're,

169
00:05:30,691 --> 00:05:32,100
you want to be nice to people.

170
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,640
Well,

171
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,361
that's nice.

172
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:33,630
Good.

173
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,411
You go right ahead.

174
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:34,681
It's like,

175
00:05:34,681 --> 00:05:37,830
I'll go find someone who can do something
and you can go be nice to people and

176
00:05:37,831 --> 00:05:40,230
see how effective that is.

177
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,700
So it's a lot of things that are
conspiring in the same direction.

178
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,520
People don't have to
get married to have sex,

179
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,250
so we have no idea what
that's going to do.

180
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,220
Although we know one thing it's done
is the only people to get married now,

181
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:55,054
or rich.

182
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,190
Okay.

183
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:56,491
Right.

184
00:05:56,491 --> 00:06:00,410
Which is another thing that's really
comical because the feminist id in the 60s

185
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:01,940
was that marriage was an oppressive,

186
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,781
oppressive,

187
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:03,950
patriarchal institution.

188
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:04,311
It's like,

189
00:06:04,311 --> 00:06:04,641
okay,

190
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:07,730
fine then why do only rich
women get married now?

191
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,111
Because that's the,

192
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:10,160
that is the case.

193
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,020
And so for poorer women,

194
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,440
the dissolution of marriage has
been an absolute catastrophe.

195
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:18,710
They are so screwed
because they have kids.

196
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,390
So they're working,

197
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,310
they've got their 90 hour work week,

198
00:06:22,311 --> 00:06:22,611
man,

199
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:23,444
that's for sure.

200
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,880
They're much less attractive
to potential mates.

201
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:27,800
So they get low quality men,

202
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,900
often parasitical and predatory.

203
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:34,880
So they often have like
jobs in retail for example,

204
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:35,870
which are just dreadful.

205
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:37,550
You don't even know what
your schedule is going to be.

206
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,350
You get paid hardly anything.

207
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:40,041
You know,

208
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,874
it's really,

209
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,831
but if you know,

210
00:06:42,831 --> 00:06:43,820
most of the women who,

211
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,690
who,

212
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,690
who are outspoken feminists are on the
successful end of the socioeconomic

213
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:52,460
distribution.

214
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,500
They're university students
or people like that.

215
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:56,330
They don't even know any poor women.

216
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,570
So they have no idea what
their lives are like.

217
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:00,620
And you would never know,

218
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:02,000
cause they're at home working,

219
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,863
you know,

220
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,900
they're either at their horrible job or
they're at home slaving away with their

221
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:06,530
kids.

222
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,870
So it's not like they're out there
telling you what's wrong with them.
