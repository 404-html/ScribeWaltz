1
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:12,260
Hello.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:13,041
Hello,

3
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,330
and welcome to simulation.

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:18,803
Ooh.

5
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,291
Hello.

6
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,370
Hello everyone.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,710
I'm your host Allen sock yarn.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,090
I'll be your beacon of
curiosity this evening.

9
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,830
Simulation Paris together,

10
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:34,780
global leaders with humanities,

11
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:39,781
most thought provoking questions
and we hope to fill Levi stadium.

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,760
We hope to scale these thought provoking
conversations up to the size of Levi

13
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:49,120
stadium because if the national football,

14
00:00:49,121 --> 00:00:49,954
we can do it.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,430
So can the scientists,

16
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:52,264
am I right?

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,243
Yeah.

18
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:57,993
Through it.

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:00,491
All right.

20
00:01:00,491 --> 00:01:02,650
You guys know who your guest is.

21
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:03,090
Well,

22
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,180
let's give him a little bit
of San Francisco Bay area La.

23
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:08,110
Yeah,

24
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:08,943
baby.

25
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,513
Yeah.

26
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:12,661
Yeah,

27
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:13,494
baby.

28
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,551
Yeah,

29
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,384
baby.

30
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:22,690
[inaudible].

31
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,990
It's a lot of noise
for a bunch of lefties.

32
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,211
Well,

33
00:02:09,211 --> 00:02:09,631
thank you.

34
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,464
That's a,

35
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,593
yeah,

36
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,460
that's completely overwhelming.

37
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:14,850
Yes.

38
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:15,683
Thank you very much.

39
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,040
Ooh,

40
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,740
San Francisco Barrier welcomes you.

41
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,773
Huge welcome.

42
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,830
Do you see the lobster?

43
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,590
I do.

44
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,550
I sit in the last year.

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:32,821
Yeah,

46
00:02:32,821 --> 00:02:33,091
yeah,

47
00:02:33,091 --> 00:02:33,924
yeah,

48
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,520
yeah,

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,180
yeah,

50
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,510
yeah.

51
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,530
Lobsters everywhere.

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,570
I guess they just made the lobster Emoji.

53
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,493
Uh,

54
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,090
that seems syncronous right.

55
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,710
Seems like a synchronous event.

56
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:43,544
It's quite funny.

57
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:44,370
I,

58
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,610
I want the one where
you're riding the lobster,

59
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,050
you can buy those posters if you're
really into that sort of thing.

60
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,770
New fetishes.

61
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,590
Yeah.

62
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,423
Yeah.

63
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,730
Oh Jordan,

64
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,190
where do we even start?

65
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,131
Well,

66
00:03:02,131 --> 00:03:02,964
you're the interviewer.

67
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,190
Amazing,

68
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:11,320
amazing work over the last year.

69
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,700
You for me,

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,730
someone that you remind
me of is Tony Robbins.

71
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:16,983
I think he's taller.

72
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,853
Uh,

73
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,080
someone that knows how to

74
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,730
inspire people to self actualization.

75
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:31,690
And I find that to be
deeply needed in our world.

76
00:03:31,691 --> 00:03:34,100
And that's what you've been
doing and it's brilliant.

77
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:34,840
It's beautiful.

78
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,740
And I think this is why you
bring people together like this.

79
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:39,574
So,

80
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:44,910
so something that you brought to the
attention of so many people is the

81
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,830
dominance or competence hierarchy.

82
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:55,910
Y W let's maybe talk about what's,

83
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,540
what's the difference?

84
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,600
Dominance or competence hierarchy.

85
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,790
I kind of like competence hierarchy.

86
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,220
Yeah,

87
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:01,800
it's better.

88
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,260
Yeah.

89
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:02,500
Yeah.

90
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,730
Well I got this colleague,

91
00:04:03,731 --> 00:04:08,731
his name is Daniel Higgins and I've
been working with him for like 25 years.

92
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:12,160
He helped me design the
self authoring suite,

93
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,710
which is a series of programs,

94
00:04:14,711 --> 00:04:18,850
writing programs that are online that
helped people write about their lives,

95
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:19,480
their past.

96
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,320
And their present,

97
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,230
their virtues and their faults
and to make a plan for the future.

98
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:24,960
And,

99
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,793
um,

100
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:26,891
we've talked a lot.

101
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:27,310
He,

102
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:27,701
he was,

103
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,534
uh,

104
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,630
he has a master's degree
in MIT in engineering.

105
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,500
And then he went to Harvard.

106
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:35,800
He was a student of mine there and he
got a phd in experimental psychology.

107
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:39,460
And we've been working
on these psychological
interventions online ever since.

108
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:42,010
And we talk fairly frequently.

109
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:45,430
And I'd been using the term
dominance hierarchy a lot,

110
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:48,460
which it's something that's used
by biologists very regularly,

111
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:48,701
right?

112
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:50,170
Because most social animals,

113
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,520
even animals that aren't social,

114
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,120
any animals that have to compete for
occupation of a specific territorial space

115
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,910
tend to organize themselves into
fairly predictable hierarchies.

116
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:01,840
And it's,

117
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,320
it's,

118
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,410
it's a biological universal that's
a good way of thinking about it,

119
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,180
which is something
really important to know,

120
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:07,421
right?

121
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:08,770
Because if you don't know that,

122
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:11,740
then you might think that hierarchical
organizations are some secondary

123
00:05:11,741 --> 00:05:15,640
consequence of a sociopolitical structure
and economic structure or something

124
00:05:15,641 --> 00:05:16,000
like that.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,690
And it's just,

126
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,530
that's just not true.

127
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,180
It isn't even a little bit true.

128
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,310
It's unbelievably not true.

129
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,930
And well,

130
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,230
um,

131
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,290
this is partly why in rural
and 12 rules for life,

132
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,800
I wrote about the nervous system of
crustaceans and in rule number one,

133
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,130
because the neural biological systems
that we have evolved or that have evolved

134
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,400
to deal with dominance,

135
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:39,851
hierarchy,

136
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:40,271
placement,

137
00:05:40,271 --> 00:05:41,890
and I'll get to the
competence issue in a minute,

138
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,440
are at least a third
of a billion years old,

139
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,450
and that's far longer than theirs.

140
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,170
That's,

141
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,050
that's there weren't trees a
third of a billion years ago.

142
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,100
So dominance,

143
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:51,611
hierarchies,

144
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:55,150
hierarchical organizations among
animals are older than trees.

145
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,440
It's like there's no
blaming them on capitalism,

146
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:57,830
right?

147
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,010
This

148
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,191
is,

149
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:58,940
it's just,

150
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,151
well,

151
00:05:59,151 --> 00:05:59,900
seriously,

152
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,020
hierarchies have problems that
they're problematic social structures,

153
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,930
but you can't blame them on,

154
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,133
on,

155
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:06,801
on,

156
00:06:06,801 --> 00:06:07,220
on,

157
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,053
on cultural,

158
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,370
you can't blame them on culture.

159
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,410
Anyways,

160
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,410
we were talking about dominance
hierarchies and Dr. Higgins said,

161
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,740
you can't call them dominance hierarchies.

162
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,250
I said,

163
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,083
why not?

164
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,080
I said,

165
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:20,501
he said,

166
00:06:20,501 --> 00:06:20,741
well,

167
00:06:20,741 --> 00:06:24,890
unless you're in an organization where
you can put a dog leash around someone's

168
00:06:24,891 --> 00:06:26,270
neck and lead them around,

169
00:06:26,271 --> 00:06:27,800
it's not a dominance hierarchy.

170
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:32,120
And I thought he's kind of blunt as he
might've notice by that comment kind of

171
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:33,320
shocked me a because,

172
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,760
because it was so blunt.

173
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,660
There's lots of that that
happens in San Francisco.

174
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,583
Yeah,

175
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:43,861
yeah.

176
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:44,611
Well the thing is,

177
00:06:44,611 --> 00:06:44,911
well,

178
00:06:44,911 --> 00:06:49,911
you know that that's actually an operable
comment because dominance is just as

179
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,410
old as sexuality,

180
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:52,520
perhaps.

181
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,600
Perhaps not quite as old.

182
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,130
It's not quite as old as sexuality,

183
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:57,560
but it's old enough so that the
two things get tangled together.

184
00:06:57,561 --> 00:06:58,350
Very,

185
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,740
very inevitably.

186
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,443
He said,

187
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:05,570
he said two things that I thought were
really interesting and the first was

188
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:06,404
that,

189
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,430
okay,

190
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,800
human organizations are
sufficiently complex,

191
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:13,800
so the dominance is an insufficient
means of establishing hierarchy gold

192
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,643
priority.

193
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,661
That's good.

194
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:16,081
And I thought,

195
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:16,561
that's right.

196
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,970
I knew that as soon as he said that,

197
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:18,271
I thought,

198
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,000
yeah,

199
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,790
I shouldn't be using the term dominance
hierarchy because friends de wall,

200
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:28,080
who's Dutch primatologist wrote a series
of excellent books on the emergence of

201
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,340
morality and chimpanzees.

202
00:07:29,341 --> 00:07:30,420
I would highly recommend them.

203
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:31,590
They're very interesting books.

204
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,710
One of the things do all noted was
that in chimpanzee hierarchies,

205
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,690
the brutal males can rise to the top,

206
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:43,220
but they tend to have very short
lived empires and to meet very,

207
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:44,810
very violent deaths.

208
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,960
And so his conclusion was that in order,

209
00:07:48,961 --> 00:07:52,290
even for a chimpanzee hierarchy
to be stable across time,

210
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,290
then they top chimp had
to be quite pro social.

211
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,490
So first of all had to engage
in sufficient reciprocal
behavior so that he had

212
00:07:59,491 --> 00:08:00,960
allies among other males.

213
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:01,821
Right.

214
00:08:01,821 --> 00:08:02,511
Because otherwise,

215
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:06,670
if you're like top chimp and
your cavemen strongman type,

216
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,030
and you've established dominance
merely as a matter of intimidation and

217
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:11,864
strength,

218
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,190
then if you have an off day,

219
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:16,250
two of your slightly weaker
opponents can tear you to pieces,

220
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:18,980
which is exactly what the chimps do
because they're quite brutal in there.

221
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,240
There's no evidence that chimpanzees
have any internal regulation of the

222
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,640
violence that they'll
use to shift dominance,

223
00:08:26,641 --> 00:08:27,570
hierarchy position.

224
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,610
And so you end up castrated,

225
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:30,261
for example,

226
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,071
by your opponents,

227
00:08:31,071 --> 00:08:33,860
which is something that the
wall noted in the RNM zoo.

228
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,690
So he found that the stable chimp
troops had males at the helm.

229
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,110
Yeah.

230
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:39,943
Who were,

231
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,340
who had friendships,

232
00:08:41,341 --> 00:08:46,100
because chimps actually have social
friendships really that can stretch across

233
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
many years,

234
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:47,900
decades even,

235
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,070
and that they track them very well,

236
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:53,360
very reciprocal and their behavior tended
to treat the females relatively well

237
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:55,920
by chimp standards and
also tended to pay a fair,

238
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:58,320
a fair amount of attention to the infants,

239
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,540
which is an unbelievably
important finding,

240
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:00,751
right?

241
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:01,170
Because it,

242
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,030
it indicates at a,

243
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:04,710
at a level that's below the human,

244
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,711
let's say that there's an ethic associated
with leadership that isn't a mere

245
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:11,280
consequence of raw power.

246
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,181
And then,

247
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,290
so that was the first thing
that Higgins pointed out in.

248
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,740
The second thing was that he thought,

249
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,110
and,

250
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:17,943
and I haven't,

251
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,680
I don't know how true this is yet.

252
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:24,681
He thought that some of
what the pathologists who
had used the term dominance

253
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,560
hierarchy to apply to animals might have
been doing was using an intrinsically

254
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:35,661
Marxist framework to interpret animal
behavior and to overestimate the degree to

255
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:38,390
which dominance was actually the,

256
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:38,780
the,

257
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:42,270
the core foundation of
hierarchical organizations,

258
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,660
even among animals and the first ones,

259
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,050
the first objection he had,

260
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:47,280
that's definitely the case.

261
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,090
This is true.

262
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:48,923
The second one,

263
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:49,960
it's an interest.

264
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,793
Competence.

265
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:51,241
Yeah.

266
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:51,511
Yeah.

267
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:55,140
Well the idea that that it's pure
power is an unstable basis for,

268
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:55,681
for,

269
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:56,580
for uh,

270
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,600
stable hierarchy.

271
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:02,700
That's well documented and I think that
has probably moved into the realm of

272
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:04,290
empirically verifiable fact.

273
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,940
The second one that the initial idea
that it was dominance per se that was at

274
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,050
the basis of hierarchical arrangements
was in part a quasi I Marxist

275
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:14,670
interpretation or projection.

276
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,230
I think that's disputable because I
think what happens is that as you go down

277
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:19,910
the,

278
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,730
um,

279
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:23,700
the Fila genetic chain to
simpler and simpler animals,

280
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,040
it looks more and more like power.

281
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,910
Physical Prowess essentially
is the determining factor.

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,220
It certainly seems to be
the case among lobsters,

283
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:32,791
for example,

284
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:33,624
crustaceans,

285
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,340
they're of interest because
they have seen their lobster.

286
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,333
Um,

287
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:41,190
they have relatively simple
nervous systems relatively,

288
00:10:41,191 --> 00:10:45,090
they're still very complex with large
neurons that are easily observable and uh,

289
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,390
and a neurochemistry that differs
from humans but is the same.

290
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,640
It's similar in very interesting ways.

291
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:55,641
And maybe an example of using skills
that aren't power based or things like

292
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,360
creativity to be able to find ways
to get food or get what you want.

293
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,390
You might want to figure out
how you would define competence.

294
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:07,020
And so there's a
psychometric answer to that.

295
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:10,140
So I can metric psychometricians are
psychologists who are particularly

296
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:13,170
interested in measurement and then
also in measurement and prediction.

297
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,560
And so one of the things you want to
predict are the various human outcomes,

298
00:11:16,561 --> 00:11:17,090
like,

299
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,510
like economic success,

300
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:18,991
let's say,

301
00:11:18,991 --> 00:11:19,824
or or,

302
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,450
or subjective wellbeing,

303
00:11:21,451 --> 00:11:24,150
which is something that Sam
Harris is quite excited about.

304
00:11:24,151 --> 00:11:26,460
10 or general quality of life.

305
00:11:26,461 --> 00:11:27,570
These things are hard to measure,

306
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,910
but you can measure economic success.

307
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:30,960
Um,

308
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,480
what,

309
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,730
and what you find is that,

310
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,540
well there are a variety of features
that predict economic success in the

311
00:11:36,541 --> 00:11:37,374
Western world.

312
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,410
The most outstanding of those are Iq.

313
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:42,000
So that's straight intelligence.

314
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:46,500
And intelligence is something
like processing speed and
working memory capacity.

315
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,070
So it's the ability to
manipulate variables,

316
00:11:50,071 --> 00:11:52,800
a number of variables simultaneously
at relatively high speeds.

317
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,210
That's their abstract variables.

318
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,130
And that so that,

319
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,180
you know,

320
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,240
there's still people who debate
about the existence of Iq,

321
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,660
but they're called fools
fundamentally because,

322
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,380
well,

323
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,681
look,

324
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,500
I mean there's no,

325
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,450
there's absolutely no doubt that Iq is
the most documented phenomena in the

326
00:12:10,451 --> 00:12:12,550
social sciences except for one thing.

327
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,490
There's one only one thing
I've ever seen that that is,

328
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,920
has been measured more
powerfully and accurately.

329
00:12:17,921 --> 00:12:21,550
And that was the correlation between
inequality across counties in the United

330
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,430
States and male homicide rate because
that correlation is about 0.9.

331
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,180
And you know,

332
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,013
like that's just,

333
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:31,310
you'd never see that the
correlation between Iq and
success depending on how you

334
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,370
measure academic success,

335
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,390
learning speed,

336
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:35,410
um,

337
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,400
economic success,

338
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:37,260
success as a,

339
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,910
as a manager and administrator
success as an entrepreneur,

340
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,070
you're an entrepreneur or creative agent.

341
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,360
The correlation between that and
Iq is about 0.5 which is about

342
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:50,530
three times roughly speaking.

343
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,570
Yeah,

344
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:53,403
three times,

345
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,680
two to three times as powerful as the
most typical next powerful order of

346
00:12:58,931 --> 00:13:00,790
effects that science
social scientists measure.

347
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,710
So Iq is at walloping effect.

348
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,040
So I accused the first
one hardly surprising.

349
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:06,874
I mean,

350
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:12,310
especially as the environment gets more
complex because Iq predicts performance

351
00:13:12,311 --> 00:13:15,370
in complex jobs better than it
predicts performance in simple jobs.

352
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:19,540
And a simple job is one where you learn
it and then you repeat what you've

353
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:19,901
learned.

354
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:22,150
Whereas a complex job is a
job that changes every day.

355
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:26,080
So I suspect most of you in the audience
have complex job and performance in

356
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,920
well I suspect so you know,

357
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,973
um,

358
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:35,500
and maybe performance with
complex thinking as well
as long as the environment

359
00:13:35,501 --> 00:13:36,010
that you're,

360
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:40,210
that you're operating in changes on a
relatively frequent basis than you have to

361
00:13:40,211 --> 00:13:42,280
have an eye high Iq to
manage it effectively.

362
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,110
That's basically what Iq measures.

363
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:45,100
And then the next most,

364
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:46,180
um,

365
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,700
relevant predictor is
trait conscientiousness,

366
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,690
which is not a trait.

367
00:13:49,691 --> 00:13:50,830
We understand that all,

368
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,560
we have no measures of
conscientiousness that work.

369
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,870
We've got a couple of week ones,

370
00:13:55,871 --> 00:14:00,460
but no measures that really work better
than self report and other report could

371
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:03,820
being meticulous be a good way
to explain conscientiousness.

372
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:07,720
Meticulousness is associated with
orderliness and orderliness is one of the

373
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,160
aspects of conscientiousness,

374
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:10,390
but conscientious people.

375
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:14,050
The best way to sum up a conscientious
person is that they're very good at

376
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,450
keeping contract with
themselves and others.

377
00:14:16,451 --> 00:14:19,890
So what a conscientious person will do
is first of all say that they'll do some

378
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:20,440
things.

379
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,430
So that's the first thing,

380
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,900
but then they'll actually do it.

381
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,430
So they seem to be able to,

382
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,740
and they seem to be able to crucial.

383
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,610
Well,

384
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,061
yeah,

385
00:14:28,061 --> 00:14:28,510
it's just,

386
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:28,691
it's,

387
00:14:28,691 --> 00:14:32,140
it's crucial if it's especially crucial
if you're a manager and administrator,

388
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,000
it's not so crucial if
you're an entrepreneur,

389
00:14:34,001 --> 00:14:37,330
if you want to hold
yourself to achieving goals.

390
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,170
Yeah,

391
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,291
yeah.

392
00:14:38,291 --> 00:14:38,521
Well they,

393
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:38,740
they,

394
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,281
they tend to be,

395
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,740
if you want to work your way
up the competence hierarchy,

396
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:44,710
probably a good way to do that is to
say I'm going to do something and do it.

397
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,071
Yes.

398
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:45,340
Well,

399
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,050
well that's the thing
that these are these,

400
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:47,884
this isn't,

401
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,410
this isn't rocket science,

402
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,244
let's say.

403
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,880
Um,

404
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,060
market surgery as,

405
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,450
as,

406
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:53,781
as,

407
00:14:53,781 --> 00:14:54,614
uh,

408
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,460
one of the favorite characters of a
show I like in Canada tends to say that

409
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:01,220
that's the trailer park
boys rocket surgery,

410
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:03,920
which I think is really funny anyways.

411
00:15:03,921 --> 00:15:04,390
I mean,

412
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:04,851
Lord for,

413
00:15:04,851 --> 00:15:07,490
so for a social science finding,

414
00:15:07,491 --> 00:15:09,050
it's pretty damn self evident,

415
00:15:09,051 --> 00:15:09,321
right?

416
00:15:09,321 --> 00:15:10,880
Smart people who work hard do better.

417
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,610
And but what that,

418
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,280
what that,

419
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,470
what's also really cool
about that and this,

420
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:17,060
it isn't viewed this way very often.

421
00:15:17,061 --> 00:15:17,630
It's like,

422
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:22,190
let's say that you were
going to psychometrically
validate the integrity of an

423
00:15:22,191 --> 00:15:23,090
economic system.

424
00:15:24,110 --> 00:15:24,621
So you'd say,

425
00:15:24,621 --> 00:15:28,190
well you take the smart people in the
hardworking people and see if they do

426
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:28,521
better.

427
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:29,540
And if the answer is no,

428
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:30,830
then the system is rotten,

429
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:31,821
right?

430
00:15:31,821 --> 00:15:32,031
I mean,

431
00:15:32,031 --> 00:15:32,930
doesn't that make sense?

432
00:15:32,931 --> 00:15:34,160
Because you'd expect,

433
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,340
you'd hope if a system is
functioning that faster,

434
00:15:37,341 --> 00:15:40,310
harder working people would
be better at whatever it does.

435
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,560
And it turns out that in our culture,

436
00:15:42,561 --> 00:15:43,670
in the western culture,

437
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,570
the correlation between
conscientiousness plus Iq,

438
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,590
you have to wait the two and longterm
life success is as high as 0.7,

439
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,840
which is walloping walloping correlation
given how much chance also contributes

440
00:15:56,841 --> 00:15:57,471
to success,

441
00:15:57,471 --> 00:15:57,681
right?

442
00:15:57,681 --> 00:16:01,040
Because you can be working hard and very
smart and then you get cancer and die.

443
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,030
And that's the end of that.

444
00:16:02,031 --> 00:16:05,990
Like there are lots of random events in
life that interfere with your movement

445
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:06,710
forward.

446
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:11,710
And so there's an eradicable degree of
chance that that prediction is not going

447
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:13,244
to overcome.

448
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,800
Plus we're not that good
at measuring success.

449
00:16:15,801 --> 00:16:16,091
So there's,

450
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:19,130
there's error on the success
end of the measurement as well.

451
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,920
But IQ and conscientiousness
goes a long ways.

452
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:22,360
Yeah.

453
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,760
So,

454
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,810
and that's competence,

455
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:24,431
you know?

456
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:24,980
And then we,

457
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:27,830
the other thing we might think about
with regards to defining a competence

458
00:16:27,831 --> 00:16:32,831
hierarchy is imagine that
one of the things you want
from the operators within a

459
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:39,140
hierarchy is that they
maintain the hierarchy and
they expand it so that it can

460
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:40,160
include other people.

461
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:40,851
Right?

462
00:16:40,851 --> 00:16:42,830
And so competence,

463
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:46,490
a good measure of competence would be
the ability to work within the hierarchy

464
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:47,750
while you're also expanding,

465
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:49,520
maintaining it and expanding it.

466
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,050
And so that means that you would want to
set up an economic system where smart,

467
00:16:54,051 --> 00:16:58,190
hardworking people were doing things
that made other people who weren't them

468
00:16:58,191 --> 00:16:59,024
rich too.

469
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,490
I think we're actually
pretty good at that.

470
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,121
You know,

471
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,440
if you look at the statistics,

472
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:07,430
here's a good one and this is why people
shouldn't be as pessimistic as they are

473
00:17:07,431 --> 00:17:08,060
likely.

474
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,890
It's a good feeling to make other people
well off and have their wellbeing be

475
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,220
bought and lots of people,

476
00:17:13,221 --> 00:17:16,400
I mean one of the things I've really
been struck by with the people that I've

477
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:20,090
known who are hyper competent is that
one of the things they really like to do

478
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:25,600
is to find young people who need
opportunities and open doors for them.

479
00:17:25,641 --> 00:17:26,171
I mean it's a,

480
00:17:26,171 --> 00:17:26,660
it's a,

481
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,760
it's a pleasure that's not well measured,

482
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:29,061
you know,

483
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:32,420
but I know that like I've seen that
among the professors that I've known,

484
00:17:32,421 --> 00:17:33,410
that I really admired,

485
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:36,890
like they really like to mentor graduate
schools and graduate students and

486
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:40,340
develop their careers and entrepreneurs
in silicon valley that I know the same

487
00:17:40,341 --> 00:17:40,641
thing.

488
00:17:40,641 --> 00:17:43,250
And good managers and administrators,

489
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:45,110
they're not playing a zero sum game.

490
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,150
They're not opening the doors to everyone,

491
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:47,661
I wouldn't say.

492
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:51,330
But they're definitely always looking
around for competent people who are young

493
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,010
to provide opportunities to.

494
00:17:53,011 --> 00:17:57,450
And it's a real unsung virtue
of capitalism that that
sort of thing occurs and

495
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,290
it's not rare.

496
00:17:58,890 --> 00:17:59,723
So,

497
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:00,361
so,

498
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:00,870
so well.

499
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,800
So back to the,

500
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:04,560
to the ICU and conscientiousness
connection is like,

501
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,103
um,

502
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:09,020
like with regards to the say the,

503
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:13,230
the broad capitalist that broad
capitalists social and economic structure,

504
00:18:13,231 --> 00:18:13,710
you know,

505
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,820
I don't know if you guys know this,

506
00:18:14,821 --> 00:18:18,720
but the UN said is one of its millennial
goals in the year 2000 to have the

507
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:22,170
rates of poverty in the
world by 50% within 15 years.

508
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:22,890
Right?

509
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,600
And we hit that in 2012,

510
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,830
three years ahead of schedule.

511
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,910
It was the fastest decrease in human
poverty that has ever occurred in the

512
00:18:29,911 --> 00:18:32,460
history of the planet by a massive margin.

513
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,960
And it hasn't quit.

514
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:34,441
Now.

515
00:18:34,441 --> 00:18:36,750
Obesity is a bigger problem
now than starvation.

516
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,000
It's like we should have
party in the street for that,

517
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:39,241
right?

518
00:18:39,241 --> 00:18:41,820
There's more faculty than
there are starving people.

519
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:42,780
You know,

520
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,580
it's a perverse sort of victory,

521
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,414
but,

522
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,980
but it's a big one and about 300,000
people a day right now are being plugged

523
00:18:49,981 --> 00:18:53,880
into the electrical grid and the fastest
growing economies are in sub Sahara

524
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,060
Africa,

525
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,050
sub Saharan Africa.

526
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:59,580
It's like there's some real reason to
be thinking things are going great and

527
00:18:59,581 --> 00:19:04,140
they're having Amazon and Alibaba compete
to provide them with those goods that

528
00:19:04,141 --> 00:19:05,280
they need every single day.

529
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,441
Yeah,

530
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:08,430
well they have cell phone technology
that's really made a big difference and

531
00:19:08,431 --> 00:19:12,810
help stabilize the currencies and help
them identify where the proper market is

532
00:19:12,811 --> 00:19:16,470
for their goods and their being plugged
into youtube and watching Jordan B.

533
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,303
Peterson videos now.

534
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:17,761
Yes.

535
00:19:17,761 --> 00:19:19,410
Well what can I say?

536
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,520
So Jordan,

537
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,030
Jordan.

538
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,310
So competence hierarchies.

539
00:19:23,311 --> 00:19:23,491
It's,

540
00:19:23,491 --> 00:19:24,120
look,

541
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:24,810
it's better.

542
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:25,643
It's better to think.

543
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:30,890
It's better to think of a well functioning
human hierarchy as one based on

544
00:19:31,351 --> 00:19:32,070
competence.

545
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:32,690
The other thing,

546
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:36,990
like my colleague said to me was that
you don't want to overestimate how much

547
00:19:36,991 --> 00:19:38,250
power people have,

548
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:42,720
let's say in a corporate environment
because it's not obvious at all that the

549
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:45,240
managers or the executives
for that matter,

550
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,790
except in the rare cases
where they're psychopathic,

551
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,710
have fewer strictures,

552
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,371
have,

553
00:19:50,371 --> 00:19:52,680
well sometimes you get
psychopaths that rise to the top,

554
00:19:52,681 --> 00:19:52,891
right?

555
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:53,190
I mean,

556
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:54,540
otherwise there wouldn't be psychopaths.

557
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:55,200
But,

558
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,800
um,

559
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,330
it isn't obvious that people higher up
in a competence hierarchy have fewer

560
00:20:00,331 --> 00:20:03,630
strictures on their moral behavior
than people lower in the hierarchy.

561
00:20:03,631 --> 00:20:04,170
Right?

562
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:09,170
Because my sense is that responsibility
increases as you move up the hierarchy.

563
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:10,974
And so,

564
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,240
and your degrees of freedom with regards
to moral attitude also tend to decline

565
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,870
because you're,

566
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:16,111
you know,

567
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:17,020
if you're a manager of,

568
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:21,840
well maybe you have 30 people working
for you and they each only have one

569
00:20:21,841 --> 00:20:22,674
manager.

570
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,870
There's a lot of people
that you're responsible to.

571
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:25,651
And so,

572
00:20:25,651 --> 00:20:26,550
and you can't miss.

573
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,920
You can't mistreat your people

574
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:36,140
with any degree of consistency because
the good ones leave the bad ones torture

575
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,174
you to death.

576
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,580
And the whole thing collapses across time.

577
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,060
And so the whole idea that what you
have in a competence hierarchy is power

578
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:52,090
is not a reasonable assumption
as far as I can tell.

579
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,590
That's a big deal,

580
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:54,030
right?

581
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:54,320
We read,

582
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,480
you've got to get that right.

583
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,860
So it's a big deal.

584
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,450
And the word competence
is an empowering word.

585
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,060
I've achieved the status that I have,

586
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,040
whoever's speaking these words,

587
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,570
by competence,

588
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,990
and then there's better mates,

589
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,731
better food,

590
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,900
less disease,

591
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,980
et Cetera,

592
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,150
to climb higher.

593
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,530
Now since you,

594
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:18,401
since you bring this up,

595
00:21:18,401 --> 00:21:21,580
I think this is an important point and
that I really wanted to ask you about,

596
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:26,970
which is that what percentage of the
competence hierarchies influenced by

597
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:31,720
potentially an exertion
of oppression for giving?

598
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:32,880
Let me give you an example.

599
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,120
For example,

600
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,550
let's go ahead and take
our friendly lobster.

601
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,140
Uh,

602
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,790
let's take the lobster for example.

603
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:40,930
Let's say the lobsters,

604
00:21:40,931 --> 00:21:43,840
a sea floor dwelling preacher,

605
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,580
and the lobster has 20 shelters,

606
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,030
but the lobster only
inhabits two of the shelters.

607
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,720
But it doesn't enable the other lobsters
to dwell or reside in the other 18

608
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,190
shelters that it doesn't even use.

609
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,710
Just as an example.

610
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,043
Well,

611
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,930
I mean it's,

612
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:12,790
we could,

613
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,990
we could think about this.

614
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,220
One of the things that I've found very
interesting about looking at archetipal

615
00:22:18,221 --> 00:22:23,200
representations of experiential reality
is that there are always balanced.

616
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,870
And so the fundamental
architectural representation
of the hierarchy is the wise

617
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:32,880
king and the tyrant and every hierarchy
can be reasonably represented with

618
00:22:33,431 --> 00:22:36,190
narratives involving the
wise king and the tyrant.

619
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:41,520
So the wise king is the part of the
hierarchy that sustains itself and expands

620
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:44,080
and includes more people,

621
00:22:44,081 --> 00:22:44,261
right?

622
00:22:44,261 --> 00:22:45,640
So that's a functioning polity.

623
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:51,180
And the tyrant is the fact that people
operating within that hierarchy can play

624
00:22:51,371 --> 00:22:52,570
zero sum games,

625
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,890
can be willfully blind,

626
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:55,150
can be malevolent,

627
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,560
can play politics,

628
00:22:56,561 --> 00:22:57,940
can cease to be productive,

629
00:22:57,941 --> 00:23:00,670
can manipulate the system for
their own devices and all of that.

630
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,690
And it's obviously the case
that every human institution,

631
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:09,691
especially as they scale falls prey to
the [inaudible] part of the archetype.

632
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,490
That's why big things fall apart.

633
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,110
And so when you say,

634
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:16,480
well to what degree is a hierarchy,

635
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,670
to what degree does a hierarchy
emerge because of tyrannical factors?

636
00:23:21,671 --> 00:23:22,271
The answer is,

637
00:23:22,271 --> 00:23:23,650
well it depends on the hierarchy,

638
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:28,900
but generally a nontrivial
amount that scales with size.

639
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,590
Okay.

640
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,423
But that,

641
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:32,380
having said that,

642
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:36,970
that doesn't to say that something is
partially corrupt is a lot different than

643
00:23:36,971 --> 00:23:38,590
saying that it's totally corrupt.

644
00:23:38,591 --> 00:23:38,950
Right?

645
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,720
There's this great story for those of
you that don't know it in the brothers

646
00:23:43,721 --> 00:23:46,100
Karamazov and the

647
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,330
atheist Ivan,

648
00:23:47,331 --> 00:23:50,360
who's the most compelling character,

649
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:54,650
I would say most charismatic character
in the book is torturing his younger

650
00:23:54,651 --> 00:23:55,011
brother,

651
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:55,611
Lee Osha,

652
00:23:55,611 --> 00:24:00,611
who's a monastic novitiates
about religion and Dogma and God.

653
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:04,280
And he's trying to convince Ellie
Osha that if there is a god,

654
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,780
he's so cruel that he's reprehensible
in his fundamental element.

655
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:09,921
And anyways,

656
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:14,510
he tells this story about the Catholic
Church and it's called the grand

657
00:24:14,511 --> 00:24:15,051
inquisitor.

658
00:24:15,051 --> 00:24:15,561
It's a very,

659
00:24:15,561 --> 00:24:16,490
very famous story.

660
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:17,360
And in this story,

661
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,380
Christ come back,

662
00:24:18,381 --> 00:24:22,010
comes back to Earth to Seville in
Spain at the height of the Spanish

663
00:24:22,011 --> 00:24:22,641
inquisition.

664
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:23,474
And he's,

665
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,380
he reappears and he's doing
miraculous things and you know,

666
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:32,420
dividing up the loaves and feeding the
poor and healing the sick and being

667
00:24:32,421 --> 00:24:33,710
miraculous and wonderful.

668
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:38,090
And the grand inquisitor who runs the
Spanish inquisition promptly has him

669
00:24:38,091 --> 00:24:39,500
arrested and throws him in prison.

670
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:40,600
And then he,

671
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:40,810
and,

672
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,050
and,

673
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:41,590
and he's,

674
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:41,890
he,

675
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:44,960
he decides he's going to be executed and
he comes to visit them at night and he

676
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:45,231
says,

677
00:24:45,231 --> 00:24:45,531
look,

678
00:24:45,531 --> 00:24:46,364
you know,

679
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:50,210
you were here 1500 years ago and you're,

680
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,600
you were perfect and you put a moral
burden on human beings that was way too

681
00:24:53,601 --> 00:24:54,740
great for anyone to carry.

682
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:59,360
And it's taken us 1500 bloody years to
cobble together something out of your

683
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:02,960
insanely positive example that
normal human beings could live with.

684
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:07,160
And we finally got it a little bit
under control and damp and it down.

685
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:08,480
And here you are back again,

686
00:25:08,481 --> 00:25:11,480
like setting up an impossible
example for people.

687
00:25:11,481 --> 00:25:12,530
We just can't have that.

688
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:14,180
We're going to do you in tomorrow.

689
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,200
And,

690
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:15,530
um,

691
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:20,030
Christ listens and is not particularly
upset by all appearances about what's

692
00:25:20,031 --> 00:25:20,481
happening.

693
00:25:20,481 --> 00:25:23,960
And then the inquisitor who's
an old man gets up to leave.

694
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:24,711
And when he leaves,

695
00:25:24,711 --> 00:25:28,360
Christ stands up and kisses him
on the lips and the inquisitor,

696
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:30,530
it turns white with shock and then leaves.

697
00:25:30,531 --> 00:25:31,221
And when he leaves,

698
00:25:31,221 --> 00:25:32,390
he leaves the door open.

699
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,240
And that's the brilliant
part of this story because,

700
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:38,450
and that's what made Dostoyevsky
such an amazing genius,

701
00:25:38,451 --> 00:25:38,961
I would say,

702
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:42,770
is even though he could write a
critique of the Catholic church,

703
00:25:42,771 --> 00:25:46,550
let's say the Christian Church is
powerful and is intelligent as the grand

704
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:47,330
inquisitor.

705
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:52,330
He also noticed that the
dogmatic structure of the
church still left the still

706
00:25:53,121 --> 00:25:55,250
left the door open for
the divine individual.

707
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:58,940
It's like you don't get a hierarchy
without getting a tyranny along with it,

708
00:25:58,941 --> 00:25:59,241
you know?

709
00:25:59,241 --> 00:25:59,840
But,

710
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,830
but there's a hell of a difference between
the 30 or so countries in the world

711
00:26:03,831 --> 00:26:06,530
where anyone with any
sense would want to live.

712
00:26:06,531 --> 00:26:11,270
And the other hundred and 50 where that
are basically run by barbaric thugs.

713
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:15,080
And it's important to keep the distinction
between those two things in dine.

714
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:15,561
It's like,

715
00:26:15,561 --> 00:26:15,801
yeah,

716
00:26:15,801 --> 00:26:18,740
we've got some things that we
should put together and clean up.

717
00:26:18,741 --> 00:26:19,580
And you know,

718
00:26:19,581 --> 00:26:23,330
people are discriminated against for
unfair reasons and that's to everyone's

719
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:23,990
detriment,

720
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,860
obviously,

721
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,170
but it's a multivariate problem.

722
00:26:27,171 --> 00:26:28,080
And the,

723
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,770
the,

724
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,190
the,

725
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:29,550
the,

726
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,550
the positioning of someone in a hierarchy
of competence is in part due to there.

727
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:40,130
What would you say to the historical
context within which that hierarchy has

728
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:40,640
emerged?

729
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,980
But to say it's all a consequence
of that is part of what I regard as

730
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,950
the radical leftist war on
the idea of competence itself.

731
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:51,060
Because I actually think that's the
fundamental narrative driving the real

732
00:26:51,061 --> 00:26:55,350
radical leftists is that they hate
the idea of competence itself.

733
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,210
It's deeper than Orwell's comment.

734
00:26:57,211 --> 00:26:58,480
George Orwell's comment in,

735
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,270
in,

736
00:26:59,270 --> 00:26:59,940
uh,

737
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,350
road to Wigan pier where he said,

738
00:27:01,351 --> 00:27:01,531
well,

739
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:05,670
the problem with middleclass
pretty socialist is that
they don't like the poor.

740
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:06,930
They just hate the rich,

741
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,890
which is like dead on man
vicious vicious diagnosis.

742
00:27:10,891 --> 00:27:11,760
It's worse than that.

743
00:27:11,761 --> 00:27:12,570
Is that,

744
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:16,260
is that the radical leftists
don't like the oppressed.

745
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,060
They just hate the competent.

746
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,350
I really believe that.

747
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,071
I think it's,

748
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:23,640
I think it's unbelievably
pathological and dangerous.

749
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:24,270
It is.

750
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:29,270
So the more nuanced conversations like
these rather than binary yes or no sort

751
00:27:29,641 --> 00:27:34,170
of reductionist conversations around
complex topics like a competence hierarchy

752
00:27:34,171 --> 00:27:37,440
that's surface to fruition
in the media sphere.

753
00:27:37,441 --> 00:27:41,520
I think over time we will get to a point
where more and more people have the

754
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,070
really complex and nuanced
conversation about this.

755
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:44,610
Um,

756
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,330
Jordan,

757
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,370
how about the genetic fitness landscape?

758
00:27:47,371 --> 00:27:48,204
Is this,

759
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,330
is it fair to say that there are a bunch
of different competence hierarchies

760
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:58,230
across this plain of fitness competent?

761
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:58,531
Well,

762
00:27:58,531 --> 00:27:59,970
there are and there are one or the,

763
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,883
you know,

764
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:05,370
one of the bubbles could be who's ranked
highest in the government or one of

765
00:28:05,371 --> 00:28:09,240
them is who's ranked highest in space
or whose rank Tyson genetic engineering

766
00:28:09,241 --> 00:28:11,430
and or whatever field in whatever.

767
00:28:11,431 --> 00:28:14,430
But that's why ideas like multiple
intelligence are so attractive,

768
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,040
even though the idea of
multiple intelligence is wrong,

769
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:17,971
it's clear.

770
00:28:17,971 --> 00:28:18,151
No,

771
00:28:18,151 --> 00:28:18,984
it's clearly,

772
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,720
it's clearly wrong intelligence.

773
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,900
The factor analysis have been done
and we've known this since like 1920.

774
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,230
It's,

775
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,150
it's not disputable if you,

776
00:28:27,151 --> 00:28:27,480
if,

777
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:27,691
so,

778
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:29,010
here's how you make an Iq test.

779
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:31,830
It's really easy and everyone
should know this because you need,

780
00:28:31,831 --> 00:28:33,240
you need to know how these things work.

781
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,360
So imagine that you took a
universal library of questions.

782
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,650
Any sort of question that required
abstraction to solve could be a general

783
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:41,730
knowledge question.

784
00:28:41,731 --> 00:28:42,960
It could be a vocabulary question,

785
00:28:42,961 --> 00:28:44,250
could be a mathematical question.

786
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,330
It doesn't matter.

787
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,540
It could be a question about anything
as long as it requires abstraction to

788
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:48,871
solve.

789
00:28:48,871 --> 00:28:51,180
So you have a universal
library of those questions.

790
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:56,160
Then imagine you took a hundred questions
at random from that universal library

791
00:28:56,550 --> 00:29:00,900
and you gave them to 500 people and
then you just totaled their scores,

792
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:01,230
right?

793
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:01,890
Right,

794
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,460
wrong,

795
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,540
total total discourse.

796
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:07,710
Then you rank ordered the scores from
highest performer to lowest performer.

797
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,843
That's Iq.

798
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:09,803
That's all there is to it.

799
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,033
That's it.

800
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,760
And then what you'd find is if you took
another hundred questions from the same

801
00:29:14,761 --> 00:29:15,241
library,

802
00:29:15,241 --> 00:29:17,880
randomly selected and gave
them to the same 500 people,

803
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,870
and you'd have to rank orders
right from the top to the bottom,

804
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,190
the correlation between the two rank
orders would be about 0.9 unbelievably

805
00:29:26,191 --> 00:29:26,460
high.

806
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,840
It's unbelievably stable.

807
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,570
And now if you correct that for age,

808
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,463
you get Iq.

809
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,370
That's all there is to it.

810
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:33,563
That's it.

811
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,430
And so well now,

812
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:37,770
so cause intelligences,

813
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,300
and that's a single factor.

814
00:29:39,301 --> 00:29:40,590
If you do a factor analysis,

815
00:29:40,591 --> 00:29:44,920
which is a statistical technique that
tells you how many different attributes

816
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:47,710
that that rank ordering possesses,

817
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,000
you get one factor.

818
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,940
So it's one that's that not multiple.

819
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:57,420
Now there are multiple talents and there
are multiple temperaments and that's

820
00:29:57,611 --> 00:29:59,080
where the big five model comes in.

821
00:29:59,081 --> 00:29:59,741
So people,

822
00:29:59,741 --> 00:30:03,550
different extroversion and extroverts
are more likely to be good at sales jobs.

823
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,930
People differ in negative emotionality
despite what the California Labor board

824
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,220
ruled yesterday.

825
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,150
Um,

826
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,150
people differ in sensitivity
to negative emotion.

827
00:30:13,151 --> 00:30:16,420
Women are more sensitive on average
to negative emotion than men.

828
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,590
And the effect size of that is something
like if you took a random woman and a

829
00:30:20,591 --> 00:30:25,090
random man out of the population and
you had to lay a bet on who had higher

830
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:28,960
levels of anxiety and emotional pain and
you bet that it was the woman you'd be

831
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,430
right 60% of the time.

832
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:34,640
So it's an interesting stat because
men and women are more the same in

833
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:35,474
emotional,

834
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,560
in sensitivity to negative
emotion then different.

835
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,671
But there's,

836
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,210
there's a,

837
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,760
there's an offset at the mean.

838
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,070
And what that also means is that
if you took the top 100 people,

839
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,180
top one in a hundred people who are
the most sensitive to negative emotion,

840
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,350
they'd almost all be women.

841
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:55,140
Now you see the re,

842
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:58,510
you see the inverse of that in some
sense with regards to criminality.

843
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,930
So males are more aggressive than females.

844
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,880
And it's about the same difference.

845
00:31:03,881 --> 00:31:06,640
If you take a random woman on a
random man out of the population,

846
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:08,260
you had to bet on who
was the most aggressive.

847
00:31:08,261 --> 00:31:09,190
If you bet it was the man,

848
00:31:09,191 --> 00:31:10,780
you'd be right 60% of the time,

849
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,430
which isn't that much of the time,

850
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:12,651
right?

851
00:31:12,651 --> 00:31:13,000
It's,

852
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:18,000
it's deviation from 50 50 but it's not
90 10 it's just 60 40 but if you take the

853
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:22,840
one in a hundred persons
who's most aggressive,

854
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:24,910
and that's the person you throw in prison,

855
00:31:24,911 --> 00:31:25,630
by the way,

856
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:26,463
they're all men.

857
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,670
Nine out of 10 of them are men.

858
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:28,930
And so one of the things,

859
00:31:28,931 --> 00:31:29,291
and this,

860
00:31:29,291 --> 00:31:32,140
this goes to the complexity argument
that you were talking about earlier,

861
00:31:32,141 --> 00:31:34,040
that it's hard for people
to have a multivariate,

862
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:34,830
uh,

863
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,750
discussion because we like to
collapse things into single causes,

864
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:41,470
but it's also hard for people to
understand the statistical reality of

865
00:31:41,471 --> 00:31:45,820
distribution because you can have two
distributions that almost entirely overlap

866
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,140
and have walloping differences at the
tails and the tails are where all the

867
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:50,741
action is.

868
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:54,700
Like who cares how aggressive you are
as long as you don't shoot or stab

869
00:31:54,701 --> 00:31:55,330
someone,

870
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,440
you get to be aggressive.

871
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,040
But if you're so aggressive that,

872
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,350
or you shoot or stab someone,

873
00:31:59,351 --> 00:32:02,620
then you end up in prison and you're
the person that we're concerned with.

874
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,750
And maybe that's 1% of the population.

875
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,081
It's like,

876
00:32:05,081 --> 00:32:05,231
yeah,

877
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:06,064
well they're all men.

878
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:11,580
And you see this happens in less dramatic
form too when you look at phenomena

879
00:32:12,941 --> 00:32:15,310
like a career selection.

880
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,650
So it was just a data set
released the other day.

881
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,850
And this is the first time I'd seen this
showing quite clearly that as this is a

882
00:32:21,851 --> 00:32:26,851
w this is a remarkable finding and it
builds on some earlier research which the

883
00:32:28,061 --> 00:32:30,670
California Labor board also
decided with pseudoscience,

884
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:35,110
which is absolutely
100% not pseudoscience.

885
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:36,460
That is so wrong.

886
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:41,670
No serious scientists debate the data
that I'm describing that nobody has

887
00:32:41,841 --> 00:32:44,000
debated it since like 1990.

888
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:44,991
So it,

889
00:32:44,991 --> 00:32:46,550
it's very well settled science.

890
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:47,883
Um,

891
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:52,580
if you look out career
choices between men and women,

892
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,630
what you find is that they're driven in
large part by temperamental differences.

893
00:32:56,631 --> 00:32:57,980
So that would be in the big five,

894
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:58,641
extroversion,

895
00:32:58,641 --> 00:32:59,241
neuroticism,

896
00:32:59,241 --> 00:32:59,871
agreeableness,

897
00:32:59,871 --> 00:33:04,280
conscientiousness and openness and
also by interest because the biggest

898
00:33:04,281 --> 00:33:07,310
difference between men and women that's
been measured psychometrically forget

899
00:33:07,311 --> 00:33:08,390
about the physical differences.

900
00:33:08,391 --> 00:33:12,350
But the psychological differences is
difference in interest and it's actually

901
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:13,184
pretty big.

902
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:18,310
And so men on average are more interested
in things and women on average are

903
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:19,850
more interested in people.

904
00:33:19,851 --> 00:33:21,830
And it's a one standard
deviation difference,

905
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:24,980
which is a big difference by by the
standards of these sorts of differences.

906
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,340
And it's enough to drive the f drive.

907
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:30,260
A couple of phenomena phenomena.

908
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:31,094
One,

909
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,610
most nurses are women phenomena
to most engineers are men.

910
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,250
Why has nothing to do
or very little to do,

911
00:33:37,251 --> 00:33:37,910
if any,

912
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,520
with differences in
mathematical reasoning ability.

913
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,650
And I mean that's being tracked too.

914
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:44,330
So if you take junior high kids,

915
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,961
men and women,

916
00:33:44,961 --> 00:33:45,794
girls and boys,

917
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:50,090
and you take only those who are off the
charts in terms of their mathematical

918
00:33:50,091 --> 00:33:50,924
interest,

919
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,730
the gender difference isn't that great.

920
00:33:52,731 --> 00:33:54,380
There's a tiny edge for for boys,

921
00:33:54,381 --> 00:33:55,011
but not much.

922
00:33:55,011 --> 00:33:57,290
And it's even disputable
whether that edge exists.

923
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,080
So let's assume it doesn't
for the sake of argument,

924
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,960
if you track those kids across time,

925
00:34:02,961 --> 00:34:06,230
what you find is a disproportionate
number of the men go into the stem fields

926
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,490
and hardly any of the women.

927
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:09,320
And the reason is they're good at it,

928
00:34:09,321 --> 00:34:10,340
but they're not interested in it.

929
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,050
So [inaudible] then you might think,

930
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,630
well that's socio-cultural white.

931
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,660
We could change that.

932
00:34:14,661 --> 00:34:15,230
It's like,

933
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:15,800
no,

934
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:16,460
sorry.

935
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,870
Research has already been done.

936
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,040
Um,

937
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,873
what a,

938
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:23,630
so imagine you could rank order
countries by how gender neutral there are

939
00:34:23,631 --> 00:34:25,460
socioeconomic policies were.

940
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,760
And then you put the Scandinavian
countries at the top for obvious reasons

941
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,220
because they'd been pushing
that for like three decades,

942
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:32,054
four decades,

943
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,470
and have made a lot of progress with it.

944
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,670
Um,

945
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:38,480
the biggest differences in temperament
and interest in the world between men and

946
00:34:38,481 --> 00:34:40,040
women are in the Scandinavian countries.

947
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:44,570
And the data now have revealed that
there's a correlation between how gender

948
00:34:44,571 --> 00:34:47,660
neutral the country is and how big the
differences are between the men and

949
00:34:47,661 --> 00:34:48,080
women.

950
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,550
And the difference is positive,

951
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,443
not negative.

952
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:51,651
And then you think,

953
00:34:51,651 --> 00:34:51,801
well,

954
00:34:51,801 --> 00:34:53,750
is that reliable science or,

955
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:58,770
or are the right wing conservatives
driving this scientific agenda?

956
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,910
And answer to that is there are no
right wing conservatives in psychology.

957
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,373
There are none.

958
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,910
I'm dead serious,

959
00:35:04,911 --> 00:35:05,744
man.

960
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,370
I'm dead serious about that.

961
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,473
So,

962
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,010
so here's why this,

963
00:35:10,011 --> 00:35:11,780
here's why this research is reliable.

964
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,900
It's because the research is reliable
because the people who generated the

965
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:15,980
findings hated them.

966
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,540
They hated the findings.

967
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,900
They were completely biased in the
other direction because everyone,

968
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:22,190
everyone was hoping.

969
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:26,480
Everyone who's a social scientist was
hoping that as you flattened out the

970
00:35:26,481 --> 00:35:29,270
gender differences in the
sociological landscape,

971
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,390
you would decrease the
personality differences,

972
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,470
individual differences.

973
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:34,281
And that's not what happened.

974
00:35:34,281 --> 00:35:35,031
You maximize them.

975
00:35:35,031 --> 00:35:36,080
Instead it's like,

976
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:36,943
oh,

977
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:38,570
that wasn't what we expected.

978
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:38,930
And,

979
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:39,763
and believe me,

980
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,760
people just didn't run to the
publisher and publish these data sets.

981
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,560
They were shocked by them
and so they replicated them.

982
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,740
And these have been replicated across
samples of tens of thousands of people

983
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:49,881
and,

984
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:50,080
and,

985
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,510
and dozens of countries.

986
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:53,330
It's extraordinarily reliable.

987
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:53,960
It is,

988
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,100
as far as I'm concerned,

989
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,810
apart from the hard
biological end of this,

990
00:35:57,811 --> 00:36:01,540
of psychology where there's some
unbelievably solid work done.

991
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,720
It's the most solid social science
that exists as far as I can tell the

992
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:08,050
psychometric data.

993
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,160
And the reason I think that is when,

994
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:12,090
when I was starting my career,

995
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,400
I was looking for the most solid data
because one of the things I wanted to do

996
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:22,650
learn how to predict how peoples lives
transformed and changed across time and,

997
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:27,060
and what sort of Ma level
of achievement they manage.

998
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:29,700
So I was looking for the most
reliable and valid measures.

999
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,980
And it's clearly the psychometric
measures are the most reliable and valid

1000
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,293
period.

1001
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,510
No one disputes that.

1002
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,013
So except like,

1003
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,490
you know,

1004
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,740
people in Women's studies
and that just doesn't count.

1005
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:41,440
So you know,

1006
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,350
they,

1007
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,760
they don't have a methodology.

1008
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,153
So,

1009
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,070
so the fact that there's a
dispute just doesn't matter.

1010
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,023
Yeah.

1011
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,053
So

1012
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:58,090
[inaudible] they have hypotheses,

1013
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,700
right?

1014
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,540
And then that's fine.

1015
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,490
There's nothing wrong with
generating hypotheses.

1016
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,810
Don't get me wrong,

1017
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,340
there's nothing wrong with theory,

1018
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:11,200
but when you start to
confuse theory with fact,

1019
00:37:11,201 --> 00:37:11,890
let's say,

1020
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,090
then there's real trouble,

1021
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:14,260
you know,

1022
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,880
your theory has to be constructed,

1023
00:37:15,881 --> 00:37:19,260
at least in part so that you can make a
prediction of some sort so that you can

1024
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:22,490
measure what your theory says that you
can measure and so that you can predict

1025
00:37:22,491 --> 00:37:23,450
something with it.

1026
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:25,670
And then to see whether or
not your theory holds up.

1027
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,240
Otherwise it's just
hypothesis and that's fine,

1028
00:37:28,241 --> 00:37:31,720
but you don't get to impose it on
everyone else because you get to state by

1029
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:33,700
theater that your hypothesis is correct.

1030
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,183
It's,

1031
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,970
it's reprehensible to do that.

1032
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:38,863
And,

1033
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,310
and that's being done an awful lot,

1034
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,443
an awful lot.

1035
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:46,860
So I always found it interesting to think
about why there weren't any groups of

1036
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,890
men that were trying to increase the
amount of men that were in nursing or

1037
00:37:54,170 --> 00:37:58,480
dental hygienists or education
or an education social work.

1038
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,900
I always found that interesting.

1039
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,530
I always,

1040
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,080
and then I there lower pain disciplines.

1041
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,253
MMM.

1042
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,090
And then,

1043
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:09,850
and then I recently started thinking
about this in terms of sports with the NFL

1044
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:12,200
and NBA and I was like,

1045
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,153
hmm,

1046
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:19,100
there are just less Asian people
and Latino people and white people.

1047
00:38:19,821 --> 00:38:20,300
There's just,

1048
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:25,120
there's more black people that artist
better athletes and are we going to

1049
00:38:25,121 --> 00:38:25,954
decrease?

1050
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:26,650
Okay.

1051
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:31,650
Standards for people have different from
eight that are Asian or Latino t to get

1052
00:38:33,621 --> 00:38:35,280
more primitive professional things.

1053
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,070
He is funny

1054
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:36,300
that,

1055
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,060
that the,

1056
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,230
the discussion about,

1057
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:38,860
um,

1058
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:41,320
gender differences in
occupational position,

1059
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,243
let's say,

1060
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:44,020
is unbelievably narrow.

1061
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:44,771
You know,

1062
00:38:44,771 --> 00:38:48,070
it tends to focus on the
highest corporate positions.

1063
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,540
That's not all of it,

1064
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,660
but it tends to focus on the highest
corporate positions are the highest paid

1065
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:53,051
positions.

1066
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:55,190
But certainly it's quite interesting if,

1067
00:38:55,191 --> 00:38:55,750
if you're,

1068
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:59,890
if you're into this sort of thing I
suppose to go online and just look up the

1069
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,180
labor statistics from,

1070
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,810
from the American federal
government because they,

1071
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:04,270
they,

1072
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:05,980
they rank order occupations by gender,

1073
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:06,610
you know,

1074
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,420
proportion and blood brick
layers or that's the,

1075
00:39:10,421 --> 00:39:12,640
that's the occupation that's
the most gender skewed.

1076
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,730
There's like no female brick layers and,

1077
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,180
but no one cares about that.

1078
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:17,260
And it's kind of interesting.

1079
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:17,741
Well,

1080
00:39:17,741 --> 00:39:17,981
no,

1081
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:21,160
but it is interesting because it's not
like brick layers don't make a good

1082
00:39:21,161 --> 00:39:21,850
living,

1083
00:39:21,850 --> 00:39:22,061
you know,

1084
00:39:22,061 --> 00:39:24,520
like the skilled trades people
make a damn good living.

1085
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,770
But heavy machinery operators,

1086
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:28,030
very few women there too.

1087
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:28,840
So,

1088
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,940
but the percentage of work related deaths,

1089
00:39:30,970 --> 00:39:33,130
93% well that's a problem.

1090
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:34,420
Yeah.

1091
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,500
I mean that there's a bunch of reasons
why men make more money on average than

1092
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:39,010
women do.

1093
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,300
And one of them is that they're,

1094
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,950
they're more willing to work outside.

1095
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,600
That's when they're more willing to move.

1096
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,730
That's another there.

1097
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:48,610
They work longer hours and
if you worked 13% more hours,

1098
00:39:48,611 --> 00:39:50,620
you make 40% more money on that.

1099
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:51,311
That's the stat.

1100
00:39:51,311 --> 00:39:51,580
So,

1101
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,220
so that the effect of
overtime is nonlinear.

1102
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,930
13% more hours.

1103
00:39:55,931 --> 00:39:57,340
40% more income.

1104
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,233
Yeah.

1105
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:58,710
Wow.

1106
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,020
Yeah,

1107
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,261
yeah,

1108
00:39:59,261 --> 00:39:59,531
yeah.

1109
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,364
Well you can,

1110
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,320
I think that's a good example of how,

1111
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:02,951
you know,

1112
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:06,160
let's say you have a bunch of employees
and you're trying to differentiate them

1113
00:40:06,161 --> 00:40:06,994
for promotion,

1114
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:07,811
like,

1115
00:40:07,811 --> 00:40:11,350
and let's say they're all operating
within a relatively narrow band.

1116
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:12,791
Perhaps they aren't,

1117
00:40:12,791 --> 00:40:14,740
but let's say for this example they are,

1118
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,281
it's like,

1119
00:40:15,281 --> 00:40:19,620
well the person who
puts out 10% more self,

1120
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:20,800
evidently so,

1121
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:22,810
well this guy's around like 10% more.

1122
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,011
That would be,

1123
00:40:24,011 --> 00:40:26,560
what about an extra 45 minutes a day,

1124
00:40:26,561 --> 00:40:27,370
something like that.

1125
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:30,520
He goes the extra mile while
he's going to get the promotion.

1126
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,830
And so you also get this,

1127
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,570
like it also looks,

1128
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,950
and this is worth thinking about too,

1129
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:38,710
and this is part of the
predo distribution problem,

1130
00:40:38,711 --> 00:40:41,890
is that success is
disproportionately rewarded.

1131
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,571
It's not linear.

1132
00:40:43,571 --> 00:40:45,760
So as you start to succeed,

1133
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:46,330
the probe,

1134
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:51,160
each success nonlinearly increases
the probability of the next success.

1135
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:51,881
Right?

1136
00:40:51,881 --> 00:40:53,260
So the door's open.

1137
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:53,700
Yeah,

1138
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:53,840
we,

1139
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,101
yeah,

1140
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:54,210
we,

1141
00:40:54,210 --> 00:40:54,490
yeah,

1142
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:55,090
that's right.

1143
00:40:55,090 --> 00:40:56,050
And not one door,

1144
00:40:56,051 --> 00:40:57,430
but they open exponentially.

1145
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,061
Right?

1146
00:40:58,061 --> 00:40:58,601
Exactly.

1147
00:40:58,601 --> 00:40:59,230
And so,

1148
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:00,100
and as you fail,

1149
00:41:00,101 --> 00:41:01,390
they close exponentially.

1150
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,590
So you might think,

1151
00:41:02,591 --> 00:41:03,424
well,

1152
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:04,743
failure,

1153
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,800
success,

1154
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,533
linear,

1155
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:11,530
it's like no failure success,

1156
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,550
right?

1157
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:13,840
So once you start to fail,

1158
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,740
good luck to you,

1159
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:15,490
right?

1160
00:41:15,490 --> 00:41:18,550
Because each failure increases the
probability of the next failure in a

1161
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:20,140
nonlinear mash fashion.

1162
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:20,920
And that really,

1163
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,330
if you're on a downhill trend,

1164
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:22,750
man,

1165
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:24,850
that's really vicious and
it's hard to get out of it.

1166
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,910
You see that happen to big companies when
they start to go into a death spiral,

1167
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,410
they can't pull themselves out of it.

1168
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,000
But by the same token,

1169
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:32,110
when you start to succeed,

1170
00:41:32,410 --> 00:41:34,100
each success increases

1171
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,210
the probability of the next week.

1172
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,280
You actually even see that with lobsters.

1173
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,930
So back to the crustaceans.

1174
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,973
Well,

1175
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,490
they'd so interesting that some of these
things are so fundamental that they

1176
00:41:43,491 --> 00:41:44,990
appear so low in the file,

1177
00:41:44,991 --> 00:41:45,830
a genetic change.

1178
00:41:45,831 --> 00:41:46,850
So if you,

1179
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,640
if you Kelly up,

1180
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,950
you watch a lobster engaged in sequence,

1181
00:41:51,951 --> 00:41:53,450
sequential dominance dispute.

1182
00:41:53,451 --> 00:41:56,000
So basically physical challenges,

1183
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,373
um,

1184
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,090
his probability if he loses the problem,

1185
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,230
if he loses the battle,

1186
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:08,210
the probability that he'll lose the next
battle is higher than you would expect

1187
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:10,340
if you just derived a linear function.

1188
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,420
That was a consequence of the telly
of his previous victories and losses.

1189
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:15,680
So because he's lost,

1190
00:42:15,681 --> 00:42:18,560
he's more likely to lose
harder the next time,

1191
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:19,790
but if he wins,

1192
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,740
he's statistically more likely to win.

1193
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:22,910
So and,

1194
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,050
and that also drives well that's a
fundamental issue to that drives the

1195
00:42:27,051 --> 00:42:32,030
disproportionate distribution of
productive goods and material resources,

1196
00:42:32,031 --> 00:42:33,110
which is a very big problem.

1197
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:36,130
It's another thing to have an intelligent
discussion about in our Dev site.

1198
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:38,480
Definitely we're going to get
there in this conversation as well.

1199
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,110
So just before we wrap up the
point about big five and gender,

1200
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,140
I have a thought about this
and it involves a company
that is very close to us

1201
00:42:47,301 --> 00:42:48,290
here in the bay area,

1202
00:42:48,291 --> 00:42:49,124
Google.

1203
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,050
And the question about

1204
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:57,730
Google is could it potentially be in the
interest of a company to want to bring

1205
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:06,430
diverse people from around the world
in to increase the creativity of their

1206
00:43:06,831 --> 00:43:07,664
output?

1207
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,350
It depends on how you define diverse,

1208
00:43:09,410 --> 00:43:11,660
but I would say you guys have
already done that in silicon valley.

1209
00:43:11,661 --> 00:43:12,021
It's like,

1210
00:43:12,021 --> 00:43:12,854
well how many people,

1211
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,100
how many people in Silicon Valley or
from the Indian Institute of Technology?

1212
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,210
It's like,

1213
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:17,541
God,

1214
00:43:17,541 --> 00:43:18,374
they're everywhere.

1215
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,161
You know,

1216
00:43:19,161 --> 00:43:20,690
and and no wonder while,

1217
00:43:20,691 --> 00:43:21,170
so that's,

1218
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,280
but that's cognitive,

1219
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:23,810
that's that's cognitive ability.

1220
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:28,811
Like look is if there's someone that's
birth in a different part of the world

1221
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:31,040
that has a different upbringing,

1222
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,840
that could potentially
bring something unique,

1223
00:43:32,841 --> 00:43:33,591
a unique person.

1224
00:43:33,591 --> 00:43:35,090
There's no evidence for that whatsoever.

1225
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,241
There's no,

1226
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:39,170
there's no,

1227
00:43:39,171 --> 00:43:40,370
there's no evidence for that.

1228
00:43:40,371 --> 00:43:41,630
That is not how you get,

1229
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:43,850
that's not the right
definition of diversity.

1230
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,530
But could it also be potentially that we
are not measuring and focusing on that

1231
00:43:48,531 --> 00:43:49,940
in order to find that data?

1232
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:51,643
No.

1233
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:53,301
No,

1234
00:43:53,301 --> 00:43:53,841
it's not.

1235
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:55,370
It's not because look,

1236
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,130
measuring success is not an easy thing.

1237
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,910
And you think it should be
meritocracy no matter what period.

1238
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:03,381
No,

1239
00:44:03,381 --> 00:44:03,680
there's,

1240
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,070
there's this,

1241
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:05,510
there's always a fly in the ointment

1242
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:07,940
there.

1243
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:08,560
There is.

1244
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,830
There's so the other thing,

1245
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:13,970
there's a good book that I would recommend
reading called the great leveler by

1246
00:44:13,971 --> 00:44:14,781
Walter Shydel.

1247
00:44:14,781 --> 00:44:15,471
It's a new book,

1248
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:16,370
relatively new book,

1249
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:19,730
and he details out the,

1250
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,680
he details out the erratic
ability of inequality.

1251
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:30,200
So part of the problem with this process
that we just described where success

1252
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:31,830
breeds success and failure breeds

1253
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:32,311
failure,

1254
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:37,311
is that the people who are succeeding
get a disproportionate share of the

1255
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,300
resource pie,

1256
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,143
let's say.

1257
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,183
Um,

1258
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,240
so you know,

1259
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,440
everyone knows that about money,

1260
00:44:43,441 --> 00:44:43,770
right?

1261
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,380
Because the 12 richest
people in the world,

1262
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,800
85 richest people in the world have
as much money as the bottom 2 billion,

1263
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:51,570
which seems while,

1264
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:52,710
let's say unfair,

1265
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,640
now,

1266
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,990
it's certainly unequal.

1267
00:44:55,230 --> 00:45:00,230
Now whether it's I believe his Lord and
this statistic is the eight richest have

1268
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:03,060
equal to the bottom 3.5 billion.

1269
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:03,371
Yeah,

1270
00:45:03,371 --> 00:45:06,030
well I think it's probably worse than
it was when I looked at this about three

1271
00:45:06,031 --> 00:45:06,481
years ago.

1272
00:45:06,481 --> 00:45:06,691
So,

1273
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:07,250
but it doesn't,

1274
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,081
it doesn't matter cause you,

1275
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:08,400
you,

1276
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,061
you get the point.

1277
00:45:09,061 --> 00:45:11,190
But it's not crazy.

1278
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:14,670
But the thing is is that this is not
something that only applies to money.

1279
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,850
It applies to everything
that's creatively produced.

1280
00:45:18,690 --> 00:45:23,310
So the same rule applies to number
of records sold by recording artists.

1281
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,890
The same rule applies to number
of books sold by novelists.

1282
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:29,100
The same rule applies to number of
goals scored by Nhl hockey players.

1283
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:32,700
The same rule applies to the population
of cities and the massive stars and the

1284
00:45:32,701 --> 00:45:33,640
size of trees in the,

1285
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:34,533
in the jungle.

1286
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,920
It's like the inequality problem is
way more troublesome again then mere

1287
00:45:40,891 --> 00:45:41,724
capitalism,

1288
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,550
it's a terrible problem
and Shydel is work,

1289
00:45:44,551 --> 00:45:45,211
which is really,

1290
00:45:45,211 --> 00:45:45,931
really interesting.

1291
00:45:45,931 --> 00:45:50,931
He's traced back inequality
10 15,000 years using,

1292
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,410
you can do it for example,

1293
00:45:52,411 --> 00:45:55,440
let's say you find a Neolithic burial
site and there's 200 people in it,

1294
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:59,520
so these people would be buried with
their possessions and obviously some of

1295
00:45:59,521 --> 00:46:00,031
them decay,

1296
00:46:00,031 --> 00:46:01,080
but some of them don't.

1297
00:46:01,081 --> 00:46:03,330
And like some of them
are buried with gold.

1298
00:46:03,630 --> 00:46:04,830
Well hardly any of them.

1299
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,910
And the tiny proportion of people who
are born bird with gold are burned with a

1300
00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:09,930
lot of gold.

1301
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,130
So you can even drive a
Gini Coefficient estimate,

1302
00:46:14,131 --> 00:46:16,500
which is an estimate of
inequality from burial sites.

1303
00:46:16,501 --> 00:46:18,810
And it looks like as soon
as you get a surplus,

1304
00:46:18,811 --> 00:46:19,710
you get inequality.

1305
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,320
And that's a rough thing
because you might think,

1306
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:25,710
well even in hunter gatherer
societies where there's no surplus,

1307
00:46:25,711 --> 00:46:28,140
there's still inequality cause
there's inequality of friendship,

1308
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:30,990
there's inequality of health and
there's inequality of sexual access.

1309
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,063
And those things are,

1310
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:33,060
they are not trivial.

1311
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:35,370
But when you're thinking
about it purely economically,

1312
00:46:35,371 --> 00:46:36,490
you start to get an inequality.

1313
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,400
As soon as you get a surplus you think,

1314
00:46:38,401 --> 00:46:39,840
oh that's interesting.

1315
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:44,250
So there's a natural rule which
is surplus generates inequality.

1316
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:45,091
All right,

1317
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:46,560
so how do you solve that?

1318
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,880
And Shy Dell's book says,

1319
00:46:47,881 --> 00:46:48,714
well that's easy.

1320
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:50,970
You just get rid of the surplus.

1321
00:46:52,470 --> 00:46:52,801
Right?

1322
00:46:52,801 --> 00:46:53,880
And that's not good.

1323
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:54,921
So like he,

1324
00:46:54,921 --> 00:46:58,140
he found and so one of the things
he did was statistical analysis.

1325
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,490
Cause one of the things he might ask is,

1326
00:46:59,491 --> 00:47:03,990
well let's say you have your measures of
inequality and then you can track them

1327
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:08,100
around the world and you can track whether
or not the inequality is generated by

1328
00:47:08,101 --> 00:47:10,200
a right wing government
or a left wing government.

1329
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:11,341
And then you might hope,

1330
00:47:11,341 --> 00:47:13,740
well the left wing governments
would ameliorate inequality.

1331
00:47:13,860 --> 00:47:15,180
There's no evidence for that at all.

1332
00:47:15,510 --> 00:47:18,210
It doesn't look like
inequality is with it.

1333
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:22,530
It doesn't look like the amelioration
of inequality is within the purview of

1334
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:23,850
political organization.

1335
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:25,321
And you should like,

1336
00:47:25,321 --> 00:47:29,120
you should not hear that with any degree
of happiness whatsoever because the

1337
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:33,910
social science on inequality is also
clear as inequality levels increase,

1338
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,860
society's destabilize.

1339
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:37,630
And the best indicator of that,

1340
00:47:37,631 --> 00:47:39,820
I already mentioned that that
was work that was done by

1341
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,550
Martin Daly and Margo Wilson at
McMaster university in Canada.

1342
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:48,730
They're really interested in what drove
male homicide because most homicide is

1343
00:47:48,731 --> 00:47:49,330
male,

1344
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,290
male on male.

1345
00:47:50,350 --> 00:47:51,490
It's mostly young males.

1346
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:54,700
It's mostly within race and
it's mostly status competition,

1347
00:47:55,150 --> 00:47:55,420
right?

1348
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:55,960
So,

1349
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:00,220
and the status competitions get
intense where inequality increases.

1350
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:02,110
So where everyone's poor.

1351
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:06,610
So if you rank order American states
and Canadian provinces by inequality,

1352
00:48:07,270 --> 00:48:09,490
the poor provinces where everyone's poor,

1353
00:48:09,491 --> 00:48:12,700
there's no male aggression and the rich
provinces and states where everyone's

1354
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:13,031
rich,

1355
00:48:13,031 --> 00:48:15,490
there's no male male homicide,

1356
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:19,360
but the states and provinces
where inequality is high,

1357
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:23,320
the male homicide rates starts to climb
up and it's probably the most aggressive

1358
00:48:23,321 --> 00:48:28,150
males who get most aggressive most
rapidly when inequality increases.

1359
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:30,130
So there's a psychological component,

1360
00:48:30,310 --> 00:48:33,520
but inequality drives male
homicide 0.9 is the correlation,

1361
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,730
which means that you actually don't
need any other explanation for male

1362
00:48:36,731 --> 00:48:37,151
homicide.

1363
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:39,400
Maybe you throw in alcohol just just as a,

1364
00:48:39,401 --> 00:48:40,720
as an extraneous variable.

1365
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:44,230
You don't need any other explanation for
the male homicide rate than inequality.

1366
00:48:44,710 --> 00:48:45,910
It's a staggering work.

1367
00:48:45,911 --> 00:48:47,380
It's absolutely staggering work.

1368
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:49,040
And so the,

1369
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,310
the thing is is that a meritocracy will
drive inequality and then you have a

1370
00:48:54,311 --> 00:48:57,850
problem because people stack up at
zero and they can't get out of zero.

1371
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,490
Cause that's what happens
as inequality increases.

1372
00:49:00,491 --> 00:49:03,100
People think about when
you're playing monopoly,

1373
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:03,963
you know the game.

1374
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:07,270
I mean that's a perfect example
of how inequality emerges.

1375
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:08,770
Everybody's equal to begin with.

1376
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,120
Everybody basically plays a random game
because monopolies basically a random

1377
00:49:13,121 --> 00:49:13,421
game.

1378
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:14,410
I mean there's some skill in it,

1379
00:49:14,411 --> 00:49:15,890
but not much so.

1380
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,380
So it's a random game.

1381
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,770
So what happens when everyone starts
equal and you play a random game?

1382
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:22,630
One person ends up with everything.

1383
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,250
Everyone else stacks up at zero.

1384
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:28,960
Now shy Dell's book basically shows the
only way out of that is various forms of

1385
00:49:28,961 --> 00:49:29,560
war,

1386
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:30,610
including revolution.

1387
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:31,990
And epidemics.

1388
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:32,680
That's it.

1389
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,390
That's the only thing he's
been able to track that.

1390
00:49:34,550 --> 00:49:34,780
And,

1391
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:38,920
and what happens is when you level
everyone and then inequality decreases,

1392
00:49:39,010 --> 00:49:39,311
it's like,

1393
00:49:39,311 --> 00:49:40,144
well,

1394
00:49:40,540 --> 00:49:41,373
okay,

1395
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:45,280
that doesn't seem like
a really great solution.

1396
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:48,520
[inaudible] and this seems to be
even more and more pressing with the

1397
00:49:48,521 --> 00:49:51,100
proliferation of artificial intelligence,

1398
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,330
robotics,

1399
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,400
genetic engineering,

1400
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,330
neuroprosthetics,

1401
00:49:54,340 --> 00:49:55,380
nanotechnology,

1402
00:49:55,570 --> 00:49:59,920
and the race between China and the
United States and Russia colonizing Mars.

1403
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,240
What is going,

1404
00:50:01,241 --> 00:50:06,241
how do we actually end up coming to a
global consensus on what to do as eight

1405
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:10,290
people equate and wealth to the bottom 12.

1406
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:15,070
I don't see why we have to
have an intelligent discussion
about this because on

1407
00:50:15,071 --> 00:50:15,790
the one hand,

1408
00:50:15,790 --> 00:50:20,790
it's pretty obvious that modern economies
are doing a damn good job of lifting

1409
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:22,810
people rapidly out of abject poverty.

1410
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:23,740
Okay.

1411
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:24,880
But at the same time,

1412
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,500
the inequality of,

1413
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:31,740
of the economic inequality
by some measures at least
is increasing and that does

1414
00:50:32,211 --> 00:50:33,770
have this destabilizing effect.

1415
00:50:34,310 --> 00:50:35,370
And so then the question is what,

1416
00:50:35,371 --> 00:50:36,290
what do you do about it?

1417
00:50:36,590 --> 00:50:36,861
Well,

1418
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:40,280
it's really hard because in a meritocracy,

1419
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:42,470
part of that's driven by,

1420
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:43,783
um,

1421
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,800
segregation by intelligence.

1422
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:52,240
And then that's likely exaggerated by
the provision of computational power

1423
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:56,600
because it really smart person with a
computer is way smarter than a really

1424
00:50:56,601 --> 00:51:00,830
smart person without a computer and is
and is way smarter than a person who

1425
00:51:00,831 --> 00:51:03,290
isn't so smart either with
or without a computer.

1426
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:03,711
Right?

1427
00:51:03,711 --> 00:51:06,350
So the computational technology
looks like it's a multiplier.

1428
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:10,130
Like I'm sure many of you already know
now because there's a huge difference

1429
00:51:10,131 --> 00:51:13,730
between someone who can really use a
computer and someone who's barely computer

1430
00:51:13,731 --> 00:51:18,080
literate and lots of way more people are
barely computer literate literate than

1431
00:51:18,081 --> 00:51:18,650
you know.

1432
00:51:18,650 --> 00:51:19,790
So here's a good stat.

1433
00:51:19,830 --> 00:51:21,560
This is like,

1434
00:51:21,561 --> 00:51:22,730
I'm really familiar,

1435
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:25,910
I've really familiarized myself with
the ICU literature and had said dismal,

1436
00:51:25,911 --> 00:51:26,780
horrible literature.

1437
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:27,350
But,

1438
00:51:27,350 --> 00:51:30,680
but you really need to know it because
it's a solid literature unfortunately.

1439
00:51:30,681 --> 00:51:31,560
And um,

1440
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,000
one of the most terrifying statistics I
ever came across was one detailing out

1441
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:41,450
the rationale of the United States Armed
Forces for not allowing the induct.

1442
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,840
You can't induct anyone into the armed
forces in the US if they have an Iq of

1443
00:51:44,841 --> 00:51:45,680
less than 83.

1444
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:46,971
Okay.

1445
00:51:46,971 --> 00:51:49,880
So let's just take that apart for a
minute because it's a horrifying thing.

1446
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,470
So the US armed forces has been in the
forefront of intelligence research since

1447
00:51:54,590 --> 00:51:59,510
World War One because they were on board
early with the idea that especially

1448
00:51:59,511 --> 00:52:02,540
during war time when you're ramping up
quickly that you need to sort people

1449
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,400
effectively and essentially without
prejudice so that you can build up the

1450
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:09,380
officer corps so you
don't lose the damn war.

1451
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:09,651
Okay.

1452
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:12,440
So there's real motivation
to get it right,

1453
00:52:12,470 --> 00:52:12,711
right.

1454
00:52:12,711 --> 00:52:13,910
Cause it's life and death issue.

1455
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:15,230
So they used Iq,

1456
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,750
they did a lot of the early
psychometric work on Iq.

1457
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:18,411
Okay.

1458
00:52:18,411 --> 00:52:19,310
So that's the first thing.

1459
00:52:19,311 --> 00:52:19,490
They're,

1460
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:21,470
they're motivated to find
an accurate predictor.

1461
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,790
So they settled on Iq.

1462
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:28,190
The second thing was the United States
armed forces also really motivated to get

1463
00:52:28,191 --> 00:52:29,750
people into the armed forces.

1464
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,970
Peace time or war time or time.

1465
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:33,140
Well for obvious reasons,

1466
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,400
peace time because,

1467
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:36,770
well first of all you got to
keep the armed forces going.

1468
00:52:36,771 --> 00:52:37,604
And second,

1469
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,360
you can use the armed forces during peace
time as a way of taking people out of

1470
00:52:41,361 --> 00:52:45,080
the underclass and moving them up into
the working class or the middle class.

1471
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:45,320
Right?

1472
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:47,630
You can use it as a
training mechanism and,

1473
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:50,000
and so there's left and right.

1474
00:52:50,001 --> 00:52:50,990
Can agree on that.

1475
00:52:50,991 --> 00:52:51,231
You know,

1476
00:52:51,231 --> 00:52:51,411
it's,

1477
00:52:51,411 --> 00:52:54,560
it's a reasonable way of
promoting social mobility.

1478
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:55,603
So again,

1479
00:52:55,730 --> 00:52:56,451
the armed forces,

1480
00:52:56,451 --> 00:53:00,860
even in peace time is very motivated to
get as many people in as they possibly

1481
00:53:00,861 --> 00:53:01,400
can.

1482
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,930
And it's difficult as well.

1483
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:04,550
It's not that easy to recruit people,

1484
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,740
so you don't want to throw
people out if you don't have to.

1485
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:08,990
So what's the upshot of all that?

1486
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:13,220
While after a hundred years
essentially of of statistic,

1487
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:14,780
careful statistical analysis,

1488
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:18,170
the armed forces concluded that
if you had an Iq of 83 or less,

1489
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:22,370
there wasn't anything you could possibly
be trained to do in the military at any

1490
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,280
level of the organization that
wasn't positively counterproductive.

1491
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:27,721
Okay.

1492
00:53:27,721 --> 00:53:28,051
You think,

1493
00:53:28,051 --> 00:53:28,291
well,

1494
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:28,800
so what,

1495
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:29,820
83 okay.

1496
00:53:29,850 --> 00:53:30,360
Yeah.

1497
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,193
One in 10,

1498
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:35,550
one in 10 that's one in 10 people.

1499
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:40,350
And that what that really means that as
far as I can tell is if you imagine that

1500
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:44,250
the military is approximately as
complex as the broader society,

1501
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,500
which I think is a reasonable proposition,

1502
00:53:46,830 --> 00:53:51,030
then there's no place in our cognitively
complex society for one in 10 people.

1503
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,710
So what are we going to do about that?

1504
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,810
The answer is no one knows.

1505
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,180
Say well shovel money down the hierarchy.

1506
00:53:57,181 --> 00:53:59,850
It's like the problem isn't lack of money.

1507
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:01,440
I mean sometimes that's the problem,

1508
00:54:01,441 --> 00:54:03,690
but the problem is
rarely absolute poverty.

1509
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,340
It's rarely that it is sometimes,

1510
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,443
but rarely.

1511
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,940
It's not that easy to move
money down the hierarchy.

1512
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,380
So first of all,

1513
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:11,760
it's not that easy to manage money.

1514
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:15,090
So it's a vicious problem,

1515
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:15,420
man.

1516
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,120
And so it's hard to train
people to become creative,

1517
00:54:18,121 --> 00:54:20,430
adaptive problem solvers as possible.

1518
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,373
You can do it,

1519
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:23,790
you cannot do it.

1520
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,340
You can interfere with
their conquerors ability,

1521
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:27,900
but you can't.

1522
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,800
You can't do that.

1523
00:54:28,801 --> 00:54:29,760
It's training doesn't work.

1524
00:54:29,761 --> 00:54:31,050
It's not as well as six months,

1525
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,970
but it could work in six years.

1526
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:33,210
No,

1527
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,043
it doesn't work.

1528
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,001
Sorry.

1529
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:37,770
It doesn't work like the data on.

1530
00:54:37,771 --> 00:54:39,030
That's crystal clear as well.

1531
00:54:39,031 --> 00:54:39,241
Look,

1532
00:54:39,241 --> 00:54:40,230
I can give you an example.

1533
00:54:40,231 --> 00:54:45,180
So I knew a bunch of people who run MBA
programs and I've had discussions with

1534
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:48,800
them because the thing about
an MBA program is it's,

1535
00:54:48,870 --> 00:54:49,621
if it's selective,

1536
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:50,640
it's really hard to get in.

1537
00:54:50,850 --> 00:54:51,930
It's like getting into Harvard.

1538
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:53,670
It's really hard to get into Harvard.

1539
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:57,600
You have to have an Iq that places
you at least at the 99th percentile,

1540
00:54:57,870 --> 00:55:01,110
and then you have to be really good
at at least one or two other things.

1541
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,020
So it's really hard to get in.

1542
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:05,011
Okay,

1543
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:05,491
so you think,

1544
00:55:05,491 --> 00:55:05,880
well,

1545
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,320
why hire a Harvard graduate?

1546
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:07,681
Well,

1547
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:08,940
it's the quality of the education.

1548
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:09,331
It's like,

1549
00:55:09,331 --> 00:55:09,451
no,

1550
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:10,284
it's not.

1551
00:55:10,410 --> 00:55:11,970
It's the fact that it's
really hard to get it.

1552
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:17,070
All of the value of the Ivy League
education is in the screening before the,

1553
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:18,173
before the,

1554
00:55:18,270 --> 00:55:18,780
uh,

1555
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:20,190
before the education starts.

1556
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,290
Now that doesn't mean that people,

1557
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,060
people go to Harvard
and they get educated,

1558
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:26,520
but they'd get just as educated
if they went somewhere else.

1559
00:55:26,850 --> 00:55:27,301
First of all,

1560
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:32,301
it's like every university contains more
information than any student can ever

1561
00:55:32,881 --> 00:55:34,050
possibly process.

1562
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,400
If you're super smart,

1563
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,620
you can be dropped into a state college.

1564
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:39,000
Some are low level state college,

1565
00:55:39,001 --> 00:55:41,010
he's spending four years in the library,

1566
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:42,031
you know,

1567
00:55:42,031 --> 00:55:42,440
like what,

1568
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:42,901
what are you going to do?

1569
00:55:42,901 --> 00:55:44,010
Read the whole library.

1570
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:44,963
No,

1571
00:55:45,390 --> 00:55:45,781
right.

1572
00:55:45,781 --> 00:55:46,290
So,

1573
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:48,060
so in the data on this is quite clear.

1574
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:48,894
It's like,

1575
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:50,580
and it's the same with private schools.

1576
00:55:50,581 --> 00:55:53,910
The reason that people who go to private
schools do better than people who go to

1577
00:55:53,911 --> 00:55:56,310
public schools is because
generally speaking,

1578
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:58,650
the people who go into
private schools are smarter.

1579
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:00,780
It's not the education that's any better.

1580
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:04,740
And so we radically overestimate
the degree to which training works.

1581
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:07,080
So now you can train people to be stupid.

1582
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:07,860
That's,

1583
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,410
but training them to be smarter
than they are is really,

1584
00:56:10,411 --> 00:56:10,681
really,

1585
00:56:10,681 --> 00:56:11,514
really hard.

1586
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:12,840
So like I said,

1587
00:56:12,841 --> 00:56:13,920
it's a dismal literature.

1588
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:19,340
And Liberals see the liberals think
everyone's roughly equal and there's a job

1589
00:56:19,531 --> 00:56:19,921
for everyone.

1590
00:56:19,921 --> 00:56:20,850
You just have to train them.

1591
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,960
It's like no wrong.

1592
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:23,470
And the Conservatives think,

1593
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:23,951
well,

1594
00:56:23,951 --> 00:56:24,130
there's

1595
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,710
a job for everyone if they just
get off their ass and work.

1596
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:26,981
It's like,

1597
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:27,520
no,

1598
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:27,880
no,

1599
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:28,713
that's wrong too.

1600
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:30,850
Even though if you work,

1601
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,893
that's better.

1602
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,180
And well,

1603
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:35,740
so that's on the conservative end,

1604
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:40,090
but the liberals won't take into account
individual differences while obviously

1605
00:56:40,091 --> 00:56:42,550
that's part of what the whole
politically correct discussion is about.

1606
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:43,960
It's like everyone's the same.

1607
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:44,913
It's like,

1608
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:46,053
yeah.

1609
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:46,840
Um,

1610
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,673
they're not,

1611
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:51,723
you don't want to find it.

1612
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,833
It's really,

1613
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,460
it's really annoying.

1614
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,870
I would say like,

1615
00:56:55,871 --> 00:56:56,350
I love,

1616
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:56,580
love,

1617
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,820
love to come to silicon valley.

1618
00:56:57,821 --> 00:56:58,451
I've been here many,

1619
00:56:58,451 --> 00:57:02,070
many times and like it's really
something to come here and,

1620
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:03,383
and,

1621
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:04,293
and meet.

1622
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:08,020
There's so many people here who off
the scales intelligence and they're all

1623
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:09,101
clustered together,

1624
00:57:09,101 --> 00:57:12,670
which is why this place is so unbelievably
rich and so unbelievably productive.

1625
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,713
One of the reasons,

1626
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:14,681
but it's very,

1627
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:19,090
it's also very annoying that it's so left
leaning because one of the things that

1628
00:57:19,091 --> 00:57:24,091
the left leaning Silicon Valley geniuses
should understand that is that they're

1629
00:57:25,030 --> 00:57:29,320
the beneficiary of a genetic lottery
and they should take that seriously.

1630
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:29,651
It's like,

1631
00:57:29,651 --> 00:57:29,821
yeah,

1632
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:30,001
yeah.

1633
00:57:30,001 --> 00:57:30,641
You worked hard.

1634
00:57:30,641 --> 00:57:30,911
Yes.

1635
00:57:30,911 --> 00:57:31,631
Your entrepreneurial.

1636
00:57:31,631 --> 00:57:31,901
Yes.

1637
00:57:31,901 --> 00:57:32,561
You're on point.

1638
00:57:32,561 --> 00:57:34,090
You put into your 60 hours a week,

1639
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:34,571
you know,

1640
00:57:34,571 --> 00:57:35,950
you do everything you could do.

1641
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:39,160
You have an Iq of 150 and
like that's not your doing,

1642
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,480
right?

1643
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,040
That's something that happened to you.

1644
00:57:42,430 --> 00:57:44,200
And so you can't be saying,

1645
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:44,790
well,

1646
00:57:44,790 --> 00:57:45,020
it's,

1647
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:45,731
it's all me.

1648
00:57:45,731 --> 00:57:46,150
It's like,

1649
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:46,983
no,

1650
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:47,943
it's not.

1651
00:57:48,430 --> 00:57:52,240
It's all you and the genius
that you were granted as a,

1652
00:57:52,390 --> 00:57:53,223
as an infant.

1653
00:57:53,750 --> 00:57:54,040
It's,

1654
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:54,670
that's it.

1655
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:55,630
That's what's driving it.

1656
00:57:55,990 --> 00:58:00,460
Now that doesn't mean I think that
people have disproportionate intelligence

1657
00:58:00,461 --> 00:58:03,370
shouldn't be rewarded disproportionately.

1658
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:07,180
It's possible that they should because
it might be in the best interest of

1659
00:58:07,181 --> 00:58:12,181
everyone else to dump as much money as
possible to the top 2% of the cognitive

1660
00:58:12,791 --> 00:58:15,670
strata because they're going
to be most generative with it.

1661
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,193
And so,

1662
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:18,760
and even if it's not fair,

1663
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:19,511
because you might say,

1664
00:58:19,511 --> 00:58:19,751
well,

1665
00:58:19,751 --> 00:58:21,250
just because he won the genetic lottery,

1666
00:58:21,251 --> 00:58:23,410
does that mean that you should
have more money than anyone else?

1667
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:23,950
It's like,

1668
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:24,101
well,

1669
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:25,750
not on the grounds of fairness,

1670
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:29,350
but if you have to distribute money while
who are you going to distribute it to?

1671
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:30,551
You know,

1672
00:58:30,551 --> 00:58:34,180
and I think ti was it Ted who ran CNN,

1673
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:35,163
Ted Turner,

1674
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:38,620
he estimated that if you tried as
hard as you could in your entire life,

1675
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:42,340
there was no way that you could
spend more than $400 million.

1676
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:45,730
And so like let's say you have more
money than that at your disposal,

1677
00:58:45,731 --> 00:58:48,700
well hopefully you're going to do some
halfways intelligent things with it.

1678
00:58:48,701 --> 00:58:52,150
And hopefully you would expect that the
more intelligent people would do more

1679
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,670
than halfway intelligent things with it.

1680
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:58,690
So if you have to have
unequal distribution than a
meritocracy is probably the

1681
00:58:58,691 --> 00:58:59,524
best way to do it.

1682
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,540
But it still leaves you
with this terrible problem,

1683
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:04,030
which is what do you do with all
the people who stack up at zero?

1684
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,750
And the answer isn't have contempt for
them because they don't work as hard as

1685
00:59:07,751 --> 00:59:08,080
you.

1686
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:08,351
It's like,

1687
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:08,501
yeah,

1688
00:59:08,501 --> 00:59:09,370
a bunch of them don't,

1689
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:09,851
you know,

1690
00:59:09,851 --> 00:59:12,730
because conscientiousness
also predicts success.

1691
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:14,410
So among the poor,

1692
00:59:14,411 --> 00:59:16,060
there are people who don't work,

1693
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:16,931
you know,

1694
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:21,920
but you never want to underestimate
the contribution of cognitive ability.

1695
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,270
So it's rough,

1696
00:59:23,271 --> 00:59:23,601
man,

1697
00:59:23,601 --> 00:59:26,150
and we don't take it seriously and
we don't know what to do about it.

1698
00:59:26,151 --> 00:59:28,910
And yet it's clear that
as inequality increases,

1699
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:30,230
society's destabilized.

1700
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,213
That's clear.

1701
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,650
So it's something that
has to be dealt with and,

1702
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:34,790
but we don't know how to deal with it.

1703
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:38,900
We don't know how to efficiently move
resources to the bottom end of the

1704
00:59:38,930 --> 00:59:41,900
competence hierarchy so that
things don't destabilize.

1705
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:43,483
So,

1706
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:43,761
you know,

1707
00:59:43,761 --> 00:59:44,810
and I've worked with people,

1708
00:59:44,811 --> 00:59:45,740
lots of people who are,

1709
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:49,430
who are at the bottom end of the
hierarchy in my clinical practice.

1710
00:59:49,431 --> 00:59:50,061
And you know,

1711
00:59:50,061 --> 00:59:51,620
like cocaine addicts for example,

1712
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:52,160
low [inaudible],

1713
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:52,641
low Iq,

1714
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:53,480
cocaine addicts,

1715
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:54,020
not,

1716
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:56,240
not all cocaine addicts
have low Iq by the way.

1717
00:59:56,241 --> 00:59:57,051
But you know,

1718
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:57,291
it's,

1719
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:57,861
it's just,

1720
00:59:57,861 --> 00:59:58,420
uh,

1721
00:59:58,420 --> 00:59:58,830
it's,

1722
00:59:58,830 --> 00:59:59,810
it's a triple whammy,

1723
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:00,201
let's say.

1724
01:00:00,201 --> 01:00:01,280
Cause if you're a cocaine addict,

1725
01:00:01,281 --> 01:00:02,630
you probably also an alcoholic.

1726
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:06,170
And so if you're a cocaine addict and
you're an alcoholic and you're sort of on

1727
01:00:06,171 --> 01:00:07,970
the low end of the cognitive distribution,

1728
01:00:07,971 --> 01:00:09,590
it's like you have pretty damn rough life.

1729
01:00:09,590 --> 01:00:11,000
There's a lot of things
going wrong for you.

1730
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,200
And you're really lucky if you're flat
broke because as soon as you get money,

1731
01:00:15,201 --> 01:00:16,130
you are so done,

1732
01:00:16,131 --> 01:00:17,060
you cannot believe it.

1733
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:22,040
So like when your unemployment check
comes in and you're a cocaine addict,

1734
01:00:22,041 --> 01:00:24,260
alcoholic who isn't employed,

1735
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,440
the probability that three days later
you're going to end up face down in the

1736
01:00:27,441 --> 01:00:28,340
ditch is really,

1737
01:00:28,341 --> 01:00:29,174
really high.

1738
01:00:29,420 --> 01:00:30,890
So don't be thinking like,

1739
01:00:30,891 --> 01:00:35,330
it's not so simple that you can just dump
money down the competence hierarchy to

1740
01:00:35,331 --> 01:00:35,750
the,

1741
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:38,330
to the people who are in the underclass
and expect that that's going to have a

1742
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:39,380
salutary effect.

1743
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,780
I don't think there's any
evidence for that whatsoever.

1744
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:45,560
It's like money is not an easy
resource to use productively.

1745
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:50,420
So is a class based speciation
something to be concerned about?

1746
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,573
Um,

1747
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:53,780
elaborate on that a little bit.

1748
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:55,580
What do you mean exactly?

1749
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:57,470
Well by class based speciation,

1750
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:02,060
meaning there's already a
tremendous amount of wealth
that is accumulated within

1751
01:01:02,061 --> 01:01:07,061
such a small percentage of people and
whether it be through a bifurcation of

1752
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:12,161
split of a couple billion people off
of the human species or it could be a

1753
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:13,791
trifurcation.

1754
01:01:13,791 --> 01:01:15,800
We don't know how many
splits there may be,

1755
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,323
whether that,

1756
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,570
I don't know if it's something to worry
about or something to hope for it.

1757
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:24,350
I mean this timescales are so large
that it's probably not relevant to

1758
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:29,000
individuals potentially something to hope
for in the evolutionary trajectory of

1759
01:01:29,001 --> 01:01:29,240
the human.

1760
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:31,040
Well you kind of hope
that people get smarter.

1761
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:33,090
My might get smarter across time.

1762
01:01:33,660 --> 01:01:35,510
I guess we would hope that
might be a good thing.

1763
01:01:35,570 --> 01:01:36,850
I mean it's not self evident so,

1764
01:01:36,851 --> 01:01:38,480
so if it is a lottery,

1765
01:01:38,600 --> 01:01:42,620
if it was a roll of the dice
to be born where we are,

1766
01:01:43,550 --> 01:01:48,530
don't we also feel that it could have
been rolled the dice to be born in a place

1767
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,260
less fortunate therefore sure.

1768
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:51,981
We do feel that.

1769
01:01:51,981 --> 01:01:53,180
I think that's why the didn't even know.

1770
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,140
Even if you're successful,

1771
01:01:54,141 --> 01:01:57,160
people often feel guilty
because of inequality and say,

1772
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:02,170
no wonder your ultimate calling in
terms of the width of religion and with,

1773
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:02,541
uh,

1774
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:06,140
with finding self actualization and
meaning within us to what you say,

1775
01:02:06,141 --> 01:02:10,190
eradicate suffering is something
that is give so much meaning to life.

1776
01:02:10,191 --> 01:02:10,790
Well,

1777
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:11,623
the,

1778
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:15,590
sometimes people in less
fortunate circumstances
experienced lots of suffering

1779
01:02:15,591 --> 01:02:20,591
with lack of food or water or
shelter or basic physiological needs.

1780
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,250
And so then therefore,

1781
01:02:23,251 --> 01:02:28,020
doesn't it feel like within this potential
class-based speciation with wealth

1782
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,720
that there should be some
sort of assistant course?

1783
01:02:32,210 --> 01:02:32,560
Of course.

1784
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:32,911
Okay.

1785
01:02:32,911 --> 01:02:34,710
And now the conversation
is how can we do that?

1786
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:36,060
So there's a couple of things there.

1787
01:02:36,061 --> 01:02:36,660
I mean,

1788
01:02:36,660 --> 01:02:37,493
to the degree,

1789
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,730
like you know,

1790
01:02:38,731 --> 01:02:41,960
I've been a vocal opponent
of the radical left and I,

1791
01:02:41,961 --> 01:02:42,350
I,

1792
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,550
I can't detest them enough really.

1793
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:45,720
Is this a fundamental,

1794
01:02:45,721 --> 01:02:47,280
is the fund my fundamental position?

1795
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:49,583
But

1796
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,870
that doesn't mean that
I don't think that uh,

1797
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,840
functioning polity requires
a left and a right wing.

1798
01:02:58,050 --> 01:02:58,681
Absolutely.

1799
01:02:58,681 --> 01:03:02,310
And the reason it requires a left wing
is because inequality is real and it has

1800
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:03,360
to be addressed.

1801
01:03:03,361 --> 01:03:05,970
It has to be addressed for all
the reasons that you described,

1802
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,283
but,

1803
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:08,423
but

1804
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:10,830
having said that,

1805
01:03:10,831 --> 01:03:15,831
there are ways to go about addressing it
that are clearly counterproductive and

1806
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:20,460
those were tried to great destructive
power in the 20th century and I don't

1807
01:03:20,461 --> 01:03:21,840
really think we need to do that again.

1808
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:26,460
The corollary to that is we don't know
what the productive means are now.

1809
01:03:26,461 --> 01:03:27,750
I've been thinking a lot about that,

1810
01:03:27,751 --> 01:03:28,011
you know,

1811
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:29,370
and I'm thinking,

1812
01:03:29,371 --> 01:03:29,940
well,

1813
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,800
how do you solve the
problem of inequality?

1814
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:37,130
And it has to be something like the moral
burden on those who are successful has

1815
01:03:38,461 --> 01:03:40,410
to be increased.

1816
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:41,490
It's something like that.

1817
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:42,900
And I think you see that,

1818
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:43,610
I mean,

1819
01:03:43,610 --> 01:03:44,790
I think I wrote this to you,

1820
01:03:44,791 --> 01:03:49,791
that what's the significance of
purchasing a third yacht rather than maybe

1821
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:52,720
hiring 50 people to solve
a problem in the world?

1822
01:03:52,721 --> 01:03:53,101
It's hard.

1823
01:03:53,101 --> 01:03:54,360
These things aren't so simple.

1824
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:54,631
You know,

1825
01:03:54,631 --> 01:03:58,680
like let's say that you decided to go
out to a restaurant and your meal is $500

1826
01:03:58,681 --> 01:03:59,251
and you might think,

1827
01:03:59,251 --> 01:04:00,870
well that's reprehensible and well,

1828
01:04:00,930 --> 01:04:02,460
perhaps you don't think
that's reprehensible.

1829
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:03,570
But the thing is,

1830
01:04:03,571 --> 01:04:05,610
it's not a bad way of
dispersing extra money.

1831
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:09,900
So it's not that obvious what rich
people should do with their money that's

1832
01:04:09,901 --> 01:04:10,734
beneficial.

1833
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:11,401
And you think,

1834
01:04:11,401 --> 01:04:11,730
well,

1835
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:13,830
should you buy a third yard
because do you really need it?

1836
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:14,400
And well,

1837
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,850
that's particularly perhaps a
particularly egregious example,

1838
01:04:17,851 --> 01:04:20,190
but it's not like you're not
employing people when you do that.

1839
01:04:20,310 --> 01:04:22,620
You shouldn't stuff the
money in your mattress.

1840
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:23,730
We could say that,

1841
01:04:23,731 --> 01:04:23,951
right.

1842
01:04:23,951 --> 01:04:25,320
Because that's just pure hoarding.

1843
01:04:25,321 --> 01:04:28,980
But most people who have money
aren't like scrooge McDuck.

1844
01:04:29,020 --> 01:04:31,830
They don't have a money been
that they swim in right there.

1845
01:04:31,831 --> 01:04:32,520
Money.

1846
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:33,061
Well that's,

1847
01:04:33,061 --> 01:04:33,894
that's the kind of,

1848
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:36,090
that's the kind of
clueless picture of wealth.

1849
01:04:36,091 --> 01:04:36,301
I mean,

1850
01:04:36,301 --> 01:04:37,920
most people who have money,

1851
01:04:37,921 --> 01:04:39,570
their money is out there doing things.

1852
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:40,410
It's not like they're,

1853
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:42,300
it's not like it's in their bedroom,

1854
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:42,740
you know,

1855
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:42,930
and,

1856
01:04:42,930 --> 01:04:44,580
and in gold coin form.

1857
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:48,900
So they're not hoarding it in exactly
the same way that perhaps people used to

1858
01:04:48,901 --> 01:04:52,730
hoard wealth when it
wasn't as abstracted and,

1859
01:04:52,740 --> 01:04:52,951
and,

1860
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:55,760
and functional in its own terms
out there in the aquarium.

1861
01:04:55,761 --> 01:04:58,500
Money is usually working for them,

1862
01:04:58,501 --> 01:04:59,520
making them more money.

1863
01:04:59,610 --> 01:04:59,851
Yeah.

1864
01:04:59,851 --> 01:05:01,800
But it's also doing a
bunch of other things.

1865
01:05:01,801 --> 01:05:02,131
You know?

1866
01:05:02,131 --> 01:05:03,720
And if you're a bad money manager,

1867
01:05:03,721 --> 01:05:04,531
even if you're wealthy,

1868
01:05:04,531 --> 01:05:06,330
you're money tends to
disappear very rapidly.

1869
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:10,110
That's another thing that's really worth
knowing is that like there is a 1% and

1870
01:05:10,111 --> 01:05:15,000
that 1% does have a disproportionate
amount of the money and 1% of that 1% has

1871
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:17,320
an even more disproportionate
amount of the money.

1872
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:21,970
It's scales all the way up the up
the measurement spectrum let's say,

1873
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:27,220
but there's actually quite a bit of
mobility within that 1% so you have a 10%

1874
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:31,600
chance in your lifetime in the United
States of being in the top 1% for at least

1875
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:31,990
a year.

1876
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,300
Now that's not like a
hundred percent chance,

1877
01:05:34,301 --> 01:05:36,760
but it's one in 10 it's not dismal,

1878
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:37,570
you know,

1879
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:38,430
so well,

1880
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:41,890
partly what you hope for is that
there's some genuine upward mobility.

1881
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,790
But then I think the other thing that
you hope for is that people who are

1882
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:50,791
disproportionately successful take it
upon themselves to do everything they

1883
01:05:51,041 --> 01:05:54,040
possibly can to do whatever they can.

1884
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,770
That's the best possible
thing to do with their money.

1885
01:05:57,130 --> 01:05:57,431
And you know,

1886
01:05:57,431 --> 01:06:00,280
I'm kind of an admirer of Bill
Gates for a variety of reasons,

1887
01:06:00,310 --> 01:06:04,240
but he's doing a really good job of
putting the boots to the five world,

1888
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:06,700
the world's five worst
transmissible diseases.

1889
01:06:06,701 --> 01:06:06,941
You know,

1890
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:08,140
and that's going quite nicely.

1891
01:06:08,141 --> 01:06:08,411
You know,

1892
01:06:08,411 --> 01:06:11,350
they're making some real
polios just about defunct.

1893
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,620
They're making some real
progress with malaria.

1894
01:06:14,650 --> 01:06:18,160
Like there's almost nothing that can be
possibly be done for Africa that would

1895
01:06:18,161 --> 01:06:19,960
be more useful than to get rid of malaria.

1896
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:23,380
Sleeping sickness would be another one
that would be really useful to allow to

1897
01:06:23,381 --> 01:06:23,951
eradicate.

1898
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:27,280
And so I would say that
the longterm solution,

1899
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,230
assuming that there is one,

1900
01:06:29,231 --> 01:06:29,411
two,

1901
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:33,700
the problem of inequality is that people
who are disproportionately fortunate,

1902
01:06:33,701 --> 01:06:34,480
let's say,

1903
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:38,020
or successful or both take it upon,

1904
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:43,170
take the moral duty of doing the best
possible good that they can with the money

1905
01:06:43,301 --> 01:06:44,134
that they generate.

1906
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:47,290
But the other thing I think that's sort
of interesting about that is I actually

1907
01:06:47,291 --> 01:06:50,050
don't think there's anything
more interesting to do with
your money that direct.

1908
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:50,710
It's like,

1909
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,740
can you think of anything more interesting
to do with your money than to find a

1910
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:57,040
really difficult problem that causes a
bunch of people suffering and then try to

1911
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:57,491
fix it?

1912
01:06:57,491 --> 01:06:58,570
It's like amazing.

1913
01:06:58,571 --> 01:07:01,810
If you have a clue that's gotta be
a little better than a third yacht.

1914
01:07:02,090 --> 01:07:02,350
Yeah.

1915
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:03,001
So yeah,

1916
01:07:03,001 --> 01:07:03,160
no,

1917
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:03,881
it's pretty low.

1918
01:07:03,881 --> 01:07:04,151
Well,

1919
01:07:04,151 --> 01:07:08,890
it's kind of a low bar like
that conspicuous consumption
thing at at some point

1920
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:14,160
it's just if you have any sense at some
point that's just not very impressive.

1921
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,071
Could it could.

1922
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:20,071
Another way to address the potential
class based speciation be the education of

1923
01:07:22,180 --> 01:07:27,180
the child and by the principles of let's
say that over the last hundred billion

1924
01:07:30,641 --> 01:07:35,290
people that have lived in died to build
this beautiful world we live in today

1925
01:07:35,291 --> 01:07:38,800
with all of the food and water ubiquity
and the governments and the economies

1926
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,370
that there,

1927
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:45,660
every child that's being stamped out
into this world might have a little tiny

1928
01:07:47,710 --> 01:07:52,710
missing chip on their shoulder and that
missing chip might be things like their

1929
01:07:53,831 --> 01:07:58,831
parents explaining to them what
evolution is or what their anatomy,

1930
01:08:02,471 --> 01:08:04,210
what their heart and their brain is,

1931
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:05,320
their body may be,

1932
01:08:05,321 --> 01:08:06,730
what morality is,

1933
01:08:06,731 --> 01:08:07,660
things like that.

1934
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:12,670
If maybe every child is born with a
little bit of something like that.

1935
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,410
Do you think there's
something like that Jordan?

1936
01:08:15,260 --> 01:08:15,471
Yeah.

1937
01:08:15,471 --> 01:08:16,304
This,

1938
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:19,070
you know like that's done right?

1939
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:24,320
This thing is connecting everyone to
everything and so the probability that

1940
01:08:24,321 --> 01:08:28,580
people are going to be get
whatever education they
want in the next 30 years is

1941
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:29,810
overwhelmingly high.

1942
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:31,760
So I think in some sense

1943
01:08:33,470 --> 01:08:36,560
that problem is being solved as
rapidly as it can possibly be.

1944
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:38,030
Be being solved.

1945
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:38,501
That is,

1946
01:08:38,501 --> 01:08:41,300
it doesn't mean people should stop trying
to find more and more effective ways

1947
01:08:41,301 --> 01:08:42,134
of educating.

1948
01:08:42,350 --> 01:08:46,530
I think that would be reading some general
basic principles that you think of.

1949
01:08:46,550 --> 01:08:50,030
Parents should teach a child
obviously within the rules of life,

1950
01:08:50,031 --> 01:08:55,031
but it may be something about evolution
or something about their own anatomy and

1951
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:56,450
well,

1952
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:57,283
I think that,

1953
01:08:58,430 --> 01:09:03,200
I think that there are all sorts of
things that parents who are good parents

1954
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,610
teach their children.

1955
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:05,271
I mean,

1956
01:09:05,271 --> 01:09:08,700
part of what 12 rules for
life is about is about that.

1957
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,060
It's like a universal
ethic in some sense there.

1958
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,920
I think that there is a,

1959
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:19,030
there's dawning realization among
members of the biologically oriented

1960
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:20,091
community.

1961
01:09:20,091 --> 01:09:24,770
Let's say that there is something like
an emergent ethic that's evident in

1962
01:09:25,370 --> 01:09:27,580
biological systems and um,

1963
01:09:28,670 --> 01:09:33,670
one of the most outstanding examples of
that I would say is apart from the work

1964
01:09:34,581 --> 01:09:36,440
that dwell has done with chimpanzees,

1965
01:09:36,441 --> 01:09:38,900
showing the beginnings of an ethic,

1966
01:09:39,860 --> 01:09:42,020
at least in in the behavioral sense,

1967
01:09:42,021 --> 01:09:45,590
the beginnings of an ethic among
chimpanzees is work that's being done with

1968
01:09:45,591 --> 01:09:46,131
rats.

1969
01:09:46,131 --> 01:09:47,960
And so Jaak Panksepp for example,

1970
01:09:47,961 --> 01:09:49,850
who wrote a book called
an affect of neuroscience,

1971
01:09:49,851 --> 01:09:50,990
which I would highly recommend.

1972
01:09:50,991 --> 01:09:52,160
It's a real work of genius.

1973
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,720
You blew my mind with Piaget,

1974
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:54,554
by the way,

1975
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:55,850
with the way that rats,

1976
01:09:56,420 --> 01:09:56,571
no,

1977
01:09:56,571 --> 01:09:58,490
that's Panksepp know.

1978
01:09:58,550 --> 01:09:59,570
Piaget found out,

1979
01:09:59,571 --> 01:10:00,770
found out that out in children.

1980
01:10:00,771 --> 01:10:01,310
So,

1981
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:01,521
oh,

1982
01:10:01,521 --> 01:10:04,370
Panksepp was a scientist who
discovered that rats laugh.

1983
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:05,600
It's hurting and you think,

1984
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:06,650
well that's not a big deal.

1985
01:10:06,651 --> 01:10:09,950
It's like actually it is a really big
deal because it shows that it shows

1986
01:10:09,951 --> 01:10:13,640
commonality of the positive emotion
systems across biological strata

1987
01:10:13,641 --> 01:10:14,121
essentially.

1988
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:15,380
So it's actually a really big deal.

1989
01:10:15,381 --> 01:10:18,710
And he found that if you
tickle routes with an Eraser,

1990
01:10:19,070 --> 01:10:22,280
they laugh ultrasonically and so you
have to slow it down to hear them.

1991
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:25,220
And the reason he figured figure that
out was because he was trying to figure

1992
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:26,054
out why.

1993
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:29,480
If you take rat pups away from their
mother and feed them and give them enough

1994
01:10:29,481 --> 01:10:29,781
water,

1995
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:30,620
they still die.

1996
01:10:31,690 --> 01:10:34,790
They die unless you massage them
with while he used a pencil eraser.

1997
01:10:34,791 --> 01:10:38,210
That's what cause it's Kinda soft and
it seems to work without harming the

1998
01:10:38,211 --> 01:10:38,621
routes.

1999
01:10:38,621 --> 01:10:39,500
A little rap pops in.

2000
01:10:39,770 --> 01:10:41,240
If you rub them with pencil racer,

2001
01:10:41,241 --> 01:10:42,110
then they'll thrive.

2002
01:10:42,290 --> 01:10:45,680
And that was actually translated very
rapidly into practical research because it

2003
01:10:45,681 --> 01:10:47,630
turns out that if you
have a premature infant,

2004
01:10:48,170 --> 01:10:49,310
it's an incubator.

2005
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,750
They often lose weight a,

2006
01:10:50,790 --> 01:10:53,180
which is a really bad thing because
they're supposed to be gaining weight.

2007
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:56,270
But if you massage them three
times a day for 10 minutes,

2008
01:10:56,271 --> 01:10:58,820
then they'll gain weight about
as fast as they do in utero.

2009
01:10:59,030 --> 01:11:01,520
And they leave the hospital
on average five days earlier.

2010
01:11:01,521 --> 01:11:05,810
And the beneficial cognitive
and physiological effects
are still detectable six

2011
01:11:05,811 --> 01:11:07,910
months down the road to walloping.

2012
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,740
It's a walloping effect.

2013
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:13,530
And so it turns out that one of the
things Panksepp sorted out was that human

2014
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:15,360
that touches a human need.

2015
01:11:15,630 --> 01:11:16,710
It's not a secondary need.

2016
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:17,521
It's a primary need.

2017
01:11:17,521 --> 01:11:20,160
Like like food and water
and childhood development.

2018
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:20,911
Yeah,

2019
01:11:20,911 --> 01:11:21,151
yeah.

2020
01:11:21,151 --> 01:11:21,361
Well.

2021
01:11:21,361 --> 01:11:25,020
And then he was also a big proponent of
rough and tumble play because he found

2022
01:11:25,021 --> 01:11:26,880
out that in routes that
rough and tumble play,

2023
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,350
especially among juvenile males,

2024
01:11:28,351 --> 01:11:32,760
catalyzes prefrontal development and
that rat pups who are male that aren't

2025
01:11:32,761 --> 01:11:34,680
allowed to engage in
rough and tumble play,

2026
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:39,890
she'll prefrontal hypo development and
you can then treat them with Ritalin,

2027
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,600
which is the Adhd drug,

2028
01:11:42,630 --> 01:11:44,040
just in case you're wondering.

2029
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:47,220
So that's a very dismal
line of scientific research,

2030
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:48,750
but also very promising.

2031
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:51,180
So what Panksepp also found,

2032
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:54,600
and this is another piece of information
that really blew me away when I first

2033
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:55,980
first read about it,

2034
01:11:56,820 --> 01:11:58,280
was so he,

2035
01:11:58,500 --> 01:11:58,791
he,

2036
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,420
he Panksepp discovered the place,

2037
01:12:00,421 --> 01:12:01,410
circuitry and mammals.

2038
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,790
And that's also a big deal,

2039
01:12:02,791 --> 01:12:03,001
right?

2040
01:12:03,001 --> 01:12:07,650
That's like discovering a continent to
discover a dedicated circuitry to a set

2041
01:12:07,651 --> 01:12:09,270
of complex biological functions.

2042
01:12:09,271 --> 01:12:10,320
That's a big deal,

2043
01:12:10,321 --> 01:12:10,950
man.

2044
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:11,783
And so,

2045
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:12,710
um,

2046
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:16,800
when he was investigating
play behavior among rats,

2047
01:12:16,801 --> 01:12:20,760
he noticed that juvenile males in
particular would work to wrestle.

2048
01:12:21,390 --> 01:12:22,710
And they wrestle really a lot.

2049
01:12:22,711 --> 01:12:23,400
Like,

2050
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,180
well,

2051
01:12:24,180 --> 01:12:28,650
human children or like cumin children
and dogs wrestle and rats pin each other.

2052
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:29,730
So,

2053
01:12:29,730 --> 01:12:30,563
um,

2054
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,340
what banks have found first was that,

2055
01:12:32,341 --> 01:12:33,480
and other scientists as well,

2056
01:12:33,481 --> 01:12:34,840
but I'll use him as a shorthand,

2057
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:39,120
was that rats would work to enter a play
arena where they knew they were going

2058
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:41,160
to be allowed to wrestle with a appear.

2059
01:12:41,700 --> 01:12:44,200
And that's kind of how you figure out
if a rat wants to do something right,

2060
01:12:44,210 --> 01:12:47,790
you make them button press forward or
pull on something and then you can measure

2061
01:12:47,791 --> 01:12:50,370
how fast you'll press the button or
how hard it pull and you can get some

2062
01:12:50,371 --> 01:12:51,740
estimate of how motivated he is.

2063
01:12:52,020 --> 01:12:54,600
Routes are pretty damn motivated
to enter into a play arena.

2064
01:12:54,601 --> 01:12:59,601
And so if one route enters into a player
arena and another rat does and the one

2065
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:01,890
rat is 10% bigger than the other,

2066
01:13:02,070 --> 01:13:04,530
then in like nine out of 10 cases,

2067
01:13:04,531 --> 01:13:09,531
the big rat can pin the little rat
and in the first bout then pinning,

2068
01:13:09,601 --> 01:13:10,860
establish his dominance.

2069
01:13:11,010 --> 01:13:14,370
This is kind of an interesting
commentary on scientific methodology too,

2070
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:19,170
because let's say that you
are investigating rat behavior
and you were trying to

2071
01:13:19,171 --> 01:13:21,450
draw conclusions and you
only paired rats together.

2072
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:26,451
Once you'd assume the big rat dominates
its physical size that does the

2073
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,010
domination and that's the purpose of play.

2074
01:13:29,490 --> 01:13:33,810
But that isn't right because it's like
don't let it win play as something that

2075
01:13:33,811 --> 01:13:34,261
iterates,

2076
01:13:34,261 --> 01:13:34,590
right?

2077
01:13:34,590 --> 01:13:37,200
You don't play with a person
only once you play with them.

2078
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:39,210
Well who knows for how long,

2079
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:39,510
right?

2080
01:13:39,510 --> 01:13:41,670
If it's a relationship that lasts decades,

2081
01:13:41,671 --> 01:13:43,620
then it's decades of
reciprocal interaction.

2082
01:13:44,010 --> 01:13:47,910
So Panksepp and his colleagues and the
other scientists who are working on this

2083
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,920
paired the rats repeatedly.

2084
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:53,940
So these are iterated games and the rules
of an iterated game aren't the same as

2085
01:13:53,941 --> 01:13:55,170
the rules of a one off game.

2086
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:58,860
And that might actually be the basis
for a universal ethic is that there are

2087
01:13:58,861 --> 01:14:00,000
rules for iterated games.

2088
01:14:00,300 --> 01:14:01,800
And what paths have found was that,

2089
01:14:02,160 --> 01:14:02,431
okay,

2090
01:14:02,431 --> 01:14:06,390
so the big rat is now super
ordinate to the little rat.

2091
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:08,040
Now when you repair them,

2092
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,590
the little rat has to ask
the big let route to play.

2093
01:14:10,591 --> 01:14:11,321
That's the rule.

2094
01:14:11,321 --> 01:14:12,100
So the big rat gets

2095
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:15,440
to sit there like he's cool and
the little rat cast to hop up like,

2096
01:14:15,610 --> 01:14:18,130
like a dog that's asking you to
play and sort of bounce around.

2097
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:19,480
You all know what that looks like.

2098
01:14:19,780 --> 01:14:21,580
Dog kind of puts its
rear end up in the air,

2099
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:22,990
kind of hops a little bit.

2100
01:14:23,050 --> 01:14:23,883
And that means like,

2101
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:25,930
well come on human cuff me,

2102
01:14:25,931 --> 01:14:28,150
you know and if you have any sense,

2103
01:14:28,151 --> 01:14:32,380
you know how to do that and you can even
understand when a dog does it and the

2104
01:14:32,381 --> 01:14:32,800
dog,

2105
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,310
if he socialized can understand
when you're doing it right
cause well socialized

2106
01:14:36,311 --> 01:14:37,570
dog is you Kinda,

2107
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:41,110
you kinda go like this and then he does
the same thing and you whack them on the

2108
01:14:41,111 --> 01:14:44,080
side of the head little bit
and he growls and puts his,

2109
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,510
you know your hand in his
mouth but he doesn't bite it.

2110
01:14:46,511 --> 01:14:47,860
But he sounds like he's going to,

2111
01:14:47,861 --> 01:14:50,110
the dog knows what the hell is
going on unless it's completely,

2112
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:52,810
unless it's raised by a
behavioral psychologist,

2113
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:53,673
which isn't

2114
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:59,590
the worst behaved dog I ever saw was
the dog that was raised by a behavioral

2115
01:14:59,591 --> 01:15:00,424
psychologist.

2116
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:01,743
So anyway,

2117
01:15:01,870 --> 01:15:02,621
sorry about that.

2118
01:15:02,621 --> 01:15:03,700
But so anyway,

2119
01:15:03,701 --> 01:15:07,810
so the pair of these rats together
and what you find is that,

2120
01:15:07,930 --> 01:15:10,480
so the little rat has to ask the
big rat to play in the big rattle,

2121
01:15:10,481 --> 01:15:11,490
like you know,

2122
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,060
break is cool and then wrestle.

2123
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:14,980
And then if you pair them repeatedly,

2124
01:15:14,981 --> 01:15:18,970
unless the big rat lets the little rat
win 30% of the time for little rat will

2125
01:15:18,971 --> 01:15:20,260
no longer ask him to play.

2126
01:15:20,650 --> 01:15:24,290
Like I read that it was like a little
electrical storm went off in my bag is

2127
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,180
what happened to me too.

2128
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:25,480
Well,

2129
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:26,051
it's so good.

2130
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:26,651
So on.

2131
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:29,050
So absolutely unbelievable is that,

2132
01:15:29,080 --> 01:15:31,540
well there you have this
emergent ethic of reciprocity.

2133
01:15:31,870 --> 01:15:35,800
All you need to do is pair animals
together in reciprocal play boats and you

2134
01:15:35,801 --> 01:15:38,200
have an emergent reciprocity
and then you think,

2135
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:38,710
well,

2136
01:15:38,710 --> 01:15:38,951
okay,

2137
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:42,550
so that's the basis for social
interaction is that reciprocity.

2138
01:15:42,580 --> 01:15:44,260
There's a bit of an advantage to the,

2139
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:45,311
to the big rat,

2140
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:46,960
but not a huge advantage.

2141
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:47,711
Say,

2142
01:15:47,711 --> 01:15:49,930
well that's the beginning of an ethic.

2143
01:15:49,931 --> 01:15:50,351
And you say,

2144
01:15:50,351 --> 01:15:50,561
well,

2145
01:15:50,561 --> 01:15:55,390
human beings that efficacy merged at the
biological level and then human beings

2146
01:15:55,391 --> 01:15:58,390
watched it develop and
told stories about it.

2147
01:15:58,570 --> 01:15:59,800
That's where the stories came from.

2148
01:15:59,950 --> 01:16:03,880
And then out of the stories we coded
and explicit ethic and that's where the

2149
01:16:03,881 --> 01:16:05,320
philosophy of ethics came from.

2150
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:07,300
But it emerged from the bottom up.

2151
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:10,030
Something Nietzsche
predicted like 150 years ago.

2152
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:10,331
He said,

2153
01:16:10,331 --> 01:16:10,660
well,

2154
01:16:10,660 --> 01:16:10,900
you know,

2155
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:14,740
we'll find that there was an emergent
ethic that emerged biologically and then

2156
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:15,670
was later mapped.

2157
01:16:15,950 --> 01:16:17,320
And so that was just,

2158
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:18,550
wow,

2159
01:16:18,550 --> 01:16:22,600
that's just absolutely beyond belief
and then very likely true and points the

2160
01:16:22,601 --> 01:16:23,800
way to something like

2161
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:26,880
while in archetipal ethics,

2162
01:16:26,881 --> 01:16:28,300
certainly one of reciprocity,

2163
01:16:28,301 --> 01:16:28,511
which,

2164
01:16:28,511 --> 01:16:28,690
uh,

2165
01:16:28,690 --> 01:16:31,840
which I think the fundamental
art archetypical ethic,

2166
01:16:31,870 --> 01:16:32,703
it's like,

2167
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:33,551
well,

2168
01:16:33,551 --> 01:16:34,510
here's another example,

2169
01:16:34,660 --> 01:16:35,021
Jordan.

2170
01:16:35,021 --> 01:16:36,360
Maybe just because we,

2171
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:38,200
when we will not touch
on a bunch of other,

2172
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:38,760
uh,

2173
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:39,593
points as well.

2174
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:40,011
We've,

2175
01:16:40,011 --> 01:16:40,570
we're,

2176
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:43,320
we're amazingly in depth in this.

2177
01:16:43,321 --> 01:16:44,680
This is so cool.

2178
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:47,170
While universal ethic is
important as it turns out.

2179
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:48,873
Exactly.

2180
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,150
Let me tell just a brief story.

2181
01:16:52,180 --> 01:16:52,940
Okay.

2182
01:16:52,940 --> 01:16:53,480
All right.

2183
01:16:53,480 --> 01:16:54,313
Because this is also,

2184
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:57,760
this is also extremely important
because it shows where the classical

2185
01:16:57,761 --> 01:16:58,310
economists,

2186
01:16:58,310 --> 01:16:59,980
brief story,

2187
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:00,540
brief,

2188
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:02,050
brief Jordan Peterson.

2189
01:17:02,230 --> 01:17:02,471
Yeah,

2190
01:17:02,471 --> 01:17:02,890
I know,

2191
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:03,191
I know.

2192
01:17:03,191 --> 01:17:04,024
It's not likely.

2193
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:06,130
So let's play a trading game.

2194
01:17:06,131 --> 01:17:06,371
Okay,

2195
01:17:06,371 --> 01:17:08,020
so you two can play this trading game.

2196
01:17:08,021 --> 01:17:08,771
So here's the deal.

2197
01:17:08,771 --> 01:17:09,770
It's very simple.

2198
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,300
I'm going to give you $100.

2199
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:12,380
I'm not actually,

2200
01:17:12,381 --> 01:17:16,820
but I'm going to give you $100 and you
can offer some of it to your partner in

2201
01:17:16,821 --> 01:17:17,654
the game.

2202
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:19,280
But the rule is if she says no,

2203
01:17:19,281 --> 01:17:23,630
you don't get anything and neither does
she and you only get to make one offer.

2204
01:17:24,290 --> 01:17:24,651
So okay,

2205
01:17:24,651 --> 01:17:25,520
here's your hundred dollars.

2206
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:26,480
How much you can offer her?

2207
01:17:29,150 --> 01:17:29,931
40 okay.

2208
01:17:29,931 --> 01:17:33,140
Would you take 40 okay then
now that's interesting.

2209
01:17:33,160 --> 01:17:33,500
Okay,

2210
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:33,951
very good.

2211
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:34,784
That's perfect.

2212
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:35,181
Okay,

2213
01:17:35,181 --> 01:17:36,680
so first of all,

2214
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:40,970
the classic economic economist would
say you should offer her a dollar.

2215
01:17:41,810 --> 01:17:42,643
Why?

2216
01:17:43,070 --> 01:17:43,251
Well,

2217
01:17:43,251 --> 01:17:46,310
because she might as well take a dollar
cause she gets a dollar and you want to

2218
01:17:46,311 --> 01:17:47,540
maximize your own return.

2219
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:49,340
So you get $99 it's like

2220
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,340
what happens when you do that?

2221
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:54,500
What happens is that is
never what people do.

2222
01:17:54,501 --> 01:17:59,150
They usually offer approximately
50% and if they don't,

2223
01:17:59,151 --> 01:18:00,470
then the other person refuses.

2224
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:00,980
Yeah.

2225
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:01,970
Now then you might think,

2226
01:18:01,971 --> 01:18:02,091
well,

2227
01:18:02,091 --> 01:18:03,890
let's say matched a rich person,

2228
01:18:03,891 --> 01:18:04,641
a poor person,

2229
01:18:04,641 --> 01:18:05,061
and you said,

2230
01:18:05,061 --> 01:18:05,360
okay,

2231
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:08,630
give the rich person a hundred and
they offer the poor person a dollar.

2232
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,320
What is the poor person say?

2233
01:18:10,321 --> 01:18:10,611
You think,

2234
01:18:10,611 --> 01:18:11,180
well,

2235
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:11,540
yeah,

2236
01:18:11,540 --> 01:18:11,751
yeah,

2237
01:18:11,751 --> 01:18:12,411
I need the dollar.

2238
01:18:12,411 --> 01:18:13,071
It's they say,

2239
01:18:13,071 --> 01:18:13,311
no,

2240
01:18:13,311 --> 01:18:14,120
go to hell.

2241
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,290
I'm not doing it because,

2242
01:18:15,380 --> 01:18:19,460
and they're more likely the poor person
is more likely to refuse the lower offer

2243
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:23,360
than a rich person is completely running
completely contrary to the predictions

2244
01:18:23,361 --> 01:18:24,500
of classical economists.

2245
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,090
You played that game across the world.

2246
01:18:26,091 --> 01:18:28,200
It's pretty much 50 50 and I,

2247
01:18:28,230 --> 01:18:31,610
that's so interesting because it's
another example of that emergent ethic.

2248
01:18:31,611 --> 01:18:32,240
It's like,

2249
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:32,960
well,

2250
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:37,960
part of the reason you'd say no and why
no was correct is because you don't play

2251
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:39,464
one trading game.

2252
01:18:40,310 --> 01:18:45,230
You play a lifetime of trading games and
the right answer to the question of how

2253
01:18:45,231 --> 01:18:50,231
to play a lifetime of trading games is
to not settle for less than 50% money.

2254
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:54,860
You could also make a case that if
you're the giver rather than receiver,

2255
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:56,690
if you're playing an iterated game,

2256
01:18:56,870 --> 01:19:01,870
you might want to offer $60 $60 because
especially if your reputation is being

2257
01:19:02,331 --> 01:19:03,164
broadcast,

2258
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:08,500
because let's say your goal isn't to get
$40 which is what you'd be left if you

2259
01:19:10,641 --> 01:19:14,570
offered 60 your goal is to let everybody
know that if they play with you,

2260
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:18,890
you give them 60 and you get 40
and then what happens is like,

2261
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:22,100
well let's take a vote on
who wants to play with who.

2262
01:19:22,220 --> 01:19:25,910
It's like you want to play with the person
who offers the a 10 or do you want to

2263
01:19:25,911 --> 01:19:30,110
play with the person who offers you 60
and then the person who's a little more

2264
01:19:30,111 --> 01:19:31,730
generous than reciprocal.

2265
01:19:31,760 --> 01:19:32,031
You know,

2266
01:19:32,031 --> 01:19:33,440
50 50 would be reciprocal.

2267
01:19:33,441 --> 01:19:35,480
Maybe you should err on
the side of generosity.

2268
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:39,800
Why easily easy people will
line up to play with you.

2269
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:41,330
So then the question is,

2270
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:45,560
do you want to win the game or do
you want to win the set of games?

2271
01:19:46,070 --> 01:19:46,790
Right.

2272
01:19:46,790 --> 01:19:47,623
And I think,

2273
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:52,010
I think there's rules that govern the
set of all possible games and it's the

2274
01:19:52,011 --> 01:19:55,400
rules that govern the set of all possible
games that constitutes something like

2275
01:19:55,401 --> 01:19:56,234
an emergent ethic.

2276
01:19:56,810 --> 01:19:57,920
So anyway,

2277
01:19:57,921 --> 01:20:00,080
so that's a very useful thing to know.

2278
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,550
It's a very useful thing to know.

2279
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:02,690
It is.

2280
01:20:02,690 --> 01:20:06,890
Can you give a couple quick ones of
those potentially universal ethics that

2281
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,280
govern the set of games?

2282
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:08,731
Well,

2283
01:20:08,731 --> 01:20:09,031
I think,

2284
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:10,050
I think that's the big one.

2285
01:20:10,051 --> 01:20:10,380
I think.

2286
01:20:10,380 --> 01:20:13,380
I think the big one is you
approximate reciprocity,

2287
01:20:13,381 --> 01:20:14,340
but it would be better.

2288
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,010
It'd be better if you
can figure out how to,

2289
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:18,391
I think you,

2290
01:20:18,391 --> 01:20:22,050
it's recept reciprocity with erring on
the side of generosity because there's

2291
01:20:22,051 --> 01:20:23,190
just no downside to that.

2292
01:20:23,191 --> 01:20:24,210
In an iterated game.

2293
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:25,440
It's like,

2294
01:20:25,440 --> 01:20:28,380
I'm going to borrow what I do when I
grade papers with students for example,

2295
01:20:28,381 --> 01:20:31,170
is I grade them and
then I had 5% it's like,

2296
01:20:31,171 --> 01:20:31,381
well,

2297
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:32,310
maybe I made a mistake.

2298
01:20:32,311 --> 01:20:34,470
So I'll err on the side of generosity.

2299
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:35,450
Right.

2300
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:38,400
And why not do that in your
reciprocal interactions.

2301
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,770
That doesn't mean you're letting
people take advantage of you,

2302
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:40,981
right?

2303
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:44,190
It's not a matter of weakness in your
negotiating strategy because there's no

2304
01:20:44,191 --> 01:20:45,024
excuse for that.

2305
01:20:45,360 --> 01:20:45,840
That's just,

2306
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:47,100
that's a losing game that,

2307
01:20:47,540 --> 01:20:52,540
but if you could take 50% or 70%
and you decide to be generous,

2308
01:20:52,951 --> 01:20:53,400
it's like,

2309
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,233
well,

2310
01:20:54,930 --> 01:20:58,830
you still have to be awake so that you're
not being messed about with by people

2311
01:20:58,831 --> 01:21:01,260
who are a little bit on the
psychopathic and you know,

2312
01:21:01,261 --> 01:21:03,540
you don't want to be foolish about it,

2313
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:06,690
but reciprocal plus generous.

2314
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:08,550
That's a hell of a good start.

2315
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:14,240
So can we do quick dive into
science and God because I want,

2316
01:21:14,820 --> 01:21:15,960
I want to know and quick

2317
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:21,931
let's,

2318
01:21:21,931 --> 01:21:22,770
let's try.

2319
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:24,660
So let's try

2320
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:28,230
10 science sufficiently,

2321
01:21:28,231 --> 01:21:31,260
consistently self actualize humans.

2322
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:33,600
Well,

2323
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:33,990
okay.

2324
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:34,920
Let cause with,

2325
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:35,640
with your,

2326
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,200
with God,

2327
01:21:37,410 --> 01:21:42,270
with religion people find some
sort of self actualization.

2328
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:48,920
10 science be a source of self
actualization or morality.

2329
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,780
The way that we normally construe science.

2330
01:21:51,781 --> 01:21:53,130
Like if you look at,

2331
01:21:54,220 --> 01:21:54,470
let,

2332
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:55,950
let's make that concrete for,

2333
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:56,760
for a minute.

2334
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:57,593
Um,

2335
01:21:58,590 --> 01:21:58,830
when,

2336
01:21:58,830 --> 01:22:03,030
when I teach my students my personality
class and we concentrated a fair bit on

2337
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:04,650
clinical theories because I'm a clinician,

2338
01:22:05,550 --> 01:22:10,530
one of the things I make clear to them
is that neither medicine nor clinical

2339
01:22:10,531 --> 01:22:11,364
psychology,

2340
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:12,660
our sciences,

2341
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:14,723
they're there,

2342
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:17,010
they're variants of engineering.

2343
01:22:17,850 --> 01:22:19,350
They're attempting to build something.

2344
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:20,220
There's an end in mind.

2345
01:22:20,221 --> 01:22:21,420
There's an ethical end in mind,

2346
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:21,630
right?

2347
01:22:21,630 --> 01:22:21,811
I mean,

2348
01:22:21,811 --> 01:22:24,780
what you do when you're a
clinical psychologist is try
to help people make their

2349
01:22:24,781 --> 01:22:25,614
lives better.

2350
01:22:26,020 --> 01:22:26,551
Or you might say,

2351
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:26,671
well,

2352
01:22:26,671 --> 01:22:28,410
you're trying to make them
more mentally healthy,

2353
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:32,730
but actually that's a weaker description
then that you're trying to make their

2354
01:22:32,731 --> 01:22:33,564
lives better.

2355
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:35,490
Because sometimes as a
clinical psychologist,

2356
01:22:35,491 --> 01:22:36,420
you see people who are,

2357
01:22:36,830 --> 01:22:37,110
you know,

2358
01:22:37,110 --> 01:22:38,790
they're normal in their health,

2359
01:22:38,791 --> 01:22:40,350
but they would like
their lives to be better.

2360
01:22:40,410 --> 01:22:42,100
There's an op obviously there,

2361
01:22:42,180 --> 01:22:42,580
but,

2362
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:46,800
and that introduces the ethical realm
and you might be able to use scientific

2363
01:22:46,860 --> 01:22:51,810
techniques in order to determine which
of the strategies you use to try to make

2364
01:22:51,811 --> 01:22:53,250
your life better are working.

2365
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:56,880
But it's not obvious that you can use
scientific principles to decide what

2366
01:22:56,881 --> 01:22:58,440
constitutes better to begin with.

2367
01:22:58,850 --> 01:22:59,700
It's a big problem.

2368
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,890
I don't see any evidence that you can,

2369
01:23:01,891 --> 01:23:02,101
well,

2370
01:23:02,101 --> 01:23:03,540
how about just science,

2371
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,633
science,

2372
01:23:04,740 --> 01:23:07,420
morality from its purview
at the methodological level?

2373
01:23:07,930 --> 01:23:08,230
Well,

2374
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:08,471
okay,

2375
01:23:08,471 --> 01:23:13,471
let's take an example of cancer and
science solving suffering by providing

2376
01:23:16,271 --> 01:23:17,320
solutions to cancer.

2377
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:17,711
Yeah.

2378
01:23:17,711 --> 01:23:17,951
Well,

2379
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:19,870
should you devote money
to cancer education?

2380
01:23:21,940 --> 01:23:22,211
That's,

2381
01:23:22,211 --> 01:23:22,391
see,

2382
01:23:22,391 --> 01:23:25,270
that's where the problems start
to come is that you can't,

2383
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,180
you can't make an a priori decisions.

2384
01:23:27,181 --> 01:23:30,250
You can't make an informed
decision about where the ethical,

2385
01:23:30,730 --> 01:23:34,450
where the scientific
attention should focus itself.

2386
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:35,620
It's not an easy thing to do.

2387
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:36,701
At some point,

2388
01:23:36,701 --> 01:23:38,320
the decisions have to be there,

2389
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:39,101
either arbitrary,

2390
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:39,934
they're made by,

2391
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:43,510
they're made by techniques that seem to
be outside of the scientific purview.

2392
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:44,770
Let me give you an example.

2393
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:50,220
So I read this book by an ex KGB agent
who had detailed out some of the extent

2394
01:23:51,431 --> 01:23:52,810
of the Soviet,

2395
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:53,783
uh,

2396
01:23:54,010 --> 01:23:57,430
biological warfare
program back in the 1980s.

2397
01:23:57,850 --> 01:24:01,330
And one of the things the
Soviet scientists were trying
to do according to this

2398
01:24:01,331 --> 01:24:03,100
guy was to weaponize,

2399
01:24:03,500 --> 01:24:04,333
um,

2400
01:24:04,660 --> 01:24:09,660
biological infectious biological agents
actually turns out to be harder than we

2401
01:24:09,731 --> 01:24:10,564
suspected,

2402
01:24:11,170 --> 01:24:12,003
thank God.

2403
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:12,910
And,

2404
01:24:12,910 --> 01:24:13,480
um,

2405
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:18,440
what they were trying to do was cross
smallpox with Ebola and it's because Ebola

2406
01:24:18,441 --> 01:24:23,380
is like seriously fatal and
smallpox is seriously contagious.

2407
01:24:23,380 --> 01:24:24,011
And so they thought,

2408
01:24:24,011 --> 01:24:24,221
well,

2409
01:24:24,221 --> 01:24:26,500
seriously fatal plus seriously contagious.

2410
01:24:26,501 --> 01:24:28,810
It's like what could be better than that?

2411
01:24:29,550 --> 01:24:29,920
Right?

2412
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:30,251
Right.

2413
01:24:30,251 --> 01:24:31,084
And so,

2414
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:31,961
and he might say,

2415
01:24:31,961 --> 01:24:36,961
well is crossing Ebola with smallpox if
is seeing whether you can cross Ebola

2416
01:24:38,321 --> 01:24:39,154
with smallpox,

2417
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:43,420
reasonable scientific question and
appropriate scientific question and purely

2418
01:24:43,421 --> 01:24:45,370
from the perspective of science,

2419
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,413
yes,

2420
01:24:46,990 --> 01:24:49,900
science is a generic
problem solving mechanism.

2421
01:24:50,440 --> 01:24:51,131
Now you might say,

2422
01:24:51,131 --> 01:24:52,660
well no,

2423
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:56,200
it's like it's not something
any reasonable human being
should ever engage in.

2424
01:24:56,201 --> 01:25:00,820
But that's not the same thing as asking
whether or not it's a question within

2425
01:25:00,821 --> 01:25:02,620
the reasonable purview of science.

2426
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:07,950
I mean the thing about science is that
science was designed to be as value free

2427
01:25:09,221 --> 01:25:10,840
a methodology as possible.

2428
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:12,730
It's designed for that.

2429
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:13,900
And so then people say,

2430
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:16,150
well why is there a gap
between science and values?

2431
01:25:16,151 --> 01:25:16,481
It's like,

2432
01:25:16,481 --> 01:25:16,631
well,

2433
01:25:16,631 --> 01:25:18,220
because it's built into the methodology.

2434
01:25:18,910 --> 01:25:22,900
So it looks to me like you need something
that's outside of science to direct

2435
01:25:22,901 --> 01:25:23,350
the,

2436
01:25:23,350 --> 01:25:24,183
the ethic.

2437
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,710
And it seems to me that
something like stories,

2438
01:25:27,050 --> 01:25:28,540
what can come from within science,

2439
01:25:28,541 --> 01:25:29,410
I don't see how,

2440
01:25:30,220 --> 01:25:31,300
I mean partly because it's,

2441
01:25:31,301 --> 01:25:32,260
it just glued the value.

2442
01:25:32,261 --> 01:25:37,261
Isn't the story of the cosmos already
enough to get someone excited enough to

2443
01:25:38,231 --> 01:25:43,231
find some sort of value system from the
being born from the stars and that being

2444
01:25:44,291 --> 01:25:45,090
inspirational?

2445
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:45,310
No,

2446
01:25:45,310 --> 01:25:46,121
not necessarily.

2447
01:25:46,121 --> 01:25:47,770
Because you can just as easily say,

2448
01:25:47,771 --> 01:25:48,041
well,

2449
01:25:48,041 --> 01:25:48,311
you know,

2450
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:50,350
here we are in this little
dirt ball in the middle,

2451
01:25:50,380 --> 01:25:50,651
you know,

2452
01:25:50,651 --> 01:25:53,410
and the outer edge of this
galaxy that's rotating,

2453
01:25:53,411 --> 01:25:57,010
going to rotate pointlessly
for the next 250 million years,

2454
01:25:57,310 --> 01:25:58,143
you know,

2455
01:25:58,330 --> 01:26:01,660
a couple of dozen billion years
before the heat death of the universe.

2456
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:06,320
It's like that's pretty dismal
accounting of the utility of life.

2457
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:07,010
I mean,

2458
01:26:07,010 --> 01:26:07,670
you know what I mean?

2459
01:26:07,670 --> 01:26:11,180
You can take you sure to hear
what you have that entire,

2460
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:14,810
you have that entire range of
interpretive possibilities from like,

2461
01:26:14,840 --> 01:26:17,960
isn't life remarkable
and wonderful and too,

2462
01:26:17,961 --> 01:26:19,910
isn't it bloody pointless if you,

2463
01:26:19,911 --> 01:26:21,430
if you look at it from
the wrong temporary,

2464
01:26:21,530 --> 01:26:23,330
I can find that from science.

2465
01:26:23,990 --> 01:26:24,171
Well.

2466
01:26:24,171 --> 01:26:24,441
Yeah,

2467
01:26:24,441 --> 01:26:26,090
but you can also find the reverse.

2468
01:26:26,390 --> 01:26:27,350
So that's the problem.

2469
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:29,030
I'm not anti scientific,

2470
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:30,560
but I don't,

2471
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:34,220
I don't see a simple way
of solving the problem of,

2472
01:26:34,780 --> 01:26:35,613
of,

2473
01:26:35,680 --> 01:26:38,690
of the ethical direction
of the scientific inquiry.

2474
01:26:38,691 --> 01:26:40,710
I mean you don't do it.

2475
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:45,680
What comes to mind maybe as
a way to to get to that area?

2476
01:26:46,370 --> 01:26:47,090
Well,

2477
01:26:47,090 --> 01:26:50,060
one of the things that I talked
about in detail with Sam Harris,

2478
01:26:50,061 --> 01:26:53,750
and we're going to talk about this some
more because it's by no means solved is

2479
01:26:53,751 --> 01:26:57,170
the relationship between facts
and values and the old idea,

2480
01:26:57,171 --> 01:26:57,890
Hume's ideas,

2481
01:26:57,890 --> 01:27:00,020
you can't derive values
from a set of fact.

2482
01:27:00,620 --> 01:27:02,750
And I think that's sort of right.

2483
01:27:02,751 --> 01:27:03,380
But I do,

2484
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:07,160
I kind of think it's more
complicated than Hume thought it was,

2485
01:27:07,161 --> 01:27:10,760
but I'm not exactly sure why because
like I made a case earlier about this

2486
01:27:10,761 --> 01:27:15,380
emergent ethic arising out of out
of out of eight are rated games.

2487
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:19,100
That kind of looks like a scientific
observation about the origin of morality

2488
01:27:19,430 --> 01:27:20,300
and something like that.

2489
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:22,970
So it's not like science can't
inform your moral decisions,

2490
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,530
but exactly how that might come about
is by no means a straight forward issue.

2491
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,393
And I mean,

2492
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:29,870
well it's also not the case.

2493
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:34,960
It is also not self evident that science
has served a beneficial function for

2494
01:27:36,981 --> 01:27:37,814
human beings.

2495
01:27:38,120 --> 01:27:39,290
Like it might be the case,

2496
01:27:39,500 --> 01:27:40,311
it could be the case.

2497
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:40,491
I mean,

2498
01:27:40,491 --> 01:27:40,731
look,

2499
01:27:40,731 --> 01:27:43,670
we're pretty comfortable here and thank
God and that's definitely a consequence

2500
01:27:43,671 --> 01:27:44,900
of the scientific revolution.

2501
01:27:44,901 --> 01:27:45,320
But,

2502
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:45,740
but you know,

2503
01:27:45,740 --> 01:27:47,870
highlighted your phone as a major,

2504
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:52,430
but one good hydrogen bomb blown up over
North America would set us back about

2505
01:27:53,330 --> 01:27:54,560
50,000 years.

2506
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:58,070
And that could easily happen
if I was a paranoid dictator.

2507
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,290
That's certainly what I would do.

2508
01:28:01,270 --> 01:28:01,761
And I know you,

2509
01:28:01,761 --> 01:28:02,594
I don't know,

2510
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:06,740
most of you guys probably know what would
happen if you blow up a hydrogen bomb.

2511
01:28:07,010 --> 01:28:08,720
I think it's about 150 miles up,

2512
01:28:08,721 --> 01:28:09,530
something like that.

2513
01:28:09,530 --> 01:28:10,363
One,

2514
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,200
you get an electromagnetic pulse,

2515
01:28:12,201 --> 01:28:13,610
it takes all the electronics out,

2516
01:28:14,210 --> 01:28:15,043
like all of them,

2517
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:16,813
right?

2518
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:18,260
One bomb.

2519
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,180
And so like maybe we'll manage that,

2520
01:28:20,181 --> 01:28:21,014
but it wouldn't.

2521
01:28:21,110 --> 01:28:21,680
And you know,

2522
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:25,310
maybe we'll manage that transition
to whatever we're going to do next,

2523
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:26,600
but I wouldn't count on it.

2524
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:32,080
And so it isn't even necessarily the
case that scientific endeavor is a pro

2525
01:28:33,650 --> 01:28:37,610
human life process and
he's in what we do with it.

2526
01:28:37,611 --> 01:28:42,230
I suppose that's why you said earlier
that it's important now more than ever to

2527
01:28:42,231 --> 01:28:47,231
have these conversations about the future
of humanity and where are we going?

2528
01:28:48,141 --> 01:28:49,550
How are we going to do this together?

2529
01:28:50,090 --> 01:28:51,320
So let,

2530
01:28:51,350 --> 01:28:51,681
let's,

2531
01:28:51,681 --> 01:28:54,770
let's talk about just ending
it off with mutual exploration.

2532
01:28:54,771 --> 01:28:58,310
I really thought this was interesting
and the intellectual dark web is a really

2533
01:28:58,311 --> 01:29:00,020
good example of this,

2534
01:29:00,050 --> 01:29:02,160
which you are a main pillar

2535
01:29:02,160 --> 01:29:03,000
of a,

2536
01:29:03,001 --> 01:29:03,834
in my opinion.

2537
01:29:04,140 --> 01:29:09,140
So let's say that two people are having
a conversation and they're reducing

2538
01:29:10,141 --> 01:29:10,920
their points.

2539
01:29:10,920 --> 01:29:13,620
There may be keeping it
to a straight binary.

2540
01:29:13,621 --> 01:29:17,520
We see a lot of political polarization
that's occurring today and United States

2541
01:29:17,521 --> 01:29:22,521
politics finding a lot of the beauty
and the nuance of conversation when you

2542
01:29:24,331 --> 01:29:29,331
take complex position and you may be
stay economists rather than become

2543
01:29:30,061 --> 01:29:30,894
agitated.

2544
01:29:31,350 --> 01:29:31,860
Um,

2545
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:35,580
all of these things tend to
drive better conversations.

2546
01:29:35,581 --> 01:29:38,970
And it seems as though you're
leading that forefront.

2547
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:40,170
What what,

2548
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:45,500
what do you see in that sort of path
that we're walking of figuring out how to

2549
01:29:45,571 --> 01:29:46,740
have better conversations?

2550
01:29:49,500 --> 01:29:50,333
There's a,

2551
01:29:50,950 --> 01:29:53,400
I write about this a fair
bit and 12 rules for life.

2552
01:29:53,401 --> 01:29:54,121
There's a chapter,

2553
01:29:54,121 --> 01:29:55,500
I think it's chapter nine.

2554
01:29:55,710 --> 01:29:56,543
I think that's right.

2555
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:59,910
Assuming that the person that you're
listening to know something you don't,

2556
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:05,220
it's kind of a derivation of some of some
things that I learned from Carl Rogers

2557
01:30:05,550 --> 01:30:07,020
who was a great clinician,

2558
01:30:07,021 --> 01:30:08,430
great 20th century clinician,

2559
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:12,180
his star sort of rose during
the 1960s he was a humanist,

2560
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:14,700
he was a Christian
missionary when he was a kid,

2561
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:19,500
but he dropped that and he became a
leading light humanistic psychology and he

2562
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:24,501
was really interested in the preconditions
for therapeutic conversation and he

2563
01:30:24,721 --> 01:30:25,554
thought that,

2564
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:26,903
well,

2565
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:32,570
if you are going to engage in the
process of therapy with a client that the

2566
01:30:32,941 --> 01:30:37,941
client had to bring to the
session before he or she arrived,

2567
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,550
the willingness to make things better,

2568
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:42,630
that would be the first thing.

2569
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:43,320
Yeah.

2570
01:30:43,320 --> 01:30:43,621
Right.

2571
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:44,454
So that,

2572
01:30:44,490 --> 01:30:47,760
and I've done therapy
that was court mandated.

2573
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:48,330
Like,

2574
01:30:48,330 --> 01:30:49,380
I wouldn't recommend that.

2575
01:30:49,530 --> 01:30:50,940
That just doesn't work very well,

2576
01:30:51,240 --> 01:30:51,451
you know,

2577
01:30:51,451 --> 01:30:53,220
cause you can't force
someone to be better.

2578
01:30:53,790 --> 01:30:57,510
They have to kind of come already thinking
that there's a bunch of things they

2579
01:30:57,511 --> 01:31:00,750
don't know and that their life
could be better than it already is.

2580
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:05,250
And that's a good position to take when
you're engaging in a conversation with

2581
01:31:05,251 --> 01:31:05,551
someone.

2582
01:31:05,551 --> 01:31:06,384
It's like,

2583
01:31:06,510 --> 01:31:06,751
look,

2584
01:31:06,751 --> 01:31:07,860
if you already know enough,

2585
01:31:08,760 --> 01:31:09,571
more power to you,

2586
01:31:09,571 --> 01:31:10,404
man,

2587
01:31:10,560 --> 01:31:11,393
you know,

2588
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:14,190
but if you're suffering more
than you think is necessary,

2589
01:31:14,250 --> 01:31:16,470
which is like a highly probable or,

2590
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:18,570
or more than you think is desirable,

2591
01:31:19,050 --> 01:31:22,050
which basically means if you're suffering
more than you think is desirable,

2592
01:31:22,680 --> 01:31:25,230
that means that you're way more
ignorant than you need to be.

2593
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:26,041
Right.

2594
01:31:26,041 --> 01:31:26,791
That's what it means.

2595
01:31:26,791 --> 01:31:28,200
Because maybe you have an illness,

2596
01:31:28,201 --> 01:31:29,160
you don't know how to cure it.

2597
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:31,770
Maybe you're having a fight with
someone you don't how to get out of it.

2598
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:34,800
Maybe you're failing at work and
you don't know what to do about it.

2599
01:31:34,801 --> 01:31:38,250
It's like you're ignorant and no wonder
because people are ignorant and so you

2600
01:31:38,251 --> 01:31:38,731
might think,

2601
01:31:38,731 --> 01:31:38,911
well,

2602
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:42,180
unless everything is just
the way you want it to be,

2603
01:31:42,930 --> 01:31:45,150
then you have something to
learn and then you think,

2604
01:31:45,151 --> 01:31:46,710
well maybe the person you're talking to,

2605
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:48,180
no matter how

2606
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,180
uncomfortable you are with their opinions
and how bent out of shape you think

2607
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:54,481
they are,

2608
01:31:54,481 --> 01:31:57,570
maybe even how bent out of
shape they actually are.

2609
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:00,880
There's always the possibility that
if you are actually engaged in a

2610
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:01,714
conversation,

2611
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:04,920
you ask them questions and you tried to
figure out what they thought that you'd

2612
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:08,830
come away with one crumb of knowledge
more than you had when you went into the

2613
01:32:08,831 --> 01:32:09,601
conversation.

2614
01:32:09,601 --> 01:32:12,550
And like conversations like
that are a lot more interesting.

2615
01:32:12,820 --> 01:32:13,653
Guy Founded my,

2616
01:32:13,860 --> 01:32:13,990
no,

2617
01:32:13,990 --> 01:32:16,270
I've probably done 20,000
hours of clinical work,

2618
01:32:16,271 --> 01:32:16,991
something like that.

2619
01:32:16,991 --> 01:32:19,420
And so that's 20,000 hours of really,

2620
01:32:19,570 --> 01:32:20,111
really,

2621
01:32:20,111 --> 01:32:20,920
really,

2622
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,900
really serious conversations.

2623
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:26,050
And they're almost always
interesting beyond belief.

2624
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:26,561
And I'm like,

2625
01:32:26,561 --> 01:32:30,190
I've had clients that I told you already
that sort of span the entire spectrum

2626
01:32:30,191 --> 01:32:35,191
from people who were so
impaired cognitively and
behaviorally that while they

2627
01:32:35,441 --> 01:32:38,140
were utterly unemployable by any,

2628
01:32:38,770 --> 01:32:43,060
any reasonable standards to people who
were unbelievably high functioning,

2629
01:32:43,061 --> 01:32:44,980
and I found working with all of them,

2630
01:32:45,550 --> 01:32:45,851
if I,

2631
01:32:45,851 --> 01:32:47,680
if I'm in the zone properly,

2632
01:32:47,681 --> 01:32:52,681
it's ridiculously fascinating because
people are ridiculously interesting and so

2633
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:53,610
and,

2634
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:58,610
and everyone has their own characteristic
experience that's actually unique.

2635
01:32:59,170 --> 01:33:02,380
And so if you have a real conversation
with someone and they tell you what's

2636
01:33:02,381 --> 01:33:03,760
unique about their experience,

2637
01:33:03,940 --> 01:33:08,030
the probability that you can learn
something from that is it's lots,

2638
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:09,610
it's certain that you can mind.

2639
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,170
My Low Iq clients,

2640
01:33:11,171 --> 01:33:11,471
God,

2641
01:33:11,471 --> 01:33:12,400
they taught me so much.

2642
01:33:12,401 --> 01:33:16,180
It's just they taught me how
difficult things were first,

2643
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:17,111
you know,

2644
01:33:17,111 --> 01:33:22,111
because to see someone struggle with
the task that the typical person can do

2645
01:33:22,691 --> 01:33:27,691
without even thinking sheds light on
exactly how amazing it is that that normal

2646
01:33:28,661 --> 01:33:32,950
people can do that and how hard it is
when when you were impaired to the point

2647
01:33:32,951 --> 01:33:36,910
where those sorts of normal
behaviors become become impossible.

2648
01:33:37,090 --> 01:33:38,080
It's so enlightening.

2649
01:33:38,081 --> 01:33:39,700
It teaches you a lot about the world.

2650
01:33:39,701 --> 01:33:44,701
And so I think part of the reason that
youtube is killing television is partly

2651
01:33:45,641 --> 01:33:47,980
because it's technologically advantageous.

2652
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:48,940
I mean,

2653
01:33:48,940 --> 01:33:49,990
make no mistake about it.

2654
01:33:50,140 --> 01:33:52,570
There's nothing that TV can
do that youtube can't do.

2655
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,380
And there's a whole bunch of
things that youtube can do.

2656
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:57,430
The TV cat.

2657
01:33:57,490 --> 01:33:59,440
So it's obvious which one is going to win.

2658
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:04,800
But what's also interesting about it
is that there seems to be a massive and

2659
01:34:05,620 --> 01:34:09,580
relatively untapped market
for actual conversation.

2660
01:34:10,240 --> 01:34:15,240
And it's because conversation is between
people of goodwill who are trying to

2661
01:34:16,571 --> 01:34:17,404
tell the truth.

2662
01:34:17,680 --> 01:34:21,190
We're trying to aim at making things
better is unbelievably valuable.

2663
01:34:21,550 --> 01:34:22,030
I mean,

2664
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:22,950
at least in principle,

2665
01:34:22,970 --> 01:34:24,070
that's what we're all doing here,

2666
01:34:24,071 --> 01:34:24,281
right?

2667
01:34:24,281 --> 01:34:24,910
I mean,

2668
01:34:24,910 --> 01:34:26,150
even though you know,

2669
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:27,910
you guys aren't talking,

2670
01:34:28,290 --> 01:34:29,020
um,

2671
01:34:29,020 --> 01:34:30,850
that doesn't mean this
isn't a conversation.

2672
01:34:31,360 --> 01:34:31,721
You know,

2673
01:34:31,721 --> 01:34:32,830
it's first of all,

2674
01:34:32,831 --> 01:34:37,510
we're trying to pay attention to you
at least enough to see if everyone is

2675
01:34:37,511 --> 01:34:39,190
engaged in the conversation.

2676
01:34:39,370 --> 01:34:40,870
If you're not engaged in it,

2677
01:34:40,871 --> 01:34:42,400
then it would be completely pointless.

2678
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:42,731
Right?

2679
01:34:42,731 --> 01:34:44,650
And you want to take them
into your experiment.

2680
01:34:44,680 --> 01:34:45,430
That was amazing.

2681
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:45,761
Well,

2682
01:34:45,761 --> 01:34:48,850
one of the things I learned in my clinical
practice is that if the conversation

2683
01:34:48,851 --> 01:34:49,601
was an interesting,

2684
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:50,680
then I was doing it wrong.

2685
01:34:50,740 --> 01:34:51,430
Yeah,

2686
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:51,761
it's great.

2687
01:34:51,761 --> 01:34:53,110
It's just that,

2688
01:34:53,111 --> 01:34:54,340
and that's a really cool thing too.

2689
01:34:54,341 --> 01:34:57,070
I think that also speaks to
this idea of a universal ethic.

2690
01:34:57,320 --> 01:34:58,130
I've really become

2691
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:58,671
interested,

2692
01:34:58,671 --> 01:35:00,980
I talked about this with
Ian McGilchrist recently.

2693
01:35:00,981 --> 01:35:02,570
I just released that video today.

2694
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:03,553
But what was up,

2695
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,820
we could go on a different site.

2696
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:10,700
I Bierly become interested in the
idea that the sense of engagement of

2697
01:35:10,701 --> 01:35:14,600
meaningful engagement is the
deepest of cognitive instincts.

2698
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:18,350
I actually think you could make a very
strong neuro biological case for that and

2699
01:35:18,890 --> 01:35:21,890
that if you're engaged in something,

2700
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:25,610
what it means is that you're
safe and secure on the one hand,

2701
01:35:25,611 --> 01:35:28,490
sufficiently safe and secure your
in your domain of competence,

2702
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:30,140
which is a good place to be.

2703
01:35:30,141 --> 01:35:30,411
You know,

2704
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:31,850
it's like explored territory.

2705
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:34,760
So you're with within the
walls where you're safe,

2706
01:35:34,880 --> 01:35:37,430
but you're also peering over
the fence and at the same time,

2707
01:35:37,431 --> 01:35:37,611
right?

2708
01:35:37,611 --> 01:35:38,960
So if you're engaged,

2709
01:35:38,961 --> 01:35:41,180
what it means is that you're
in your domain of competence,

2710
01:35:41,210 --> 01:35:44,480
but you're operating within that domain
of competence so that you're expanding

2711
01:35:44,481 --> 01:35:45,980
your competence at the same time.

2712
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,440
And so you feel that
as meaningfully engage,

2713
01:35:48,710 --> 01:35:49,880
meaningfully engaging.

2714
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:50,953
And it is.

2715
01:35:51,560 --> 01:35:52,380
And so,

2716
01:35:52,380 --> 01:35:55,910
and I do also think that that sense
of meaningful engagement is the right

2717
01:35:55,911 --> 01:35:57,440
antidote to the suffering.

2718
01:35:57,441 --> 01:35:57,890
That's,

2719
01:35:57,890 --> 01:35:58,310
that's,

2720
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:01,070
that's part and parcel
of our limited existence.

2721
01:36:01,071 --> 01:36:04,700
It's like you need an antidote to the
fact that life is suffering and the,

2722
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:08,720
the experience of meaningful
engagement I think is that antidote.

2723
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:13,610
And I also think that the experience of
meaningful engagement is a marker that

2724
01:36:13,611 --> 01:36:14,180
you're,

2725
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:17,180
where you should be doing what
you should be at the right time.

2726
01:36:17,390 --> 01:36:19,550
I think it's the deepest
of cognitive instincts.

2727
01:36:19,700 --> 01:36:21,110
And so that's really cool man.

2728
01:36:21,140 --> 01:36:22,070
If that was true,

2729
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:23,420
I think it's actually true.

2730
01:36:23,930 --> 01:36:25,400
So if you bring something,

2731
01:36:25,401 --> 01:36:26,270
if that was true,

2732
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:27,104
man,

2733
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:27,620
so,

2734
01:36:27,620 --> 01:36:28,453
but I think it is.

2735
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:32,300
So when we're trying to see if
it works and that state of flow,

2736
01:36:32,301 --> 01:36:33,500
you lose a sense of time.

2737
01:36:33,920 --> 01:36:34,101
Yeah.

2738
01:36:34,101 --> 01:36:36,470
When you lose your self
consciousness too as well.

2739
01:36:36,620 --> 01:36:38,930
So that's something that's worth thinking.

2740
01:36:38,931 --> 01:36:41,960
But I would also consider that
a primary religious experience.

2741
01:36:42,410 --> 01:36:43,280
It's something like that.

2742
01:36:43,281 --> 01:36:43,730
Yeah.

2743
01:36:43,730 --> 01:36:44,001
You know,

2744
01:36:44,001 --> 01:36:47,330
you're talking about science and religion
earlier and like there's a bunch of

2745
01:36:47,331 --> 01:36:50,330
questions that we need to address
pretty seriously about that too.

2746
01:36:50,331 --> 01:36:53,390
Because the scientific
kind of atheist types,

2747
01:36:53,660 --> 01:36:53,871
you know,

2748
01:36:53,871 --> 01:36:55,670
they're very down on the idea of religion.

2749
01:36:55,671 --> 01:36:58,640
But that's a very bad idea because
religion is a human universal,

2750
01:36:59,510 --> 01:36:59,990
right.

2751
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:01,550
And religious experience.

2752
01:37:01,551 --> 01:37:03,050
People have religious experiences.

2753
01:37:03,051 --> 01:37:05,420
It's like at the minimum we
need an explanation for that.

2754
01:37:05,421 --> 01:37:06,800
Plus you can induce them,

2755
01:37:07,370 --> 01:37:08,203
which is also,

2756
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:08,841
you know,

2757
01:37:08,841 --> 01:37:09,231
you can't,

2758
01:37:09,231 --> 01:37:10,910
you can't just write that off.

2759
01:37:10,911 --> 01:37:12,860
Like you can induce religious experiences.

2760
01:37:12,861 --> 01:37:15,410
I can be intertwined with
that spiritual as well.

2761
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:15,890
Right?

2762
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:16,580
Yeah.

2763
01:37:16,580 --> 01:37:17,001
Religious,

2764
01:37:17,001 --> 01:37:17,780
spiritual.

2765
01:37:17,780 --> 01:37:18,613
So,

2766
01:37:18,710 --> 01:37:19,011
but it's,

2767
01:37:19,011 --> 01:37:19,610
it's not,

2768
01:37:19,610 --> 01:37:20,990
it's not just conceptual.

2769
01:37:21,050 --> 01:37:21,290
Like,

2770
01:37:21,290 --> 01:37:21,501
you know,

2771
01:37:21,501 --> 01:37:21,951
you can say,

2772
01:37:21,951 --> 01:37:22,131
well,

2773
01:37:22,131 --> 01:37:23,240
there's this spiritual realm.

2774
01:37:23,241 --> 01:37:24,740
It's deeply experiential.

2775
01:37:24,830 --> 01:37:27,470
You have to be Jordan,

2776
01:37:27,980 --> 01:37:29,510
are we in a computer simulation?

2777
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:30,933
Ah,

2778
01:37:34,040 --> 01:37:34,873
um,

2779
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:35,631
if we are,

2780
01:37:35,631 --> 01:37:38,210
it's within a computer
that we don't understand.

2781
01:37:38,700 --> 01:37:39,450
Um,

2782
01:37:39,450 --> 01:37:42,590
I look at questions like
that or are strange because,

2783
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:43,743
um,

2784
01:37:44,270 --> 01:37:45,680
welcome to simulation.

2785
01:37:45,710 --> 01:37:46,543
Well,

2786
01:37:46,700 --> 01:37:47,620
it's like it's,

2787
01:37:47,780 --> 01:37:52,780
it's like asking whether you can reduce
consciousness to material to material

2788
01:37:53,091 --> 01:37:53,924
substrate.

2789
01:37:54,140 --> 01:37:54,980
And the answer to that is,

2790
01:37:56,030 --> 01:38:00,770
but by the time we reduced
consciousness to its material substrate,

2791
01:38:00,800 --> 01:38:03,800
our understanding of what
that material substrate is,

2792
01:38:03,801 --> 01:38:07,130
we'll have transformed so dramatically
that it won't look very much like the

2793
01:38:07,131 --> 01:38:09,140
material substrate that we presume now.

2794
01:38:09,141 --> 01:38:11,060
And so if we're in a simulation,

2795
01:38:11,061 --> 01:38:16,061
then it's within the confines
of a mechanism that we
can't easily assimilate to

2796
01:38:16,481 --> 01:38:18,220
our own computational devices.

2797
01:38:20,440 --> 01:38:23,680
And then of course the other
question like that as well,

2798
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,730
we've already defined this as reality.

2799
01:38:26,731 --> 01:38:28,050
And so his reality,

2800
01:38:28,051 --> 01:38:28,890
a simulation,

2801
01:38:28,891 --> 01:38:29,071
it's,

2802
01:38:29,071 --> 01:38:29,311
well,

2803
01:38:29,311 --> 01:38:30,080
no,

2804
01:38:30,080 --> 01:38:31,400
by definition it's not.

2805
01:38:32,030 --> 01:38:33,350
It's you might say,

2806
01:38:33,351 --> 01:38:33,501
well,

2807
01:38:33,501 --> 01:38:36,620
the simulation can get so real that
you can't distinguish it from reality.

2808
01:38:37,060 --> 01:38:37,893
You start to

2809
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:44,680
almost all questions of the form is a
B devolve down to it depends on how you

2810
01:38:48,221 --> 01:38:49,360
define a and B.

2811
01:38:49,620 --> 01:38:53,160
Because the problem with questions like
that is it decontextualizes the terms,

2812
01:38:53,161 --> 01:38:53,401
right?

2813
01:38:53,401 --> 01:38:53,970
It's like,

2814
01:38:53,970 --> 01:38:54,121
well,

2815
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:55,200
what do you mean by reality?

2816
01:38:55,620 --> 01:38:56,850
What do you mean by simulation?

2817
01:38:57,210 --> 01:38:57,301
Well,

2818
01:38:57,301 --> 01:38:59,280
if you mean the same
thing by both of them,

2819
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:00,480
then they're the same thing.

2820
01:39:00,660 --> 01:39:02,550
If you mean different
things by both of them,

2821
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:03,900
then there are different things.

2822
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:04,973
And so

2823
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:07,260
I'm serious about that.

2824
01:39:07,290 --> 01:39:12,290
[inaudible]

2825
01:39:12,560 --> 01:39:17,480
well most of the time you
can't pull single terms out
of a conversational stream

2826
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:22,570
and assumed that the term has a bounded
definition that's self evident using

2827
01:39:22,571 --> 01:39:23,500
only that term.

2828
01:39:23,740 --> 01:39:25,360
Because when we converse it's like,

2829
01:39:25,840 --> 01:39:28,190
well you utter a stream of words.

2830
01:39:28,191 --> 01:39:28,551
It's like,

2831
01:39:28,551 --> 01:39:29,600
well what are the words mean?

2832
01:39:30,340 --> 01:39:32,110
It depends on where
they are in the phrase.

2833
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,140
It depends on where they
are in the sentence.

2834
01:39:34,141 --> 01:39:36,540
It depends on where the sentence
is located in the paragraph.

2835
01:39:36,541 --> 01:39:39,670
It depends on the context within
which the paragraph is uttered.

2836
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:43,500
And you triangulate all
of that simultaneously.

2837
01:39:43,820 --> 01:39:45,410
Extract out the meaning of the word.

2838
01:39:45,740 --> 01:39:47,030
And then if you take a word out,

2839
01:39:47,031 --> 01:39:48,710
like it's a thing and another word out,

2840
01:39:48,711 --> 01:39:49,371
like it's a thing.

2841
01:39:49,371 --> 01:39:49,791
And you say,

2842
01:39:49,791 --> 01:39:51,260
are these two things the same?

2843
01:39:51,740 --> 01:39:55,340
You're acting as if those words can be
decontextualized and they have absolute

2844
01:39:55,341 --> 01:39:58,190
meaning in their decontextualize
state and they don't.

2845
01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,453
So,

2846
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:01,013
so,

2847
01:40:01,150 --> 01:40:05,970
so usually those questions I would say
in some sense or philosophically are

2848
01:40:05,971 --> 01:40:07,410
philosophically untenable.

2849
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:08,643
So,

2850
01:40:08,970 --> 01:40:09,211
so,

2851
01:40:09,211 --> 01:40:10,270
well that's the answer to that.

2852
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:17,250
[inaudible]

2853
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:26,890
for those of you that haven't done
self authoring or understand myself,

2854
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:31,310
they are incredible programs.

2855
01:40:31,311 --> 01:40:35,590
There's a 20% off code San Fran.

2856
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:36,370
Okay.

2857
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:38,140
So give that a go.

2858
01:40:39,090 --> 01:40:39,923
Thanks Jordan,

2859
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:40,813
appreciate you.

2860
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:44,510
I appreciate you coming out
here and San Francisco Bay area.

2861
01:40:44,750 --> 01:40:45,620
Really enjoyed having you.

2862
01:40:45,621 --> 01:40:46,730
We hope to have you again soon.

2863
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:48,030
Thank you.

2864
01:40:48,030 --> 01:40:48,430
Thank you.

2865
01:40:48,430 --> 01:40:53,430
[inaudible]

2866
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:01,180
thank you very much.

2867
01:41:01,181 --> 01:41:01,990
Fun.

2868
01:41:01,990 --> 01:41:06,990
[inaudible].
