1
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:03,500
The stories that,

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,300
that we tell and that we live in are
fundamentally ways that we deal with the

3
00:00:10,841 --> 00:00:12,310
complexity of the world.

4
00:00:12,850 --> 00:00:17,230
And the fundamental problem with
the world as far as I can tell,

5
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:20,980
is that not only is it complex
beyond your comprehension,

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,190
but the complexity shifts
in unpredictable ways.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,510
So that's the Darwinian
conundrum actually.

8
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,970
That's why Darwinism seems to be a
practical necessity with regards to the

9
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:35,140
continuation of life,

10
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:39,190
because because of the
complexity changes unpredictably,

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,580
you can't necessarily tell what's
going to work in the future.

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,110
And so the Darwinian process solves
that by generating quasi random

13
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,860
variations and letting,

14
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:55,360
whichever one by happenstance happens
to work in that environment survive now.

15
00:00:55,361 --> 00:01:00,361
And it's not random precisely because
the underlying structure is conserved.

16
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:05,290
It's very rare that a child would be
born with an extra arm or something like

17
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:05,581
that.

18
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:10,581
And like the skeletal structure that you
inhabit is shared by animals going way,

19
00:01:11,771 --> 00:01:13,450
way back in evolutionary history.

20
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:16,750
There's a lot of conservation
and in the evolutionary process,

21
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:19,480
but so there's variation
within conservation,

22
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,560
like music.

23
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,281
It's a good,

24
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:22,690
it's a good way of thinking about it.

25
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,370
And so

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,963
the,

27
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,090
the stories that we tell have
exactly the same structure.

28
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:31,924
They,

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,100
they have this,

30
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,960
his core element with variations.
