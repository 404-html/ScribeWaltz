00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,760
A story that we've been telling Rosette
and stories that we've been telling for

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,030
3000 years,

3
00:00:10,031 --> 00:00:12,090
it seems to me to have something to offer.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,640
And so when,

5
00:00:13,641 --> 00:00:16,590
when I look at the stories in the Bible,

6
00:00:16,591 --> 00:00:17,070
I do it,

7
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:19,410
I would say in some sense
with a beginner's mind,

8
00:00:19,411 --> 00:00:20,490
it's a mystery.

9
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:21,240
This book,

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,320
how the Hell it was made,

11
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:23,101
why it was made,

12
00:00:23,101 --> 00:00:24,180
why we preserved it,

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,420
how it happened to motivate an entire
culture for 2000 years and to transform

14
00:00:29,731 --> 00:00:30,564
the world.

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,590
Like what's going on?

16
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:32,550
How did that happen?

17
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,440
It's by no means obvious.

18
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:38,730
And one of the things that bothers me
about casual critics of religion is that

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,010
they don't take the phenomena seriously.

20
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:42,440
And it's a serious phenomenon.

21
00:00:42,441 --> 00:00:43,274
I mean,

22
00:00:43,370 --> 00:00:43,830
um,

23
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,340
not at least because people have the
capacity for religious experience and no

24
00:00:47,341 --> 00:00:48,330
one knows why that is.

25
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:48,631
And I mean,

26
00:00:48,631 --> 00:00:51,450
you can induce it reliably and
all sorts of different ways.

27
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,490
You could do it with brain stimulation.

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,170
You can certainly do it with drugs.

29
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,540
There's,

30
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:57,270
especially the psychedelic variety,

31
00:00:57,271 --> 00:01:02,271
they produce intimations of the
divine extraordinarily regularly.

32
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,880
People have been using drugs like
that for God only knows how long,

33
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:07,080
50,000 years,

34
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:08,130
maybe more than that,

35
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,180
to produce some sort of
intimate union with the divine.

36
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:14,040
It's like we don't understand any of that.

37
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:17,790
When we discovered the psychedelics and
the late sixties it shocked everybody so

38
00:01:17,791 --> 00:01:21,900
badly that they were instantly made
illegal and abandoned in terms of research

39
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:22,980
for like 50 years.

40
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:27,360
And it's no wonder because who the
hell would expected that nobody.
