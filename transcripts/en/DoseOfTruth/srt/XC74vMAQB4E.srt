1
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:11,690
I'm also working on my new
book quite a lot actually.

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:12,420
Um,

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,420
it's tentatively titled Beyond Order 12
more rules for life or perhaps beyond

4
00:00:18,331 --> 00:00:19,200
mere order.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,210
I haven't decided on that yet.

6
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:22,743
Um,

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,600
I can tell you what the rules are.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,070
Maybe you'd be interested in that.

9
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,950
So I'll give you a list of them.

10
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:34,370
The first one is do not carelessly
denigrate social institutions or creative

11
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:37,344
achievement

12
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,040
rule to imagine who you could be.

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,550
And then aim singlemindedly at that

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:47,990
rule three.

15
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,610
Work as hard as you can.

16
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:55,120
Work as hard as you possibly can on at
least one thing and see what happens.

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,530
Rule four,

18
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,460
do not hide unwanted things in the fog.

19
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:03,560
Rule five,

20
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,620
abandoned ediology abandoned
ideology rules six,

21
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,970
notice that opportunity lurks where
responsibility has been abdicated.

22
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:15,770
Rule seven,

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:18,500
do not do things that you hate.

24
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,001
Rural.

25
00:01:20,001 --> 00:01:20,690
Eight,

26
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,990
try to make one room in your
house as beautiful as possible.

27
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:25,940
Rule Nine,

28
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,510
if old memories still make you cry,

29
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,180
right them down carefully and completely

30
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,280
rural 10 plan and work diligently to
maintain the romance in your relationship.

31
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,260
Rule 11,

32
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,050
be grateful in spite of your suffering.

33
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,540
And then rule 12,

34
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,330
do not allow yourself to become resentful,

35
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,201
deceitful,

36
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:52,070
or arrogant.

37
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,990
In principle,

38
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,920
that book will be published in January,

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,360
2020 so,

40
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:03,230
and I'm supposed to have the manuscript
in sometime within the next six months

41
00:02:03,231 --> 00:02:07,430
and I have a first draft done and I'm
working hard on the repeated edits.

42
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,390
Um,

43
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:12,800
it's going to be published simultaneously
in the UK and the U S and Canada.

44
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,640
Um,

45
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,640
I'm working with three different
editors and so that's that part of the

46
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:19,491
announcement.

47
00:02:19,491 --> 00:02:20,510
So I'm hoping,

48
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,210
I'm really hoping that I can
make the next book better.

49
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,410
I think it would be a pair,

50
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:27,110
you'll be a parent coffee
with the first one.

51
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:30,260
I'm probably going to publish it with a
black cover to go with the white cover

52
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,880
of 12 rules,

53
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,780
and I'm hoping that I can make it into
a better book and that the two together

54
00:02:35,781 --> 00:02:37,490
will make a very complete set.
