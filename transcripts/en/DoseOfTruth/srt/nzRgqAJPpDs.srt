1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:06,771
Well,

2
00:00:06,771 --> 00:00:11,771
I was very heartened Jordan's by your
affirmation of the objectivity of moral

3
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:15,440
values and duties.

4
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:20,830
You said there are things
that are unquestionably good
and unquestionably evil,

5
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:25,210
but these moral values are
not things that are infected,

6
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,810
but they are discovered.

7
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:32,350
And I couldn't agree more and I would
want to push you on this to say that this

8
00:00:35,121 --> 00:00:40,121
very consideration ought to help you
to move through naturalism and beyond

9
00:00:41,301 --> 00:00:46,301
naturalism to a transcendent ground for
the objectivity of these moral values

10
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:50,450
and duties because they
won't be found in naturalism.

11
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,810
The naturalist is trapped
in the lower story.

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:54,920
Uh,

13
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,611
objective.

14
00:00:55,611 --> 00:01:00,611
Moral values and duties are not physical
entities described by the laws of

15
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:01,934
nature.

16
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,610
These are transcendent realities,

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,600
either play tonic or else grounded in God.

18
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,770
Um,

19
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:14,770
and therefore the very affirmation of
the objectivity of moral values and

20
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:16,401
duties.

21
00:01:16,401 --> 00:01:19,600
It was so strong throughout
your talk I have,

22
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,940
which I just so appreciate it.

23
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:22,940
So it's anti relativistic,

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:24,690
it's objective as stick.

25
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,790
I want to,

26
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,560
I want to encourage you to push
through that naturalism to finding a

27
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:34,490
transcendent ground for
these in via awesome.

28
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:39,491
I think that's the most plausible moral
theory that will enable us to affirm the

29
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:42,440
objectivity of these
moral values and duties.

30
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,943
Yup.

31
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,040
All right.

32
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I've tried to work out the sorts of
ideas that I portrayed in this talk today

33
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,030
within a naturalistic
framework as much as possible

34
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,670
because the naturalistic
technique is so powerful,

35
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,560
not least for that,

36
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,520
but also because there's glimmerings
in the scientific literature of

37
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,440
the sorts of ideas that you portrayed
when you mentioned that the evolutionary

38
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:26,310
biologists are increasingly making the
claim that morality is a biological

39
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:31,110
adaptation and I think you can make a
very strong case for that much stronger

40
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:33,090
case than has actually been made so far.

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,553
Um,

42
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,270
I think there is a,

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,040
a very sophisticated ethic that has
evolved that we recognize as a consequence

44
00:02:44,161 --> 00:02:47,820
of the evolution of our cognitive
and emotional structures.

45
00:02:47,821 --> 00:02:52,560
I think that that recognition
manifests itself in admiration.

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,180
You know,

47
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,560
people are very imitative.

48
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,950
It's one of the things that characterizes
us in contradistinction animals who

49
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:01,660
are not very imitative.

50
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,990
It's probably they're preconditioned
for our linguistic capacity.

51
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:10,300
One of the things that characterize
this human existence is the capacity to

52
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,410
spontaneously pick a model for emulation,

53
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,310
right?

54
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,450
And model for admiration.

55
00:03:16,451 --> 00:03:19,060
And that's the manifestation
of that moral instinct to say,

56
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,420
well to admire is to want to copy say,

57
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:22,571
well,

58
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:23,560
what do you want to copy?

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,350
What you want to copy that
which is most admirable?

60
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,880
What is most admirable?

61
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,170
Well,

62
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,510
what is most admirable
that starts to become a,

63
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,240
that starts to become a
transcendent question,

64
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,290
right?

65
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,670
You can imagine that the,

66
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,530
the,

67
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:41,920
the local examples of
what's admirable there,

68
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:42,960
right in front of you and,

69
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:43,920
and,

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,310
and their concrete and tangible.

71
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:47,560
But to abstract out from that,

72
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,790
that which is admirable in and of
itself is simultaneously to construct

73
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:54,280
something like the representation
of a transcendent good.

74
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:58,270
And that's to some degree how religious
conceptions emerged from their

75
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,890
underlying biological substrate.

76
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,031
Now you might say,

77
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:04,780
well that's merely reducing the
religious conceptualization,

78
00:04:04,781 --> 00:04:07,960
the religious abstraction of what's
good to the biological sub strait.

79
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,490
And I think you can read it that way,

80
00:04:09,491 --> 00:04:12,370
but I don't think that that
necessarily indicates what it is.

81
00:04:12,371 --> 00:04:17,371
I think that the entire process of
evolution is somehow shaping itself around

82
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,210
maybe platonic ideas,

83
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:21,971
something like that,

84
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:26,950
some transcendent good and that it's a
mistake to assume that just because you

85
00:04:26,951 --> 00:04:31,270
can make an association between the
transcendent abstract good and the process

86
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:31,931
of evolution,

87
00:04:31,931 --> 00:04:34,090
that one is necessarily
reduceable to another.

88
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,260
It doesn't,

89
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,830
the way reality works commit

90
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,520
the genetic fallacy to try to say that
because one's moral beliefs originated

91
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:49,541
through such a biological evolutionary
process that therefore they are explained

92
00:04:51,201 --> 00:04:54,990
away and have no objective
validity that that just,

93
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,410
yeah,

94
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,500
I think partly what happens too is that

95
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,100
at that level of analysis,

96
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:05,360
you have to start questioning
your initial presumptions,

97
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,400
liked the idea that the most true truth
is objective because I'm not sure it is.

98
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,890
I don't think we understand
what constitutes truth
very well and there's the

99
00:05:16,891 --> 00:05:21,600
truth that you act out as well as the
truth that tells you what the world is

100
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:24,180
made of and those aren't
necessarily the same thing.

101
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,310
And so things get very murky
at that level of obstruction.

102
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:34,311
But one thing I have learned
from attempting to reduce
religious preconceptions

103
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,180
to their biological substrate is that
there's always something left over that

104
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,320
you haven't explained,

105
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:41,211
and it's,

106
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:45,360
it's not something trivial because
every time I look into what's leftover,

107
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,030
it turns out to be an ultra bleat deep.

108
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,920
Then I get rid of some more of it and
the rest becomes unalterably deep.
