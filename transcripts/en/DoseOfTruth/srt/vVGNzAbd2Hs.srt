1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,440
[inaudible].

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:21,260
So one of the propositions that I

3
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:28,090
set forth for you last week was that
the most real things are the things that

4
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:35,651
are most permanent across time and
that manifest themselves in the largest

5
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,030
number of situations.

6
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,170
And those are the things that you have
to map successfully in order to survive,

7
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,540
survive as individuals,

8
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:47,150
but survive as a species over
a very long period of time.

9
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:49,430
And so the question is,

10
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:54,580
one question is what are the constants
of experience if you are a follower of

11
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:03,420
the evolutionary psychologists and to
some degree the evolutionary biologists,

12
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,030
but I would say more the psychologists

13
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:09,340
like to be and caused meetings.

14
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:16,440
They have a very afro centric
view of human evolution.

15
00:01:16,441 --> 00:01:18,640
And the idea basically is that

16
00:01:20,870 --> 00:01:25,490
after we diverged from the common
answer ancestor between chimpanzees,

17
00:01:25,491 --> 00:01:27,410
Bonobos and human beings,

18
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:32,900
we spent a tremendous amount of
time in the African environment,

19
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,370
mostly on the Velt,

20
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:37,100
although we're not absolutely
certain about that.

21
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:37,780
Um,

22
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:42,050
we're also very good in water human
beings and we have some of the features of

23
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:43,190
aquatic mammals.

24
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:44,803
So,

25
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,470
um,

26
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:47,030
well hairlessness being one of them.

27
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,230
Uh,

28
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,370
women have a subcutaneous layer of fat
or feed your quite nicely adapted for

29
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:53,204
swimming.

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,740
And so Buckminster fuller,

31
00:01:54,741 --> 00:01:57,830
who I wouldn't call a mainstream
evolutionary psychologist,

32
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,270
hypothesized back in the 70s that
we spent some period of time in our

33
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:05,150
evolutionary history living
on beaches near the ocean.

34
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,810
I had that idea really,

35
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,813
uh,

36
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,120
echoes for me because we like beaches a
lot and it's a great place if you want

37
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:14,210
to get easy food.

38
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:18,620
And we're pretty damn good at swimming
for terrestrial mammals and we are

39
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:22,490
hairless and we do cry salt tiers and
there's a lot of evidence that we,

40
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,271
and our feet,

41
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:24,200
if you think about our feet,

42
00:02:24,201 --> 00:02:24,980
they're quite slipper.

43
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,890
Like I know we all stand
up and all that and walk.

44
00:02:27,891 --> 00:02:29,360
So that's part of the adaptation,

45
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:30,920
but we're pretty good at swimming.

46
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,230
So anyways,

47
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,820
the classical evolutionary psychology
view is that we spent most of our time on

48
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:42,230
the African Veldt and the critical
period of our evolutionary development,

49
00:02:42,231 --> 00:02:42,681
let's say,

50
00:02:42,681 --> 00:02:47,330
after we diverged from this common
ancestor and that were adapted for that

51
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:47,901
environment.

52
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:51,710
And one of the consequences of
that is the idea that we're,

53
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,410
that things have changed
so much around us,

54
00:02:54,411 --> 00:02:58,010
that we're really not adapted to the
environment that we're in anymore.

55
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:03,310
And I don't really believe because I think
that the idea that the primary forces

56
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:07,750
that shaped our evolution shaped
them during that period of time,

57
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:11,260
call it us roughly a 7 million period,

58
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,310
year period of time,

59
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:13,144
something like that.

60
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:19,870
And that that was somehow a special
time for human evolution that set our

61
00:03:19,871 --> 00:03:20,704
nature.

62
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,660
I don't believe that,

63
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,090
um,

64
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,470
I mean it's true to some degree,

65
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:31,471
but it's more useful to view the evolution
of human cognitive processes over the

66
00:03:32,231 --> 00:03:36,730
entire span of evolutionary history and
not necessarily give preference to any

67
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:38,230
particular epoch.

68
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,430
And I certainly believe that the idea
that we're no longer adapted to the

69
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:45,730
environment because of
our rapid technological
transformations is simply not

70
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:46,390
true.

71
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:49,960
And the reason I think that it's not
true is because the fundamental constants

72
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,640
of the environment,

73
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:52,151
let's say,

74
00:03:52,151 --> 00:03:55,930
or it's more of the fundamental
constitute constituent elements of being.

75
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,340
I think that's the right
way to think about it.

76
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,383
They're the same.

77
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:03,160
They haven't changed a bit and there's
no way of changing them as far as I can

78
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:08,161
tell without us being radically and in
comprehensively different than we are and

79
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:12,940
you know with with the rapid rise of
artificial intelligence and robotics and

80
00:04:12,941 --> 00:04:13,750
all of that,

81
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,340
it's certainly possible that in 500
years will be completely will be.

82
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,440
So like unlike the way we are now,

83
00:04:20,441 --> 00:04:22,180
that we won't even be the same creatures.

84
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:24,280
I don't think that's a
particularly great outcome,

85
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,570
but it's certainly impossible.

86
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,560
So what are the fundamental
constituent elements?

87
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:32,110
While they're expressed in mythology,

88
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:32,944
but they're,

89
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,480
they're not merely symbolic.

90
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,160
I think it's the wrong
way to think about it.

91
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:37,511
They're symbolic,

92
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,780
but they reflect a very deep reality
and they actually reflect the reality

93
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,890
that's not easily apprehensible
directly by the census.

94
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:49,210
Now your senses are tuned
for a particular duration.

95
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:50,683
That's roughly,

96
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,680
excuse me.

97
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,550
Oh,

98
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,580
that's roughly the duration that you live,

99
00:04:57,581 --> 00:04:57,971
let's say.

100
00:04:57,971 --> 00:04:59,170
But more importantly,

101
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:00,070
it's the duration,

102
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,120
whatever that duration is across
which meaningful actions take place.

103
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:06,820
And we kind of have some idea
of what that duration is.

104
00:05:06,821 --> 00:05:07,061
You know,

105
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:07,930
if you look at us,

106
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,100
a computer screen,

107
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,790
if it has a refresh rate
of less than 60 hertz,

108
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:13,810
you can see it flickering,

109
00:05:13,811 --> 00:05:14,860
but above 60 hertz,

110
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:15,311
you can't,

111
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:16,000
it's uniform.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,260
And with movies,

113
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,670
um,

114
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,420
anywhere between 20 and 50 frames a second
is enough to give you the illusion of

115
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:23,410
continual motion.

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,610
So,

117
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:25,150
you know,

118
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:29,920
we live in a universe that's above the
10th of a second domain or maybe the

119
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,900
hundredth of a second
somewhere in there anyways.

120
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:32,410
And I mean,

121
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,030
it's not like time isn't almost infinitely
sub dividable at higher levels of

122
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:38,260
resolution than that,

123
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,590
but we don't operate generally speaking
at higher temporal resolution than that.

124
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,040
And then,

125
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,341
you know,

126
00:05:45,341 --> 00:05:45,700
we're,

127
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,200
we're our,

128
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:47,561
our,

129
00:05:47,561 --> 00:05:48,820
our feeling of the,

130
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,950
of the felt moment seems to be,

131
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,250
I would say something approximating
half a second to a second,

132
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:55,121
you know,

133
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:55,230
um,

134
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:55,571
I mean,

135
00:05:55,571 --> 00:05:56,710
it's an estimate obviously,

136
00:05:56,711 --> 00:06:00,800
but the second is a meaningful unit of
time for a person and a hundredth of a

137
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,500
second really isn't in certainly
a billionth of a second isn't.

138
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,334
And then,

139
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:04,670
you know,

140
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,150
we can think across hours and
days and weeks and months,

141
00:06:08,151 --> 00:06:09,140
but we really can't,

142
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,850
once you start getting out in two years,

143
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:14,330
it gets kind of sketchy and it's hard
to think more than five years down the

144
00:06:14,331 --> 00:06:14,570
road.

145
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:18,590
And the reason for that is that the
particulars upon which you're basing your

146
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:22,640
predictions are likely to change
sufficiently over a five year period.

147
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:27,200
So that extending out your vision past
that just exposes you to accelerating

148
00:06:27,201 --> 00:06:28,034
error.

149
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,341
Right.

150
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:28,681
And that,

151
00:06:28,681 --> 00:06:31,120
and of course that's the problem
with predicting the future periods.

152
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:35,030
So we live in a time range that's
about say a 10th of a second,

153
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:35,151
two,

154
00:06:35,151 --> 00:06:35,540
three,

155
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,373
three years,

156
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,251
something like that.

157
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:37,371
No,

158
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:38,930
I know it can expand beyond that,

159
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:39,710
but that's,

160
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:43,670
that's kind of where we're set and
our census seem to be tuned to those

161
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:44,570
durations and,

162
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:49,571
and to be operative so that we make proper
decisions within those durations and,

163
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,070
and also from,

164
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,050
from a particular spacial
position and so forth.

165
00:06:54,051 --> 00:06:54,570
You know,

166
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,840
your eyes see what's roughly,

167
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:01,340
maybe we could say a walkable
distance in front of you,

168
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,300
something like that.

169
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,610
So I knew didn't detect things and in the
locale that enables you to immediately

170
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:09,380
interact with things,

171
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:14,810
but it isn't necessarily the case that
senses that are tuned to do that are also

172
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:19,790
tuned to inform you directly about what
the most permanent things about being

173
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:20,660
itself are.

174
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:22,940
I think that those things
have to be inferred.

175
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:23,930
And there's some,

176
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,860
there's some supporting evidence
for that kind of thing from uh,

177
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,390
from psycho linguistics.

178
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:30,970
There,

179
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,110
there is a level of,

180
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:37,340
of categorization that we seem to
manifest more or less automatically or

181
00:07:37,731 --> 00:07:38,361
implicitly.

182
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:39,320
So for example,

183
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,290
when children perceive animals,

184
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:42,551
they,

185
00:07:42,551 --> 00:07:43,340
they,

186
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,310
they perceive at the level of cat or dog.

187
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,353
They don't,

188
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,170
they don't perceive at the level
of subspecies like Siamese cat or,

189
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:51,891
or,

190
00:07:51,891 --> 00:07:52,370
uh,

191
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:52,701
or,

192
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:53,090
or,

193
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,420
uh,

194
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,620
let's say salmonoid,

195
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,280
you know,

196
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:55,700
there's,

197
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:56,420
there's this,

198
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,260
there's a natural,

199
00:07:57,261 --> 00:07:59,450
I can't remember what they
call that base category,

200
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:00,081
something like that.

201
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:03,170
It's usually specified by very short
words that are easily learnable.

202
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,230
And so the linguistic system
seems to map right onto the,

203
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,390
to the object recognition,

204
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,160
po characteristics of the sensory
systems that are built right into it.

205
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:13,640
And,

206
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,870
and if they weren't built into it,

207
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:17,390
we couldn't communicate easily
because our natural categories,

208
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,110
I think that's it,

209
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,160
but it's probably wrong.

210
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,570
Our natural categories,

211
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,440
they have to be the same for everyone
or it would be very difficult for us to

212
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:25,274
communicate.

213
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:25,761
Okay.

214
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:27,590
So having said all that,

215
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,550
then the question is,

216
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:29,601
well,

217
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,530
what are the most,

218
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,950
what are the most real categories?

219
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,800
And I think there's,

220
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,500
there's a real division in ways to think
about this because there's a scientific

221
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:40,550
way of thinking about it.

222
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:41,540
And,

223
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:42,450
and in,

224
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,161
in that case,

225
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:44,930
the most real categories are,

226
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,780
well mathematical equation certainly
seemed to be in the top category there,

227
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:52,700
their equations that describe
the physical universe,

228
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:57,701
but then then the hypothesis of the
existence of such things as protons and

229
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,920
electrons and you know,

230
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,280
the,

231
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:01,950
the,

232
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,200
the material elements
that make up everything.

233
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:09,120
That's every element of being with
the possible exception of empty space.

234
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,423
Um,

235
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,120
but in the,

236
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,680
in the mythological world,

237
00:09:13,681 --> 00:09:18,681
the categories I think are more
derived from Darwinian by the effect of

238
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:22,860
Darwinian processes on cognitive
and perceptual function.

239
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,140
So which is to say that we have learned
to perceive and then to infer those

240
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:31,830
things that are most necessary for us
in order to continue our existence,

241
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,420
propagate live well,

242
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,290
all of those things.

243
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,170
And that would be true at the
level of individual survival.

244
00:09:37,171 --> 00:09:39,210
And maybe it's also true at
the level of group survival,

245
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,590
although you know the,

246
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,370
there's a tremendous debate
among evolutionary biologists
about whether or not

247
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,770
selection can take place
at the level of the group.

248
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,433
Anyways,

249
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,650
there are these basic level categories
that manifest themselves to you.

250
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:56,850
And then there's categories of the
imagination that you have to infer up from

251
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:57,900
the sensory domain.

252
00:09:57,901 --> 00:10:02,901
And we do that partly in
science by comparing our
sensory representations across

253
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,320
people.

254
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,480
But we also do it by thinking abstractly,

255
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:08,010
conceptualizing abstractly.

256
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,203
And no,

257
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,740
one of the things that's
interesting about abstractions,

258
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,850
it's not clear whether they're more
or less real than the things they're

259
00:10:14,851 --> 00:10:15,840
obstructed from.

260
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:16,720
You know,

261
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,990
this is a perennial debate among,

262
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:23,550
let's call them ontologists who were
interested in that fundamental fundamental

263
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:25,050
nature of reality itself.

264
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,341
In some sense,

265
00:10:26,341 --> 00:10:28,200
independent of conceptual structures.

266
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:31,230
Our numbers more or less real
than the things they represent.

267
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:36,950
It's a really hard question to answer
because knowing like using numbers as a

268
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:40,920
representational system
gives you unbelievable power.

269
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,220
And there are mathematicians that believe
that there isn't anything more real

270
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:45,840
than mathematical representations.

271
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:49,170
Now it depends to some degree of
course on how you classify reality.

272
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,310
That's the problem with
a question like is a uh,

273
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,980
equivalent to be the
answer to that always is,

274
00:10:55,981 --> 00:10:57,390
well it depends on how you define a,

275
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,000
and it depends on how you define be.

276
00:10:59,001 --> 00:11:01,320
So generally it's not
a very useful question,

277
00:11:01,321 --> 00:11:04,920
but you can still get the point that
there's something very real about

278
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:07,410
abstractions incredibly real.

279
00:11:07,411 --> 00:11:09,270
Because otherwise why
would you bother with them?

280
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,040
They wouldn't give you
any handle on the world.

281
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,233
So what's the,

282
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,090
what's the most useful or what's the most,

283
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,420
what's the broadest possible level of
abstraction and is there any use of any

284
00:11:20,731 --> 00:11:22,410
utility in thinking in that manner?

285
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:25,440
And I tried to make the
case last time that,

286
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:30,570
that in the mythological world there are
three categories or four depending on

287
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:32,730
what you do with the
strange fourth category.

288
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,830
Cause the fourth category is sort of the
category of uncategorizable entities.

289
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:42,000
And so it's sort of the category of
everything that not only do you not know,

290
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,691
but you don't know,

291
00:11:42,691 --> 00:11:43,890
you don't know what it's it's,

292
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:46,740
or you can think about it as
the category of potential.

293
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:50,940
I actually think that's the best way to
think about it is that it's the dragon

294
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,040
of chaos is the category of potential.

295
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,570
And I do believe that we're,

296
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,910
our materialist view is essentially wrong.

297
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,010
I think that the proper
way of looking at the,

298
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,330
at beings that being his
potential and from that potential,

299
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:09,190
whatever consciousness is extracts out
the reality that we inhabit anyways.

300
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:11,360
That's certainly the
mythological viewpoint and,

301
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,050
but it's not just a
mythological viewpoint.

302
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:14,210
It's,

303
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:14,340
it's,

304
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:14,681
it's the,

305
00:12:14,681 --> 00:12:15,130
it's a,

306
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,900
it's a sequence of ideas,

307
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:17,471
for example,

308
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:21,010
that deeply underlies the thinking
of John Piaget and Piaget.

309
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:21,551
By the way,

310
00:12:21,551 --> 00:12:25,240
it was very interested in reconciling
the gap between religion and science.

311
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:27,190
That's really what he
devoted his life to doing.

312
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,300
And so,

313
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,970
and there are other streams of philosophy
and I would say high digger that

314
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,710
phenomenologists are,

315
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,030
are thinking along lines that are similar
to this as well because Heidegger was

316
00:12:37,031 --> 00:12:39,220
concerned not with the
nature of material reality,

317
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,840
but with being as such.

318
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:46,460
And so you can extract out the viewpoint
that I just described from mythology,

319
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:50,290
but it isn't the only source of such,

320
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:51,543
um,

321
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:52,383
what would you call it?

322
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:53,463
A

323
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,090
hypotheses is probably the right idea.

324
00:12:58,091 --> 00:12:58,381
So,

325
00:12:58,381 --> 00:12:59,214
so the idea,

326
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,740
you can think about this as a
bootstrapping process in some senses,

327
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,720
in order for anything to get going,

328
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,010
it has to bootstrap itself up and become
more and more complex as it does that.

329
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:09,490
So it's,

330
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,160
it's like this is the answer
to the chicken and egg problem,

331
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:12,820
right?

332
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,720
Which was first the chicken or the egg
while neither something from which both

333
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,160
the chicken and egg were derived.

334
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:18,610
Right.

335
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,480
Cause the ultimate,

336
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,840
the ultimate answer to that is the
answer to how there are things at all,

337
00:13:22,841 --> 00:13:23,650
who knows?

338
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:26,140
But at some point there were
neither chickens nor eggs,

339
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:28,930
but there were the things that were
the precursors to those things.

340
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:33,040
And so they spiraled
upwards in some sense.

341
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:33,490
And those,

342
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:33,790
those,

343
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,623
uh,

344
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:35,643
initial,

345
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,280
uh,

346
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,360
prodo entities,

347
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,770
single celled animals for,

348
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,080
we need to go back farther than that.

349
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,651
But we could say,

350
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:41,801
well,

351
00:13:41,801 --> 00:13:44,650
single cell animals
differentiated over time.

352
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:45,041
Right?

353
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,590
And there's this looping process that,

354
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,280
that differentiates out into
both the chicken and the egg.

355
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:52,563
So,

356
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,830
but the question is,

357
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:56,080
what do you need in order
for that process to begin?

358
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,160
And that's really the question of what
the fundamental constituent elements of

359
00:14:00,161 --> 00:14:01,000
reality are.

360
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:04,690
And the mythological hypothesis
is that there's are three or four.

361
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,230
One is the fact that there
has to be something that,

362
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,070
that,

363
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,800
that that manifests itself as an observer.

364
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,940
It's something like that,

365
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:18,150
some kind of observer now where that
process of observation starts in the Fila

366
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,540
genetic chain is very,

367
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,250
very difficult to tell.

368
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:21,941
You know,

369
00:14:21,941 --> 00:14:22,481
we might say,

370
00:14:22,481 --> 00:14:22,631
well,

371
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,464
there's certainly nothing,

372
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,100
no possibility of a conscious observer
until there's a differentiated nervous

373
00:14:27,101 --> 00:14:27,820
system.

374
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:30,940
But then prior to the emergence
of differentiated nervous systems,

375
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:35,380
there were animals that were complex
enough to react with the environment in a

376
00:14:35,381 --> 00:14:36,100
manner that,

377
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,341
well,

378
00:14:36,341 --> 00:14:37,360
single celled animals,

379
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:38,350
they're quite complex.

380
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:38,860
I mean,

381
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,600
some of them are unbelievably complicated.

382
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:40,811
You know,

383
00:14:40,811 --> 00:14:42,640
they can move themselves through space,

384
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:43,271
they can orient,

385
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:44,710
they can follow chemical trails.

386
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:45,550
They're not,

387
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,070
they're not stupid by any
stretch of the imagination.

388
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:52,220
Now to what degree they have big,

389
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:52,870
you know,

390
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,290
as something that can represent,

391
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:55,970
well we don't have to speculate on that,

392
00:14:55,971 --> 00:14:58,100
but the prodo elements of,

393
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,200
of conscious being are there.

394
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,483
So you need,

395
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,990
you need a being,

396
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,890
you need that.

397
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,610
The structure of that
being through which the,

398
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:13,570
the entirety of being itself is
interpreted and you need the surround.

399
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,080
It's something like that.

400
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:19,520
And so I conceptualize that as
something that knows that's the knower,

401
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,380
what it knows.

402
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:26,450
That's the interpretive structure and
that which needs to be known or you could

403
00:15:26,691 --> 00:15:26,930
come,

404
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:31,930
you could conceptualize that as the
individual in explored territory,

405
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,600
nested inside unexplored territory.

406
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,100
That's another way of thinking about it.

407
00:15:37,101 --> 00:15:42,101
Or you can think about it
as the individual inside
culture and the individual

408
00:15:42,171 --> 00:15:44,030
culture has nested inside nature.

409
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,410
That's another way of looking at it.

410
00:15:45,411 --> 00:15:50,411
Or you can think of as the knower
and in order surrounded by chaos.

411
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,430
That's another way of thinking about it.

412
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:53,300
But all these things,

413
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:53,811
you know,

414
00:15:53,811 --> 00:15:57,920
they're all attempts to articulate
the same underlying structure.
