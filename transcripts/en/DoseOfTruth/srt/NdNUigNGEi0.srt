1
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,230
How do you identify?

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:12,200
How do you justify a rejection of identity
ism when a pillar of the neo Marxist

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:17,010
strategy is to demographically replaced
the indigenous people of Europe,

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:17,671
London,

5
00:00:17,671 --> 00:00:20,070
it's less than half ethnically English.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:21,723
Um,

7
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:22,380
okay.

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,060
So let's take that question apart.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,953
First of all,

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,440
it isn't self evident to me that it is
specifically a neo Marxist strategy to

11
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:34,780
demographically replaced the
indigenous peoples of Europe and um,

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,080
I don't think that's the strategy anyways,

13
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:40,380
even if that's the outcome because you
have to distinguish between strategy and

14
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,214
outcome.

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,353
Um,

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,620
the strategy and principle is to
bring in immigrants to balance out the

17
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,670
declining birth rate.

18
00:00:47,671 --> 00:00:49,260
Now I'm not saying I agree with that.

19
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,690
I'm just saying that that's
what the strategy is.

20
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:52,551
A,

21
00:00:52,551 --> 00:00:57,551
and then the next part of the question
is predicated on the assumption that

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,590
identitarianism is necessarily
the answer to the problem of,

23
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:04,743
um,

24
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,960
the problem that's being identified,

25
00:01:06,961 --> 00:01:09,270
which is characterized
as excess immigration.

26
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,471
First of all,

27
00:01:10,471 --> 00:01:14,190
we'd have to figure out exactly what
identitarianism means because it isn't

28
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:15,024
clear.

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,050
Uh,

30
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:20,190
if it means radical right
wing ethnic nationalism,

31
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:24,570
I don't think that that's going
to be particularly constructive.

32
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,220
If it means having a sensible discussion
about what the appropriate limits might

33
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,960
be on immigration,

34
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:32,040
uh,

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,140
and to think about that over the long run.

36
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:36,180
And also to have a
serious discussion about

37
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,830
the degree to which say is lamb and,

38
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,150
and the west,

39
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,630
the values of Islam and the
West are actually commensurate,

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,730
then that has to be,

41
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,530
obviously has to be done.

42
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,543
But,

43
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:51,623
um,

44
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,990
so I'm afraid that to
answer that question,

45
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:57,900
I'd have to know more about exactly
how these terms we're being,

46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,460
we're being defined,

47
00:01:59,461 --> 00:02:02,800
especially with regards to
identitarianism cause it's a vague word.

48
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:02,940
And.
