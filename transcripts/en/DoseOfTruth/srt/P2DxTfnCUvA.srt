1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,890
You could ask one question

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,093
I'd like,

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,290
I'd like to ask them how the hell he
figured out what it figured out because I

4
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:13,920
can't,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,980
I can understand how he can call

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,460
incalculably intelligent.

7
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:21,301
You know,

8
00:00:21,301 --> 00:00:22,134
when I read,

9
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:27,990
I read everything he wrote the
1990s but 25 volumes of stuff.

10
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,650
It wasn't like I understood all
of it cause it's tough going.

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,450
I've just never been able to figure
out how he can figure out what he did.

12
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,950
Maybe at an Iq of 180 you know,

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,210
people do one in a billion,

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:42,930
you know,

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,930
maybe he was wanting to billion so he
could see things that I can't figure out

16
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,210
how anyone can see.

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,351
But you know,

18
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:54,960
it might just be an
incredible intelligence.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,510
He sees to have a gift for imagination.

20
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:57,900
Like,

21
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,733
you know,

22
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:02,670
some people are very good at articulation
and we're good at thinking in words

23
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:07,350
and some people are good at thinking in
pictures and he seemed to be really good

24
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:08,280
at both.

25
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:08,571
You know,

26
00:01:08,571 --> 00:01:12,900
I had a tremendous amount of sedation
and could dream 12 weight essentially.

27
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,040
And to learn how to do that and seem
to learn all sorts of things from his

28
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:17,970
weekend dreams.

29
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:18,990
You know,

30
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,250
and I can do that a little bit.

31
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:21,061
You know,

32
00:01:21,061 --> 00:01:22,920
sometimes when I'm doing
therapy with people,

33
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:23,790
for example,

34
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,970
I'll be listening to the macro picture
will pop into my head there a little

35
00:01:26,971 --> 00:01:28,110
fragment of the story,

36
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,070
you know,

37
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,970
like a dream.

38
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,760
It comes with imagery and it
sort of didn't background.

39
00:01:32,761 --> 00:01:35,380
And then I'll notice it and
then I'll tell the person,

40
00:01:35,381 --> 00:01:35,581
they said,

41
00:01:35,581 --> 00:01:35,881
look,

42
00:01:35,881 --> 00:01:38,550
when you said that this
happened in my imagination,

43
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,160
we can take apart the relationship between
what they said and what happened in

44
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:43,991
my imagination.

45
00:01:43,991 --> 00:01:46,830
And that usually shipped substantial
light on what's going on.

46
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,050
But he was an absolute master at that.

47
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,190
So I do actually find out
from him how he managed that.

48
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,980
And maybe you couldn't say,

49
00:01:55,981 --> 00:01:57,890
but I actually like to know that.

50
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,753
Anyone like that.

51
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,620
So there were a couple of questions.
