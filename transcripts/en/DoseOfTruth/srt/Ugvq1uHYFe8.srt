1
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,980
When you stop and think
about where you came from,

2
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,240
you most likely a reminded of your
mother or a street you grew up on.

3
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,790
But think about evolution and biology
class and the animal that we are closest

4
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:25,140
to the chimp.

5
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:30,330
There were based systems that control us
and these systems have been studied in

6
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,610
animals that date back much
farther than the monkey.

7
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,140
In fact,

8
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,490
the animal which gives us insight into
why base drives like status and hierarchy

9
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:42,150
are built in date back one
third of a billion years.

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,060
And if you've been following
Dr. Jordan Peterson,

11
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,120
you'll know exactly what
animal I'm talking about.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,380
Yes,

13
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,213
you guessed it.

14
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,473
The lobster,

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:56,010
the display of status is something
that dates back thousands of years.

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,470
Let's look at the lobsters habitat.

17
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,930
It's a volatile place with many
lobsters struggling to hunt for food and

18
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:06,810
occasionally settling for scraps
that fall from the sky above.

19
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:12,240
If food wasn't enough to have to worry
about shelter is the next item to

20
00:01:12,241 --> 00:01:13,074
struggle over.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,540
And because shelter is so scarce,

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,450
lobsters have to resort
to the only method which,

23
00:01:18,451 --> 00:01:20,100
which they know how to acquire things.

24
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:21,563
Dominance.

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:26,610
Now it's a fun scene that is painted in
the 12 rules for life of the physical

26
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:28,560
struggle for dominance among lobsters.

27
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,030
However,

28
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,020
for the sake of time,

29
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,520
I'll cut to the end of a fight.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,800
Having defined a clear winner and loser.

31
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:41,300
Now it doesn't take a physical altercation
to mark a winner or a loser that is

32
00:01:41,641 --> 00:01:43,440
largely governed by neuro chemistry.

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,140
The two chemicals that
governed the lobsters,

34
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:51,141
mood and behavior are
serotonin and October Jamine
Serotonin and I've Topa mean

35
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,820
exist in balance.

36
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:59,310
And when Serotonin is at a higher level
and October me lower the effect is very

37
00:01:59,311 --> 00:01:59,791
confident.

38
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:03,540
Lobster of Mcgregor ready to
fight everyone type of lobster.

39
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,250
Also heightened serotonin makes a
lobster ready to fight and display its

40
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:11,760
dominance continuously and
as long as the lobster wins,

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:13,530
the serotonin levels stay high.

42
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,480
However,

43
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,770
if the lobster loses,

44
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:21,630
the inverse happens and an increased level
of October mean and lowered serotonin

45
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:26,631
occur leaving a very sad
er sort of lobster soaking
around too afraid to fight.

46
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,350
If a previous dominant lobster loses a
fight is once dominant brain transforms

47
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:38,371
into a new subordinate brain knocking
him down the hierarchy like with humans.

48
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,800
The spoils go to the dominant,

49
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,600
the prime real estate,

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,970
all the ladies and all the scrap food.

51
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,490
The dominance hierarchy is the other
biological structure built into us and all

52
00:02:50,491 --> 00:02:51,324
other animals.

53
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,523
Yes,

54
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,733
builtin.

55
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,330
It isn't the result of social
constructs like capitalism,

56
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,500
communism.

57
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,300
It's not the military industrial complex.

58
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:02,950
It's not the patriarchy.

59
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,690
It's not a human creation.

60
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,280
The dominance hierarchy has been deeply
rooted for hundreds of millions of

61
00:03:09,281 --> 00:03:10,114
years.

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,620
We saw it in grained in the lobster
brain and it is a permanent fact of life.

63
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:19,270
The human brain at a basic level shares
a similar neuro chemistry with the

64
00:03:19,271 --> 00:03:20,104
lobster.

65
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,740
When a human loses a battle or
suffers a defeat or betrayal,

66
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,650
we often recoil and pull within ourselves.

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,930
If we stay down for long enough,

68
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,490
we become chronically depressed.

69
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,560
Serotonin that governs posture and fight
or flight reactions in lobsters has a

70
00:03:35,561 --> 00:03:37,000
similar effect in humans.

71
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,340
Low ranking lobsters are like low ranking
human beings and that their behavior

72
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:42,941
is similar.

73
00:03:42,941 --> 00:03:44,590
When levels of Serotonin are low,

74
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,000
low confidence,

75
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:46,741
costly.

76
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:50,830
Your stress response and being at the
bottom of the hierarchy generally means

77
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,990
more bad things can and will happen,

78
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,550
less happiness,

79
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,290
more pain and anxiety,

80
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,820
more illness and a shorter lifespan
and with higher levels of Serotonin.

81
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:02,170
The end verse effects occur.

82
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:03,730
Less illness,

83
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,080
less misery in depth,

84
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,250
a better income.

85
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,410
At an unconscious level,

86
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,750
your status is tracked at
the root of your brain.

87
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,540
If you're male and your status is high,

88
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:16,870
you have preferential access
to the best places to live.

89
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,280
The highest quality food people want to
socialize and will do anything to help

90
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,114
you.

91
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,420
You have limitless opportunity
for romantic and sexual contact.

92
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,670
If you're a female at the top,

93
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,440
you have access to many attractive,

94
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:30,303
creative,

95
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,030
reliable,

96
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,541
honest,

97
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,720
high quality men and
like the dominant male,

98
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:36,100
you compete ferociously,

99
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,610
even piddle Asley to maintain
or improve your position.

100
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,950
The opposite end of the diamond at the
opposite end of the dominance hierarchy

101
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,210
is a dangerous place.

102
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,190
No good places to live,

103
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,160
if any terrible food when not starving,

104
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,780
poor physical and mental condition as
you're a minimum romantic interest to

105
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:58,330
anyone unless they are
as desperate as you are.

106
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,780
The part of your brain
that assesses dominance,

107
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,850
watches how you were
treated by other people.

108
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,240
The part of your brain
that assesses dominance,

109
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,400
watches how you are
treated by other people,

110
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,510
how you are treated renders
your value and assigns status.

111
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,300
If you were judged to have little worth,

112
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,220
your brain restricts serotonin.

113
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:22,750
This makes you more physically and
psychologically reactive to any event that

114
00:05:22,751 --> 00:05:23,740
produces emotion,

115
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,660
particularly negative ones.

116
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:28,390
That reactivity is needed,

117
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:29,680
where emergency is common,

118
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,540
constantly being alert,

119
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,150
burns up precious energy
and physical resources.

120
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,680
Also,

121
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,430
all emergencies will be tackled loan
because of the lack of quality social

122
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,590
network at the bottom.

123
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,950
You continually sacrifice what you
could otherwise store for the future.

124
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:49,930
Using it up on a heightened readiness
drug use and promiscuity and myriad.

125
00:05:49,931 --> 00:05:54,931
Other things are used to cope with the
stress that habits can present serious

126
00:05:55,001 --> 00:05:56,830
problems and what does the physical,

127
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:57,711
however,

128
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,350
it can be labeled and
mistaken as a mental illness.

129
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:04,700
The positive feedback loop that
alcoholism can create can be fatal.

130
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,850
Imagine someone who
enjoys drinking alcohol.

131
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:13,460
He has a few drinks and his blood
alcohol level rises and when he stops it

132
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:18,440
plateaus and begins to fall and when his
body starts to metabolize the ethanol,

133
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:19,430
he has a hangover.

134
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,380
Well,

135
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,490
most alcoholics at some point realized
drinking helps fight the hangover.

136
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,360
However,

137
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,530
postponing the withdrawal long enough can
be fatal when the cause of the problem

138
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,490
is also the cure.

139
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,500
Creating a positive feedback loop.

140
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,570
The problem can spiral out of control.

141
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,520
With depression,

142
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:42,660
a person feels useless and burdensome so
that'd become isolated and that intern

143
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,060
amplifies the depression.

144
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,620
Social anxiety often
cause from some sort of

145
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,020
social anxiety often caused from some
type of trauma like bullying can lead a

146
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,760
person to avoid eye contact,

147
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:56,421
be upset,

148
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:01,421
easily be certain or indecisive and take
a habitually submissive posture that's

149
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:05,720
observed by all and sometimes further
exploited by adults that have remained

150
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:06,830
Billie's into adulthood.

151
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,300
Some people become bullied
because they can't fight back.

152
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,033
For kids,

153
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:15,740
a six year old is no
match for a nine year old.

154
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,940
Women tend to be less physically
strong in the upper body than men.

155
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,770
However,

156
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,810
some people choose not to fight back.

157
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:29,060
The temperament of a person that's
bullied is commonly compassionate and self

158
00:07:29,061 --> 00:07:34,061
sacrificing and high in negative emotion
and it doesn't help when they make all

159
00:07:34,641 --> 00:07:39,260
sorts of noises that please
the sadistic no step dad,

160
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:42,590
her crying works especially well.

161
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,440
People who have had tyrannical parents
can become sensitive to tyranny and

162
00:07:48,441 --> 00:07:51,090
overaggressive competitiveness
and restricted.

163
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,350
They themselves all the emotions
that might give rise to such things.

164
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,280
These people may decide that
all forms of aggression,

165
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,890
including feelings of
anger are morally wrong.

166
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:05,030
These people restrict their ability
to fight back and because of their

167
00:08:05,031 --> 00:08:07,820
compassionate and self
sacrificing temperament,

168
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,060
which often turns out to
be naive and exploitable,

169
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:14,390
are unable to call forth
the genuinely righteous,

170
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,170
inappropriate,

171
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,530
self-protective anger
necessary to defend themselves.

172
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,000
If you can bite,

173
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,710
you generally don't have too.

174
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,870
When integrated properly,

175
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:27,980
the ability to respond with aggression
and violence decreases rather than

176
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:31,640
increases the probability that actual
aggression will become necessary.

177
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,080
If you say no early in the
cycle of oppression and mean it,

178
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,330
then you will limit its effect on you.

179
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,350
When naive people discover
the capacity for anger within,

180
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,810
they are sometimes shocked severely.

181
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:45,891
However,

182
00:08:45,891 --> 00:08:49,910
when people recognize themselves
as dangerous there fear decreases.

183
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,890
They develop more self respect.

184
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:56,190
There is a little difference between
the capacity for mayhem and destruction

185
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,220
integrated and the strength of character
applying rule one standing up straight

186
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:05,520
with your soldiers back is made much
simpler by instilling a few routines in

187
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,354
your life.

188
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:10,410
Routines are necessary in many aspects
of life to keeping your brain functioning

189
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:11,244
properly.

190
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,590
Sleep is the first area that you want to
address specifically when you wake up.

191
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,263
Also,

192
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,330
you want to wake up around the same
time other people wake up around you.

193
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,860
The relevance of proper sleep
patterns is easily observable.

194
00:09:25,861 --> 00:09:29,280
When you see the difference between
well rested and sleep deprived children

195
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,780
night and day.

196
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,980
Not only does sleep regulate
your security and rhythms,

197
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,480
but eating does too,

198
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,450
so alongside waking up at the same time,

199
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,180
eating at the same time
can be important as well.

200
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,820
What to eat is equally important.

201
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:49,200
High fat and high protein is
preferred to simple carbs and sugars.

202
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,500
Unlike fat and protein rich meals,

203
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:57,480
simple carbs and sugars exacerbate
existing physiological and psychological

204
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:02,481
problems and cause spikes and dips in
blood sugar that people identify as rushes

205
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:03,414
and crashes.

206
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:08,910
High fat and high protein diets leave
you feeling energized and more balanced

207
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:09,744
throughout the day.

208
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,110
If you feel like you're a loser,

209
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,183
maybe you are.

210
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,383
Maybe you aren't.

211
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:16,741
Regardless,

212
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:17,730
you don't have to be.

213
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,020
You may just have one bad habit
or a collection of bad habits.

214
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,570
You may have developed bad posture.

215
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:29,280
You may have been bullied or
unpopular at home or in school.

216
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,410
It's not necessarily appropriate.

217
00:10:31,411 --> 00:10:32,244
Now,

218
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:33,750
circumstances change.

219
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,330
If you slump around like
the defeated lobster,

220
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,920
people will treat you as such.

221
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,510
Then your brain won't produce as much
serotonin which will make you less happy

222
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:44,040
and more anxious and sad.

223
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,790
Your probability of
living in a nice place,

224
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,930
finding a stable,

225
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,793
healthy mate,

226
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,160
your access to high quality
resources will decrease.

227
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:57,600
You will live for the present and not
defer gratification and you will be more

228
00:10:57,601 --> 00:10:58,980
likely to abuse drugs.

229
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,350
Now I'm going to read a
few pages of Jordan's book.

230
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,180
You might object.

231
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,200
The bottom is real.

232
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,230
Being at the bottom is equally real.

233
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,401
Emir.

234
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:13,120
Transformation of posture is insufficient
to change anything that is fixed.

235
00:11:13,990 --> 00:11:17,830
If you're in the number 10 position
and standing up straight and appearing

236
00:11:17,831 --> 00:11:20,590
dominant might only attract the
attention of those who want.

237
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:24,040
Once again to put you
down and fair enough,

238
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,150
but standing up straight
with your shoulders back is
not something that is only

239
00:11:28,151 --> 00:11:30,880
physical because you're not only a body,

240
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,193
you're a spirit,

241
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,490
so to speak,

242
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:34,840
a psyche as well.

243
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:40,030
Standing up physically also
implies and invokes and demands.

244
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:40,750
Standing up.

245
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:45,750
Metaphysically standing up
means voluntarily accepting
the burden of being your

246
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:50,320
nervous system responds in
an entirely different manner.

247
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,840
When you face the demands
of life voluntarily,

248
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,850
you respond to a challenge.

249
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,830
Instead of bracing for a catastrophe,

250
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,263
you see the goal,

251
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,660
the dragon hoards instead of
shrinking and terror from the all too,

252
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,070
real fact of the Dragon.

253
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:07,750
You stepped forward to take your place
in the dominance hierarchy and occupy

254
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:08,650
your territory,

255
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,930
manifesting your willingness to defend,

256
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:11,860
expand,

257
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,910
and transform it.

258
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:18,940
That can all occur practically
or symbolically as a
physical or as a conceptual

259
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:19,830
reconstruction.

260
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,190
To stand up straight with your
shoulders back is to accept the terrible

261
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:26,830
responsibility of life
with eyes wide open.

262
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,450
It means deciding to
voluntarily transformed the
chaos of potential into the

263
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:33,250
realities of habitable order.

264
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,620
It means adopting the burden of self
conscious vulnerability and accepting the

265
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:43,420
end of the unconscious paradise of
childhood where finitude and mortality are

266
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:44,890
only dimly comprehended.

267
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:49,840
It means willingly undertaking
the sacrifices necessary
to generate a productive

268
00:12:49,841 --> 00:12:51,130
and meaningful reality.

269
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,230
It means acting to please God in the
ancient language to stand up straight with

270
00:12:56,231 --> 00:12:56,681
your shoulders.

271
00:12:56,681 --> 00:13:00,400
Back means building the Ark that
protects the world from the flood,

272
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,820
guiding your people through the desert
after they have escaped tyranny,

273
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,680
making your way away from comfortable
home and country and speaking the

274
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:11,770
prophetic word to those who
ignore the widows and children.

275
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,220
It means shouldering the
cross that marks the ex,

276
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:18,940
the place where you and
being intersect so terribly.

277
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:24,700
It means casting dead rigid and too
tyrannical order back into the chaos in

278
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:25,750
which it was generated.

279
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:31,060
It means withstanding the
ensuing uncertainty and
establishing in consequence a

280
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:31,570
better,

281
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,850
more meaningful and more productive order.

282
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,700
So at 10 carefully to your posture,

283
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,100
quit drooping and hunching around.

284
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,330
Speak your mind,

285
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,570
puts your desires forward as
if you had a right to them,

286
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,910
at least the same right as others
walk tall and gays forthrightly ahead,

287
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,980
dare to be dangerous.

288
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,730
Encourage the Serotonin to float
plentifully through the neuropathways.

289
00:13:54,731 --> 00:13:58,000
Desperate for its calming
influence and people,

290
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:01,660
including yourself will start to assume
that you're a competent and able,

291
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:06,280
or at least they will not immediately
conclude the reverse emboldened by the

292
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,170
positive response.

293
00:14:07,171 --> 00:14:08,470
As you are now receiving,

294
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,240
you will begin to be less anxious.

295
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,960
You will then find it easier to pay
attention to the subtle social cues that

296
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:16,060
people exchange when
they are communicating.

297
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,530
Your conversations will flow
better with fewer awkward pauses.

298
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:23,080
This will make you more
likely to meet people,

299
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,160
interact with them,

300
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,233
and impress them.

301
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:26,651
Doing so,

302
00:14:26,651 --> 00:14:30,130
we'll not only genuinely increase the
probability that good things will happen

303
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:30,964
to you.

304
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:34,060
It will also make those good things
feel better when they do happen.

305
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,760
Thus strengthened and emboldened.

306
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,740
You may choose to embrace being and worked
for its furtherance and improvement,

307
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,270
thus strengthened.

308
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,690
You may be able to stand even
during the illness of a loved one,

309
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,730
even during the death of a parent,

310
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,240
and allow others to find strength
alongside you when they would otherwise be

311
00:14:53,241 --> 00:14:56,690
overwhelmed with the
spare thus emboldened,

312
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,730
you will embark on the
voyage of your life.

313
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,200
Let your light shine,

314
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:00,980
so to speak,

315
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,890
on the Heavenly Hill and
pursue your rightful destiny.

316
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:08,180
Then the meeting of your
life may be sufficient to
keep the corrupting influence

317
00:15:08,181 --> 00:15:09,500
of mortal disparate bay.

318
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,410
Then you may be able to accept the
terrible burden of the world and find joy.

319
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,720
Look for your inspiration
to the victorious lobster
