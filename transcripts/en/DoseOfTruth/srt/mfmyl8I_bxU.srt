Hi,

2
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:07,504
Dr. Peterson,

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,760
I would just like to ask you to please
talk about what you called a psychic

4
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:13,120
death,

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,650
also known as an ego death.

6
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:15,570
Okay,

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:16,040
sorry,

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:16,873
say that again.

9
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,480
Would you please talk about what young
referred to as a psychic death also

10
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,440
called an ego death.

11
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,330
That's what happens when someone
who loves you betrays you.

12
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,280
Right?

13
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,270
So imagine that

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:35,010
the world is complicated
beyond comprehension,

15
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:35,490
right?

16
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,240
When you only see a very little bit
of it and the way you structure your

17
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:42,840
understanding is you make assumptions
about things and they're simplifying

18
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:43,331
assumption.

19
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:45,180
So if you trust someone,

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,600
you reduce their complexity massively,

21
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:48,901
right?

22
00:00:48,901 --> 00:00:49,800
Because like,

23
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,270
let's say we were married and there's a
whole bunch of ways that you're going to

24
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:55,980
act that are going to be simpler.

25
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:57,391
Okay.

26
00:00:57,391 --> 00:01:00,930
So then I can tolerate being around
you in some sense because you're not

27
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,670
everything at once.

28
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,420
Now those simplifying structures are
hierarchically assembled and some of them

29
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,630
are far more important than others.

30
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,250
Trust is one of them,

31
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:16,570
especially trust in loved ones,

32
00:01:16,571 --> 00:01:17,291
family members,

33
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:20,400
which is why I'd be trailed by a family
member is really catastrophic cause it

34
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,470
it an it destabilizes your past,

35
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:23,950
right?

36
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,140
All the memories you have at
de stabilizes your present.

37
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,580
It destabilizes your future.

38
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,770
It shakes your faith in human beings,

39
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,040
including yourself and
everything collapses.

40
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:34,480
And that's an ego death.

41
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,580
And so now underneath the ego
as far as young was concerned,

42
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:41,830
was another structure
that he called the self.

43
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:46,120
And the self is the thing that
remains constant across ego deaths,

44
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:47,973
but it's,

45
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,730
it's deeper and less personal.

46
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,880
It's archetipal and it's the thing
that the eagle collapses into when it

47
00:01:56,891 --> 00:01:59,020
collapses and then it rebuilds the ego,

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,120
something like that across time.

49
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:03,430
But that's what an ego death is.

50
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,470
Now there's variants of that because you
can have a voluntary or involuntary ego

51
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:12,940
death and a voluntary ego death is when
you learn a bunch and you're willing to

52
00:02:12,941 --> 00:02:13,774
let go.

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,120
So that would be your own immolation.

54
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:17,110
It's like your lighting,

55
00:02:17,111 --> 00:02:17,231
your,

56
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,510
you're a Phoenix and your
lighting yourself on fire.

57
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:21,580
That's a much better idea.

58
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,410
Even though it can still be really harsh,

59
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,110
the involuntary ego desks,

60
00:02:26,111 --> 00:02:27,280
they're really hard on people.

61
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:30,520
People will do almost anything
to stop that from happening,

62
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:35,521
which is partly why they fight to
maintain their group fostered axiomatic

63
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:38,500
simplifications.

64
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,140
It's not surprising because it's very,

65
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,610
you lose your,

66
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,270
like that ego death is a journey into
the underworld or it's a collapse into

67
00:02:46,271 --> 00:02:47,104
chaos.

68
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:49,120
And that's not so bad if
you do it purposefully.

69
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,070
But in the Pinocchio Story,

70
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:51,641
for example,

71
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:55,060
that's exemplified by Pinocchio going
down to the depths to rescue his father

72
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:55,894
from the whale.

73
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:57,160
Now he does that voluntarily,

74
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:58,210
but it damn near killed him,

75
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,163
right?

76
00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,321
I mean,

77
00:02:59,321 --> 00:02:59,741
first of all,

78
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:01,120
you hardly gets out of the whale.

79
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,440
Second,

80
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,300
he actually drowns and dies,

81
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,010
but he comes back to life.

82
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,690
So even if you do it voluntarily,

83
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:08,524
it's still,

84
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,820
it's just better than
doing it in voluntarily,

85
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,200
which is the other alternative.

86
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,310
So that's what it is.

87
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,680
You Bet.
