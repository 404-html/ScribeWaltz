1
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:05,973
It's

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,750
limited and there is a
zero tolerance policy

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,180
or disruption.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,980
[inaudible]

5
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,230
Dr. Jordan Peterson.

6
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:57,810
[inaudible] [inaudible]

7
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,423
thank you very

8
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,400
much.

9
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,233
Appreciate

10
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,990
to be here at this beautiful.

11
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,530
So I'm going to talk to you tonight.

12
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:38,050
Suffering from some trepidation
regards for this talk is

13
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,240
probably the most difficult
of the talks that I give

14
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,093
and take.

15
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:50,830
It's,

16
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,090
it's basing on

17
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:59,230
much of the material and I'm going to
discuss with you tonight in room 60 12

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:05,400
rules for like which is put your house
in perfect order before you criticize the

19
00:02:06,221 --> 00:02:11,221
world and it's constantly and
the discussion that surrounds it,

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,033
is it

21
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,960
a problem that I interned to Seoul for
very little time and sold means two

22
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:22,391
things.

23
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:25,720
It needs to clearly formulate girl,

24
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,010
which is actually the most difficult
part of solving the problem.

25
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:30,900
Once you,

26
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,650
once you can formulate the problem,

27
00:02:32,651 --> 00:02:35,460
it's fairly easy to lay on possibilities,

28
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:38,260
but to clearly communicate
the problem is very difficult.

29
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:40,390
It doesn't mean solving
isn't necessarily easy,

30
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,233
but

31
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,300
so,

32
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,150
so to solve that problem
needs to formulate,

33
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,460
but also they need to to articulate it
the problem deeply enough so that in

34
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:53,590
principle it might go away.

35
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:54,730
You know,

36
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,490
if you have an argument
with someone in your family,

37
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,120
your or your husband or the sibling,

38
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,600
there's a real conflict around it.

39
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,170
If you formulated conflict
properly and you walked through it,

40
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,070
then you don't have to have to
fight anymore because you've,

41
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:13,470
you've negotiated a settlement,

42
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,790
the problem disappears and
that's actually how you moved.

43
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,400
If you understand something is
that the problem disappears.

44
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:19,770
That takes care of principle.

45
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:25,210
And so the problem that I want to talk
to you about tonight is I want to make a

46
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,360
product specific.

47
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,080
I spent a lot of time thinking
about totalitarianism in,

48
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,140
I'm very interested in both of those
topics interested in ideological

49
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:41,760
possession,

50
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,760
but I'm more interested in something
that's the most extreme variant of

51
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,060
physiological possession and see it.

52
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:54,061
And that's the proclivity of people
to use unbelievably brutal means of

53
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,423
enforcing.

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,840
It carries to the ideology because
etiology in itself is a mystery.

55
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,230
Why can't we believe the fix that they do,

56
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,530
but why they're willing to use,

57
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,900
why they're willing to commit atrocities
in the service of those ideologies is a

58
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:17,920
bunch of deeper history.

59
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:23,530
And one of the stories that
really affected me when I
was studying what happened

60
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,580
in Nazi Germany and indigo light counts
of the Soviet Union because those were

61
00:04:29,321 --> 00:04:31,660
the two forms of massive trust,

62
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,840
let's say that I dealt into intervals
deeply was a story that never really left

63
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:39,400
my imagination.

64
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,060
This was a story or something that was
inflicted upon my prisoners in our shorts

65
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,440
during the time of the
Nazi concentration camps.

66
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,630
Do you understand that?

67
00:04:52,631 --> 00:04:53,381
Something like that,

68
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,190
you kind of have to put yourself there.

69
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,140
You know,

70
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:59,980
and that's an uncomfortable thing
to do for all sorts of reasons.

71
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:02,010
You can put yourself there as victim,

72
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,090
which is actually more
comfortable and get some sense.

73
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:04,641
I mean it's not,

74
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:05,474
but it's comforting,

75
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,530
but your option is basically
victim or perpetrator,

76
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:08,831
right?

77
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:10,600
Take a situation like that.

78
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:13,420
I think it's easier for people
to imagine themselves as victim.

79
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,210
It's not that that's easy cause it's not,

80
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,400
it's a paragraph to attempt,

81
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,740
but it's nowhere near as error.

82
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,400
Generally speaking as it is to
hazard herself a perpetrator.

83
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,150
You might not be willing to do that,

84
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:32,320
but that's actually a mistake because
unless you're willing to think that the

85
00:05:32,321 --> 00:05:37,321
sorts of people who perpetrated
the catastrophes of Nazi
Germany and the Stella

86
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,380
was Soviet Union and I was China,

87
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,723
Cambodia,

88
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,451
et Cetera,

89
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,284
et Cetera,

90
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,930
we thought we added including North Korea,

91
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,670
including now then is the way that this
neighbor and that means that the people

92
00:05:51,671 --> 00:05:56,671
who do it aren't a different species
that you then are the same and I don't

93
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:02,861
really think that we're ever going to
be able to stop that sort of thing so it

94
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:08,981
can be stopped and interviewed the case
without reading those situations as if

95
00:06:10,401 --> 00:06:15,230
we're the perpetrators and that's
a terrible thing to do and fucking,

96
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,550
I don't think that there's any way would
the situation without understanding

97
00:06:19,551 --> 00:06:20,360
that.

98
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,930
One of the things I often encourage my
students can understand when they're

99
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:29,570
contemplating history and reading history
is that they stop reading history like

100
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,840
it's something that happened in the
past and start reading like it's an

101
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:35,960
autobiography because
it's much more effective.

102
00:06:35,961 --> 00:06:37,460
You're a historical creature.

103
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:38,960
When you read about history,

104
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:42,980
when you read history you are grieving
about now you might not know that because

105
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,170
you're not every form of human.

106
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,680
You could be like your
whatever particular form.

107
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:50,490
Huge choke right here,

108
00:06:50,491 --> 00:06:53,660
right now about you have the potential,

109
00:06:53,661 --> 00:06:56,520
but the ending for a
multiplicity of beings,

110
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,270
I think it was Alexander Pope who said,

111
00:06:59,271 --> 00:07:00,440
if I remember correctly,

112
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,300
nothing human is foreign.

113
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,790
To me that's a hell of a statement.

114
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:08,870
On the upside it's really quite something
because there's obviously deep great

115
00:07:08,871 --> 00:07:09,231
people,

116
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:11,570
but on the downside it's
reading something to,

117
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,200
and so to develop a detailed
self understanding is to
develop an understanding

118
00:07:18,111 --> 00:07:19,190
that enables you to,

119
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,110
to,

120
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:21,650
to,

121
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,840
to understand what your
affiliation with the,

122
00:07:24,230 --> 00:07:25,700
with the Nazi camp guards.

123
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,830
And that's a very unpleasant thing.

124
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:32,210
So the situation with Asha,

125
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:34,010
let's say it was,

126
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:37,400
people were brought
there often in Cali cars,

127
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,460
often in either freezing weather or in
very hot butter and they're all crammed

128
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:47,741
together in cattle car standing mostly
as many people as they possibly be

129
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:48,973
crammed in.

130
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,000
And what that meant was many
of them died on the way there.

131
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:57,010
They die of heat exhaustion or they
froze to death if they are on the outer

132
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,230
sides of the car or they suffocate or,

133
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,530
and so it's always,

134
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:06,410
it's very difficult to lens and
how terrible that has to be.

135
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:10,970
And then of course they
arrived at accounts and they
were sorted into people who

136
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,240
from whom some useful labor
might conceivably be extracted
or those who were due

137
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,220
to a relatively immediate death.

138
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,210
And then that's all bad enough,

139
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:23,840
you know,

140
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,590
for sure.

141
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,590
I mean these people were innocent to
begin with and then they were separated

142
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,120
under brutal conditions from their,

143
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,230
from their life.

144
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,440
And so from their past and
the present feminists future,

145
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,300
absolutely traumatizing.

146
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,520
The families were destroyed,

147
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,860
everything was taken away from them.

148
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:48,610
They were treated as badly as animals are
treated when they're treated badly and

149
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:49,770
then,

150
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,860
and they were brought to these
accounts and the counselor.

151
00:08:51,861 --> 00:08:54,680
Cute places like the size of small cities.

152
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,660
Can you think of cow weight to the city?

153
00:08:57,661 --> 00:08:59,370
But really that's what they were.

154
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:03,210
But that wasn't enough for
the people who ran an account,

155
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,260
which is really something because you
think that would be enough no matter how

156
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,940
what we're motivated by,

157
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,950
you might think that
that would do the trick,

158
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:12,060
you know fundamentally,

159
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,490
but it really didn't do the trick.

160
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,710
You know there there was a sign over
Auschwitz which was stolen last year.

161
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,030
Take this side assisted and maybe in
many barriers as if there was only one of

162
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:27,600
them and I can't say the German
or something like perfect connect.

163
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,400
Free maturely is lacking
but it needs work.

164
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,820
We'll set it free.

165
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,160
That was the little model,

166
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,003
the account.

167
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,990
That's also really stuck in
my mind because it was a joke.

168
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,280
No,

169
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,600
it's actually a chill.

170
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,200
It's really something to think of a mind
that would conceptualize that Jill and

171
00:09:48,441 --> 00:09:50,110
put it in that sort of place.

172
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:53,810
Work rules free camp.

173
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,210
It was designed to work people to death.

174
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:58,020
Not even for the work they didn't do.

175
00:09:58,660 --> 00:09:58,860
No,

176
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:03,120
because if the Nazis would've had any
sense and if they wouldn't be motivated by

177
00:10:03,121 --> 00:10:04,260
what they say they would,

178
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,610
we're motivated by,

179
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:07,120
they would just said the cap itself.

180
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:08,730
In a much more humane manner.

181
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,960
They would have used the people,

182
00:10:09,961 --> 00:10:13,630
they put in accounts as slaves to further
the war effort and they might've won

183
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,070
the war,

184
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,060
but that isn't what they did.

185
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:18,030
They brought them to Jews and the
Gypsies and all the other people.

186
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:22,610
They decided where we're worth
having around each of the couch.

187
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:26,490
He just basically work the point to be
the death and the reason for that was

188
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:29,000
because that was the way
you can make the depth.

189
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:29,491
The worst.

190
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:33,780
It could be the hope because they
usually work as a punishment.

191
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,420
You don't if you work utility work.

192
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,570
Soldiered isn't talked
about this as a ghoulag.

193
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,261
When he was there,

194
00:10:40,261 --> 00:10:40,561
he said,

195
00:10:40,561 --> 00:10:41,090
well at least,

196
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,230
but he was laying bricks as a prisoner.

197
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,320
He had the Grad gratification,

198
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,750
let's say if they need to build
a straight wall of bricks,

199
00:10:48,751 --> 00:10:52,290
like there was something about productive
Labor that he's engaging in productive

200
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:57,291
Labor that they need to find at least
see some tiny shred of useful meaning in

201
00:10:57,631 --> 00:10:58,950
this absolutely dismal,

202
00:10:58,951 --> 00:10:59,760
wretched herder,

203
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,720
a circumstance.

204
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,140
But there were people who were running
the camps like Auschwitz who wanted to

205
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:06,601
take,

206
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:08,700
even now the way it worse than that,

207
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,603
convert it.

208
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:13,500
And so one of the things that the camp
guards used to do to the new prisoners

209
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,140
was to have them pick up wet socks,

210
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,730
wet 100 pounds,

211
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:22,290
100 pound sacks of went Saul and
then carry them on their backs.

212
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,810
And then you remember I already told
you that these people had already been

213
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,810
through from one side of
that account to the other.

214
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,730
But that wasn't enough either.

215
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:35,580
Even though there was no reason you
can move the soul and it was only a

216
00:11:35,581 --> 00:11:36,700
demonstration of power,

217
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,450
demonstration of the sub,

218
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,320
absolute subjugation of
the prisoners to this,

219
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,251
what would you call it?

220
00:11:44,251 --> 00:11:46,290
Universal human necessity for work.

221
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,110
We have to work,

222
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:47,490
right?

223
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,070
It's one of the curses God glazed
donuts at the end of the story about me.

224
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,860
People have deployed and you can
find meaning in that inverted,

225
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:00,880
it becomes a torture and you
do that by making it pointless,

226
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,960
difficult appointments.

227
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:08,230
So the carrier that sacral quit
salt from one side of the camp,

228
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,860
how resolve PC,

229
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:14,410
a parody of work and that was what
the joke referred to parody of work.

230
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,670
But that wasn't enough either.

231
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,650
They had good cherry back.

232
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:18,710
Right.

233
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,220
You think there's a
real part of the screen,

234
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:23,320
the same artist that came up with a joke.

235
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,270
There's something about that that system,

236
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,360
it's almost dark and that would
be trained to understand that.

237
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,590
Why is that exactly?

238
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,240
It's not like it's a question
it's gone up with vote.

239
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,500
Although it's a question when
people don't like to ask or answer,

240
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,673
you know,

241
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,880
in your country and in mine,

242
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,273
um,

243
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,020
we have this spectacle of the mass murder.

244
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:55,270
It's a competitive game that often
young men played and you know,

245
00:12:55,271 --> 00:12:58,610
I call it the game for good reason.

246
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,170
That competitive game for good reason
that the mass murders school shooters,

247
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,750
those sorts of people that
keep track of each other.

248
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,100
Now they tried to up the engine.

249
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,480
Each cap,

250
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,990
the most egregious should have was
probably the one at Sandy Hook I would say

251
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,540
for the elementary school
kids who are killed.

252
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,820
Because that brings up
another level of mystery.

253
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:21,710
It's like why go after the innocence?

254
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,720
If you're altered for her revenge,

255
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:31,980
why not punish the guilty and sort of
that because it's more effective to punish

256
00:13:32,081 --> 00:13:35,900
the innocent because
it's more of a violation.

257
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:39,410
It's a greater violation of good,

258
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:40,021
let's say it's,

259
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:40,200
it's,

260
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,390
it's a more evil and it's,

261
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,790
it's a more vegetable active,

262
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,870
you know,

263
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:47,430
perhaps the most data sets of the innocent
might be elementary school children,

264
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,300
especially ones that you don't know.

265
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,150
And so the killer of
the sandy hook killer,

266
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,580
something like he didn't
think this through.

267
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,930
Right.

268
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,310
And that's another thing to consider.

269
00:13:57,311 --> 00:14:01,670
You don't get to the point where you to
do something like that on a win already

270
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,680
taking months,

271
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,310
months,

272
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,310
months or even years of dark fantasizing
before you get to that point.

273
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:14,130
And you can go places that are hardly
imaginable when you allow yourself to be

274
00:14:15,221 --> 00:14:19,120
taken over by the kind of spirit
that produces that kind of fantasy.

275
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,100
Right.

276
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,751
And where do you go?

277
00:14:20,751 --> 00:14:25,751
It's a place where you think that
bringing them a deadly weapon into an

278
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:31,081
elementary school and deliberately
targeted it is the children,

279
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:33,820
is,

280
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,960
is actually a goal that's
reasonable to pursuit.

281
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:43,660
Now you see this most recently,

282
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,720
very recently in Toronto or a band who
was apparently frustrated by his lack of

283
00:14:49,151 --> 00:14:51,290
success in the dating market,

284
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,550
or at least that was the,

285
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,091
excuse me,

286
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:58,091
the accused rented a van and jump
on the sidewalk 12 off on sidewalks,

287
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:02,010
which is very long time,

288
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,270
right?

289
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:04,160
It's not a casual,

290
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,090
aggressive,

291
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,040
impulsive women Christmas years.

292
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,480
Your hand on the steering wheel in your
hands because you're angry and you see a

293
00:15:11,481 --> 00:15:12,291
crowd of people.

294
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,200
It's not fat.

295
00:15:13,201 --> 00:15:13,410
It's,

296
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:13,880
it's,

297
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:14,601
it's very,

298
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:15,440
very deliberate.

299
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:19,130
And to hit people one by one,

300
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,560
you know when it continual
sequence like that.

301
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,090
And then I talked to a journalist who had
seen this man the next day when he was

302
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:26,924
raped in court.

303
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:30,850
She said that he walked into the courtroom
like someone who was there for board.

304
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,750
And so,

305
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,810
so there's this constellation of action.

306
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:44,320
I think that the only proper way to
describe those options is as evil actions.

307
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,400
That is a metaphysical statement,

308
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,160
some sense because you describe it,

309
00:15:50,161 --> 00:15:55,161
the options as equal as to
also with simultaneously
proclaim the reality of good

310
00:15:56,331 --> 00:15:57,650
and evil in the world.

311
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:02,660
But that doesn't really bother me
because I can't see that there's any

312
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,300
alternative language.

313
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,210
It's useful to describe
those sorts of advances.

314
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,700
I mean you might not agree with that.

315
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,230
You might take of,

316
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:18,080
you might not think that
that's the appropriate by
imagine within which to close

317
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,213
such events.

318
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,290
I do the appropriate language.

319
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,850
And that being said,

320
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:24,380
in order to understand those events,

321
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:27,230
you have to speak a
language with good and evil.

322
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,920
And I do believe this to be true
and I can tell you why in part,

323
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,810
one of the things that's happened to me,

324
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,020
I didn't lecture online the distinction
between tragedy and evil and I think

325
00:16:39,211 --> 00:16:42,090
he's one of the most effective
but the directly liberty.

326
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:43,400
Um,

327
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,660
I started to say brigade,

328
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,710
I would conceptually
earthquakes and cancer,

329
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:50,240
you know the standard
catastrophes of life,

330
00:16:50,241 --> 00:16:52,100
that CPP perpetrator,

331
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
acts of God so to speak and very hard
on people obviously and often Danthony

332
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:03,110
from the level of attacks which are
deadening in the same manner and you might

333
00:17:03,111 --> 00:17:05,160
think therefore the same thing.

334
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,510
They're not the same thing.

335
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:10,730
Their tragedy is one thing and malevolence
is another thing and the level of

336
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:11,361
tragedies,

337
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:12,410
but worst of things,

338
00:17:12,411 --> 00:17:15,590
and we actually don't as
clinicians if we're awake,

339
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,340
has clinical all of those because one
of the things that it's quite well

340
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:24,341
documented in the claim in the literature
is what causes post traumatic stress

341
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:27,560
disorder and generally speaking,

342
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,080
it isn't exposure to tragedies
that caused this poster and

343
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,760
usually what goes as close to
his exposure to malevolence.

344
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,030
So not only do you have to be heard,

345
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:45,090
let's say you have to be hurt by
someone who is intended for now.

346
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,341
That's what I'm very,

347
00:17:46,341 --> 00:17:50,430
the other variance of this often happens
to soldiers going to bow down and they

348
00:17:50,431 --> 00:17:54,510
observe themselves in something that's
deeply malevolent and they never knew

349
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,320
that they had been asking for that perhaps
does partner in that even enjoys it,

350
00:17:58,321 --> 00:18:02,940
at least in the moment logo and
afterwards they're fragmented by the

351
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:03,803
consequences.

352
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,960
Say people who were
perhaps somewhat too naive,

353
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,490
he can make effective soldiers.

354
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,593
Um,

355
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,990
they observe themselves doing something
terrible that the battlefield and then

356
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:15,390
they're broken and they
cannot be repaired.

357
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,510
And I've had many heart,

358
00:18:16,511 --> 00:18:18,150
it's very difficult for
them to be repaired.

359
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:23,151
And I've had many people like that contact
me and say that because of the watch,

360
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,990
this lecture hall,

361
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:27,300
the Distinction Between Tragedy and evil,

362
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:31,380
they have been able to recover at least
in part from the post traumatic stress

363
00:18:31,381 --> 00:18:32,214
disorder.

364
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:32,971
And so,

365
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:34,580
and in my own clinical practice,

366
00:18:34,581 --> 00:18:35,550
when I treated people,

367
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:39,870
I had a client who was a young woman
and she had been bullied very badly.

368
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:44,870
Buddy boy who she did not want to go out
with it after that made it his life's

369
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:50,190
work to bring her down when she get
very effectively with his friends and he

370
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:53,160
pulled her into a state
of absolute psychosis.

371
00:18:53,161 --> 00:18:54,090
When I first saw her,

372
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,270
she couldn't even speak
and she was hallucinating.

373
00:18:57,390 --> 00:19:00,570
She had an auditory and
visual hallucinations and
I could barely communicate

374
00:19:00,571 --> 00:19:01,404
with her.

375
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,640
I spent about eight months with her slowly
detailing out what happened and what

376
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:12,660
have really affected her was the fact
that she couldn't understand how anyone

377
00:19:12,661 --> 00:19:16,290
could be so cruel as to bloat the way to
do nothing but make her life miserable.

378
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,820
And that's what broke
her and she was real.

379
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,250
It was really serious.

380
00:19:20,790 --> 00:19:23,220
And we had to sit and talk.

381
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:23,821
First of all,

382
00:19:23,821 --> 00:19:28,050
I tried to carry ways of then as she
recovered in increasingly coherent ways

383
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,090
about good and evil,

384
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:34,440
essentially about the fact that people
can be motivated to pursue nothing.

385
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,450
That disruption and pain and misery and
to do that consciously and with intent

386
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,910
accidentally and at that as,

387
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,930
as the victims of some other process,

388
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:46,650
you know,

389
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:50,520
but knowing full well what they're doing
it and doing it because they know what

390
00:19:50,521 --> 00:19:51,354
they're doing.

391
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,360
And she was a lot more mature,

392
00:19:54,361 --> 00:19:57,870
let's say at the end of that process
that she was at the beginning of April,

393
00:19:57,871 --> 00:19:59,470
she paid great crisis,

394
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:02,280
which is typically the case.

395
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,120
So I do understand that.

396
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:12,000
I do understand what sort of language is
necessary for use to frame these sorts

397
00:20:12,001 --> 00:20:12,834
of situations.

398
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,220
And um,

399
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:18,470
and I think the language of good
and evil is the appropriate leg,

400
00:20:18,471 --> 00:20:23,471
which you aren't treating the topic we
sufficient seriousness unless you need to

401
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:27,090
use the appropriate terminology and evil.

402
00:20:27,091 --> 00:20:31,620
To me it's something like the generation
of harm for the sake of the harm,

403
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,610
especially to think about it
as a condiment dispensing it.

404
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,740
And you can understand that if you
think about the side dimension,

405
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,320
we're pro second freak.

406
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,100
There's and this authentic to that.

407
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,260
It's a dramatic or artistic statement
painted in blood essentially.

408
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:50,360
And people don't like that idea
because we don't make fleet.

409
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:50,860
You know,

410
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,050
we like to think that
the only cause of human

411
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,010
inappropriate human action,

412
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,560
like people just do better.

413
00:21:00,561 --> 00:21:01,231
They wouldn't do it.

414
00:21:01,231 --> 00:21:02,990
And it's like I'm afraid
that just doesn't cut it.

415
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,980
People know perfectly well what you're
doing and that's exactly why you're doing

416
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:07,790
it.

417
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:09,220
I mean there are secrets involved,

418
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,590
it's involved in everything and it's
just not sufficient explanation.

419
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:18,790
So the question is where do you go when
you use language is put an evil and

420
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,810
that's associated with another question,

421
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:24,620
which is something like what's
the proper level of analysis?

422
00:21:24,621 --> 00:21:26,810
Because as I mentioned it to begin with,

423
00:21:26,811 --> 00:21:27,840
it's very difficult to,

424
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,270
to solve a problem formulating property.

425
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:34,020
So the question here,

426
00:21:34,021 --> 00:21:34,854
I think that

427
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:38,130
the emerging question
is what could happen?

428
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,950
What else do you use
to approach the issue?

429
00:21:40,951 --> 00:21:44,690
And I would say there
is a deeper question.

430
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,210
The question of human motivations
are equal except perhaps the opposite

431
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:50,901
question,

432
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:52,520
which is human motivation for good.

433
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,130
I've heard the same thing in some sense,

434
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:54,400
right?

435
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,591
It does.

436
00:21:54,591 --> 00:21:55,490
If you pause it one,

437
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,590
you will also be positive.

438
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,180
It's opposite it dark you incident
because of like taking poison evil.

439
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:04,160
You are the opposite of that.

440
00:22:04,161 --> 00:22:05,270
There's no way around that.

441
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,810
So it's the same question and I'm going
to be the question I suppose suppose of

442
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,180
ethical behavior of morale,

443
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,260
something like that in the question,

444
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,820
the question of this nature,

445
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,070
the nature of reality in the world.

446
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,020
It's a deep question.

447
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:19,440
You could say it's the deepest,

448
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:25,280
deepest question and it
requires formulation at the
deepest possible level of

449
00:22:25,281 --> 00:22:30,281
analysis and it's a mystery that requires
formulation at the deepest possible

450
00:22:30,681 --> 00:22:31,730
level of analysis.

451
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,620
And so you accept that it's a history
of you except that it's a deep just left

452
00:22:35,621 --> 00:22:36,451
one and I'm assistant.

453
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:37,460
Didn't you ask yourself,

454
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,700
where did you go to find an answer to
a question that's mysterious at the

455
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:48,500
deepest possible level of analysis and
down to that at least the partners you go

456
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,334
or you don't,

457
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:50,900
you go over,

458
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,830
you don't know.

459
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:54,100
You go to that place that you don't know.

460
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,450
There's actually a technical,

461
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,660
that's a technical issue in some sense.

462
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:02,130
So one of the things that
currently only pointed out,

463
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:08,580
and I think this is well supported by the
relevant neuro psychological and neuro

464
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,170
psychiatric literature,

465
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:16,370
is that your dreams and your fantasies
contain the information that you don't

466
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:19,590
yet know.

467
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,213
Now,

468
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:24,140
that's not an easy thing to understand
that because you might think,

469
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,280
let's say you have to three,

470
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,170
you figure out what the dream means.

471
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,550
Then there's a mystery,

472
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,413
which is,

473
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:31,171
well,

474
00:23:31,171 --> 00:23:32,440
if you didn't know what to treat them,

475
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,160
how the hell did you dream it?

476
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,210
Right?

477
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,840
Mean because you drunk,

478
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,640
you don't understand it.

479
00:23:38,641 --> 00:23:39,660
So how does that work?

480
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,980
Because how can you think of
something that you don't understand?

481
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,333
Part of the army,

482
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,710
you're not exactly a unity.

483
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,860
There's parts of you that know things
that other parts of you don't know.

484
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:52,730
Or there's parts of you that know things
in ways that the part of you that parks

485
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,230
can understand that.

486
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,650
And there's things that you act out
that are too complicated for you to

487
00:23:57,651 --> 00:23:59,240
represent for it to articulate.

488
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:02,540
And so there's lots of things that were,

489
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,520
that you don't understand
that our adolescent foreman,

490
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,120
I mean,

491
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,420
you know,

492
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,670
you don't know how you breathe,

493
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,050
you don't know what in your heart works.

494
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,150
It's not support how your heart beats.

495
00:24:11,151 --> 00:24:12,740
You don't have voluntary
control over that.

496
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:17,660
So it's not that surprising in some sense
that your mind could produce contents

497
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:19,640
that transcend your articulate.

498
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,100
No idea was that,

499
00:24:22,101 --> 00:24:25,060
that's what dreams did that
with what dreams were doing,

500
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:29,840
ascension was you haven't worldview
and that worldview was only partial

501
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:30,801
obviously,

502
00:24:30,801 --> 00:24:31,510
because what the hell,

503
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,210
you know,

504
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,080
so you know,

505
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,321
you're,

506
00:24:33,321 --> 00:24:36,140
you're limited in your knowledge
and you're articulate and you're,

507
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,010
and you're,

508
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,370
you're,

509
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:37,890
you're,

510
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,760
you're logical.

511
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,471
It integrated,

512
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:41,870
articulate knowledge
as the limited domain.

513
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:45,840
And there's lots of things that
exist outside that made those,

514
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,191
it takes,

515
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:48,440
you don't understand or
errors that you've made.

516
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,640
And you also have to cope with them half
to start provisionally understanding

517
00:24:52,641 --> 00:24:52,911
them.

518
00:24:52,911 --> 00:24:56,630
Because not only do you have to understand
what you understand and most will

519
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:59,510
have to come to understand
what you don't yet understand.

520
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,381
Right?

521
00:25:00,381 --> 00:25:03,290
And that's how you learn and
it's August how that happens.

522
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,600
And Hume's idea was that
this is an elaboration I came
to some degrees while you

523
00:25:08,601 --> 00:25:13,140
learned in part by acting and then you
learn in part by representing that action

524
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,030
and you learn by analyzing
this representation.

525
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,440
And I would say yoga is not particularly
well regardless in most cases by

526
00:25:21,441 --> 00:25:22,010
modern,

527
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:25,700
more biologically oriented
psychologists and medical practitioners.

528
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:28,730
But that's generally because they don't
understand what the hell he was talking

529
00:25:28,731 --> 00:25:29,510
about.

530
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:33,260
So the reason is there's good news,

531
00:25:33,261 --> 00:25:34,490
psychiatric evidence now,

532
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:37,640
psychological evidence that that's
actually how the brain functions.

533
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:40,500
So there is a neuropsychologist,

534
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,690
they'll Conan Goldberg who was a student
of another neuropsychologist named

535
00:25:44,691 --> 00:25:45,650
Alexander Luria,

536
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,490
who's a Russian,

537
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:51,490
probably the grade school psychologist
of the 20th century is he basically laid

538
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,310
the ground water.

539
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:58,760
My understanding of the way the brain
functions and his students discovered

540
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:03,790
extraordinarily fundamental
neurophysiological fact
spoke to Brady's heavy

541
00:26:03,921 --> 00:26:05,680
hitter and his student help.

542
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,440
Conan Bloomberg was very interested
in why we have two hemispheres.

543
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:12,020
It's not obvious what
have to have a seriously.

544
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:15,890
It's as as we have two
brains and there is evidence.

545
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,820
There was surgery that was government,

546
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:22,430
not so much anymore but years ago when
people had intractable epilepsy that

547
00:26:22,431 --> 00:26:24,980
caused the two hemispheres stuff,

548
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,960
Corpus Callosum,

549
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:28,220
which is the fat tissue,

550
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:32,260
proper hemispheres and collecting,

551
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,263
discovered

552
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:39,580
conscious and so it's
actually the case in,

553
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,463
in you,

554
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:45,450
in your feed you have to consciousness
is that someone separate that you'd be

555
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,980
the case that each have had
various functions and what
that implies is that you

556
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:54,540
need to look at the world in two ways
and that implies maybe that the world is,

557
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:59,770
is in some sense fundamentally divisible
into two because otherwise why would

558
00:26:59,971 --> 00:27:04,500
have you evolved the brain then we'd look
at it in two ways since you evolve to

559
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:09,030
actively avoid hitting the world and it's
not just you because animals have two

560
00:27:09,031 --> 00:27:14,031
hemispheres as well as a very fundamental
division and what Goldberg's suggested

561
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:20,210
was that your left hemisphere
of a specialized for
operation in places that you

562
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:26,070
understand in your right hemisphere was
specialized for operation in places that

563
00:27:26,071 --> 00:27:27,180
you don't understand,

564
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:28,010
find.

565
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:30,990
You can think about that if you want to
think about it from a more biological

566
00:27:30,991 --> 00:27:31,591
perspective.

567
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:34,140
You could say that you have one system,

568
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:38,910
say psychological system that
orients you unexplored territory,

569
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:43,470
which is where your things are familiar
and where you can predict what's going

570
00:27:43,471 --> 00:27:43,981
to happen,

571
00:27:43,981 --> 00:27:47,880
where what you want to happen is happening
because that's the best definition of

572
00:27:47,881 --> 00:27:48,810
being comfortable,

573
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,470
right?

574
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,130
You know,

575
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:55,130
you know where you are when you act and
what you want to have happen happens.

576
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:00,530
That's a place that's home that's
explored territory and what an unexplored

577
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:01,471
territory is.

578
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:02,160
The space,

579
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,270
the on account fire,

580
00:28:03,271 --> 00:28:06,240
let's say the darkness of
the night in the jungle,

581
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,590
but also that place where things that
you didn't know what to expect or want

582
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,380
happened and he's the best.

583
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,190
So that's what the world is composed of,

584
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:15,790
the substance of the
world have experienced.

585
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:19,500
It's all those things that you want to
have happen that you're familiar with and

586
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,480
all those things that
go bump in the night.

587
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,720
All those things that rise up out
of the unknown to disrupt your,

588
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,920
the best laid plans of mice,

589
00:28:27,921 --> 00:28:28,710
let's say.

590
00:28:28,710 --> 00:28:32,490
And so you do have these two separate
neurological systems in the way.

591
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,740
And so that was outlined.

592
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,010
Oil foaming Goldberg quite nicely and uh,

593
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:41,190
it's been verified by neurosis
neuropsychiatric status.

594
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:42,030
For example,

595
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,290
by MDGs Rep Shaundra who's
a neurologist at Ucla.

596
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:47,580
I'll tell you a story about that,

597
00:28:47,850 --> 00:28:48,810
but he discovered,

598
00:28:48,811 --> 00:28:50,130
cause it's pretty damn amazing.

599
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,780
So there's this neurological
condition called neglect.

600
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,040
I said,

601
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,120
really strange condition.

602
00:28:56,121 --> 00:28:57,670
It's virtually in comprehensible.

603
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:02,040
And what happens if you have eucalyptus
that you have a stroke and you're right,

604
00:29:02,041 --> 00:29:06,730
the bridle up the right priority
area of your right hemisphere has,

605
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,560
right?

606
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,500
It doesn't happen if
it's left hemispheres.

607
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:15,280
And what happens if you have that stroke
is you lose the logic side of your

608
00:29:15,331 --> 00:29:16,164
body.

609
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:20,070
And the loss is extremely interesting
that the first thing is you lose motor

610
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,600
control so you can't move it.

611
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,790
But that's sort of the beginning of it.

612
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:27,030
You lose your ability to conceptualize it.

613
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,750
The fact that you had the left
side of your body and more,

614
00:29:30,751 --> 00:29:33,430
you lose the ability to conceive of land.

615
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,400
And we don't know how this happens.

616
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:36,870
I think it must be something like,

617
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,280
you know,

618
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,010
if I stand here and look out at all,

619
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,260
I can see that people right
in front of me quite clearly,

620
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,420
and then the people to my right and left,

621
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:47,750
as long as I keep my eyes fixed,

622
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,790
it's right in front of me.

623
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:49,990
They're quite blurry.

624
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,280
I can't see their faces,

625
00:29:51,281 --> 00:29:52,390
although I know there people.

626
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:56,260
And then by this are out at the
periphery of my visual system.

627
00:29:56,261 --> 00:29:58,000
I don't even have color vision anymore.

628
00:29:58,001 --> 00:30:03,001
Even white tape it door cause the tests
to show that and then past that which is

629
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:04,804
behind me.

630
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,853
There's nothing,

631
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,660
it's not black.

632
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:08,860
It's not an amputee,

633
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,010
it's just not there.

634
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:11,883
It's not even,

635
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,930
it's not even gone.

636
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,241
Fair.

637
00:30:13,241 --> 00:30:14,470
It just doesn't exist.

638
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:19,180
And what seems to happen when people who
have neglect that moves around a three

639
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:21,220
quarters of that thing instead of half.

640
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:24,070
Now that's a guess because
we really don't know.

641
00:30:24,071 --> 00:30:26,980
But if you get people who
they'd like to draw a clock,

642
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,660
it will put all the numbers in one half.

643
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:30,100
And if you give them a plate full of food,

644
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:32,770
they'll only eat the food off
the right side of the plate.

645
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:33,940
And if you turn the plate,

646
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,260
they'll eat half of what's left.

647
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,980
And then even more strangely now,

648
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:42,340
I meant they notice that they have a
left heart and it really upsets them.

649
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:45,760
So they have it and they noticed they
have a left arm and they'll try to,

650
00:30:45,761 --> 00:30:47,290
it will be horrified by it.

651
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,940
They'll think in someone else's,

652
00:30:48,941 --> 00:30:52,320
they'll take maybe someone that they know
or that maybe the nurses left the body

653
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,840
and sometimes they'll even
try to throw it out with bed.

654
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,770
And so and so they don't seem to buy.

655
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:00,920
And here's the other thing,

656
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,840
strange is they're not upset about the
fact that they're half paralyzed as

657
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,430
because they actually don't
know that they're half parallax.

658
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:08,590
And the reason for that,

659
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,070
the part of the brain that would alert
them to the fact that they're half

660
00:31:12,071 --> 00:31:14,050
paralyzed is being
destroyed by the stroke.

661
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,510
So it's,

662
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,091
it's there,

663
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,180
don't have sex at all.

664
00:31:17,181 --> 00:31:20,290
Like that part that would make them
upset because you should be upset if you

665
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:21,420
lose half your voice.

666
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,140
It's like that's very upsetting.

667
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,330
And the fact that you get upset is your,

668
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:30,420
it alerts you to the importance of the
loss and so mad that he didn't care a

669
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:32,500
little bit.

670
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,390
Well then would you notice
and answered as well?

671
00:31:34,391 --> 00:31:35,530
Apparently not.

672
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:40,950
And so what grandma Sean was
experimented with the balance,

673
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,860
literally the balance of
people who have neglected.

674
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:50,080
He did this weird little experiments
that you do to test people's vestibular

675
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:50,471
system,

676
00:31:50,471 --> 00:31:52,650
which enables them to
stay on break felons,

677
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,493
consultant.

678
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:56,170
If you pour cold water in someone's ear,

679
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,460
then it upstairs,

680
00:31:57,461 --> 00:32:00,940
I have sense of their buildings because
your ears are intensely involved in your

681
00:32:00,941 --> 00:32:04,710
balance and your eyes are move back
and forth and it destabilizes the seas.

682
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:10,140
And so around the Shaundra was
testing his neglect cases for their,

683
00:32:11,110 --> 00:32:11,681
for their,

684
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:12,514
uh,

685
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:15,190
for their testicular
function using cold water.

686
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:19,750
A number of them woke up and
realized that they were paralyzed.

687
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,610
And his idea was
essentially that the shock,

688
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:25,900
eventually the shock of the
cold water was enough to,

689
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,030
to increase,

690
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:32,380
say emotional functioning enough to
reactivate the damage and efforts in the

691
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:36,300
right hemisphere to wake them up
enough to notice that have to go into

692
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:41,310
businesses and to produce a catastrophic
emotional response when people realize

693
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:42,623
what happened.

694
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:43,863
Um,

695
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,210
so if you call the attention
of someone with neglect,

696
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,420
the left hand and you say,

697
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,020
you haven't left handed there,

698
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:50,861
and we said,

699
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:51,501
can you move it?

700
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:51,951
And they'll say,

701
00:32:51,951 --> 00:32:52,170
well,

702
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,003
never mind.

703
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:56,450
I don't feel like my arthritis
is point this morning.

704
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,081
It hurts me.

705
00:32:57,081 --> 00:32:59,840
They come up with some rationalization
for why they can't move it,

706
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,520
but they're not upset.

707
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:03,460
So robichon none when
you're getting your ears.

708
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:07,160
And then they wake up and they haven't
had a strong emotional response to the

709
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:09,020
loss of the live side of your body.

710
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,960
But then 20 minutes later they snap out
of it and then they forget they lost the

711
00:33:12,961 --> 00:33:13,400
left.

712
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,190
They go right back to
their old way of thinking.

713
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:16,671
Now,

714
00:33:16,671 --> 00:33:20,180
what's so interesting about this and how
it's related to whatever he told you is

715
00:33:20,181 --> 00:33:20,710
that,

716
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,010
see,

717
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:24,050
their left hemisphere had already
built a blog with their body,

718
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,600
and you know you have
a model of your body.

719
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,260
It's really [inaudible].

720
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,370
You can tell that magic
if you break a tooth,

721
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:35,450
what happens if you break your tooth is
your tongue grooves absolutely insane,

722
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:35,810
right?

723
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:36,800
Next three months,

724
00:33:36,801 --> 00:33:40,190
all of your tongue does
is poke around in there.

725
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,520
Pick her up exactly the
contours of your mouth,

726
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:46,610
and maybe it takes you three
months to update that too.

727
00:33:46,611 --> 00:33:49,310
And you don't feel like
you're both is a stranger.

728
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:51,970
And the reason for that is
what you should let him know.

729
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,300
It's in your outrage.

730
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,160
Like entire,

731
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,340
you're unbelievably are not sensitive.

732
00:33:58,341 --> 00:34:01,400
And so because when you put things
in there and you have to eat,

733
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:05,870
and so you have the intelligence of
what's you and what isn't for you.

734
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:06,860
Choose your tongue.

735
00:34:06,890 --> 00:34:07,071
Like,

736
00:34:07,071 --> 00:34:07,610
I mean,

737
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:10,070
it's very important to
have that map that you see.

738
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:13,970
You see with your experience
with having a damage tooth.

739
00:34:13,971 --> 00:34:17,690
You see just how much work it takes to
even do a little tiny bit of remapping,

740
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:18,140
right?

741
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,090
It's like three months of of Tom,

742
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,480
the effort to update
your will of your mouth.

743
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:26,870
Imagine how much effort it would lucky
we'll take to update your model of your

744
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:28,430
body if you've lost half of it,

745
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:29,510
right?

746
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,021
So that's it.

747
00:34:30,021 --> 00:34:31,880
So your left hemisphere count do that.

748
00:34:31,881 --> 00:34:36,110
It just keeps on processing
your body with the old model.

749
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,390
And since the right hemispheres damaged,

750
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,480
there isn't any emotion
associated with the loss.

751
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:46,220
And so the left hemisphere just keeps
on grinding away on its own local one.

752
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,250
And that happens to us a lot.

753
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:52,610
But that's sort of how we think is that
we have these partial models of reality

754
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:55,550
that more or less work and
were really stubborn about.

755
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,400
And we don't want them to disappear
because they take a bloody modern word to,

756
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,100
to formulate.

757
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,590
And if we're forced to lose the,

758
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,220
it tends to be catastrophic.

759
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,410
And so an example that might be,

760
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,521
you know,

761
00:35:07,521 --> 00:35:12,200
let's say you put a whole bunch of
effort into a monogamous monogamous

762
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:15,980
relationship and so as she's
lasted 10 years and you think,

763
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:17,150
well what's the effort?

764
00:35:17,151 --> 00:35:18,670
Okay well the first PBS,

765
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:22,610
you've gone a lot of places with this
person who had done a lot of things with

766
00:35:22,611 --> 00:35:26,120
them and you have a story about that and
the stories based on your understanding

767
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:31,121
of that person and the implication of
that understanding for your understanding

768
00:35:31,191 --> 00:35:32,024
of you.

769
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,650
So you know you might be equal.

770
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,730
I took mine,

771
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:38,040
my wife or husband to Hawaii and we

772
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,960
have a nice time and you have that
whole memory and you have hundreds of

773
00:35:42,961 --> 00:35:44,370
memories like that whole sequence,

774
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,390
the next your story about who you
are and very hard in the past.

775
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,770
And then you have a story like that,

776
00:35:51,210 --> 00:35:54,510
who you are and what maybe we now and
then give a story like that about your

777
00:35:54,511 --> 00:35:55,320
future.

778
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,830
And then you find out what the partners
can been having sequential affairs for

779
00:35:58,831 --> 00:36:00,240
the last 15 years.

780
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:01,201
And it's like,

781
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,730
well what happens?

782
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:03,601
Well,

783
00:36:03,601 --> 00:36:05,270
your model's not really delicate.

784
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,871
And then you think,

785
00:36:06,871 --> 00:36:06,961
well,

786
00:36:06,961 --> 00:36:08,250
what does that mean exactly?

787
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,031
Well,

788
00:36:09,031 --> 00:36:13,140
it doesn't just mean that you
don't know who your partner is,

789
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,680
although it really means that it also
means everything is not about your past is

790
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:19,823
wrong.

791
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,830
All those memories of
everything that happened,

792
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,080
those aren't accurate.

793
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:28,410
And so when something like
that happens in deep betrayal,

794
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:31,740
this is why Dante put betrayers
in the lowest level of hell,

795
00:36:31,741 --> 00:36:32,574
by the way,

796
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:37,740
are besides safety itself in case denies
that the betrayers and because it blows

797
00:36:38,131 --> 00:36:41,430
out your model of the past and
the presence of the teacher,

798
00:36:41,431 --> 00:36:43,500
you told him where your are,

799
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,740
we don't know where you were and
you don't know where you're going.

800
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,080
And it's worse than that.

801
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:52,500
That because you also don't know who you
are anymore because you are obviously

802
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,350
someone who just wasn't that
awake and you were with someone.

803
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,330
Justin wasn't who you thought they were.

804
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,890
And so it's no wonder you'd be
resistant to information like that.

805
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,061
You know what I mean?

806
00:37:06,061 --> 00:37:10,880
It's like who the hell wants to have a
global theory of that magnitude disprove

807
00:37:10,881 --> 00:37:11,940
dealt a blow?

808
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:16,650
It just leaves you wide open and exposed
to the world so we can protect your

809
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,900
theories as much as you possibly can.

810
00:37:18,901 --> 00:37:23,400
You're not going to overthrow them because
of some casual disapprove or to stick

811
00:37:23,401 --> 00:37:24,234
to them.

812
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:24,481
You know,

813
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:27,630
psychologists talk about
that as a confirmation bias.

814
00:37:27,631 --> 00:37:29,530
Let's say I think about it as a cognitive.

815
00:37:29,531 --> 00:37:30,364
They are,

816
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,050
you know,

817
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:34,050
bemoan the fact that people are
very stubborn about giving up their

818
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:34,920
presuppositions,

819
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:36,270
but it's no bloody wonder.

820
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,531
You know,

821
00:37:36,531 --> 00:37:37,080
it's,

822
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,913
it's,

823
00:37:38,010 --> 00:37:40,740
you put a lot of afternoon to
that formulation of the world.

824
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:42,780
It's not just a representation,

825
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:43,501
right?

826
00:37:43,501 --> 00:37:45,870
It's the way we live in the world.

827
00:37:45,871 --> 00:37:47,040
And so if you give that up,

828
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:48,990
well then what the hell
are you supposed to do?

829
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:49,711
Right?

830
00:37:49,711 --> 00:37:51,060
You're supposed to be enraged.

831
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:52,030
He's supposed to have a fit,

832
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,310
is supposed to become bourbon.

833
00:37:53,311 --> 00:37:53,491
Russ,

834
00:37:53,491 --> 00:37:55,800
are you supposed to
collapse into depression?

835
00:37:55,890 --> 00:37:58,230
He's supposed to be
like infinitely cynical.

836
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:01,740
Are you supposed to never happen to have
a relationship that your life are you

837
00:38:01,741 --> 00:38:05,730
supposed to be half complete contempt
for yourself for being so naive and blind

838
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,360
or you're supposed to hate humanity
because it contains the capacity for that

839
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,500
kind of betrayal.

840
00:38:10,590 --> 00:38:12,060
It's like you don't know.

841
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:16,470
All of those things are true all at
one civil paisley and that's the little

842
00:38:16,471 --> 00:38:17,970
space that you occupy,

843
00:38:17,971 --> 00:38:18,690
right?

844
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,880
That's the mythical
underworld essentially.

845
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,220
That's a place you go when
your dreams and hopes died.

846
00:38:24,450 --> 00:38:26,550
Everyone goes there from time to time.

847
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,040
Lots of people go there
and never come out.

848
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,773
So what did,

849
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,220
what happens when you,

850
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,860
what happens in a situation like that?

851
00:38:34,861 --> 00:38:38,770
What happens when you're faced by
something that you really radically don't

852
00:38:38,771 --> 00:38:39,604
understand?

853
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:43,540
Partly what happens is you start
fantasizing about who you can partner.

854
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:48,910
Was it the it's you don't need to be
pumped into all sorts of dramatic theories

855
00:38:48,911 --> 00:38:50,330
about what they might really be.

856
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:51,164
Number two,

857
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:51,810
right?

858
00:38:51,810 --> 00:38:52,280
There's pair,

859
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,940
you don't head down them and cynicism,

860
00:38:54,970 --> 00:38:56,260
bitterness and all of that,

861
00:38:56,261 --> 00:39:00,110
but that's your right hemisphere trying
to make a new picture of reality and

862
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:04,180
generating these fantasies kind of come
up with an account that makes sense of

863
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:05,014
what happened.

864
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,670
And that's really the way that we help
to cope with radically new information.

865
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:10,720
Something like that.

866
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:12,610
Except it's even more complicated.

867
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,690
And I'm telling you all this
because I want to specify how it is,

868
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:20,290
what I want to specify,

869
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,910
why it's necessary to go to the
deepest level of analysis and to try to

870
00:39:24,911 --> 00:39:26,170
understand what's there.

871
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,690
The more mysterious something is,

872
00:39:28,990 --> 00:39:33,700
the more you have to use your imagination
in some sense to represent it because

873
00:39:33,701 --> 00:39:34,660
you don't know what to do.

874
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,350
Fancy socks and hypothesize
about you have to dream about,

875
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,773
yeah,

876
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:41,390
oh,

877
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:42,480
you'll kind of walk this office.

878
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,333
But

879
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,823
dreams

880
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,690
concentrated on what we ignore.

881
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,400
So the part of your brain
tells you what's a lot.

882
00:39:52,401 --> 00:39:54,690
Then he's on things in the normal world,

883
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,710
but that doesn't work perfectly because
what you know doesn't work perfectly.

884
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,670
And so you started recruiting errors
along the way and then your right

885
00:40:02,671 --> 00:40:04,050
hemisphere collects those areas.

886
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,170
It starts to try and figure
out what to do about them.

887
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,180
If you wake people up
under CP and the dreaming,

888
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,830
the most common emotion,

889
00:40:10,831 --> 00:40:15,660
they relate his anxiety and because at
night what you do is try to reconfigure

890
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:19,110
what you know to take into account what
you don't know and that's an anxiety

891
00:40:19,111 --> 00:40:23,640
provoking process and use notion
with regards to dream analysis.

892
00:40:23,641 --> 00:40:25,920
And that was the same story to
some degree was that you could,

893
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,910
if people were facing an attractable
mystery and they didn't know how to see.

894
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,631
So for example,

895
00:40:30,631 --> 00:40:31,890
then you come and see me,

896
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:34,500
you're not happy in your job that you
don't want to give it up because of the

897
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:38,730
security or like it's
complicated situation and you
can't see any way forward.

898
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:39,781
Then I might say,

899
00:40:39,781 --> 00:40:41,340
well do you dream?

900
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,050
And if you said yes,

901
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,860
some people dream a lot and right now
and we might take a look at dreams to see

902
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:51,840
if he could catch the new story that's
emerging underneath your knowledge about

903
00:40:51,841 --> 00:40:53,250
where it is that you might go.

904
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,300
And that can be very,

905
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:59,280
very illuminating and people differ in
the complexity and sophistication of

906
00:40:59,281 --> 00:41:00,930
their drinks and their
ability to remember the,

907
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:03,410
but we also might bucket your
fantasy so maybe you know,

908
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:07,740
you have a fantasy about what you really
liked to say to your boss and it's a

909
00:41:07,741 --> 00:41:11,310
fairly well developed from maybe or hit
embarrassed about it because it's kind

910
00:41:11,311 --> 00:41:12,144
of violence.

911
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,223
And

912
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,460
if we let you have that say,

913
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,820
well tell me about the fantasy.

914
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:19,650
Do you lay it out a fantasy?

915
00:41:19,651 --> 00:41:23,790
We can take weekend at the seeds of who
you might be calm because maybe you're

916
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:25,940
not standing up for yourself
and not feed your boss.

917
00:41:25,941 --> 00:41:27,010
It's time to retire.

918
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,250
And so you have this fantasy that you're
rooted in the direction that that lays

919
00:41:32,251 --> 00:41:33,980
out the landscape of what look

920
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:34,190
like.

921
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,670
If you find it just got up enough courage
to march in there and say exactly what

922
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:38,810
you have to say.

923
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:40,550
And so that's something you want.

924
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,240
And if you're thinking about changing
careers that we want to figure out what

925
00:41:44,241 --> 00:41:44,811
you want.

926
00:41:44,811 --> 00:41:48,050
And so you can look up what you're
fantasizing about what you want.

927
00:41:48,051 --> 00:41:50,510
And maybe you could find
some seats and what you want.

928
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:51,501
You might say,

929
00:41:51,501 --> 00:41:52,040
well,

930
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,220
you're not going to be happy in the next
job regardless of what you do unless

931
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:58,760
you become somewhat more assertive
because he'll just carry the same problem

932
00:41:58,761 --> 00:41:59,610
into your next job.

933
00:41:59,611 --> 00:42:01,570
So getting the problem is the job.

934
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:06,650
Maybe the problem is do we did knock on
what you really need to do to thrive in

935
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,320
work and you can try
to solve that problem.

936
00:42:09,321 --> 00:42:11,930
And then we started figuring out whether
that would also mean that you would

937
00:42:11,931 --> 00:42:13,160
have to shift careers.

938
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:15,940
And so that's how you can
use the analysis of say,

939
00:42:15,941 --> 00:42:20,941
fantasies and dreams to shed light on
how it is with the person might conduct

940
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,004
themselves.

941
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:22,963
Now

942
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,270
this is where it gets tricky.

943
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,290
Casey hasn't got treats.

944
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,133
You can ask him.

945
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,263
Hmm.

946
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:45,690
Alright.

947
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:47,760
So here's another way that you figure out

948
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:49,950
how it happened.

949
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:50,783
You were,

950
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:55,860
let's say your your child and
there's a lot you don't know.

951
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,860
So how do you handle that?

952
00:42:59,610 --> 00:42:59,731
Well,

953
00:42:59,731 --> 00:43:01,440
you stay in a simplified environment,

954
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,633
right?

955
00:43:02,910 --> 00:43:06,570
You don't crawl out onto the
street when you're 10 months old,

956
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:08,080
your parents aren't gonna let you do that.

957
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,790
And they keep you in the phone
and they keep you close to them.

958
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:15,230
And what you do is react though.

959
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,080
But you know,

960
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,130
which isn't very much.

961
00:43:17,490 --> 00:43:21,220
Mostly it's how quick things in your boat
with an index because that's what she,

962
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,320
that's what kids do.

963
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,160
And just smiling kids
to play a little bit.

964
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,430
But it's a fragile space of
knowledge and it's easily disrupted.

965
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,070
And when it's disrupted,

966
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:32,904
you cry.

967
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:35,070
And that's a signal up to the disruption.

968
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,140
And then your parents move in.

969
00:43:37,141 --> 00:43:38,610
If their grade are you all watching,

970
00:43:38,611 --> 00:43:43,611
they fix whatever the problems and what
you do is you watch and then you imitate

971
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:45,063
me.

972
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:45,751
So I'm like,

973
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:46,201
you know what,

974
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:46,800
the rock could you,

975
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,990
cause you're not sophisticated
enough to know what they're up to.

976
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:50,060
Heal childhood.

977
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,200
You get to pull the town with
the behavior of the parents.

978
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,890
No parents should give a full
account of her own behavior.

979
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,120
So you certainly can't
expect that from a child.

980
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:00,930
But children often will obviously grow
up to take care of their own children,

981
00:44:00,931 --> 00:44:05,931
just like grow up to take care of their
own offspring ever knowing what they're

982
00:44:06,091 --> 00:44:06,451
doing.

983
00:44:06,451 --> 00:44:07,284
Exactly.

984
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:08,480
So you learn by amputation.

985
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:14,430
And what that means is that collectively
we faced things that we didn't

986
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:17,310
understand for very,

987
00:44:17,311 --> 00:44:21,780
very long periods of time and we've
figured out how to act so that it works

988
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:22,510
well.

989
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:23,520
We don't know.

990
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,760
We don't know the rules
that underlie that.

991
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:26,230
Exactly.

992
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:27,900
We don't know exactly what that means.

993
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:29,070
We just figured it out.

994
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:32,940
So there was a way of being,

995
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:35,890
a good partner might say there's
a way to be a good mother.

996
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:41,280
Mostly you understand what that is
when you fail at it or when your child,

997
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:42,770
he accuses you of failing at it,

998
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:43,351
right?

999
00:44:43,351 --> 00:44:46,770
Because he's only in the failure that you
realize that you deviate from whatever

1000
00:44:46,771 --> 00:44:48,310
the ideal is cause you're not.

1001
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,990
Who the hell knows what
the rules are for beacon?

1002
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:51,833
Good father.

1003
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:55,320
It's very difficult to detail them
but you know when you've failed.

1004
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:55,891
Okay,

1005
00:44:55,891 --> 00:45:00,450
so you know how to be a controller and
you know that because you imitated your

1006
00:45:00,451 --> 00:45:02,730
father and he imitated his father images.

1007
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,250
His father is like way back as
far as you can possibly jolt.

1008
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,400
That's the rule.

1009
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,930
We also know that and here's,

1010
00:45:09,931 --> 00:45:11,060
here's an example of why,

1011
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:15,050
how the clock called colleague at the
University of Toronto who spends some

1012
00:45:15,051 --> 00:45:17,430
maternal behavior and racks and racks,

1013
00:45:17,431 --> 00:45:18,860
you're actually very sophisticated.

1014
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:23,350
They have somewhat of a cultural state
pass on through imitative learning.

1015
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:28,710
If you take rap cops away from their
mother and and treat them well enough so

1016
00:45:28,711 --> 00:45:29,730
that they live in,

1017
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:31,230
which is not that easy by the way,

1018
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:35,850
cause feeding them and giving them enough
water and warmth and so forth isn't

1019
00:45:35,851 --> 00:45:36,151
enough.

1020
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:37,650
You also have to attend to them.

1021
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:38,441
You have to touch them.

1022
00:45:38,441 --> 00:45:41,760
You played it the more they die anyways.

1023
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:45,450
If you take prep helps away from their
mother and then you let those routes grow

1024
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:50,090
up and have to wrap apps and then those
wrap crops grow up and have red crops,

1025
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:50,980
et cetera.

1026
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:54,510
You find that the maternal behavior
is disruptive for three generations.

1027
00:45:55,530 --> 00:46:00,090
So that shows you why you need that
imitative continuity in order to keep

1028
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:03,840
knowledge that's implicit
propagating through a culture.

1029
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,930
So once it's disruptive,

1030
00:46:06,931 --> 00:46:09,710
it's very difficult to
local once again ask.

1031
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,183
So

1032
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,620
we've learned how to be good
and bad by trial and error,

1033
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,180
very long periods of time.

1034
00:46:22,110 --> 00:46:27,070
We've learned that an imaging back from
the people that we see who are good,

1035
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:28,103
the hug,

1036
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,270
and we've learned how to embody that.

1037
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:33,660
And so we carry that on
with us in our actions.

1038
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,470
Now you actually do this in
quite a sophisticated way,

1039
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,830
even though you can't describe it exactly.

1040
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:45,750
So let's say you go to a party and if
someone that gets annoying and they're

1041
00:46:45,751 --> 00:46:48,930
annoying because they tell jokes that
aren't funny and they've been off the

1042
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:53,040
lights and conversation and they don't
pay any attention to anyone else,

1043
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,410
they're full of micro errors.

1044
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,510
That made me socially be tolerable.

1045
00:46:58,230 --> 00:46:59,430
And so what they,

1046
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,020
what they are doing is easy.

1047
00:47:01,021 --> 00:47:02,690
Anything from your implicit ideal,

1048
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,720
right?

1049
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,620
That's why they're annoying,

1050
00:47:05,250 --> 00:47:06,120
obviously,

1051
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,090
because they're not eating the
way they should be educated.

1052
00:47:09,150 --> 00:47:11,130
And you could tell that
because they're annoying.

1053
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,180
And so what that means is that you have
an ideal that you're expecting from

1054
00:47:15,181 --> 00:47:16,350
other people over time.

1055
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,140
And that isn't the case
because wherever we go,

1056
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:23,730
we meet people and we expect and hope
that they will act out the ideal.

1057
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,201
And when they don't,

1058
00:47:25,201 --> 00:47:26,034
we know.

1059
00:47:26,790 --> 00:47:29,070
But that doesn't mean you can say
what it is cause you can know,

1060
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,840
go home with your partner and say,

1061
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:31,901
I was that person.

1062
00:47:31,901 --> 00:47:32,810
So annoying.

1063
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:34,730
And You yes if I'm Chad.

1064
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,580
But it's hard to specify because you
don't move the ideal that you don't know

1065
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,990
exactly what it was to break through.

1066
00:47:40,991 --> 00:47:42,760
It's very difficult to
beat this articulate,

1067
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:44,800
but you do have any ideal in mind.

1068
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,300
Okay?

1069
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:51,300
So what that means is that we can act
out and conceptualized before we could

1070
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:58,300
describe in words what that ideal he is.

1071
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,840
Now this

1072
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:04,751
development,

1073
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:05,540
as they call it,

1074
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:10,420
the junk studied kids 30 gauge.

1075
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:15,430
And that doesn't necessarily sound very
important or just gauged it just for

1076
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:16,264
fun.

1077
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:21,690
But it's really important because the
game is actually a microcosm of the world.

1078
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,390
Just what people like cage played.

1079
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:26,710
Monopoly example.

1080
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:31,750
It's a microcosm of no
holds barred capitalism,

1081
00:48:32,140 --> 00:48:32,973
let's say.

1082
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,080
And you can learn about
your bedroom people,

1083
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:39,070
about people by playing monopoly with
them because even though it's fictional

1084
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:44,590
and the gold is just real people that
adopt the goal was if it's really that he

1085
00:48:44,711 --> 00:48:47,710
started to manifest be emotions that
would be relevant and getting a real

1086
00:48:47,711 --> 00:48:52,711
pursuit and so that you
can see what they're fun to
play with and if they're fun

1087
00:48:52,881 --> 00:48:53,900
to play with and

1088
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,230
it'll get a little high
and mighty about winning,

1089
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:57,571
he don't,

1090
00:48:57,571 --> 00:48:59,960
they [inaudible] to lock.

1091
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,840
They detach themselves from a
little bit so that it stays fun.

1092
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:05,141
Hey,

1093
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:06,330
remember that it's a game,

1094
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:08,380
like they're doing all sorts
of sophisticated things.

1095
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:12,970
If they're funding by Jessica number
that they're trying to play with your

1096
00:49:12,971 --> 00:49:13,720
testing,

1097
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,970
how well they match deep.

1098
00:49:14,970 --> 00:49:16,570
Was that ideal that you will?

1099
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:21,040
And so that's what kids are doing when
they played games with their friends to

1100
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:21,580
their,

1101
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,640
it's more complicated
because they also the way,

1102
00:49:23,641 --> 00:49:24,290
then again,

1103
00:49:24,290 --> 00:49:25,990
just basically that they're pretending.

1104
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,890
So let's say kids who frequents the
decides we're going to play hubs.

1105
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:32,620
This is a common kits and Damon,

1106
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,870
first thing they do is
have them negotiation.

1107
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:37,390
So unlikely to screen writers.

1108
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,160
They say,

1109
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:41,260
well you be the moment you'd be the dad,

1110
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:46,330
you don't need to be the cap and then
if everyone wants to play that role,

1111
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,080
but that's the first
thing the kids have hope.

1112
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,810
Kids have to want to play
voluntarily or it's not good.

1113
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,680
That's a good thing to keep in mind.

1114
00:49:53,950 --> 00:49:56,350
So putting accepts the rule
and then you might say,

1115
00:49:56,351 --> 00:50:00,040
well then they go ahead and take the
mother and the father and the cap,

1116
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,660
but they don't actually think I taped it
because like if I was imitating you sit

1117
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,020
exactly like your city,

1118
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,990
but I would move my body in
exactly the same where you are.

1119
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:10,240
But if I was caricatured review,

1120
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:11,830
let's say I got to know you a little bit,

1121
00:50:11,831 --> 00:50:15,340
then I can kind of adopt the spirit
of your voice and your mannerisms,

1122
00:50:15,341 --> 00:50:16,180
whatever they are.

1123
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:19,870
I could extract out from you a pattern
of character and it's giving me an I can

1124
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:24,270
body that pattern that's a lot more
sophisticated and just invitation and not

1125
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:27,490
for the kids are trying to do when they
played house and I'm indicating they're

1126
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,120
far down

1127
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,470
because they're not doing exactly the
same movements that the I was doing.

1128
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,770
They've watched the farther,

1129
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:38,830
either farther over multiple contexts
and they've extracted the commonalities

1130
00:50:38,931 --> 00:50:43,150
across those contexts and portrayed
back with the term before that.

1131
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,170
You can think about that as a spirit.

1132
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:47,020
It's the spirit of that man.

1133
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,650
He before non personal multiple context
and then they're acting that out there

1134
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:56,340
representing that good boy and he hit
dramatic play and so they can't say what

1135
00:50:56,341 --> 00:50:58,550
they're doing and they can't
tell you what the rules are,

1136
00:50:58,551 --> 00:51:02,690
but they can use their
own body to represent this
incredibly complex thing that

1137
00:51:02,691 --> 00:51:03,524
they don't understand.

1138
00:51:03,890 --> 00:51:05,510
And they can do the
same thing with mother,

1139
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,200
right?

1140
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,960
If you play with a goal and feed it
and do all the things for the mother

1141
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,530
doesn't,

1142
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:13,970
they can practice being a mother and so
then they learn how to embody this ideal

1143
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,370
without describing it.

1144
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:22,020
Now there's a lot of things that we know
like that and so we know how to act out

1145
00:51:22,431 --> 00:51:25,070
things that you don't understand it now.

1146
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:30,230
Eventually we figured out
what collectively over the
tens of thousands of years

1147
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:32,030
that you've been trying
to figure things out,

1148
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:37,230
how to act in a manner that makes us
essentially sig the signature of civilize

1149
00:51:37,330 --> 00:51:39,380
the neighbor's or somebody's
sick in this group,

1150
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,590
even though we don't know each
other and to all do the same thing,

1151
00:51:42,850 --> 00:51:43,550
all the dog,

1152
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:47,420
the same posture and to oligarchs
essentially the same attitude and the same

1153
00:51:47,421 --> 00:51:52,310
emotional state and to thereby being
predictable to one another and to be safe

1154
00:51:52,311 --> 00:51:53,150
with one another,

1155
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:54,410
which is what we're doing right now.

1156
00:51:54,411 --> 00:51:55,310
It's a ritual.

1157
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:57,800
Everyone understands his
a theatrical Richard,

1158
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:02,510
that everyone understands it and the fact
that everyone is doing the same thing,

1159
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,660
it means that we can all be virtually
assured that at the moment we're all

1160
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:10,160
holding the same ideal and that's why
we're not terrified because if someone all

1161
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:11,970
of a sudden stood up and branch did knife,

1162
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,480
this was not be the same place.

1163
00:52:14,750 --> 00:52:14,991
Right?

1164
00:52:14,991 --> 00:52:15,840
It was seriously,

1165
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:19,370
if you don't want the same place and you
wouldn't be using the same part of your

1166
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:20,600
brain to process it,

1167
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,960
it would switch instantly and you'd be
possessed by ancient motivational states,

1168
00:52:26,211 --> 00:52:31,211
terror and rage and and the preparation
for action that would be completely

1169
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:35,720
outside of the neurological systems that
you're using to Orient Yourself at this

1170
00:52:35,721 --> 00:52:36,140
movement.

1171
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,320
And people do not have to
like it when that happens.

1172
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,350
We don't like even if
someone you don't like,

1173
00:52:42,351 --> 00:52:46,610
that's like if you're walking down the
street and you see someone who's doing

1174
00:52:46,611 --> 00:52:48,950
something that isn't normal,

1175
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:51,920
like maybe they're monitoring
to consultant twitching
a little bit or something

1176
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:53,930
like that and they're a little disheveled.

1177
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,810
You'll do what almost everyone does,

1178
00:52:56,870 --> 00:53:00,320
which is we'll give them a wide berth
and you'll keep on walking and you

1179
00:53:00,321 --> 00:53:05,321
probably do what you can not to make eye
contact because that's an invitation.

1180
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:06,763
So you're,

1181
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:07,111
you're,

1182
00:53:07,111 --> 00:53:08,420
you walked down the street and you think,

1183
00:53:08,421 --> 00:53:13,020
oh there's some unexplored territory
like circumvented that and maybe

1184
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:13,960
particularly one.

1185
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:14,340
Right?

1186
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:19,040
So you do everything you
can as a consequence of your
actions to stop yourself

1187
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:23,210
from being exposed to anything that
disrupts the stability of the theory that

1188
00:53:23,211 --> 00:53:25,010
you're using or hit yourself in the world.

1189
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:29,160
That's why people hold onto their
theories because underneath that it's like

1190
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:29,910
terror,

1191
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,160
rage and you don't want that coming up.

1192
00:53:32,161 --> 00:53:34,500
And so we don't take it kindly.

1193
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:37,590
People come along and mess with our,

1194
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:39,240
the axioms of our theories.

1195
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,950
We seriously don't like that.

1196
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:44,730
And that's partly why people are so
motivated to protect their belief systems,

1197
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:45,210
right?

1198
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:47,380
It's not only then we construe the world,

1199
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:48,420
our belief systems,

1200
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,490
we organize our social behavior,

1201
00:53:50,491 --> 00:53:51,540
we thought and belief systems.

1202
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:53,520
And so if you mess with
the police systems,

1203
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:57,900
you mess with the structure that makes
everyone predictable of everyone else.

1204
00:53:58,180 --> 00:53:59,960
And that is not what I,

1205
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,430
there's nothing but hell
would that when that path,

1206
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:03,420
that's for sure.

1207
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:04,261
All right,

1208
00:54:04,261 --> 00:54:06,090
so now

1209
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:12,770
we've learned how to act out this pattern
that makes us acceptable and desirable

1210
00:54:13,051 --> 00:54:17,340
project and we're constantly
reminding each other how do that,

1211
00:54:17,341 --> 00:54:19,020
because like if you go to a party,

1212
00:54:19,770 --> 00:54:20,940
you're going to want people,

1213
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:22,590
well who knows what you've been walked by.

1214
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:24,540
If you're the typical person,

1215
00:54:24,541 --> 00:54:25,021
a typical,

1216
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:26,760
reasonably well socialized person,

1217
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,210
you're going to want people to like,

1218
00:54:28,410 --> 00:54:29,620
or that they disliked,

1219
00:54:29,621 --> 00:54:30,150
he would.

1220
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:32,850
You're going to want them to pay some
attention to you and you're going to want

1221
00:54:32,851 --> 00:54:35,950
to engage people in
interesting conversation.

1222
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:39,840
Maybe you're going to want people to
appreciate you and you know if you want to

1223
00:54:39,841 --> 00:54:44,310
have a good time to have a good time
at the party needs to act a certain way

1224
00:54:44,311 --> 00:54:47,730
that you're listening to certain separate
responses from other people and if you

1225
00:54:47,731 --> 00:54:50,070
fail it that they will tell you,

1226
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:51,630
they'll ignore you.

1227
00:54:52,050 --> 00:54:53,490
They won't laugh at your jokes,

1228
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:53,971
you know,

1229
00:54:53,971 --> 00:54:55,350
they'll move away from you.

1230
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:55,550
There's,

1231
00:54:55,550 --> 00:54:57,090
there's all sorts of reasons.

1232
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,550
There's all sorts of things
they will do to broadcast.

1233
00:54:59,551 --> 00:55:00,300
At you,

1234
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,920
your deviation from the ideal.

1235
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,050
And that can be very painful,

1236
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:04,560
right?

1237
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:08,400
Especially if you're very deviant from
the ideal because it opens up this

1238
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:11,730
realization that you just don't know
what the hell are you doing at all.

1239
00:55:11,790 --> 00:55:15,440
And that either means that other people
are contemptible and horrible at that

1240
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:19,050
something should be done about that or
that there's something seriously wrong

1241
00:55:19,051 --> 00:55:20,520
with you that needs to be rectified.

1242
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:22,920
And neither of those
options are very pleasant.

1243
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:26,130
So we carry within us,

1244
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,280
let's say place that ideal
that we carry within us,

1245
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:32,090
a counter ideal as well
be the opposite of that.

1246
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:36,690
That's an introduction in some sense to
the landscape of good and evil because

1247
00:55:36,691 --> 00:55:41,691
the ultimate ideal is whatever's good
and the ultimate counter whatevers evil.

1248
00:55:42,570 --> 00:55:47,570
So that's the space within which we map
our behaviors and we can't help but map

1249
00:55:48,670 --> 00:55:50,460
help that spacing cause it's,

1250
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:54,930
it constitutes the most extreme version
of the structure that we use to evaluate

1251
00:55:54,990 --> 00:55:56,160
everything everyone else does.

1252
00:55:56,161 --> 00:55:57,120
And every four week.

1253
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:01,230
We also know that that's the case
because when you go to a movie,

1254
00:56:01,290 --> 00:56:02,670
even though you don't know that,

1255
00:56:02,671 --> 00:56:04,170
you know it's the case,

1256
00:56:04,350 --> 00:56:05,430
you go to a movie,

1257
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:08,250
let's say it's an action
or it doesn't matter,

1258
00:56:08,251 --> 00:56:08,780
it could be a,

1259
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,000
so maybe those are the two
basic categories of votes.

1260
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,460
Actually he has a hero.

1261
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:18,990
The hero is either good or partially do
it like a complex here would be good,

1262
00:56:18,991 --> 00:56:21,330
but even kind of a flawed
and interesting way.

1263
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:26,350
And then of course in an action movie
there's the evil bad guy as well,

1264
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,110
but hopefully he's going to benefit
good interview because otherwise it's a

1265
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:31,990
caricatured always into movies.

1266
00:56:31,990 --> 00:56:36,430
You have that the hero and the
villain and the romance welded.

1267
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:39,880
You have the person who's the love
interest in all those who've failed to

1268
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:40,714
measure up.

1269
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:41,760
And so it's just saying,

1270
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:42,593
hey,

1271
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,550
it's just played out for
different multiplication reasons.

1272
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,050
So,

1273
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,590
and you know it's,

1274
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:51,370
it's difficult to understand it
and you go to see your movie,

1275
00:56:51,371 --> 00:56:52,750
which is fiction

1276
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,570
isn't real.

1277
00:56:56,290 --> 00:57:00,740
Then it's also more regal than real
because otherwise you either watch,

1278
00:57:00,770 --> 00:57:05,770
you don't want the movie director to
show you how many times to protagonists

1279
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,760
links before they get
out a bed in the morning.

1280
00:57:10,210 --> 00:57:15,210
It's not interesting when you want them
to do is to take the full panoply of the

1281
00:57:16,271 --> 00:57:21,271
heroes behavior and only extract from
those instances that are of particular

1282
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:26,250
interest in relationship to the portrayal
of that ideal or the counter idea.

1283
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:28,630
Do you want to see why the bad guys bad?

1284
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:30,730
And you want to see why
they good guys good.

1285
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,870
And that's more real than reality because
it's abstract that from reality it's

1286
00:57:34,871 --> 00:57:36,040
more real than reality.

1287
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:39,250
Like numbers are more real than the
things they they're derived from.

1288
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:40,720
It's a form of abstraction,

1289
00:57:41,380 --> 00:57:41,591
right?

1290
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:42,101
And it doesn't,

1291
00:57:42,101 --> 00:57:46,090
it makes perfect sense that when you
want to extract that from fictional

1292
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:47,010
representations,

1293
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:50,290
just referenced representations
of what's good and what's evil.

1294
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:51,610
So that in principle,

1295
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,230
assuming that this is what you want,

1296
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:57,910
you could do a better job of embodying
what's good because then everything would

1297
00:57:57,911 --> 00:57:59,380
go well for you in the war room,

1298
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:00,970
assuming that that's what you want.

1299
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,840
So there's probably nothing more
important than you could possibly do.

1300
00:58:04,930 --> 00:58:07,450
The know do that and
that's how you treat it.

1301
00:58:07,451 --> 00:58:09,700
Like it's more important than
anything else you can do.

1302
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:11,290
Because if you think about it,

1303
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:16,060
you will go to a movie and you'll line
up and you hae to be exposed to that kind

1304
00:58:16,061 --> 00:58:16,894
of information.

1305
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:18,071
And that's an,

1306
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:20,380
that's an indication of
exactly how vital it is,

1307
00:58:20,381 --> 00:58:20,800
right?

1308
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,330
You actually find most of you met.

1309
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,540
And if it isn't movies,

1310
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:24,374
well then it's,

1311
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,490
it's fiction or books of stories
that other people tell you.

1312
00:58:27,491 --> 00:58:27,721
Listen,

1313
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:29,590
you have no interest whatsoever in people.

1314
00:58:29,591 --> 00:58:30,910
And that's very rare.

1315
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,440
If even if that's the case,

1316
00:58:32,441 --> 00:58:32,970
you'll find it.

1317
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:36,430
Science fiction or something else like
that where the mythology creeps into the

1318
00:58:36,431 --> 00:58:37,264
technology,

1319
00:58:37,330 --> 00:58:38,260
it doesn't really matter.

1320
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:40,210
It's going to come at you
in one way or another.

1321
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:43,690
And the fact that we will pay
to expose yourself to that.

1322
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:46,660
And then also that when
you go into those venues,

1323
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:51,000
be entranced by it to spite yourself
despite the fact that you know it isn't

1324
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:51,873
real,

1325
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:55,600
it's an indication of exactly how
important that information is.

1326
00:58:55,601 --> 00:58:56,434
Key.

1327
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,551
So you could say,

1328
00:58:57,551 --> 00:58:58,384
well there's,

1329
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,740
there's truth in the extraction of
protections and then the question,

1330
00:59:02,741 --> 00:59:03,574
right,

1331
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:08,530
well imagine that you have real life,

1332
00:59:09,670 --> 00:59:13,330
have never imagined that you have
first order obstruction fiction,

1333
00:59:13,331 --> 00:59:14,080
which are,

1334
00:59:14,080 --> 00:59:14,320
look,

1335
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,620
if someone's telling you the
story about what they did last,

1336
00:59:16,630 --> 00:59:20,800
I mean some people are just going to bore
you too because they're going to tell

1337
00:59:20,801 --> 00:59:22,050
you relevant details.

1338
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,860
It's like why is it relevant?

1339
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,190
What's the difference
between what's relevant,

1340
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:29,030
what is relevant makes you interested,

1341
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,213
but why?

1342
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:32,060
Who knows?

1343
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,010
You just know when that happens,

1344
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:35,900
you know that the person is
good at telling the story.

1345
00:59:35,901 --> 00:59:39,650
So what they're essentially
doing is they're laying
down your experience but not

1346
00:59:39,651 --> 00:59:40,484
all of it.

1347
00:59:41,090 --> 00:59:42,560
They're selective about,

1348
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:44,570
and that's what makes a born storyteller.

1349
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:48,890
They do first order abstraction again
first order fictionalization in some sense

1350
00:59:48,891 --> 00:59:49,540
they say,

1351
00:59:49,540 --> 00:59:52,730
here's a bunch of interesting things
that have come in last week and those

1352
00:59:52,731 --> 00:59:56,780
interesting things have to have some
bearing on your life in some way or you're

1353
00:59:56,781 --> 00:59:58,050
not going to find the interesting,

1354
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:58,903
have a,

1355
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:01,280
you have to know to extract
something of value on there.

1356
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:02,660
Somebody has got a point.

1357
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:03,851
Point is wait,

1358
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:04,800
directs you to some,

1359
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,910
so that's what makes you interesting
and then you might think,

1360
01:00:07,911 --> 01:00:09,590
well that's just the born storyteller,

1361
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,060
but then you had people
who are brilliant at it,

1362
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,690
say writing awful circle.

1363
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:14,750
We're producing movies,

1364
01:00:14,751 --> 01:00:18,650
street place and they're way better
than a normal person that extracting out

1365
01:00:18,651 --> 01:00:19,401
what's important,

1366
01:00:19,401 --> 01:00:23,870
like they're geniuses at it and so they
don't just extract out from their life

1367
01:00:23,871 --> 01:00:24,651
what's relevant.

1368
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:25,160
Interesting.

1369
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,970
They look at a whole bunch of people and
then how to distill that into a single

1370
01:00:28,971 --> 01:00:32,720
characters and then they extract out
from them what's relevant and interesting

1371
01:00:32,721 --> 01:00:37,721
and they lay out for trailer good
versus evil and transformation.

1372
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:39,740
It's transfixing.

1373
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:46,610
That's what we've been doing with her
religious stories since the beginning of

1374
01:00:46,611 --> 01:00:47,444
time.

1375
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:50,750
We'd be watching how we behave.

1376
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:56,050
We've been extracting out the patterns
of that application and we'd be presented

1377
01:00:56,170 --> 01:01:01,070
in dramatic form and those stories
are at the bottom of our cognitive

1378
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:01,904
architecture.

1379
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,090
That's what are,

1380
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:04,300
it's,

1381
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:09,020
it's within that structure that our
worldviews rests and that is roughly

1382
01:01:09,021 --> 01:01:09,621
speaking.

1383
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:14,621
It's the drama of good versus evil on
the landscape of chaos versus order.

1384
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:18,710
Order be that place that you're
familiar with and comfortable with.

1385
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:19,550
The home,

1386
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:20,121
the hearth,

1387
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:20,661
the family,

1388
01:01:20,661 --> 01:01:21,494
the country,

1389
01:01:21,530 --> 01:01:22,340
the state,

1390
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:23,900
the well organized community,

1391
01:01:23,960 --> 01:01:25,490
the gated community,

1392
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,780
the walled city,

1393
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,620
the places that people have always lived.

1394
01:01:28,790 --> 01:01:30,740
And then what's the upside of that?

1395
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,120
And that's our reality.

1396
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,580
That's the landscape within math.

1397
01:01:34,581 --> 01:01:38,690
There's a drama group versus succeed
and that's our fundamental religious

1398
01:01:38,691 --> 01:01:40,100
conception of the world.

1399
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,001
And you might take,

1400
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:42,950
well you don't believe in that,

1401
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:44,300
but that's not true.

1402
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,060
You do believe in that because
if you didn't believe in it,

1403
01:01:47,061 --> 01:01:48,290
you wouldn't be human.

1404
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:51,740
To be human is to live in that world.

1405
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:52,910
Now what that means,

1406
01:01:52,911 --> 01:01:55,030
metaphysically is very difficult to say.

1407
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:55,821
It has played out.

1408
01:01:55,821 --> 01:01:56,810
Support is reality.

1409
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,800
Actually.

1410
01:01:57,860 --> 01:02:00,180
Chaos versus order with address,

1411
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,380
amount of good and evil
being played down in nap.

1412
01:02:02,630 --> 01:02:04,460
And that's a very difficult
question to answer,

1413
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:09,350
but one thing I can tell you is that
you act like it is and your brain is

1414
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,150
organized like idiots.

1415
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:15,050
And so that's pretty powerful evidence
that there's something going on that's

1416
01:02:15,051 --> 01:02:18,560
vaguely related to reality
and not just to imagination.

1417
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,653
Okay.

1418
01:02:27,130 --> 01:02:31,510
I'm going to tell you if you're a
sequence of very old stories and then I'm

1419
01:02:31,511 --> 01:02:36,160
going to tell you about why
don't related to mass murderers,

1420
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,900
because I already said that.

1421
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:39,850
If you want to answer that
most difficult question,

1422
01:02:39,851 --> 01:02:44,560
you have to go to the deepest possible
level and the deepest possible level

1423
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,000
isn't what you know.

1424
01:02:46,001 --> 01:02:51,001
You know it's what you act out and maybe
it's what you start to represent it,

1425
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:53,650
but you don't know what it is yet.

1426
01:02:53,651 --> 01:02:54,940
It's too profound.

1427
01:02:54,941 --> 01:02:58,420
Needs to be visible in
some sense to be partner,

1428
01:02:58,450 --> 01:02:59,780
fully articulate knowledge.

1429
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:01,060
One of the things that,

1430
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:01,281
see,

1431
01:03:01,281 --> 01:03:03,880
one of the things that
cardio was attempted to do,

1432
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:05,513
see,

1433
01:03:06,630 --> 01:03:07,463
I think he was,

1434
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:10,380
I don't know if he was the greatest
thinker of the 20th century,

1435
01:03:10,381 --> 01:03:11,670
but he certainly,

1436
01:03:12,210 --> 01:03:17,210
he was certainly up there and I'll tell
you what he was up when he took Freud's

1437
01:03:18,121 --> 01:03:23,121
idea that you could look at
fantasy and extract out new.

1438
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:25,200
Nolan took that idea seriously.

1439
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:25,861
And then he thought,

1440
01:03:25,861 --> 01:03:26,610
well,

1441
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:30,090
dreams that people have in the fantasies
they have are like the mythologies that

1442
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:31,530
they use in their culture.

1443
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:33,690
So the dream is to the individual,

1444
01:03:33,691 --> 01:03:38,520
like the myth is to the culture and you
believe that we existed within Stuart's.

1445
01:03:38,521 --> 01:03:39,031
If we've been,

1446
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:39,864
I'd describe it.

1447
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,700
And I think the evidence
for that by the way,

1448
01:03:41,701 --> 01:03:43,370
is incontrovertibly Kenny,

1449
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:48,410
serious psychologist who knows anything
about how the brain functions in any

1450
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,740
deep sense is destiny.

1451
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:57,300
Admit that the manner in
which we construct the world
looks like a narrative.

1452
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,180
Now had not everyone who raised me,

1453
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,710
the psychologist that I've come across.

1454
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:06,210
So I think are the deepest of thinkers
have have drawn that conclusion.

1455
01:04:06,211 --> 01:04:08,100
And why did disparate fields,

1456
01:04:08,270 --> 01:04:08,550
right?

1457
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:12,020
Ranging from artificial intelligence
to the analysis of dreams.

1458
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:13,910
It's something that's emerged cross this.

1459
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,710
So here's where it was
up to the first page.

1460
01:04:26,890 --> 01:04:27,291
Pause it.

1461
01:04:27,291 --> 01:04:29,130
That was what I just told you about.

1462
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:32,880
It's an extension of Freud's
vision of treatments.

1463
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:36,680
The second idea was that park,

1464
01:04:36,850 --> 01:04:38,350
the way they think about the world,

1465
01:04:38,351 --> 01:04:39,790
is it banding stories?

1466
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:48,250
Third idea was that these stories were
deeply reflective of who we are and I'm

1467
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,030
only culturally,

1468
01:04:50,031 --> 01:04:53,960
but in the deepest
possible biological sense.

1469
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:59,320
It wasn't merely armature socio-cultural
structure and I also think the evidence

1470
01:04:59,841 --> 01:05:02,840
for that is overwhelming
and crystal court.

1471
01:05:03,260 --> 01:05:04,160
First of all,

1472
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:09,910
our fundamental biology is very much
like that of the fundamental biology of

1473
01:05:10,250 --> 01:05:10,890
animals,

1474
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:11,361
mammals,

1475
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:12,194
social mammals,

1476
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,180
the drugs that work on us,

1477
01:05:15,110 --> 01:05:18,220
the site of the drugs that
work psychologically a to
have very similar effects

1478
01:05:18,221 --> 01:05:19,990
on animals like rats for example.

1479
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:24,070
We share biological history with that

1480
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:31,990
and to think about us as some divorced
from our biological fundamental is

1481
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:33,853
illusory.

1482
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:35,113
You know that,

1483
01:05:35,630 --> 01:05:38,720
you know that might what you don't have
to be talking about when you talk to

1484
01:05:38,721 --> 01:05:38,991
someone,

1485
01:05:38,991 --> 01:05:41,120
you don't have to talk
about what anger is.

1486
01:05:41,420 --> 01:05:43,030
You don't have to talk about what fear is.

1487
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:46,010
You don't have to talk about with jealousy
is you don't have to talk about what

1488
01:05:46,011 --> 01:05:46,810
Hungary's.

1489
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:48,770
You might describe your particular hunger,

1490
01:05:48,771 --> 01:05:52,340
but you don't have to make a
case for the existence of hunger,

1491
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:53,000
right?

1492
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:57,080
There's all these fundamental human
experiences that are part and parcel of

1493
01:05:57,081 --> 01:05:57,891
being embodied.

1494
01:05:57,891 --> 01:06:01,400
In the manner that one boy
that are beyond discussion,

1495
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:04,560
it's so self evident like
pain is one you don't,

1496
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:09,760
you don't have to convince someone
else of the existence of pain or the

1497
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:10,551
suffering.

1498
01:06:10,551 --> 01:06:14,690
I think this particularly alcohol
in that regard and so we have those

1499
01:06:14,691 --> 01:06:17,750
fundamental ways of orienting ourselves
to the world that are deeply rooted

1500
01:06:17,751 --> 01:06:21,410
biologically make manifest themselves
in our stories and that makes up part of

1501
01:06:21,411 --> 01:06:24,710
our nature and we have to figure out
how to cope with those fundamental

1502
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:29,120
realities of life and the way we do that
just by learning to act in particular

1503
01:06:29,121 --> 01:06:31,060
ways in the world are there.

1504
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,240
You can strange ways,

1505
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,500
which I'll just go sit at the moment.

1506
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:03,060
I just made the case that we live in a
metaphysical store and then in fact the

1507
01:07:04,481 --> 01:07:08,860
kind of reality now what seems to have
happened to us that over the last 500

1508
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:10,270
years or something like that,

1509
01:07:10,450 --> 01:07:13,570
we invented a new way
of looking at the world.

1510
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:18,620
That's a materialistic view site and
that is exactly the view of story.

1511
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:20,650
It's different than that.

1512
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:26,250
It's a new technology and the problem
seems to be that the emergence of that

1513
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,640
which has made us wealthy and to
take the Lord's will be powerful,

1514
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,400
doesn't seem to fundamental way
meditative subarc basic story.

1515
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:40,640
Neat.

1516
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:45,640
You have this idea in the league 19
hundreds and hundreds that the conflict

1517
01:07:47,951 --> 01:07:52,390
between the scientific world view and
the religious worldview had decimated.

1518
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:53,320
They just will do it.

1519
01:07:55,150 --> 01:07:59,300
Can you describe that as the definite
goal and he believed that because of that

1520
01:07:59,301 --> 01:07:59,751
had happened,

1521
01:07:59,751 --> 01:08:03,680
we had lost our moorings for ethical
mornings and that our society is going to

1522
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:04,191
lost lake.

1523
01:08:04,191 --> 01:08:07,220
Very bad men between nihilism
and totalitarianism as a console.

1524
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:08,930
Okay,

1525
01:08:08,930 --> 01:08:09,270
neat.

1526
01:08:09,270 --> 01:08:13,650
You died quite young believe that in
order to recover from that and find our

1527
01:08:13,651 --> 01:08:14,484
bearings again,

1528
01:08:14,670 --> 01:08:19,250
that we going to have to replace
the gods that we once believed in.

1529
01:08:19,251 --> 01:08:19,671
Let's say,

1530
01:08:19,671 --> 01:08:23,450
are you caught up and wants to plead it
with some notion of our own divinity?

1531
01:08:23,990 --> 01:08:26,630
Take responsibility for
creating our own doubters?

1532
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:28,700
That was his idea of the superman.

1533
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:31,890
The Overman Yeoman was very interested in.

1534
01:08:31,891 --> 01:08:36,170
He just stopped coming because he knew
that we lived inside stories and the

1535
01:08:36,171 --> 01:08:40,340
stories had certain actions of value
and then our faith and our fundamental

1536
01:08:40,341 --> 01:08:41,480
story had been shaken,

1537
01:08:41,481 --> 01:08:43,010
not least by our scientific,

1538
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,690
the rising of the scientific knowledge,

1539
01:08:45,230 --> 01:08:49,040
and he was interested in trying to figure
out how people might find themselves

1540
01:08:49,041 --> 01:08:51,740
reoriented so they
didn't turn to nihilism,

1541
01:08:51,741 --> 01:08:52,161
let's say,

1542
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:54,520
or two to tell interi utopian world news,

1543
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:56,930
but put themselves back in the story.

1544
01:08:57,200 --> 01:09:02,200
But he didn't buy the niches prognosis
for cure because yoga was influenced by

1545
01:09:03,981 --> 01:09:06,770
Freud and Freud and pointed out that

1546
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:10,430
people didn't create their own values.

1547
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,830
You can't do that because you have nature
and the nature manifests itself within

1548
01:09:15,831 --> 01:09:18,770
you regardless of your choice.

1549
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:24,170
There's things that you can't get
yourself to do and you know that,

1550
01:09:24,501 --> 01:09:24,711
right?

1551
01:09:24,711 --> 01:09:26,960
Because there's a matter of
creating your own values.

1552
01:09:26,961 --> 01:09:27,471
You just think,

1553
01:09:27,471 --> 01:09:27,591
well,

1554
01:09:27,591 --> 01:09:30,800
you would wake up one morning and you
could just tell yourself what to do.

1555
01:09:30,830 --> 01:09:31,700
Like go to the gym two,

1556
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:33,950
three times a week so that
you know you're in good shape,

1557
01:09:34,140 --> 01:09:36,980
stopped eating junk or
quit drinking and bang,

1558
01:09:36,981 --> 01:09:39,770
you just kill it because you've
got control over yourself.

1559
01:09:39,771 --> 01:09:44,771
And well obviously that's just not the
case and that's because there are all

1560
01:09:44,871 --> 01:09:48,530
sorts of things operating inside of you
that have their own autonomy and their

1561
01:09:48,531 --> 01:09:51,710
own nature that you've Lenny
will have to contend with.

1562
01:09:51,980 --> 01:09:55,310
And so that's why you went
back inside the human psyche,

1563
01:09:55,311 --> 01:09:56,300
so to speak,

1564
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:00,590
to look at the fantasies that
we spontaneously generated
as a Greek myths of the

1565
01:10:00,591 --> 01:10:01,160
world,

1566
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,030
to see if he could find out
what the pattern constituted.

1567
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:06,693
Alright,

1568
01:10:07,370 --> 01:10:09,060
now I'm going to tell
you this little story.

1569
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:12,470
So this is the idea is
that this is partly,

1570
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:17,650
these stories are partly derived from
thousands or even Ken out tens of

1571
01:10:18,590 --> 01:10:23,570
thousands of years of watching how people
act to successfully and unsuccessfully

1572
01:10:23,571 --> 01:10:26,140
in the world and extracting overpass.

1573
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:27,943
So you know,

1574
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:30,140
and has the patterns get extracted,

1575
01:10:30,141 --> 01:10:32,270
they get more abstract and they get,

1576
01:10:32,570 --> 01:10:36,080
I think it less real in some sense
that they get more broadly applicable.

1577
01:10:36,081 --> 01:10:38,420
So let me tell you first story.

1578
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,550
So this is from the opening chapter,

1579
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:41,780
opening parts of Genesis.

1580
01:10:41,790 --> 01:10:43,310
So there's an idea in genesis.

1581
01:10:43,940 --> 01:10:48,680
This is roughly how the idea is laid out
and it's an idea that's expressed it.

1582
01:10:48,710 --> 01:10:50,720
It tells you all over the
world in different forms.

1583
01:10:50,890 --> 01:10:54,950
And so the first time he hit me is
that there's sorts of domains or fee.

1584
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:59,870
There's potential chaos and
there's order having a more,

1585
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:00,381
okay,

1586
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:01,310
now that's,

1587
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:02,180
that's the,

1588
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:04,040
that's the structure of reality.

1589
01:11:04,190 --> 01:11:05,990
It's like the Dow was given Yay.

1590
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:10,760
It's the same thing that you're
hemispheres are mapping order and chaos.

1591
01:11:10,761 --> 01:11:12,290
And that's what the world's made of.

1592
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:13,270
Okay.

1593
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:17,490
There's a third founder and the third
factor is the thing he mediated between

1594
01:11:17,491 --> 01:11:18,324
those two.

1595
01:11:18,510 --> 01:11:19,470
And that would be,

1596
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:24,540
that's what people mean when they talk
about consciousness is that seems to be

1597
01:11:24,691 --> 01:11:25,800
what consciousness does.

1598
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:28,290
Consciousness establishes order,

1599
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:29,124
your conscious,

1600
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:30,210
you make decisions,

1601
01:11:30,270 --> 01:11:31,200
you make it a world.

1602
01:11:32,190 --> 01:11:34,340
But while you're being
conscious and attempted,

1603
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,390
you're attending to what you don't
yet understand and haven't her.

1604
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:42,030
And so you're faced with some known
and potential and you transform that

1605
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:47,120
effortfully and carefully is what you
understand what you couldn't have that.

1606
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:48,750
So that's what your consciousness does.

1607
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:49,830
And the Genesis,

1608
01:11:49,831 --> 01:11:50,870
you see that portrayed,

1609
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:54,570
you see that portrayed as something
that's defined as a divine spirit.

1610
01:11:54,930 --> 01:11:57,920
So that's basically Jajuan yellows,

1611
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:58,620
y'all was,

1612
01:11:58,620 --> 01:11:59,371
what would you call it,

1613
01:11:59,371 --> 01:12:00,660
the process by which you all,

1614
01:12:00,661 --> 01:12:03,150
what generates the world
has been terminated.

1615
01:12:03,180 --> 01:12:07,680
This is the Christianization of that
story is the term the logos and the logos

1616
01:12:07,681 --> 01:12:09,720
is the capacity for attentive,

1617
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:10,770
communicative,

1618
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,570
truthful speech.

1619
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:15,660
And so there's a deep idea at
the beginning of genesis step,

1620
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:22,670
whatever divine consciousness is that
which uses trinkled communicated speech to

1621
01:12:23,250 --> 01:12:28,240
encounter the chaos of the unknown
and to transform it to happen board.

1622
01:12:28,870 --> 01:12:32,760
And so that's a technical description
of the structure of reality.

1623
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:35,220
And it's an ethical injunction as well.

1624
01:12:35,221 --> 01:12:38,970
Because what happens in the will in
chapters of genesis is that God uses the

1625
01:12:38,971 --> 01:12:42,390
logos to create the world
out of that preexisted chaos.

1626
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:43,500
And He,

1627
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,600
and when he does that in stages,

1628
01:12:45,780 --> 01:12:47,670
he pronounces it good.

1629
01:12:48,360 --> 01:12:50,440
And so there's an idea there are deep it.

1630
01:12:51,940 --> 01:12:52,510
It's true.

1631
01:12:52,510 --> 01:12:56,690
You need idea because one of the
things you might ask yourself,

1632
01:12:57,400 --> 01:13:01,230
and this is one of the things that the
mass murderers asking themselves all the

1633
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:02,064
time,

1634
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:07,400
is being justifiable or is it something
against which you should strive and to

1635
01:13:09,101 --> 01:13:09,934
destroy?

1636
01:13:10,710 --> 01:13:13,740
And that's a very good
question because life is very,

1637
01:13:13,741 --> 01:13:16,920
very difficult and it's full of suffering
and it's full of betrayal and it's

1638
01:13:16,921 --> 01:13:21,780
full of malevolence and it's
not an unreasonable proposition.

1639
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:26,580
He question whether it would be better
if you're not thinking at all sisters and

1640
01:13:26,581 --> 01:13:30,630
the people who take the steps to doing
the terrible things that they ended up

1641
01:13:30,631 --> 01:13:31,200
doing.

1642
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:33,150
Answer that question in the affirmative,

1643
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:36,480
they believe that life
itself is so unbearable.

1644
01:13:36,481 --> 01:13:39,870
It was fucking mental structure
that normally should not exist,

1645
01:13:39,871 --> 01:13:44,400
but at the right response to it is to
take revenge against the fact that its

1646
01:13:44,401 --> 01:13:45,450
existence.

1647
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:50,700
And that's part of the answer to
how you get to where you have to go.

1648
01:13:50,730 --> 01:13:54,000
If you're going to rent a van and
drive it for camp blocks on a city,

1649
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:55,350
on city sidewalks,

1650
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:56,870
it's a deep,

1651
01:13:56,871 --> 01:13:58,860
deep problem and it's justifiable.

1652
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:02,280
But the hypothesis it's
laid out in genesis,

1653
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:03,960
which is an amazing hypothesis,

1654
01:14:04,110 --> 01:14:09,110
is that despite the fragility of the
world and the vulnerability of the world

1655
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,380
and it's a proclivity,

1656
01:14:10,381 --> 01:14:11,890
let's say towards malevolence,

1657
01:14:12,460 --> 01:14:16,630
if you encountered with consciousness
encounters with the potential that the

1658
01:14:16,631 --> 01:14:20,140
world is extracted from
Eddie does that truthfully,

1659
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:25,320
then what is created as a consequence
is good and I would say that's the host.

1660
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,350
That's the most fundamental act of
faith and I think that's the fundamental

1661
01:14:29,351 --> 01:14:31,030
ethical question that lies,

1662
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:35,410
that underlies the entire Corpus of the
stories of what which our culture and

1663
01:14:35,411 --> 01:14:38,590
all phones predicate question is,

1664
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:43,990
are you really to act out the proposition
that he is good if you abide by the

1665
01:14:43,991 --> 01:14:48,160
truth and what's interesting is
that it's an existential question,

1666
01:14:48,161 --> 01:14:48,851
Nate.

1667
01:14:48,851 --> 01:14:53,020
It's not a question that you can that can
be answered by fact because no one can

1668
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,180
prove it to you because they can't,

1669
01:14:55,660 --> 01:14:58,900
they can't tell you what your life is
going to be like if you do that because

1670
01:14:58,901 --> 01:14:59,200
you could.

1671
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,940
You're the only person that can find out.

1672
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,960
And the only way you can find out
essentially by risking everything you can

1673
01:15:04,961 --> 01:15:05,351
decide,

1674
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:05,471
well,

1675
01:15:05,471 --> 01:15:08,590
I'm going to separate proposition.

1676
01:15:08,591 --> 01:15:13,090
That truthful being is that being that
producers what's good and then I'm going

1677
01:15:13,091 --> 01:15:13,870
to abide by that,

1678
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:17,890
but then strange things will happen to
you because it isn't necessarily the case

1679
01:15:17,891 --> 01:15:21,280
that if you attempt to
abide by your own truth,

1680
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:26,440
that everything that happens to every
second is going to be demonstrative proof

1681
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:27,940
that that's the right pathway.

1682
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:31,510
You'd beat yourself in all sorts of
trouble if you knew that you know that

1683
01:15:31,511 --> 01:15:34,930
perfectly well because
there's uncomfortable
conversations that you should

1684
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:38,770
probably have a few people and if you
have those uncomfortable conversations,

1685
01:15:38,771 --> 01:15:39,580
it's not like there's big,

1686
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:41,920
it's just going to be
roses and sunshine rather.

1687
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:42,360
You're happy.

1688
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:43,193
The discussion,

1689
01:15:43,330 --> 01:15:44,350
quite the contrary.

1690
01:15:44,830 --> 01:15:47,290
The truth is a very disruptive force,

1691
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:50,410
especially people that are
living inside an illusion.

1692
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:52,380
And so it is is,

1693
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:53,231
it's a statement.

1694
01:15:53,231 --> 01:15:56,320
It's an if it's a metaphysical
statement of faith.

1695
01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:59,320
Now this story for aggressive,

1696
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,840
so godleys of the world,

1697
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:05,620
but it's not the material world is the
world that I just described as the world

1698
01:16:05,621 --> 01:16:07,540
of chaos and order and good and evil

1699
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:15,320
and the historic,

1700
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:18,640
just two creation stories in genesis
and they actually come from slightly

1701
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:21,700
different conditions that people who
put the books together and try to,

1702
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,780
they were probably from different
tribes and the tribes came together.

1703
01:16:25,780 --> 01:16:28,720
They had to integrate the stories because
otherwise the tribes would fight and

1704
01:16:28,740 --> 01:16:32,530
the Bible is actually a consequence of
the integration of tribal stories across

1705
01:16:32,531 --> 01:16:35,050
thousands of years and they're
not integrated perfectly,

1706
01:16:35,051 --> 01:16:38,230
which is why there are conceptual
contradictions in the Bible.

1707
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:38,591
It doesn't,

1708
01:16:38,591 --> 01:16:41,890
it doesn't matter because the pattern,

1709
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:46,540
the pattern Rene's constantly across
the conceptual error daughters,

1710
01:16:47,530 --> 01:16:49,210
the second creation story,

1711
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:52,330
it's the story of how he is
actually older than the first one,

1712
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:56,710
but it was placed by whoever edited the
Bible second because that was a way of

1713
01:16:56,711 --> 01:16:58,940
making a narrative some more coherently.

1714
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:03,690
What happens in the second
story's this go out.

1715
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:05,230
He's already created Cosmo,

1716
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:05,771
let's say no,

1717
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:08,140
he makes the habitable
place for human beings.

1718
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:09,500
And that's a Gardner.

1719
01:17:09,980 --> 01:17:11,150
So that's paradise.

1720
01:17:11,210 --> 01:17:14,570
It's paradise is a
walled garden or eating,

1721
01:17:14,571 --> 01:17:16,580
which needs well watering space.

1722
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:21,380
And so the idea is that the proper
environment for you human ne is a wall

1723
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,243
enclosure.

1724
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,213
That's well water.

1725
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:27,140
And there's a mythological id
on that because what's a garden?

1726
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:30,410
A garden is nature and culture together.

1727
01:17:30,730 --> 01:17:31,640
It proper union,

1728
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:31,940
right?

1729
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:35,630
Because obviously the nature is the plants
and the growth and the culture is the

1730
01:17:35,631 --> 01:17:39,470
tending that it takes to make that the
proper place for human beings to live.

1731
01:17:39,471 --> 01:17:40,670
So there's chaos.

1732
01:17:40,671 --> 01:17:42,050
Order Echo there.

1733
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:43,660
Chaos being nature in order,

1734
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:44,513
big culture,

1735
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:46,290
that's the proper
environment for human beings.

1736
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:49,020
It has to be wall because well,

1737
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:51,770
you have to live with a wool environment,

1738
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,633
right?

1739
01:17:53,180 --> 01:17:54,020
Your house,

1740
01:17:54,050 --> 01:17:55,280
your roots have walls,

1741
01:17:55,281 --> 01:17:57,290
your houses have walls,

1742
01:17:57,650 --> 01:17:59,630
your cities are pounding,

1743
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:01,670
your states have boundaries.

1744
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:03,440
Your countries have borders.

1745
01:18:03,530 --> 01:18:04,540
It's woefully thing.

1746
01:18:04,541 --> 01:18:05,640
Bowls with the mold.

1747
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:06,501
And you need that.

1748
01:18:06,501 --> 01:18:06,831
Pardon me?

1749
01:18:06,831 --> 01:18:10,520
Because there isn't that much of you
and you have to wall over a tremendous

1750
01:18:10,521 --> 01:18:12,620
amount of complexity in order to survive.

1751
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:15,410
The gardener who go ahead,

1752
01:18:15,470 --> 01:18:19,000
which men and women there
and he says to them,

1753
01:18:20,190 --> 01:18:21,460
you can do whatever you want to garden,

1754
01:18:21,461 --> 01:18:24,910
but there's a tree in the middle of
the garden and it has the fruit of the

1755
01:18:24,911 --> 01:18:28,960
knowledge of good and evil on
an end you're not to touch that.

1756
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,840
And so that's a very curious thing.

1757
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,930
First curious questioning his
wife and the damn tree again.

1758
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:40,510
And the second day is what the hell's
going expect to be told people not to pass

1759
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:41,081
with that tree.

1760
01:18:41,081 --> 01:18:44,020
Because the first thing that would happen
when she told people not to do that is

1761
01:18:44,021 --> 01:18:45,280
that's exactly what they would do.

1762
01:18:45,281 --> 01:18:46,570
Cause that's exactly what we're like.

1763
01:18:47,200 --> 01:18:48,033
So

1764
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,800
eve is tempted by the snake
and she eats the apple

1765
01:18:56,570 --> 01:18:58,100
that praises other industries.

1766
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:02,700
One of the mysteries is what's up with
the snake and why did you go on with that

1767
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:03,650
with the gardener?

1768
01:19:03,740 --> 01:19:04,990
But here's the answer for them.

1769
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:05,840
As far as I can tell,

1770
01:19:05,841 --> 01:19:07,160
it's a very complicated answer,

1771
01:19:07,161 --> 01:19:09,860
unfortunately is a very complicated topic.

1772
01:19:10,970 --> 01:19:13,910
There's no way of walling
know everything ever.

1773
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:15,291
Right?

1774
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:18,820
So let's say do everything you possibly
can to make out a safe and secure

1775
01:19:18,821 --> 01:19:20,000
environment for your children.

1776
01:19:20,810 --> 01:19:23,800
But what are you going to do
about Internet pornography,

1777
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,793
south side?

1778
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:27,800
Are you going to forbid
them to use the internet?

1779
01:19:28,670 --> 01:19:28,821
Well,

1780
01:19:28,821 --> 01:19:31,010
that's the only way of getting
rid of a whole set of snakes.

1781
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:35,030
But you know what kind of timeline you're
going to have to be in order to manage

1782
01:19:35,031 --> 01:19:35,330
that.

1783
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:37,580
What need to do to change
it in the basement?

1784
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:41,660
Well then you've just replaced the
Internet snake with the Tyrese snake.

1785
01:19:41,690 --> 01:19:41,891
You have,

1786
01:19:41,891 --> 01:19:43,070
you gotten rid of the snake,

1787
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:43,670
he,

1788
01:19:43,670 --> 01:19:45,080
there's no getting rid of the snake.

1789
01:19:45,110 --> 01:19:48,710
That's the thing about the biblical
story was that if you're going to make a

1790
01:19:48,711 --> 01:19:49,401
walled garden,

1791
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:52,250
you're going to put a snake in it
and there's no way around that.

1792
01:19:52,730 --> 01:19:53,480
And so,

1793
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,630
and that's merely to say that
something unexpected always exist.

1794
01:19:56,631 --> 01:19:58,480
So no matter how well
protected the surroundings.

1795
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:00,680
So then the question is,

1796
01:20:00,681 --> 01:20:02,990
well what happens when you
interacted with the snake?

1797
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:09,833
What happened

1798
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,280
in the story of Adam and eve
when they were first created?

1799
01:20:15,290 --> 01:20:16,980
They kind of seem unconscious seven,

1800
01:20:17,370 --> 01:20:21,650
you're not really awake and
they interact with the snake,

1801
01:20:21,651 --> 01:20:26,060
which is just unexpected thing is some
expected thing that has a touch of

1802
01:20:26,061 --> 01:20:29,180
malevolence it and they wake up,

1803
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:30,110
right?

1804
01:20:30,110 --> 01:20:30,501
Cause this,

1805
01:20:30,501 --> 01:20:35,501
the story says that after the serpent
tells each this particular fruit that

1806
01:20:37,610 --> 01:20:38,450
she'll be wise,

1807
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:43,460
like caught and so she eats
her eyes open up the scales,

1808
01:20:43,461 --> 01:20:44,360
fall for bribes.

1809
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:48,140
That's a mythological idea that's
associated with the London lightning or

1810
01:20:48,141 --> 01:20:52,580
illumination or vision like because to
have the scales fall from your eyes has

1811
01:20:52,581 --> 01:20:54,650
to see something that
you haven't seen before.

1812
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,540
What do you see?

1813
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:57,370
Right?

1814
01:20:57,370 --> 01:20:57,670
Right.

1815
01:20:57,670 --> 01:20:59,360
Immediately did cheese.

1816
01:21:01,210 --> 01:21:02,320
What does that mean?

1817
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,240
Well first of all,

1818
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,770
you might notice that you're all close
human needs and be wearing clothes,

1819
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:10,960
clothes for a very long period of time.

1820
01:21:10,961 --> 01:21:15,961
It's tens of thousands of years and
actually track the evolution of lice and

1821
01:21:16,241 --> 01:21:16,750
clothing.

1822
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:20,470
You can track the evolution of clothing
by tracking the genetic structure of

1823
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:21,333
human lights,

1824
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:25,900
because license all claim to clothing
and you can tell how far back do you hold

1825
01:21:25,901 --> 01:21:30,130
that ability until you can derive from
that an indication of when people first

1826
01:21:30,131 --> 01:21:31,090
started to wear clothes.

1827
01:21:31,360 --> 01:21:34,330
So it's been long enough so
that license invulnerable to,

1828
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:34,840
to,

1829
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:35,820
to the downtown.

1830
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:36,790
So it's a long time.

1831
01:21:37,210 --> 01:21:39,190
And why are your clothes,

1832
01:21:41,890 --> 01:21:43,720
he wakes up,

1833
01:21:44,380 --> 01:21:47,980
then she waits out of the house
and she notices that she's naked.

1834
01:21:48,550 --> 01:21:48,761
Okay.

1835
01:21:48,761 --> 01:21:50,210
Now think about human beings.

1836
01:21:50,830 --> 01:21:51,820
First of all,

1837
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,270
we're not down on all fours,

1838
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:53,910
right?

1839
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:54,743
We're

1840
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:56,330
now an animal's,

1841
01:21:56,330 --> 01:21:59,410
you're done all for the most
vulnerable parts of them are hidden.

1842
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:02,080
I'm kind of armor light
structures of their bag.

1843
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,310
It's not that easy to get at.

1844
01:22:03,311 --> 01:22:06,900
An animal is vulnerable parts
and some amicable curl up,

1845
01:22:07,110 --> 01:22:07,770
right?

1846
01:22:07,770 --> 01:22:10,720
[inaudible] makes it hard
for them to be torn apart.

1847
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:11,863
Not Us.

1848
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:13,001
We're right up,

1849
01:22:13,001 --> 01:22:13,610
right?

1850
01:22:13,610 --> 01:22:16,750
And the most vulnerable parts
of us are exposed to the world,

1851
01:22:16,751 --> 01:22:17,320
to the,

1852
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,610
not only to the elements,

1853
01:22:18,790 --> 01:22:21,400
to the analysis of everyone else.

1854
01:22:21,700 --> 01:22:25,120
So it's not only are our
knowledge of our nakedness,

1855
01:22:25,121 --> 01:22:28,470
let's say against the terrible different
nations of nature because we're rather

1856
01:22:28,540 --> 01:22:33,370
soft and tender and delicious bio with
hours and but also because we're exposed

1857
01:22:33,371 --> 01:22:38,170
to the evaluation of other people and to
wake up and realize that that's a very

1858
01:22:38,171 --> 01:22:42,190
interesting thing because it means
that what happened to eat when she was

1859
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:45,040
enlightened in the garden was that
she woke up and realized that she was

1860
01:22:45,041 --> 01:22:45,874
vulnerable,

1861
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:46,421
right?

1862
01:22:46,421 --> 01:22:47,560
Fundamentally vulnerable.

1863
01:22:47,590 --> 01:22:49,120
And then two things happen.

1864
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:54,610
This realization that the dam and
there's a realization of good and evil.

1865
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,630
Now the realization of death,

1866
01:22:56,650 --> 01:23:00,430
that's relatively easy to
understand because if you
wake up and you realize that

1867
01:23:00,431 --> 01:23:01,061
you are vulnerable,

1868
01:23:01,061 --> 01:23:02,420
the logical extension of that,

1869
01:23:02,421 --> 01:23:03,610
it's to know that you could die,

1870
01:23:03,670 --> 01:23:04,250
right?

1871
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:06,010
The logical stands for acknowledge

1872
01:23:06,010 --> 01:23:10,810
of vulnerability is to view the future
as a finite place to view yourself as

1873
01:23:10,811 --> 01:23:13,930
something that's started a terminal
and and as far as we know will lead.

1874
01:23:13,940 --> 01:23:15,270
Human beings have that million.

1875
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:19,840
And so that's something
completely different than
other teachers because we're

1876
01:23:19,841 --> 01:23:23,680
aware of our own vulnerability and the
level isn't the case any other creature.

1877
01:23:23,950 --> 01:23:28,900
And that biblical story relates that as
a cataclysmic event in the structure of

1878
01:23:28,901 --> 01:23:29,734
the world.

1879
01:23:29,770 --> 01:23:33,220
And I think that's a reasonable way
of proceeding it because we are,

1880
01:23:33,910 --> 01:23:37,090
we aren't conscious creatures and we're
the only creatures that are true self

1881
01:23:37,091 --> 01:23:42,091
conscious and we don't know what the
essential significance of that is except

1882
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:46,090
that for us certainly propelled us
into our historical developments.

1883
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:48,460
So at least at the human level,

1884
01:23:48,461 --> 01:23:50,040
it's a cataclysmic discovery.

1885
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:51,670
And then the next question is,

1886
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:52,120
well,

1887
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:52,841
okay fine.

1888
01:23:52,841 --> 01:23:55,770
So that's why you wake up when you
discovered her naked and that kind of seek

1889
01:23:55,780 --> 01:23:58,330
the knowledge and the world.

1890
01:23:58,390 --> 01:23:59,740
What about needle?

1891
01:24:01,150 --> 01:24:01,301
Well,

1892
01:24:01,301 --> 01:24:03,400
I'm puzzled on that for like 15 years.

1893
01:24:03,401 --> 01:24:05,310
Starts to take off once
the health of the launch.

1894
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:06,700
Then why does that,

1895
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:08,740
why does the story relate to that way?

1896
01:24:09,070 --> 01:24:09,940
And more importantly,

1897
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:11,470
why do we remember that story,

1898
01:24:11,471 --> 01:24:11,711
right?

1899
01:24:11,711 --> 01:24:13,540
That's an old stories.

1900
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:15,190
Dozens of years old.

1901
01:24:15,270 --> 01:24:17,990
It's written for him and God
only knows how old in its world.

1902
01:24:18,430 --> 01:24:20,200
We don't forget this story.

1903
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,670
Well why not?

1904
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:21,911
Well,

1905
01:24:21,911 --> 01:24:24,760
who knows it into our memories come out.

1906
01:24:24,790 --> 01:24:26,700
That's why we didn't
forget they talk this week.

1907
01:24:26,980 --> 01:24:29,590
So reason for that possibly.

1908
01:24:29,980 --> 01:24:31,690
I'm assuming that there's a reason for it.

1909
01:24:32,020 --> 01:24:32,291
Well,

1910
01:24:32,291 --> 01:24:35,440
I didn't figure it out a little
bit about it and 12 of us for life,

1911
01:24:37,300 --> 01:24:38,740
when you know you're vulnerable,

1912
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:40,580
you know a hundred people there

1913
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,570
and as soon as you know that your phone
to hold another people are vulnerable,

1914
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,680
you understand how you can be hurt,

1915
01:24:48,190 --> 01:24:48,370
right?

1916
01:24:48,370 --> 01:24:49,750
You don't just hit hurt.

1917
01:24:50,590 --> 01:24:53,110
You understand how you could be heard.

1918
01:24:53,710 --> 01:24:56,140
And as soon as you understand
how you can be heard,

1919
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,710
then you know how long
people can be heard.

1920
01:24:59,650 --> 01:25:01,320
And as soon as you know how I met,

1921
01:25:01,330 --> 01:25:02,620
people can be heard.

1922
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:06,400
Then what you have is the knowledge of
good and evil because then you can decide

1923
01:25:06,401 --> 01:25:09,880
whether you're going to use your
knowledge of what hurts you to hurt other

1924
01:25:09,881 --> 01:25:13,180
people and you're going to
get the client to do that.

1925
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:15,460
And so part of what
that means is that the,

1926
01:25:15,790 --> 01:25:20,050
the whole issue of moral choice
all of a sudden enters the world.

1927
01:25:20,260 --> 01:25:21,660
And that's the landscape

1928
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:22,953
happened.

1929
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:25,733
Alright,

1930
01:25:25,870 --> 01:25:27,080
so then what happens

1931
01:25:29,980 --> 01:25:31,550
if you could wake up,

1932
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:36,650
which I think is right because I think
that women probably Walkman and then we'd

1933
01:25:36,651 --> 01:25:37,660
never forgiven you for,

1934
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:40,730
I think that that happens
actually all the time,

1935
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:46,120
which is part of the reason why the man
in my Toronto drove up on the side door,

1936
01:25:47,650 --> 01:25:52,650
killed all those people is because women
were making himself and he didn't like

1937
01:25:53,661 --> 01:25:54,200
it.

1938
01:25:54,200 --> 01:25:54,471
No one,

1939
01:25:54,471 --> 01:25:59,471
even him and his self
conscience or something like
I'm constitute in such a way

1940
01:26:00,051 --> 01:26:04,250
that what I desire is
rejection and then maybe

1941
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,270
bigger low on comprehension and murders.

1942
01:26:10,020 --> 01:26:12,760
Now women are prone to reject man.

1943
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:16,940
You have twice as many female
ancestors as male ancestors.

1944
01:26:17,330 --> 01:26:20,030
And the evolutionary
biology seems quite clear.

1945
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:24,950
The reason that we've diverged from a
common ancestor of chimpanzees like human

1946
01:26:24,951 --> 01:26:29,951
beings is because chimpanzee females
are not sexually selective and human

1947
01:26:30,321 --> 01:26:31,940
females are.

1948
01:26:32,150 --> 01:26:32,983
And that needs that.

1949
01:26:33,020 --> 01:26:36,020
Whatever progress we've made as a species,

1950
01:26:36,021 --> 01:26:41,021
assuming what we made constitutes progress
as been as a consequence of women to

1951
01:26:41,061 --> 01:26:43,410
proclivity to reject man.

1952
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,051
And you might think,

1953
01:26:45,051 --> 01:26:45,860
well,

1954
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:47,780
maybe that's a price worth paying,

1955
01:26:47,810 --> 01:26:50,120
but it's not necessarily a
price that you want to pay.

1956
01:26:50,121 --> 01:26:51,760
If you happen to be one of those band,

1957
01:26:51,761 --> 01:26:53,780
you were constantly being rejected.

1958
01:26:54,110 --> 01:26:56,540
Now perhaps you the right
attitude to that is,

1959
01:26:56,780 --> 01:27:00,620
well you should figure out how to
retool yourself so that you're not being

1960
01:27:00,621 --> 01:27:03,530
rejected by 50% of the population,

1961
01:27:03,531 --> 01:27:07,250
which is fairly solid evidence that
there might be something about you that's

1962
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:11,180
not exactly like straight
and appropriate let's say.

1963
01:27:11,510 --> 01:27:12,840
But you know that's a harsh,

1964
01:27:12,850 --> 01:27:16,970
that's the harshest of all
possible judgements and it's
very difficult thing for

1965
01:27:16,971 --> 01:27:18,970
people to accept and no one did.

1966
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:19,970
So.

1967
01:27:19,970 --> 01:27:20,301
Okay,

1968
01:27:20,301 --> 01:27:21,134
so anyways,

1969
01:27:21,440 --> 01:27:23,740
evenings having self conscious and then,

1970
01:27:23,820 --> 01:27:24,531
then what happens?

1971
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:29,360
Well the next part of this story is a
black comedy and so God goes for a walk to

1972
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:32,340
the garden and he's accustomed
to walking without him.

1973
01:27:32,470 --> 01:27:33,560
What that means to me,

1974
01:27:33,561 --> 01:27:37,190
I think it's something like we've already
conceptualized in this talk to some

1975
01:27:37,191 --> 01:27:40,780
degree with Gog represents at least in
this part of the narrative cycling or it

1976
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:43,640
represents that divine consciousness.

1977
01:27:43,641 --> 01:27:48,641
Let's say that you partake in that
confronts the potential of chaos,

1978
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:50,113
transplants,

1979
01:27:50,130 --> 01:27:55,130
actuality to walk with that is
to be guided by that principle.

1980
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:55,461
You know,

1981
01:27:55,461 --> 01:27:56,360
if you're on the street,

1982
01:27:56,361 --> 01:27:57,190
you know path,

1983
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:59,960
you're where you should be at your
life and not sure what you're doing.

1984
01:27:59,960 --> 01:28:01,580
And maybe that requires courage.

1985
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:05,600
It requires you to be forthright
and it requires you to look up into,

1986
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,350
to try to make the world a better
place rather than a terrible place.

1987
01:28:09,620 --> 01:28:11,070
And so Adam's just the customers,

1988
01:28:11,071 --> 01:28:14,720
do we have it today after he's
woken up and become self conscious,

1989
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:17,530
he hides like the hook.

1990
01:28:17,990 --> 01:28:22,310
And that's partly why it's comical
because you can't hide behind.

1991
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:26,300
You can't hide from God
behind that Bush in a look.

1992
01:28:26,310 --> 01:28:29,420
Once somebody's gone is that
I can even see through a bush,

1993
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:30,021
it's like,

1994
01:28:30,021 --> 01:28:34,590
and it doesn't reflect for
evolve out to intelligence God.

1995
01:28:34,780 --> 01:28:36,440
And he's hiding behind a bush.

1996
01:28:36,770 --> 01:28:40,250
And then he comes up with three
ladies skews to so go out calls,

1997
01:28:40,251 --> 01:28:41,050
offices,

1998
01:28:41,050 --> 01:28:41,340
what's,

1999
01:28:41,340 --> 01:28:42,173
what's up,

2000
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:44,210
we're supposed to go for a walk it out.

2001
01:28:44,211 --> 01:28:45,044
And he says,

2002
01:28:45,170 --> 01:28:46,003
um,

2003
01:28:46,430 --> 01:28:47,850
I make an end to shame.

2004
01:28:48,820 --> 01:28:50,030
And God says,

2005
01:28:50,031 --> 01:28:55,031
who told you that you were naked and
this is the terrible part of the story.

2006
01:28:55,530 --> 01:28:56,210
Um,

2007
01:28:56,210 --> 01:28:56,391
you know,

2008
01:28:56,391 --> 01:28:58,850
because eve is often
portrayed as the villain.

2009
01:28:58,910 --> 01:29:00,170
At least that's the theory,

2010
01:29:00,171 --> 01:29:00,960
right?

2011
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:01,710
If you,

2012
01:29:01,710 --> 01:29:02,430
if you,

2013
01:29:02,430 --> 01:29:05,790
if you regard the mythical stories as
part of the patriarchal oppression,

2014
01:29:06,540 --> 01:29:11,180
centuries long patriarchal oppression
and eve is the bag first of whose rocket

2015
01:29:11,181 --> 01:29:14,990
man time madam is needs some think that
it's complete rubbish because how did he

2016
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:17,670
shows his true colors in the
second part of the story?

2017
01:29:18,000 --> 01:29:22,680
Because as soon as God calls him
who said that you were naked,

2018
01:29:22,740 --> 01:29:23,850
what does he do?

2019
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:26,250
He says he does two things.

2020
01:29:26,251 --> 01:29:27,084
He said,

2021
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:29,490
remember that the woman who made for me,

2022
01:29:29,940 --> 01:29:31,110
it's her fault.

2023
01:29:31,200 --> 01:29:34,770
And so that's a perfect day because it
doesn't take responsibility for his own

2024
01:29:34,771 --> 01:29:35,604
action.

2025
01:29:36,090 --> 01:29:40,530
And first he blames the woman
and then you'd late God.

2026
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:41,151
Right.

2027
01:29:41,151 --> 01:29:45,620
And you might think that takes a fair
bit of goal and that's exactly right.

2028
01:29:45,620 --> 01:29:47,340
I mean this is relevant.

2029
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:52,910
It's relevant because that's exactly
what happened to this man in Toronto who

2030
01:29:53,011 --> 01:29:53,970
killed all those people.

2031
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:58,360
First thing you did because of his
painful self consciousness as plain white

2032
01:29:58,361 --> 01:29:59,100
men.

2033
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:01,060
And the second thing
you did was blaming God.

2034
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:04,290
And the third one he did
was take his revenge.

2035
01:30:04,950 --> 01:30:05,161
Okay,

2036
01:30:05,161 --> 01:30:06,720
so that's the next story.

2037
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:12,200
So God isn't very happy with this because
now the structure of Ba is permanently

2038
01:30:14,311 --> 01:30:18,300
disrupted by the emergence
of self consciousness and
the knowledge of death and

2039
01:30:18,510 --> 01:30:20,370
the emergence of the
knowledge of good and evil.

2040
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:22,350
It's like so much for that paradise,

2041
01:30:22,351 --> 01:30:22,890
right?

2042
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:27,360
It's people have evolved
beyond their childhood.

2043
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:30,450
Harriet's same thing happens
to the Buddha when he matures,

2044
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:30,701
right?

2045
01:30:30,701 --> 01:30:33,690
Because as father and
links in a walled city,

2046
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,150
it's all where there's no
age and there's no death,

2047
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,440
there's no sickness.

2048
01:30:37,590 --> 01:30:39,540
And he grows up in there
and everything's perfect,

2049
01:30:39,541 --> 01:30:40,410
but it gets curious.

2050
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:44,490
He goes outside the walls of the city
and the first thing he encounters is

2051
01:30:44,820 --> 01:30:45,451
sickness.

2052
01:30:45,451 --> 01:30:49,230
And then he encounters old age at
different voyage and any encounters,

2053
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:54,020
death and he encounters get
never goes back inside the waltz,

2054
01:30:54,030 --> 01:30:55,570
in his father's name for it.

2055
01:30:55,710 --> 01:30:56,880
It's exactly the same.

2056
01:30:56,881 --> 01:30:57,714
Might be.

2057
01:30:58,290 --> 01:30:59,010
So anyways,

2058
01:30:59,010 --> 01:30:59,581
God says,

2059
01:30:59,581 --> 01:31:00,830
well now to change up,

2060
01:31:00,870 --> 01:31:01,290
you know,

2061
01:31:01,290 --> 01:31:02,220
you've really done it.

2062
01:31:02,910 --> 01:31:03,960
Here's what's going to happen.

2063
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:07,660
You knew about the future and
now you're going to have to work.

2064
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:10,800
Because as soon as you
know about the future,

2065
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:12,330
then you have to work.

2066
01:31:12,360 --> 01:31:15,450
Because even if things are going well
now that doesn't mean they're going to go

2067
01:31:15,451 --> 01:31:18,600
well in Amman and you
better get ready for that.

2068
01:31:18,630 --> 01:31:22,200
You better get ready for the winter then
get ready for your old age and they're

2069
01:31:22,201 --> 01:31:25,620
getting ready for the fact that you
might get ill and so you're work.

2070
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,083
That's that.

2071
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:28,620
As human beings work,

2072
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:32,820
we work because we're aware of the
future and he tells eve while you're in

2073
01:31:32,821 --> 01:31:33,630
trouble too,

2074
01:31:33,630 --> 01:31:35,520
and I won't go into
this in too much detail,

2075
01:31:35,521 --> 01:31:40,521
but part of each trouble is that she's
going to give birth to intelligent,

2076
01:31:41,640 --> 01:31:46,640
large skull and highly dependent children
and they're going to tear her apart

2077
01:31:46,811 --> 01:31:49,740
and shelter and she's going to have
to be dependent on her husband.

2078
01:31:50,310 --> 01:31:54,090
And so those are the dual curses
of whatever we get into wake up.

2079
01:31:54,690 --> 01:31:58,170
So when the world and what my history
starts as far as the biblical stories are

2080
01:31:58,171 --> 01:31:59,004
concerned.

2081
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:00,550
And then there's the second story

2082
01:32:03,700 --> 01:32:08,600
is the story of painting
and very short stories.

2083
01:32:08,601 --> 01:32:09,790
Something about a paragraph long,

2084
01:32:09,791 --> 01:32:10,650
it's like 10 seconds.

2085
01:32:11,030 --> 01:32:13,420
It's got to meet that richest
10 sentence has ever written.

2086
01:32:13,421 --> 01:32:17,800
And I think so he had looked
at first two real big,

2087
01:32:18,790 --> 01:32:22,360
I need not because either leave by
out so he can hardly count them.

2088
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:27,370
Now Cain and Abel were actually born
in history to a mother and a father.

2089
01:32:28,271 --> 01:32:30,820
So then there was the
real no real human beings,

2090
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:31,070
right?

2091
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:32,590
In the real world.

2092
01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:33,693
And there are a pattern.

2093
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:38,590
There's a pattern of a hostile progress
like foreign local evangelicals,

2094
01:32:38,610 --> 01:32:39,443
right?

2095
01:32:39,610 --> 01:32:41,350
Or Harry Potter and Voldemort.

2096
01:32:41,380 --> 01:32:42,870
Same IPFS is,

2097
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:47,200
or back after the Joburg or superman and
Lex Luthor doesn't matter the good guy

2098
01:32:47,201 --> 01:32:47,981
and a bad guy,

2099
01:32:47,981 --> 01:32:48,540
right?

2100
01:32:48,540 --> 01:32:49,870
The or that,

2101
01:32:49,930 --> 01:32:53,070
the quasi messiah and the safety himself,

2102
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:53,560
right?

2103
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,850
It's the same pattern,

2104
01:32:54,860 --> 01:32:58,780
intention and tested instantly as
soon as this landscape is laid out.

2105
01:32:58,810 --> 01:33:00,610
So what happens to Cain and Abel?

2106
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:01,503
Well,

2107
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:05,470
they made sacrifices and that's the
first part of the story that hard to

2108
01:33:05,471 --> 01:33:06,060
understand.

2109
01:33:06,060 --> 01:33:11,060
His April offers the best pumps of neat
that he has is the choices everyone's

2110
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:17,410
from Splore burdensome
offers the smoke you got,

2111
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:19,240
it's a little lonely aren't caring side.

2112
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:20,200
Right.

2113
01:33:20,200 --> 01:33:21,520
So what's the idea?

2114
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:23,500
Well God is in the heavens.

2115
01:33:23,860 --> 01:33:25,540
What you think that I'll get,

2116
01:33:25,541 --> 01:33:27,160
cause when you look up at the night sky,

2117
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:28,750
it fills you with awe.

2118
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:30,460
You can seize this infinite expanse.

2119
01:33:30,461 --> 01:33:31,420
You have to say the spirits.

2120
01:33:31,421 --> 01:33:32,650
When you look at the sun and the moon,

2121
01:33:32,651 --> 01:33:34,420
it's that which is beyond you.

2122
01:33:34,510 --> 01:33:37,330
The human imagination
populates that domain,

2123
01:33:37,331 --> 01:33:38,350
which divinity?

2124
01:33:38,830 --> 01:33:40,960
The ultimate well and where is that?

2125
01:33:40,961 --> 01:33:41,440
It's out.

2126
01:33:41,440 --> 01:33:42,810
Well how do you communicate with what's,

2127
01:33:43,390 --> 01:33:48,390
oh smoke rises and so you offer something
to the absolute and it can get a sense

2128
01:33:49,901 --> 01:33:54,790
of the quality of your offering as a
consequence of the rising of the smoke.

2129
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:55,901
Like I said,

2130
01:33:55,901 --> 01:33:59,440
it's an archaic idea that you can grow
it as this childlike idea of not child

2131
01:33:59,490 --> 01:34:00,670
Yasha a child life.

2132
01:34:02,190 --> 01:34:04,480
So you communicate with
dogs from sacrifice.

2133
01:34:05,830 --> 01:34:10,630
Cain sacrifices his offerings
and able sacrifices his,

2134
01:34:11,970 --> 01:34:14,560
but then because we're taking
these stories seriously,

2135
01:34:14,710 --> 01:34:14,951
okay,

2136
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:15,700
well what's going on?

2137
01:34:15,700 --> 01:34:16,533
For example,

2138
01:34:17,050 --> 01:34:20,020
well here's what's going on and this
is how finding the 12 rules for life as

2139
01:34:20,021 --> 01:34:20,201
well.

2140
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:24,440
This is also about 20 years to figure out
what about this idea of separate twice

2141
01:34:24,441 --> 01:34:25,750
what the health behind that,

2142
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,920
because it's a human universal,

2143
01:34:26,921 --> 01:34:27,131
right?

2144
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:28,420
You find sacrificial,

2145
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:29,310
OTC efferent.

2146
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,110
We remember while you can think,

2147
01:34:32,111 --> 01:34:32,861
you can think it through,

2148
01:34:32,861 --> 01:34:36,680
if you think about how people
use the word sacrifice in,

2149
01:34:36,690 --> 01:34:36,811
in,

2150
01:34:36,811 --> 01:34:37,870
in really modern times.

2151
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:40,740
Or I teach my students at
the University of trial,

2152
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,270
but other than when children
are first generation immigrants,

2153
01:34:43,660 --> 01:34:44,350
so they're,

2154
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:44,531
you know,

2155
01:34:44,531 --> 01:34:49,531
their parents sacrificed a lot in
order to give them an opportunity.

2156
01:34:49,780 --> 01:34:50,860
So what they sacrifice,

2157
01:34:50,861 --> 01:34:52,870
but they offer the sacrifice
of their home country.

2158
01:34:53,170 --> 01:34:56,770
Sometimes they sacrifice a profession
because maybe they were doctors where they

2159
01:34:56,771 --> 01:34:57,170
came,

2160
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:58,610
the couldn't get licensed in Canada,

2161
01:34:58,611 --> 01:35:02,210
so they end up running up convenience
store or laundry or something like that.

2162
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,020
Working,

2163
01:35:03,020 --> 01:35:03,853
you know,

2164
01:35:04,010 --> 01:35:06,680
punishing their kids have an opportunity.

2165
01:35:06,740 --> 01:35:08,300
So if you ask the kids,

2166
01:35:08,301 --> 01:35:10,940
but what did your parents sacrificing
that you could go to university?

2167
01:35:10,941 --> 01:35:12,300
It's like their hands are up right away.

2168
01:35:12,320 --> 01:35:14,950
They have the staff that language
and then you can ask them to,

2169
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:15,041
well,

2170
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:19,280
what do you sacrifice for your
grades all I don't party every night,

2171
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:19,641
right?

2172
01:35:19,641 --> 01:35:21,650
I for go ratification.

2173
01:35:22,430 --> 01:35:23,390
So what does it mean?

2174
01:35:23,450 --> 01:35:28,010
I sacrifice something I valued APG
make to make the future better.

2175
01:35:28,100 --> 01:35:32,840
I'm acting out the proposition that I
can bargain with Phage by giving them

2176
01:35:32,841 --> 01:35:33,231
something.

2177
01:35:33,231 --> 01:35:35,510
Now I can make something
better in the future.

2178
01:35:36,110 --> 01:35:39,440
That is an absolutely
overwhelming discovery.

2179
01:35:39,950 --> 01:35:44,780
That's what human beings discovered is
that it's so strange because it works.

2180
01:35:45,440 --> 01:35:49,610
You can give up things that you value in
the present and it does pay off in the

2181
01:35:49,611 --> 01:35:50,444
future.

2182
01:35:50,660 --> 01:35:53,810
Now that's partly because you're
bargaining with future people,

2183
01:35:53,870 --> 01:35:55,490
but I'm not going to get into that.

2184
01:35:55,610 --> 01:35:58,480
You can read more about how the
12 rules for life if you warm.

2185
01:35:59,090 --> 01:36:04,090
The point is that it wasn't archaic as
the ritual was Sikh people were acting up

2186
01:36:05,610 --> 01:36:07,210
something they didn't understand.

2187
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:11,510
They've watched how people
that were successful were
successful and they watched

2188
01:36:11,511 --> 01:36:16,120
people how people who weren't successful
weren't successful and they extracted

2189
01:36:16,130 --> 01:36:19,580
out this idea that the people who were
successful were doing something that made

2190
01:36:19,581 --> 01:36:22,610
them successful and it was like sacrifice.

2191
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:27,200
And so they ritualizing sacrifices
have you understand what it was and

2192
01:36:27,201 --> 01:36:29,390
eventually that became
a psychological concept,

2193
01:36:29,391 --> 01:36:29,870
which was,

2194
01:36:29,870 --> 01:36:30,021
well,

2195
01:36:30,021 --> 01:36:30,830
you can give,

2196
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:31,663
you know,

2197
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:34,370
you do that when you to renew
yourself and the new year's festival,

2198
01:36:34,490 --> 01:36:34,911
by the way,

2199
01:36:34,911 --> 01:36:37,220
which is an unbelievably old idea.

2200
01:36:37,221 --> 01:36:41,330
You give up your pathological
past self and you make some,

2201
01:36:42,020 --> 01:36:42,510
what do you call,

2202
01:36:42,510 --> 01:36:43,320
goals,

2203
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,030
resolution.

2204
01:36:44,030 --> 01:36:48,150
There's some issues about how you can
be a very new in the future and that's a

2205
01:36:48,151 --> 01:36:53,151
sacrificial app and it's based on
a very old ritual that has roots,

2206
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:55,730
at least in Mesopotamia,

2207
01:36:55,820 --> 01:36:58,700
at least 5,000 years ago
where the king had to,

2208
01:36:58,701 --> 01:37:03,050
I'd do that every new year so that he
could be a good king for the upcoming

2209
01:37:03,050 --> 01:37:03,590
year,

2210
01:37:03,590 --> 01:37:05,090
which you can also read about that.

2211
01:37:05,090 --> 01:37:05,530
It maps it.

2212
01:37:05,530 --> 01:37:07,140
Maybe you want to read about that.

2213
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:08,660
The interesting anyways.

2214
01:37:08,661 --> 01:37:10,620
The whole idea is that
this whole sacrifice,

2215
01:37:10,740 --> 01:37:11,930
this actually works,

2216
01:37:12,170 --> 01:37:15,350
and then that rig that brings
up a whole realm of questions.

2217
01:37:15,351 --> 01:37:15,890
It's like,

2218
01:37:15,890 --> 01:37:16,011
well,

2219
01:37:16,011 --> 01:37:17,510
the sacrifice works.

2220
01:37:18,560 --> 01:37:20,390
What's the best possible sacrifice,

2221
01:37:20,630 --> 01:37:20,901
right?

2222
01:37:20,901 --> 01:37:23,510
Because that's obviously when
you figured out that it works,

2223
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:27,860
you want to figure out what we optimize
it and part of that is you have to

2224
01:37:27,861 --> 01:37:31,950
sacrifice that which she loved and
that's part of the active labor.

2225
01:37:31,980 --> 01:37:34,250
When Abraham is called on to sacrifice,

2226
01:37:34,251 --> 01:37:34,561
I say,

2227
01:37:34,561 --> 01:37:36,100
I guess the emergence of that idea,

2228
01:37:36,170 --> 01:37:39,260
maybe what you love most is a
personally love the most and you think,

2229
01:37:39,261 --> 01:37:42,890
well does that mean you said
offer your son up to God?

2230
01:37:43,040 --> 01:37:46,010
Hence what you mean when you ask me
the questions because the answer that

2231
01:37:46,011 --> 01:37:47,750
question is actually yes.

2232
01:37:47,850 --> 01:37:48,321
In fact,

2233
01:37:48,321 --> 01:37:52,580
that's exactly what you do if you're an
ideal parent because you want your son

2234
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:56,040
and your daughter to be as good as

2235
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:57,960
they can possibly be,

2236
01:37:58,020 --> 01:37:58,441
let's say.

2237
01:37:58,441 --> 01:38:01,200
How can make any sacrifices that
are necessary in order to carry,

2238
01:38:01,201 --> 01:38:02,034
there's your life.

2239
01:38:02,190 --> 01:38:05,370
So even though the idea again
is barbaric and are archaic,

2240
01:38:05,390 --> 01:38:07,080
couldn't it's ritual form.

2241
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:10,170
There's a siege in that are calculable.

2242
01:38:10,171 --> 01:38:10,980
Brilliant.

2243
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:11,850
In any case,

2244
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:18,560
God's happy with Abel sacrifices and he's
not happy with Katie suffer pharmacies

2245
01:38:19,020 --> 01:38:22,380
and there's reality and is not
exactly what the swine and the story,

2246
01:38:22,740 --> 01:38:25,500
it's kind of thing.

2247
01:38:25,740 --> 01:38:26,640
Not Exactly.

2248
01:38:26,641 --> 01:38:27,101
There's hymns,

2249
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:29,370
but it's vague and that's
good because you know,

2250
01:38:29,550 --> 01:38:33,420
you know what life is like if you're
doing everything you can to sick yourself,

2251
01:38:33,421 --> 01:38:33,701
right?

2252
01:38:33,701 --> 01:38:36,660
And to put the world in order
around and it isn't working,

2253
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:40,200
your sacrifices are being rejected.

2254
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:40,521
Well,

2255
01:38:40,521 --> 01:38:42,150
what's the consequence of that?

2256
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:42,661
Well,

2257
01:38:42,661 --> 01:38:43,740
if you're not trying,

2258
01:38:43,741 --> 01:38:44,790
when you fail,

2259
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:50,180
well that's sucks because it's not very
exciting not to try and who the hell

2260
01:38:50,821 --> 01:38:51,541
wants to fail,

2261
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:55,860
but at least you're not
punished for your best efforts.

2262
01:38:56,190 --> 01:38:59,190
But if you make your sacrifices
and they're rejected,

2263
01:38:59,490 --> 01:39:03,050
then what's the right attitude towards up?

2264
01:39:03,270 --> 01:39:03,421
Well,

2265
01:39:03,421 --> 01:39:04,071
Keynes out.

2266
01:39:04,071 --> 01:39:06,720
The key is to get bigger.

2267
01:39:07,410 --> 01:39:09,440
He gets fitter because Abel is,

2268
01:39:09,441 --> 01:39:12,040
you're making these
sacrifices and works like mad.

2269
01:39:12,290 --> 01:39:13,950
God's thrilled about Abel.

2270
01:39:13,980 --> 01:39:17,100
He's partner with a women blocks increase.

2271
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,450
Everybody likes him worse.

2272
01:39:18,610 --> 01:39:21,480
He's the sort of guy who deserves
it and that's super annoying,

2273
01:39:21,481 --> 01:39:21,790
right?

2274
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:25,560
Because there's nothing more annoying
than coming to meet someone hyper

2275
01:39:25,561 --> 01:39:28,590
successful and then also
realizing that they deserve it.

2276
01:39:28,650 --> 01:39:32,220
You think that person would have the
good graces to be contemptible so you

2277
01:39:32,221 --> 01:39:35,310
wouldn't have to be envious about the
fact that everything is going well for

2278
01:39:35,311 --> 01:39:35,820
them.

2279
01:39:35,820 --> 01:39:38,070
But often that doesn't work out.

2280
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:41,670
So Kane isn't he raised by Dick Spice,

2281
01:39:41,730 --> 01:39:46,730
continual failure and he's outraged at
Abel because Abel successes casting this

2282
01:39:48,001 --> 01:39:53,001
failure and even a more dim light
and he's brooding about the unjustice

2283
01:39:53,110 --> 01:39:58,110
injustice in the world and so he decides
to call out God because Adam get it,

2284
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,990
why not cane?

2285
01:40:01,140 --> 01:40:05,220
And so he has a little chat with God
and says something along the lines.

2286
01:40:05,230 --> 01:40:09,390
I've heard a lot of different translations
of this major change to get to what

2287
01:40:09,391 --> 01:40:12,060
was at the bottom of it
is quite complicated.

2288
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:15,640
But basically what happens
is Katie calls out God,

2289
01:40:15,680 --> 01:40:16,620
creator of reality.

2290
01:40:16,621 --> 01:40:17,970
He says something like,

2291
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:19,950
what the hell is up here?

2292
01:40:21,220 --> 01:40:26,220
I'm breaking myself in half trying
to have a half decent life in.

2293
01:40:27,340 --> 01:40:30,720
Everything I do is turns to ash.

2294
01:40:31,350 --> 01:40:36,350
And then there's my brother whose doesn't
seem to be making sacrifices or any

2295
01:40:37,131 --> 01:40:39,100
more heartfelt than me,

2296
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:40,890
isn't spectacular success.

2297
01:40:40,891 --> 01:40:41,460
It's like,

2298
01:40:41,460 --> 01:40:42,690
what the Hell's going on?

2299
01:40:42,760 --> 01:40:43,980
Kinda crazy planet.

2300
01:40:43,981 --> 01:40:47,990
Is this anyway to that you've created
where this sort of thing is so likely to

2301
01:40:47,991 --> 01:40:48,640
happen?

2302
01:40:48,640 --> 01:40:51,730
How do you know you might
first of all go to that?

2303
01:40:51,740 --> 01:40:56,140
The probability that you thought that
way of you license from time to time is

2304
01:40:56,230 --> 01:40:58,480
100% in fact,

2305
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:02,440
I suspect that there's a substantial
number of you in the room who think like

2306
01:41:02,441 --> 01:41:04,000
that almost all the time.

2307
01:41:04,750 --> 01:41:07,980
It's extraordinary attempting because
when things fall apart for you,

2308
01:41:08,020 --> 01:41:09,580
which they do from time to time,

2309
01:41:09,840 --> 01:41:10,150
it's like,

2310
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:10,391
well,

2311
01:41:10,391 --> 01:41:14,200
who doesn't want to go outside and shake
his fist at the sky and rail against

2312
01:41:14,260 --> 01:41:15,780
the horror of blind faith?

2313
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:16,541
Right?

2314
01:41:16,541 --> 01:41:17,650
The question arises,

2315
01:41:17,810 --> 01:41:22,210
how can the world be constituted in such
an unjust manner and who's to blame?

2316
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:22,721
You might say,

2317
01:41:22,721 --> 01:41:22,871
well,

2318
01:41:22,871 --> 01:41:23,950
I don't believe in God.

2319
01:41:23,951 --> 01:41:24,790
It's again,

2320
01:41:24,791 --> 01:41:25,720
it's irrelevant.

2321
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:30,010
It doesn't matter from the psychological
perspective it happens anyways.

2322
01:41:30,190 --> 01:41:31,720
You act it out anyways.

2323
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:32,740
Also,

2324
01:41:32,740 --> 01:41:33,580
God listens,

2325
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:35,170
but he's not,

2326
01:41:35,170 --> 01:41:35,591
you know,

2327
01:41:35,591 --> 01:41:37,540
taking responsibility because,

2328
01:41:39,550 --> 01:41:41,130
because he thinks it's king's fault.

2329
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:43,900
And so this is what he
tells kink essentially.

2330
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:46,780
He says it's a very
interesting use of language.

2331
01:41:46,781 --> 01:41:47,614
He says,

2332
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:50,590
Sin crouches sin by the way,

2333
01:41:50,591 --> 01:41:54,730
that we're needs to draw your
Arrow back and to miss the target.

2334
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,400
It's a very particular kind of work.

2335
01:41:57,520 --> 01:42:00,880
It needs to miss what you're in
rehab or perhaps in a team at all.

2336
01:42:01,250 --> 01:42:05,590
So it implies that perhaps you're aiming
wrong if you don't hit the target right

2337
01:42:06,010 --> 01:42:07,410
and you specify the target.

2338
01:42:07,411 --> 01:42:12,411
So that's an interesting part
of that as well says to Cain,

2339
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:17,760
Sin Crouches at your door like
a predatory sexually aroused cap

2340
01:42:19,510 --> 01:42:21,430
you've invited into your life.

2341
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:26,850
You've opened the door to it and you
voluntarily had your way with it.

2342
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:28,880
And it means that in a sexual manner,

2343
01:42:28,980 --> 01:42:32,560
it's sort of like the old idea that a
vampire can't come into your house on us.

2344
01:42:32,561 --> 01:42:33,460
He would fight it.

2345
01:42:33,910 --> 01:42:34,631
So first of all,

2346
01:42:34,631 --> 01:42:35,830
he tells Kane,

2347
01:42:36,820 --> 01:42:40,750
don't be so sure that it's the structure
of reality that's at fault here.

2348
01:42:41,620 --> 01:42:44,260
Maybe it's something that you're
either doing or not doing.

2349
01:42:44,500 --> 01:42:45,630
And he accuses him directly.

2350
01:42:45,631 --> 01:42:45,911
He says,

2351
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:48,370
not only are you not giving it,

2352
01:42:48,400 --> 01:42:49,420
you're also doing it.

2353
01:42:49,630 --> 01:42:51,150
There's something there that's lurking.

2354
01:42:51,160 --> 01:42:52,120
It's not good.

2355
01:42:52,570 --> 01:42:53,980
You've asked him to come in,

2356
01:42:54,070 --> 01:42:55,720
no way have you asked him to command.

2357
01:42:55,770 --> 01:43:00,770
You made it with it in a creative manner
and you've given birth to something

2358
01:43:01,420 --> 01:43:04,120
horrible as a consequence and you know it.

2359
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,320
And so that's what happens
when you mess with God.

2360
01:43:08,380 --> 01:43:10,420
You find out things that
you don't want to find out.

2361
01:43:11,020 --> 01:43:14,740
And so painting was not very happy
when he started this discussion.

2362
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:16,960
And when he's done with the discussion,

2363
01:43:17,140 --> 01:43:18,730
he's seriously not happy.

2364
01:43:18,731 --> 01:43:21,070
And the story says his countenance fell,

2365
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:25,600
which means that he was
enraged by that answer.

2366
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,750
And no wonder because he's got
the problem that he had before,

2367
01:43:28,751 --> 01:43:30,730
which is that everything's
going to hell around him.

2368
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:34,260
And his brother was
thriving plus go on himself,

2369
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:38,110
just told him that it's completely his
fault and that he knows he's doing it and

2370
01:43:38,111 --> 01:43:39,100
then he chose to do it.

2371
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:40,503
Well,

2372
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:41,740
what's,

2373
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:44,410
what are you going to do
in a situation like that?

2374
01:43:44,770 --> 01:43:45,280
Well,

2375
01:43:45,280 --> 01:43:46,570
you do what people do.

2376
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:50,680
You take a rock and you
killed your brother.

2377
01:43:51,620 --> 01:43:52,453
Right?

2378
01:43:52,790 --> 01:43:53,810
And that's what happens.

2379
01:43:54,100 --> 01:43:54,830
And that's it.

2380
01:43:54,830 --> 01:43:57,890
It's a horrifying story because
it's really the first story.

2381
01:43:59,070 --> 01:44:04,070
And it's a story of Andy and
hatred and murder and worse,

2382
01:44:04,940 --> 01:44:09,940
because what happens then is Katie is
spared by God for complex reasons that we

2383
01:44:10,251 --> 01:44:11,084
won't get into them.

2384
01:44:11,140 --> 01:44:15,170
And then he goes out and has a family
and he has his descendants and one of his

2385
01:44:15,180 --> 01:44:19,460
descendants as Tubal Cade and bulky and
use the first person who makes weapons

2386
01:44:19,461 --> 01:44:20,294
of war.

2387
01:44:20,990 --> 01:44:24,970
So there's this idea that the corruption
of the individual that rips represented

2388
01:44:24,980 --> 01:44:27,200
by Kane is part of the process.

2389
01:44:27,201 --> 01:44:27,950
That,

2390
01:44:27,950 --> 01:44:29,990
so there's more to that.

2391
01:44:30,590 --> 01:44:31,423
So if you,

2392
01:44:32,120 --> 01:44:32,953
if you,

2393
01:44:32,990 --> 01:44:33,890
it's so pain,

2394
01:44:33,891 --> 01:44:35,220
let's say kills you.

2395
01:44:35,890 --> 01:44:40,890
If you insult child and [inaudible]
seven and if you insult Keynes,

2396
01:44:42,051 --> 01:44:42,741
grandchild,

2397
01:44:42,741 --> 01:44:45,150
then he kills 49 to two.

2398
01:44:45,410 --> 01:44:48,080
So there's this idea that
this corrupt process,

2399
01:44:48,081 --> 01:44:50,870
that king part Tolkien
expands exponentially,

2400
01:44:50,871 --> 01:44:55,280
I'll give to the community came judicial
descendant is to Boucane who makes

2401
01:44:55,281 --> 01:44:56,450
weapons of war.

2402
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:57,370
Yeah.

2403
01:44:57,370 --> 01:44:57,641
Right?

2404
01:44:57,641 --> 01:45:02,641
So does this direct line in the story
between the Pauling vengeful nature of

2405
01:45:03,791 --> 01:45:08,140
cane and his jealousy and spite and
refusal to take responsibility for the

2406
01:45:08,141 --> 01:45:12,220
consequences of his actions and
inactions murder and genocide.

2407
01:45:12,580 --> 01:45:14,620
And it's all in like one paragraph.

2408
01:45:14,710 --> 01:45:16,270
It's absolutely overwhelming.

2409
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,940
And the next story is the flood.

2410
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,113
So

2411
01:45:23,990 --> 01:45:27,440
back to the high school shoes,

2412
01:45:28,510 --> 01:45:31,130
they're just acting out
exactly the same old story.

2413
01:45:31,730 --> 01:45:33,770
It's the same thing over and over.

2414
01:45:33,771 --> 01:45:35,380
And that's why these stories are typical.

2415
01:45:35,770 --> 01:45:37,340
It's why we can never forget them.

2416
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:42,670
They always happen and hope we need to
come to understand that I'm just going to

2417
01:45:42,920 --> 01:45:46,790
have some possibility of avoiding
the worst of the catastrophes.

2418
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:48,980
High school shooters,

2419
01:45:49,460 --> 01:45:50,900
people like to call them my kids.

2420
01:45:51,200 --> 01:45:52,970
They wrote down what they did.

2421
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:54,230
No,

2422
01:45:54,230 --> 01:45:55,700
as far as they were concerned,

2423
01:45:56,240 --> 01:45:57,160
they would reject it,

2424
01:45:57,170 --> 01:45:58,340
at least in part.

2425
01:45:58,610 --> 01:45:58,941
You know,

2426
01:45:58,941 --> 01:46:00,260
people make much of that saying,

2427
01:46:00,261 --> 01:46:03,010
well the poor kids who were bullied
and that's why they do prevent,

2428
01:46:03,030 --> 01:46:06,140
just like first of all the
morning stuff and kids.

2429
01:46:06,350 --> 01:46:07,370
Second of all,

2430
01:46:07,430 --> 01:46:11,630
most people are voting and they
don't want to blow up to high school.

2431
01:46:11,631 --> 01:46:13,280
And it wasn't just that they call them.

2432
01:46:13,281 --> 01:46:15,950
My kids wanted to go in there and kill.

2433
01:46:16,190 --> 01:46:19,580
That was only a tiny fraction of what
they were planning in their fantasies.

2434
01:46:19,581 --> 01:46:21,470
They wanted to take out the whole city,

2435
01:46:21,560 --> 01:46:22,460
the entire city.

2436
01:46:22,850 --> 01:46:26,780
They have propane bones plans that
they wanted to make a media spectacle.

2437
01:46:26,781 --> 01:46:28,630
It management quick attracted.

2438
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:32,480
They want to produce as much mayhem
as they possibly could in the shortest

2439
01:46:32,481 --> 01:46:36,080
possible period of time and cap
it off with their own suicide.

2440
01:46:36,110 --> 01:46:40,880
Just to demonstrate how little they
character the damn world and that's the

2441
01:46:40,881 --> 01:46:42,920
motivation behind that sort of thing.

2442
01:46:43,130 --> 01:46:45,350
It's a deep and dark motivation.

2443
01:46:51,210 --> 01:46:55,710
One of the things that's been helpful
to me in studying all of this,

2444
01:46:56,970 --> 01:46:58,170
here's an idea.

2445
01:46:59,010 --> 01:47:01,460
Here's an idea that's expressed,

2446
01:47:01,650 --> 01:47:02,790
Christian symbolism.

2447
01:47:04,290 --> 01:47:08,790
There was an idea that Christ was
crucified before he was taken to heaven,

2448
01:47:08,820 --> 01:47:10,170
had to go to hell.

2449
01:47:10,650 --> 01:47:12,330
That heroin hell let him rise.

2450
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:13,530
It's a mythological idea.

2451
01:47:13,531 --> 01:47:16,870
It's not canonical biblical
idea as far as I'm aware,

2452
01:47:17,520 --> 01:47:18,850
but there's an idea there.

2453
01:47:19,110 --> 01:47:20,440
If you want to move up,

2454
01:47:20,550 --> 01:47:23,100
you have to go down first
and you kind of know this,

2455
01:47:23,101 --> 01:47:23,311
right?

2456
01:47:23,311 --> 01:47:25,470
Because most of the things that
you've learned in your life,

2457
01:47:25,890 --> 01:47:30,890
you've learned the hard way and so most
any culpable increased in wisdom tends

2458
01:47:31,201 --> 01:47:33,170
to come at a sacrificial costs.

2459
01:47:33,550 --> 01:47:33,960
It will,

2460
01:47:33,960 --> 01:47:38,960
you has to die and there's an intermediary
period of chaos and horror and then

2461
01:47:39,241 --> 01:47:43,990
maybe come out of that your
why is it more work together,

2462
01:47:44,050 --> 01:47:45,210
what you paid for it.

2463
01:47:45,870 --> 01:47:46,800
And so

2464
01:47:48,330 --> 01:47:51,800
one of the things that's
being the consequence of
that process for me is that,

2465
01:47:51,810 --> 01:47:52,081
you know,

2466
01:47:52,081 --> 01:47:53,280
I've looked into these,

2467
01:47:53,370 --> 01:47:56,610
this motivation for an atrocity
and I told you what I've included,

2468
01:47:56,850 --> 01:47:58,170
you could make about what you want,

2469
01:47:58,171 --> 01:48:00,690
but it's also done something
very positive for me,

2470
01:48:00,810 --> 01:48:02,910
which is to shed light on something else,

2471
01:48:02,970 --> 01:48:03,803
which is,

2472
01:48:03,900 --> 01:48:07,680
well let's say you can declare this has
to do with the solution of the problem,

2473
01:48:07,710 --> 01:48:11,400
but say you can detail about the problem
and so I need to help out the problem.

2474
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:12,001
If it's,

2475
01:48:12,001 --> 01:48:13,520
if it's detailed out property,

2476
01:48:13,530 --> 01:48:15,620
then there's a solution
that emerges from it.

2477
01:48:15,900 --> 01:48:18,870
If you could identify the
nature of true malevolence,

2478
01:48:18,871 --> 01:48:21,570
then you clarify the
nature of its opposite,

2479
01:48:21,571 --> 01:48:23,130
which is whatever is good.

2480
01:48:24,240 --> 01:48:26,010
And then you can perhaps pursue that.

2481
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:29,440
Perhaps that's how you can straight
the malevolence whatever good is,

2482
01:48:29,441 --> 01:48:30,720
is not what he had.

2483
01:48:30,720 --> 01:48:31,950
It's the opposite of that.

2484
01:48:31,970 --> 01:48:32,940
And some would say,

2485
01:48:33,060 --> 01:48:33,750
well,

2486
01:48:33,750 --> 01:48:34,860
what do you do

2487
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:37,500
instead of trending,

2488
01:48:37,501 --> 01:48:39,630
trending down the path of change.

2489
01:48:41,130 --> 01:48:42,450
And that's that is

2490
01:48:44,700 --> 01:48:49,530
you don't look for the insufficiency of
the world in the structure of the world.

2491
01:48:50,850 --> 01:48:54,390
You look for the insufficiency of
the structure of the world in you.

2492
01:48:55,350 --> 01:48:58,050
If things aren't going
well enough for you,

2493
01:48:58,800 --> 01:49:01,330
then you have some work to
do and you might pay well.

2494
01:49:01,380 --> 01:49:04,920
That's a hell of a thing
happen because the world,

2495
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:09,720
there's a lot to it and it's
a rain against you in some
many ways and there's no

2496
01:49:09,721 --> 01:49:11,340
doubt that that's the case.

2497
01:49:11,910 --> 01:49:12,960
You've got your options.

2498
01:49:12,961 --> 01:49:17,961
You can either pass your catastrophe at
the feet of God and become bitter and

2499
01:49:18,151 --> 01:49:22,530
cruel and resentful and worse as a
constant lines or you can take it upon

2500
01:49:22,531 --> 01:49:26,820
yourself to improve what you improve
and also assume that the same time that

2501
01:49:26,821 --> 01:49:31,710
there's enough to you that you can
actually bench and CSA which regards to

2502
01:49:31,730 --> 01:49:33,180
malevolence itself.

2503
01:49:33,450 --> 01:49:36,660
You can look for that upside of yourself
and there's evidence for it outside of

2504
01:49:36,661 --> 01:49:37,470
yourself,

2505
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:40,710
and then you can go after those
people that you regard as particularly

2506
01:49:40,711 --> 01:49:43,230
malevolent and straighten
the world up that way.

2507
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:45,600
But that's how insurance develop.

2508
01:49:45,870 --> 01:49:46,141
No,

2509
01:49:46,141 --> 01:49:47,850
and there's a better idea,

2510
01:49:47,870 --> 01:49:52,240
which is you might want to
look to yourself first and
see just how much of that

2511
01:49:52,241 --> 01:49:54,190
you can constraint inside yourself.

2512
01:49:54,250 --> 01:49:57,860
Start before you start worrying about how
much of that younger the constraint it

2513
01:49:57,861 --> 01:49:58,694
under people.

2514
01:49:59,230 --> 01:50:03,400
And so that's why you need to send
your house in perfect order before he

2515
01:50:03,401 --> 01:50:04,690
criticized the world.

2516
01:50:04,870 --> 01:50:09,760
Because all of that sounded to me that
unless you want things to go down the

2517
01:50:09,761 --> 01:50:10,594
pathway,

2518
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:14,530
the cane I would go on and the
people still go down constantly.

2519
01:50:14,920 --> 01:50:17,860
There might making
everything worse for them,

2520
01:50:17,861 --> 01:50:18,820
for their families,

2521
01:50:19,120 --> 01:50:19,901
for the community,

2522
01:50:19,901 --> 01:50:20,920
for the world.

2523
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:24,080
You have the alternative of
taking all of that onto yourself,

2524
01:50:24,600 --> 01:50:25,250
right?

2525
01:50:25,250 --> 01:50:26,650
And so that's fine.

2526
01:50:27,280 --> 01:50:31,330
In our most profound
transformative stories,

2527
01:50:31,331 --> 01:50:36,331
let's say the person who revives me
the world is the person who voluntarily

2528
01:50:37,630 --> 01:50:39,310
accepts their own vulnerability.

2529
01:50:39,940 --> 01:50:42,890
That's what's symbolized
by the crucifixion.

2530
01:50:43,720 --> 01:50:47,500
That's why that symbol as
Gregory Poole for 2000 years,

2531
01:50:48,340 --> 01:50:53,340
since the proper pathway is to take on
your mortality as your responsibility.

2532
01:50:55,870 --> 01:50:57,220
And the second is to

2533
01:50:59,400 --> 01:51:00,233
seven.

2534
01:51:04,010 --> 01:51:05,270
How would I put this

2535
01:51:14,570 --> 01:51:19,480
to notice that the temptation that's laid
out by the spirit of malevolence is it

2536
01:51:19,481 --> 01:51:24,481
temptation that you confront that you
have to take responsibility for it and

2537
01:51:24,621 --> 01:51:26,330
then you have to attain victory over?

2538
01:51:26,960 --> 01:51:30,980
It's a psychological drama and that's
the story that sits as the boy and what

2539
01:51:30,981 --> 01:51:35,800
her culture with its emphasis on the
divinity of the individual isn't the

2540
01:51:35,810 --> 01:51:37,280
suffering of the individual.

2541
01:51:37,370 --> 01:51:38,203
It's divine.

2542
01:51:38,390 --> 01:51:40,390
It's not the malevolence
of the individual,

2543
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:41,293
it's divine.

2544
01:51:41,570 --> 01:51:45,580
It's the capacity of the individual in
principle to accept both of those into,

2545
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:46,940
to work for the remediation.

2546
01:51:47,510 --> 01:51:51,360
And that's the story that allows
us our natural rights and our,

2547
01:51:51,740 --> 01:51:55,310
and the responsibility that we have
taught ourselves into our families,

2548
01:51:55,311 --> 01:51:56,180
into the community.

2549
01:51:56,660 --> 01:52:01,510
And it's the acting out of that story
that produces individuals who are helping

2550
01:52:01,511 --> 01:52:02,300
them thrive.

2551
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:06,560
Families that work and surviving in
communities that are integral and don't

2552
01:52:06,561 --> 01:52:08,850
degenerate into something
resembling health.

2553
01:52:09,620 --> 01:52:11,300
And it's important as Carl,

2554
01:52:11,301 --> 01:52:16,301
you don't point it out for us to wake
up because we're so powerful now we need

2555
01:52:18,021 --> 01:52:21,740
to wake up and we need to understand
what it is that we'd be doing right and

2556
01:52:21,750 --> 01:52:26,750
wrong for all of this time
and to implement that as
consciously and clearheaded

2557
01:52:27,351 --> 01:52:32,351
Layton intentively properly as we
possibly can individualize and to see what

2558
01:52:33,831 --> 01:52:35,180
great things might happen.

2559
01:52:35,420 --> 01:52:35,971
How's it going?

2560
01:52:35,971 --> 01:52:37,400
Some points if you did so

2561
01:52:39,770 --> 01:52:44,770
[inaudible]

2562
01:53:02,740 --> 01:53:03,573
it's so

2563
01:53:05,210 --> 01:53:09,650
hard from the stage for a
couple of minutes and they're
going to set it up again

2564
01:53:10,010 --> 01:53:13,910
in a slightly different format and then
I'm going to come out with my laptop and

2565
01:53:13,940 --> 01:53:14,960
you've all provided.

2566
01:53:15,020 --> 01:53:16,590
Many of you have provided the questions.

2567
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:21,290
We're going to spend half an hour with
the questions and the answers that will

2568
01:53:21,291 --> 01:53:22,730
bring the evening to a close.

2569
01:53:23,300 --> 01:53:23,680
Thank you.

2570
01:53:23,680 --> 01:53:28,680
[inaudible]

2571
01:54:00,630 --> 01:54:01,463
wonderful.

2572
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:02,910
Standing on

2573
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:06,713
your shoulders back

2574
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:17,800
a little bit for some of the questions
that you guys had already submitted.

2575
01:54:26,780 --> 01:54:27,613
The

2576
01:54:29,230 --> 01:54:31,290
sewer is amazing,

2577
01:54:31,690 --> 01:54:33,340
just it's incredible.

2578
01:54:33,590 --> 01:54:35,570
It's exceeded all our expectations.

2579
01:54:36,590 --> 01:54:38,160
This is now the fifth show.

2580
01:54:38,380 --> 01:54:39,213
Uh,

2581
01:54:39,470 --> 01:54:44,470
currently scheduled 40 shows us
also going to London next week.

2582
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:47,570
We are adding shows all the time.

2583
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:47,901
Uh,

2584
01:54:47,901 --> 01:54:50,770
they've been adding cities
or returning to this.

2585
01:54:50,780 --> 01:54:53,590
He said they sent a sold very well.

2586
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:57,120
We sold out all by shows
and every night is,

2587
01:54:57,470 --> 01:54:59,210
his presentation has been different.

2588
01:54:59,720 --> 01:55:01,730
It's been a different subject matter.

2589
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:05,030
So if you want to return to some shows
in the future that they're going to be

2590
01:55:05,031 --> 01:55:05,864
very different.

2591
01:55:09,830 --> 01:55:13,100
He is so inclusive.

2592
01:55:13,490 --> 01:55:14,790
It doesn't cross the aisles.

2593
01:55:14,800 --> 01:55:16,130
It crosses oceans.

2594
01:55:16,131 --> 01:55:19,640
We had people here from Russia
and community shows already.

2595
01:55:19,641 --> 01:55:20,474
Just the first slide.

2596
01:55:20,480 --> 01:55:21,313
China,

2597
01:55:21,350 --> 01:55:22,183
Japan,

2598
01:55:22,430 --> 01:55:23,031
uh,

2599
01:55:23,031 --> 01:55:23,990
of course Canada.

2600
01:55:24,220 --> 01:55:24,590
How many,

2601
01:55:24,590 --> 01:55:25,790
many Canadians here tonight.

2602
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:32,873
Uh,

2603
01:55:33,790 --> 01:55:34,623
it,

2604
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:42,920
I really do like it and we're
just seeing the beginning of a,

2605
01:55:43,220 --> 01:55:46,750
the positive nature of it and
the healthy and I'm sure a a lot.

2606
01:55:46,770 --> 01:55:47,603
You'd be home.

2607
01:55:47,610 --> 01:55:51,300
We'll continue to bring in a lot of other
people in the states around the world.

2608
01:55:51,980 --> 01:55:52,813
It's just amazing,

2609
01:55:53,490 --> 01:55:55,530
except the book trade is
going to translate as well.

2610
01:55:55,750 --> 01:55:56,570
Uh,

2611
01:55:56,570 --> 01:55:57,650
someone was in our minds,

2612
01:55:57,700 --> 01:55:58,890
seven countries in the Arabic,

2613
01:55:58,891 --> 01:56:00,690
so it will be everywhere.

2614
01:56:00,850 --> 01:56:01,050
Uh,

2615
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:01,883
various,

2616
01:56:02,510 --> 01:56:03,210
uh,

2617
01:56:03,210 --> 01:56:03,940
okay.

2618
01:56:03,940 --> 01:56:04,500
Uh,

2619
01:56:04,500 --> 01:56:06,720
what he's made to sit down and
you're ready to start with the Q and.

2620
01:56:06,721 --> 01:56:07,554
A and again,

2621
01:56:07,650 --> 01:56:10,860
please welcome back to the
stage Dr. Jordan Peterson.

2622
01:56:11,120 --> 01:56:16,120
[inaudible].

2623
01:56:36,310 --> 01:56:37,590
All right,

2624
01:56:40,720 --> 01:56:41,553
so

2625
01:56:52,660 --> 01:56:57,280
how long a person go about finding
your calling purpose or passion?

2626
01:56:58,360 --> 01:56:58,511
Well,

2627
01:56:58,511 --> 01:56:59,920
are you going to say bagging?

2628
01:57:00,570 --> 01:57:01,403
Um,

2629
01:57:02,110 --> 01:57:03,490
because what the hell do you know?

2630
01:57:05,340 --> 01:57:08,230
I agree being a technical as well.

2631
01:57:09,730 --> 01:57:13,290
So I have this program called
the cell phones program.

2632
01:57:14,160 --> 01:57:19,160
Its components is the future authoring
programs and it asks people to consider

2633
01:57:20,411 --> 01:57:24,010
their lives deeply and to
develop a vision and a strategy.

2634
01:57:24,640 --> 01:57:27,730
And it's not an easy,

2635
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:31,570
did have someone who
hasn't been encouraged,

2636
01:57:31,571 --> 01:57:35,110
let's say self position because
they're non practice data.

2637
01:57:35,980 --> 01:57:36,431
People say,

2638
01:57:36,431 --> 01:57:38,260
well I don't know what I should be doing.

2639
01:57:38,620 --> 01:57:39,070
It's like,

2640
01:57:39,070 --> 01:57:39,610
well,

2641
01:57:39,610 --> 01:57:39,911
you know,

2642
01:57:39,911 --> 01:57:41,530
some things she shouldn't be doing.

2643
01:57:41,531 --> 01:57:42,730
So that's a good start.

2644
01:57:42,731 --> 01:57:46,120
And I don't mean that in
the most practical manner.

2645
01:57:46,150 --> 01:57:47,140
If you don't know what to do,

2646
01:57:47,141 --> 01:57:50,710
you could start by stopping doing all
the stupid things that you're doing that

2647
01:57:50,711 --> 01:57:51,610
you know are stupid.

2648
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:54,880
And that's a good start because
it starts to clear your vision.

2649
01:57:55,570 --> 01:57:56,403
So if you,

2650
01:57:56,650 --> 01:57:58,270
if you don't know what to do,

2651
01:57:58,570 --> 01:58:01,400
but I do know that you're doing things
that you're ashamed of and that you

2652
01:58:01,401 --> 01:58:02,410
regret.

2653
01:58:02,590 --> 01:58:07,590
You could start by just eliminating
employed by one and slowly given it to the

2654
01:58:08,381 --> 01:58:09,700
best of your ability.

2655
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:11,570
And then as you're,

2656
01:58:11,610 --> 01:58:14,590
and so that's really a vendor is starting
to become disciplined to false of

2657
01:58:14,591 --> 01:58:15,411
ethical rules,

2658
01:58:15,411 --> 01:58:15,611
some,

2659
01:58:15,611 --> 01:58:20,200
some set of ethical rules with any logic
to follow a set of ethical rules long

2660
01:58:20,201 --> 01:58:20,471
enough,

2661
01:58:20,471 --> 01:58:21,670
then you'll get disciplined enough.

2662
01:58:21,671 --> 01:58:25,420
So you'll start to have a clearer vision
and then you might be able to see the

2663
01:58:25,421 --> 01:58:30,421
way forward for you might see a way
forward port for intensity rather than

2664
01:58:31,961 --> 01:58:33,400
merely what you should avoid.

2665
01:58:33,430 --> 01:58:35,440
So that's a good initial practical issue.

2666
01:58:35,441 --> 01:58:36,470
It's about,

2667
01:58:36,650 --> 01:58:40,410
because everyone knows you know perfectly
well that there are things you're

2668
01:58:40,420 --> 01:58:42,180
doing that you know you shouldn't do it,

2669
01:58:42,940 --> 01:58:44,360
but you don't stop,

2670
01:58:46,960 --> 01:58:47,890
start stopping

2671
01:58:49,470 --> 01:58:54,470
because part of this idea about putting
your house in perfect order before you

2672
01:58:55,061 --> 01:58:56,290
criticize the world,

2673
01:58:56,320 --> 01:58:57,280
because there's a question,

2674
01:58:57,281 --> 01:58:58,120
it's always open.

2675
01:58:58,740 --> 01:58:59,310
And as far as,

2676
01:58:59,310 --> 01:59:00,190
this is the question,

2677
01:59:00,191 --> 01:59:00,761
so to speak,

2678
01:59:00,761 --> 01:59:02,470
that God placed in front of cake.

2679
01:59:02,471 --> 01:59:03,304
It's like,

2680
01:59:03,490 --> 01:59:03,641
well,

2681
01:59:03,641 --> 01:59:06,010
how do you know the world would be a
terrific place if he weren't such a

2682
01:59:06,011 --> 01:59:06,970
wretched thing?

2683
01:59:08,200 --> 01:59:09,280
Maybe it wouldn't be.

2684
01:59:10,720 --> 01:59:11,201
He might say,

2685
01:59:11,201 --> 01:59:11,321
well,

2686
01:59:11,321 --> 01:59:12,580
that's a pretty casual answer.

2687
01:59:12,620 --> 01:59:16,210
Would you say to people who has a parent
who's dying with Alzheimer's disease

2688
01:59:16,211 --> 01:59:16,871
for example?

2689
01:59:16,871 --> 01:59:19,570
It's like whether you can get their act
together and he's going to fix that,

2690
01:59:19,571 --> 01:59:22,510
looks like it would make it a hell
of a lot better than it wouldn't be

2691
01:59:22,511 --> 01:59:23,021
otherwise.

2692
01:59:23,021 --> 01:59:24,160
I can tell you that.

2693
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:28,240
And that's something because it's bad
enough to have someone who's dead deal and

2694
01:59:28,270 --> 01:59:32,290
your family without having an incredibly
amount of unnecessary pathology

2695
01:59:32,291 --> 01:59:35,970
gathered around that and make something
that could be merely tragic into

2696
01:59:35,980 --> 01:59:37,390
something that's outright hell.

2697
01:59:38,000 --> 01:59:39,730
And that happens to people all the time.

2698
01:59:40,420 --> 01:59:44,740
And so even if it's
not a perfect solution,

2699
01:59:44,741 --> 01:59:46,510
is the best solution that you have.

2700
01:59:46,960 --> 01:59:51,220
And then the next part of that is when
I suggest to people that they do the

2701
01:59:51,221 --> 01:59:53,590
future authoring program and they're,

2702
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:55,510
they're leery about doing it.

2703
01:59:56,740 --> 02:00:01,740
I asked them to do it bad because a
bad plan is waving the didn't know plan

2704
02:00:04,060 --> 02:00:09,060
because if you implemented that plan
then you learn why ain't you that plan.

2705
02:00:09,400 --> 02:00:10,040
Exactly.

2706
02:00:10,040 --> 02:00:14,200
Not Hypothetically but exactly in
New Orleans and then in and use that

2707
02:00:14,201 --> 02:00:18,760
information above her failure
to retool the better acquire.

2708
02:00:18,820 --> 02:00:21,080
And so the English men pageant,

2709
02:00:21,081 --> 02:00:21,350
you're,

2710
02:00:21,350 --> 02:00:23,010
you're tracking the destination,

2711
02:00:23,011 --> 02:00:23,591
it's moving,

2712
02:00:23,591 --> 02:00:26,810
there's some kind of ideal
in your vision is blurry,

2713
02:00:26,811 --> 02:00:30,160
they don't know where to look so you're
going to go this way and then you can go

2714
02:00:30,161 --> 02:00:30,740
that way.

2715
02:00:30,740 --> 02:00:31,810
We can go this way.

2716
02:00:31,840 --> 02:00:35,950
But if you keep doing that then the
deviations from the right path agreed to

2717
02:00:35,951 --> 02:00:40,450
decrease with time and eventually you'll
be walking forward in an efficient

2718
02:00:40,451 --> 02:00:44,470
manner and you might have to get all
sorts of errors before you manage that.

2719
02:00:44,620 --> 02:00:48,400
But I watched people long enough in my
clinical practice to know that waiting

2720
02:00:48,401 --> 02:00:53,260
for Godot and a very bad idea and
non growing up as a very bad idea.

2721
02:00:53,261 --> 02:00:55,670
It's like implement the
best plan that has to happen

2722
02:00:57,280 --> 02:01:02,260
and learn from and that works and you
get sharper at making your planets.

2723
02:01:02,830 --> 02:01:06,400
And then the other thing that we do in
the future of your program does what we

2724
02:01:06,401 --> 02:01:06,911
ask people,

2725
02:01:06,911 --> 02:01:11,911
well maybe you can't decide what your
passion or your calling should be.

2726
02:01:12,790 --> 02:01:14,470
That's a pretty global question.

2727
02:01:15,430 --> 02:01:18,910
But you might ask yourself
some questions like,

2728
02:01:19,570 --> 02:01:23,530
well is there something you could do
to improve your intimate relationship?

2729
02:01:24,130 --> 02:01:24,761
One thing,

2730
02:01:24,761 --> 02:01:28,090
is there a way that you can
improve your friendships?

2731
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:31,930
Is there something you can do at your
job that would make it better than it is

2732
02:01:31,990 --> 02:01:32,710
now?

2733
02:01:32,710 --> 02:01:34,420
Even if it's something incremental,

2734
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:38,920
could you do something more productive
and meaningful with your time outside of,

2735
02:01:39,590 --> 02:01:40,100
could you be

2736
02:01:40,100 --> 02:01:43,870
slightly better at handling
temptations that come your way?

2737
02:01:44,480 --> 02:01:46,930
Could you take care of herself somewhat?

2738
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:48,470
You better be mentally and physically.

2739
02:01:48,860 --> 02:01:51,260
But you know the answers to all
of those questions is Jeffery.

2740
02:01:51,290 --> 02:01:51,630
Yeah.

2741
02:01:51,630 --> 02:01:54,680
So then you can even ask
themselves a simpler question,

2742
02:01:55,370 --> 02:01:56,360
which would be,

2743
02:01:56,520 --> 02:01:56,690
well,

2744
02:01:56,690 --> 02:02:00,650
if there is something that you could do
that would make one post things better,

2745
02:02:00,680 --> 02:02:03,490
is there also something they wouldn't do?

2746
02:02:04,390 --> 02:02:06,320
And then you can ask yourself that,

2747
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:06,960
you know,

2748
02:02:06,960 --> 02:02:08,960
instead of telling
yourself that you should,

2749
02:02:08,961 --> 02:02:10,620
which is the same thing,

2750
02:02:10,710 --> 02:02:11,151
might say,

2751
02:02:11,151 --> 02:02:15,080
well I would like my marriage
because you said you ask yourself,

2752
02:02:15,081 --> 02:02:16,440
well how can my marriage be better?

2753
02:02:16,640 --> 02:02:20,120
And you'll get a bunch of answers and
most of you will like because if you

2754
02:02:20,121 --> 02:02:22,400
really ask yourself a question like that,

2755
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:23,421
the part of our brain,

2756
02:02:23,421 --> 02:02:24,490
this is management doesn't,

2757
02:02:24,540 --> 02:02:25,670
it's looking for new answers,

2758
02:02:25,671 --> 02:02:26,650
will tell you.

2759
02:02:26,710 --> 02:02:29,570
And then we'll tell you a bunch of
things you don't want to hear and Lord of

2760
02:02:29,571 --> 02:02:31,400
them won't be things you already know.

2761
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:34,400
And some of what we think speakers
just no damn way you we get to know,

2762
02:02:34,401 --> 02:02:35,330
you know that you should.

2763
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:36,511
But some,

2764
02:02:36,511 --> 02:02:40,820
some said that those might be things that
you should do that by your definition

2765
02:02:40,880 --> 02:02:42,920
that you actually would do.

2766
02:02:43,010 --> 02:02:45,950
It might be trivial or books or guilt,

2767
02:02:46,030 --> 02:02:50,840
but at least a step in the right direction
so he would never step in the right

2768
02:02:50,841 --> 02:02:51,321
direction.

2769
02:02:51,321 --> 02:02:56,321
You're willing to take day by day
and that's incremental progress.

2770
02:02:57,090 --> 02:02:58,460
It'll spiral.

2771
02:02:59,530 --> 02:03:00,510
It goes firewall,

2772
02:03:00,570 --> 02:03:02,150
and there's a stake in the New Testament,

2773
02:03:02,190 --> 02:03:03,980
which actually happens
to be true statement,

2774
02:03:03,981 --> 02:03:08,920
which is to those who have everything
more will be given and it's a,

2775
02:03:08,930 --> 02:03:11,750
it's a reflection of his
underlying phenomenon.

2776
02:03:12,320 --> 02:03:12,851
Phenomenon.

2777
02:03:12,851 --> 02:03:14,580
It looks like the natural law schools,

2778
02:03:14,581 --> 02:03:17,060
it's as things start to recruit to you,

2779
02:03:17,210 --> 02:03:19,200
the rate at which they need further,

2780
02:03:19,201 --> 02:03:21,050
the crew will increase.

2781
02:03:21,400 --> 02:03:23,130
That's a natural law school price.

2782
02:03:23,131 --> 02:03:25,680
As long as sometimes great opens,

2783
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:27,620
it reflect or just confusion.

2784
02:03:27,621 --> 02:03:31,330
So there's a chapter promos for polite,

2785
02:03:31,340 --> 02:03:32,173
calm down.

2786
02:03:32,720 --> 02:03:34,100
Don't compare yourself.

2787
02:03:34,190 --> 02:03:36,200
Compare yourself and
who you were yesterday,

2788
02:03:36,201 --> 02:03:38,330
not someone else's today.

2789
02:03:38,510 --> 02:03:40,790
And it's a new junction for
incremental improvement.

2790
02:03:41,030 --> 02:03:42,210
If you don't know where to go,

2791
02:03:42,211 --> 02:03:43,044
when you like,

2792
02:03:43,180 --> 02:03:46,370
think about where you are and
see if today you could make,

2793
02:03:46,430 --> 02:03:50,510
where do you want somewhat better when
something is so that when you go to bed

2794
02:03:50,511 --> 02:03:51,170
at night,

2795
02:03:51,170 --> 02:03:54,080
you're not asking Richard as you
were when you woke up in the morning.

2796
02:03:54,690 --> 02:03:57,050
And so if you do that for two years,

2797
02:03:57,490 --> 02:03:59,720
you know what do you make
it a just a small thing,

2798
02:03:59,721 --> 02:04:01,780
something you could actually
do that you wouldn't do,

2799
02:04:02,030 --> 02:04:06,140
then your life will be waiting here and
at the end of that you might have enough

2800
02:04:06,141 --> 02:04:10,280
clarity of mind to start to understand
where you would go if things worked out

2801
02:04:10,281 --> 02:04:11,450
for you across the world.

2802
02:04:12,320 --> 02:04:14,840
So that's the answer.

2803
02:04:23,410 --> 02:04:24,243
Okay.

2804
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:29,410
How do we encourage others to fix
themselves as they reduce personal

2805
02:04:29,411 --> 02:04:34,411
responsibility or blame idiot lords with
Ruth the system for all their trouble

2806
02:04:35,200 --> 02:04:36,160
by example.

2807
02:04:37,380 --> 02:04:38,970
That's the best way to do it.

2808
02:04:39,300 --> 02:04:41,860
You know there's another
new of injunction,

2809
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:43,033
rather harsh

2810
02:04:45,930 --> 02:04:46,711
don't cows.

2811
02:04:46,711 --> 02:04:50,790
Pearls will force one and took me a
long time to understand that because he

2812
02:04:50,791 --> 02:04:52,140
really is a harsh statement.

2813
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:53,730
But here's the,

2814
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:54,810
here's the gist of it.

2815
02:04:55,410 --> 02:04:57,580
If you're talking to someone
and they're not distinct,

2816
02:04:57,600 --> 02:04:58,650
you should shut up.

2817
02:05:00,230 --> 02:05:02,120
It's really hard thing to
learn because you think,

2818
02:05:02,121 --> 02:05:02,410
man,

2819
02:05:02,410 --> 02:05:03,720
I just keep telling this person,

2820
02:05:03,721 --> 02:05:05,280
they'll listen if I no they won't.

2821
02:05:05,490 --> 02:05:07,350
They're shelf will just get harder.

2822
02:05:07,410 --> 02:05:09,060
And so here's what's happening.

2823
02:05:09,061 --> 02:05:10,920
If you're talking to someone
and they're not listening,

2824
02:05:11,610 --> 02:05:13,230
you are not receiving thinks you are.

2825
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:15,600
That's why they're not listening.

2826
02:05:15,720 --> 02:05:17,910
You're actually wrong
in a local situation.

2827
02:05:17,970 --> 02:05:19,260
Now they might also be wrong,

2828
02:05:19,261 --> 02:05:21,060
but what are you going to do about that?

2829
02:05:21,840 --> 02:05:23,410
But you could show me wrong.

2830
02:05:23,640 --> 02:05:25,740
And so if you try a couple of times,

2831
02:05:25,950 --> 02:05:29,070
say you were telling me some things to
a family member for their own good and

2832
02:05:29,071 --> 02:05:31,830
maybe you actually are and maybe it's
for their own good and maybe they should

2833
02:05:31,831 --> 02:05:33,840
listen and maybe you're right
and all of those things,

2834
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:38,770
but they're not busy and he told him like
six times or nothing's out put telling

2835
02:05:38,771 --> 02:05:40,740
me it isn't working.

2836
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:43,740
The problem isn't the
problem you think it is.

2837
02:05:43,890 --> 02:05:45,450
That's why your approach is working.

2838
02:05:45,840 --> 02:05:47,940
And so one of the things you could
do with a situation like that,

2839
02:05:47,941 --> 02:05:48,660
it's quick,

2840
02:05:48,660 --> 02:05:49,980
just quit doing it.

2841
02:05:50,030 --> 02:05:53,790
And I would say pull back
from the person and watch.

2842
02:05:54,270 --> 02:05:55,320
Don't offer them anything.

2843
02:05:55,321 --> 02:05:56,890
Don't tell them your wisdom,

2844
02:05:56,970 --> 02:05:58,230
give them any advice,

2845
02:05:58,440 --> 02:05:59,760
tell him anything about yourself.

2846
02:06:00,330 --> 02:06:02,180
Just watch and listen.

2847
02:06:02,690 --> 02:06:05,040
If you do that for like a year,

2848
02:06:05,610 --> 02:06:08,330
they will tell you what's
wrong with them and case.

2849
02:06:09,240 --> 02:06:13,500
But that will only happen if you
prick casting pearls before swine.

2850
02:06:14,250 --> 02:06:14,761
And then you say,

2851
02:06:14,761 --> 02:06:14,881
well,

2852
02:06:14,881 --> 02:06:17,880
let's say you have someone in your
family just absolutely intractable,

2853
02:06:17,881 --> 02:06:21,090
they're just not changing and nothing
you can do is going to fix that.

2854
02:06:21,091 --> 02:06:22,620
And that's unbelievably common.

2855
02:06:23,030 --> 02:06:24,900
So like what can you do?

2856
02:06:24,990 --> 02:06:29,730
Well maybe not because people have a
guesstimate and there's might be that and

2857
02:06:29,731 --> 02:06:32,190
you might not be the person who
could do anything about that.

2858
02:06:32,490 --> 02:06:35,640
And so you don't want to destroy yourself.

2859
02:06:35,700 --> 02:06:38,840
You know how you approach
someone who's drumming,

2860
02:06:39,030 --> 02:06:40,070
the panicking,

2861
02:06:40,740 --> 02:06:42,210
you approach the lift your foot up,

2862
02:06:42,510 --> 02:06:47,100
swimming this way towards
and you do that because,

2863
02:06:47,101 --> 02:06:49,560
and you tell them you have
to stop panicking or I'm up.

2864
02:06:49,561 --> 02:06:50,580
Or the risk of VTE.

2865
02:06:51,330 --> 02:06:54,420
And the reason is because drunk
people is not better than one.

2866
02:06:55,200 --> 02:06:56,730
And you don't have to
tell them that recently.

2867
02:06:56,820 --> 02:06:57,653
But you could

2868
02:06:59,880 --> 02:07:04,880
if there's someone that you did with is
attracted or sacrificing yourself and

2869
02:07:05,701 --> 02:07:08,250
also being part of that
attracted the problem.

2870
02:07:08,280 --> 02:07:09,540
It's not helpful.

2871
02:07:10,380 --> 02:07:15,380
So you do what you can and you live by
example and maybe if the person has any

2872
02:07:17,010 --> 02:07:22,010
chance they watch you and maybe they
have to watch it for 10 years and they

2873
02:07:22,501 --> 02:07:24,570
learn or they fail to learn,

2874
02:07:24,870 --> 02:07:27,060
in which case you've done it again.

2875
02:07:28,320 --> 02:07:29,730
And that's how it is.

2876
02:07:31,740 --> 02:07:32,720
So he's his function.

2877
02:07:32,721 --> 02:07:33,840
It's sound

2878
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:39,920
[inaudible]

2879
02:07:45,350 --> 02:07:48,760
on the 17 year old girl.

2880
02:07:52,590 --> 02:07:54,090
Well maybe it is,

2881
02:07:54,091 --> 02:07:55,320
but I don't think it is.

2882
02:07:55,920 --> 02:07:56,830
So you know,

2883
02:07:56,920 --> 02:07:59,640
there's this idea that the only
people who are listening to me or,

2884
02:07:59,641 --> 02:08:00,840
hey Barry white men

2885
02:08:06,730 --> 02:08:11,730
[inaudible]

2886
02:08:17,480 --> 02:08:18,500
as far as I'm concerned,

2887
02:08:18,740 --> 02:08:20,740
and this is just so observes the,

2888
02:08:21,620 --> 02:08:25,400
I can't believe that this is easy to
become controversial and talking to people

2889
02:08:25,401 --> 02:08:30,401
about taking responsibility for the state
of the world onto themselves and the

2890
02:08:31,550 --> 02:08:32,940
radical leftist identity.

2891
02:08:32,960 --> 02:08:33,771
All it politics.

2892
02:08:33,771 --> 02:08:37,940
Any alarms can only do this through the
lens of the radical left has an identity

2893
02:08:37,941 --> 02:08:42,941
politics instead of noticing that this
isn't a political issue except that I

2894
02:08:43,281 --> 02:08:46,200
don't like the radical leftists
and their restrictions on pricing.

2895
02:08:46,270 --> 02:08:51,270
Thanks [inaudible].

2896
02:08:57,330 --> 02:08:58,163
For me,

2897
02:08:59,620 --> 02:09:00,453
it's,

2898
02:09:00,580 --> 02:09:05,580
it's boundaries for politicians just
started the new things that they don't get

2899
02:09:05,971 --> 02:09:10,971
to do it stepping [inaudible] realm or
these fits into the theological realm and

2900
02:09:11,911 --> 02:09:13,830
they should stay the hell out of the bowl.

2901
02:09:14,030 --> 02:09:19,030
[inaudible]

2902
02:09:21,730 --> 02:09:22,380
you're,

2903
02:09:22,380 --> 02:09:24,170
you're no longer where you should.

2904
02:09:24,370 --> 02:09:28,160
You've transformed yourself into
a target and not a good time.

2905
02:09:28,390 --> 02:09:29,790
Not that there is a good content.

2906
02:09:30,310 --> 02:09:34,740
So now the consequences are harvest

2907
02:09:36,280 --> 02:09:39,470
because I've been objected to that.

2908
02:09:39,650 --> 02:09:39,930
Oh,

2909
02:09:39,930 --> 02:09:41,920
separately him with a
fair degree of success,

2910
02:09:44,890 --> 02:09:46,510
the only response that can be mounted,

2911
02:09:46,511 --> 02:09:47,400
listen to this monster,

2912
02:09:47,610 --> 02:09:48,980
is this within two,

2913
02:09:49,030 --> 02:09:50,080
maybe conceptualizations.

2914
02:09:50,081 --> 02:09:51,880
I've got them identity politics.

2915
02:09:51,940 --> 02:09:52,571
So it,

2916
02:09:52,571 --> 02:09:53,800
since I'm objecting to that,

2917
02:09:53,801 --> 02:09:56,770
then I must be the reprehensible engine.

2918
02:09:57,090 --> 02:09:57,430
It's like,

2919
02:09:57,430 --> 02:09:58,240
well,

2920
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,120
good luck the facts.

2921
02:09:59,840 --> 02:10:02,560
It's not going to work out
because that is what's going on.

2922
02:10:02,830 --> 02:10:05,500
So and so to the 17 year old girl.

2923
02:10:05,530 --> 02:10:06,280
It's like,

2924
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:10,000
who knows how many 17 year old girls
are paid attention to what I'm saying on

2925
02:10:10,001 --> 02:10:10,780
aging?

2926
02:10:10,780 --> 02:10:12,580
I would say it's in the tens of thousands,

2927
02:10:12,700 --> 02:10:14,380
perhaps hundreds of thousands.

2928
02:10:14,381 --> 02:10:16,810
And so the mere fact that
that isn't the story,

2929
02:10:16,820 --> 02:10:21,820
that a small subsection of the ideological
he committed popular media is telling

2930
02:10:23,571 --> 02:10:23,980
him to serve.

2931
02:10:23,980 --> 02:10:27,190
By no means all of them by any stretch
of the imagination does feed it's

2932
02:10:27,250 --> 02:10:28,220
economically true.

2933
02:10:28,750 --> 02:10:31,330
So now we might be rare.

2934
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:33,650
Statistically speaking for olds,

2935
02:10:33,800 --> 02:10:34,633
listen to me,

2936
02:10:35,520 --> 02:10:37,790
I give ever served them all the time.

2937
02:10:38,180 --> 02:10:40,070
More power to in as far as I'm concerned,

2938
02:10:40,071 --> 02:10:41,900
it's a complicated message.

2939
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:47,000
The lectures are very sophisticated and
difficult and it's great that if you're,

2940
02:10:47,020 --> 02:10:49,730
if you happen to find that your
interest is captured by them,

2941
02:10:49,900 --> 02:10:51,260
then there's something to that.

2942
02:10:51,920 --> 02:10:53,480
What advice would I have for teens?

2943
02:10:53,481 --> 02:10:55,970
Like you do what you think's right,

2944
02:10:56,000 --> 02:10:56,833
Kiddo.

2945
02:10:57,410 --> 02:11:02,410
[inaudible]

2946
02:11:08,020 --> 02:11:08,970
in 12 rules.

2947
02:11:08,971 --> 02:11:12,480
You mentioned that people can go this
quit your teaching to be hell to pay.

2948
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:14,250
I think I noticed why,

2949
02:11:14,260 --> 02:11:15,570
but say why.

2950
02:11:16,430 --> 02:11:17,263
Well,

2951
02:11:18,510 --> 02:11:23,510
I read a lot of critiques of Carl Young
and he's often accused of doing all of

2952
02:11:23,701 --> 02:11:26,000
the malicious things like start to help.

2953
02:11:26,010 --> 02:11:26,843
For example.

2954
02:11:27,060 --> 02:11:27,810
Are you talking about man,

2955
02:11:27,810 --> 02:11:28,600
one of those critiques,

2956
02:11:28,600 --> 02:11:31,110
I thought you actually
understood what he was up to.

2957
02:11:31,970 --> 02:11:34,920
What you're doing is like accusing
ambassador of chain walking.

2958
02:11:36,240 --> 02:11:41,210
What he was doing was so valuable
that like starting a health that's,

2959
02:11:41,640 --> 02:11:43,710
that's not even in the
same conceptual universe.

2960
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:47,480
Partly where you'll get to starting
to do is to put the metaphysical

2961
02:11:47,560 --> 02:11:48,410
substructure back.

2962
02:11:48,411 --> 02:11:52,220
I'm in Western civilization
and to the degree that I'm,

2963
02:11:52,420 --> 02:11:53,051
I'm just still,

2964
02:11:53,051 --> 02:11:56,340
but he was up doing to development to
something green can be communicated

2965
02:11:56,341 --> 02:11:57,174
effectively.

2966
02:11:57,210 --> 02:12:00,780
Then there's also what I've been trying
to do for 30 years and I'd be trying to

2967
02:12:00,781 --> 02:12:04,260
do it because I studied what I told you
I was studying at the beginning of this

2968
02:12:04,261 --> 02:12:05,094
tall.

2969
02:12:05,160 --> 02:12:08,490
I looked at the worst things that I
see that people were capable of doing.

2970
02:12:08,760 --> 02:12:12,540
And I look at them for a very long time
and I tried to understand why they were

2971
02:12:12,541 --> 02:12:15,930
doing and then and they me.

2972
02:12:16,770 --> 02:12:19,110
And then I tried to figure
out what the alternative was.

2973
02:12:20,340 --> 02:12:23,640
And so I'd be laying on an alternative
because that's what we need to learn for

2974
02:12:23,641 --> 02:12:24,960
what happened in the 20th century.

2975
02:12:25,260 --> 02:12:28,880
We need to learn the alternative to
what happened in the Soviet Union.

2976
02:12:29,240 --> 02:12:31,830
And we need to learn the alternative
to what happened in Nazi Germany.

2977
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:35,070
And listen what happened
in Nazi Germany to have,

2978
02:12:35,120 --> 02:12:36,480
and again on this,

2979
02:12:36,481 --> 02:12:39,600
we want what happened in the
Soviet Union to happen again.

2980
02:12:39,780 --> 02:12:43,140
We need to learn are less and so,

2981
02:12:43,180 --> 02:12:45,330
and the lesson is an individual lesson,

2982
02:12:45,331 --> 02:12:46,350
not an elective list.

2983
02:12:46,740 --> 02:12:49,650
And I believe this to
be empirically the case.

2984
02:12:50,160 --> 02:12:54,480
Why is this commentators that I grabbed
on Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union

2985
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:56,340
have all come to the same conclusion.

2986
02:12:56,910 --> 02:13:01,110
The reason those tyrannies could exist
and maintain yourselves and then do the

2987
02:13:01,111 --> 02:13:05,060
murderous things that they did was
because the individuals that compose those

2988
02:13:05,061 --> 02:13:07,350
societies rejected their moral,

2989
02:13:07,440 --> 02:13:11,700
individual moral responsibility and
allowing those to test case to take place.

2990
02:13:11,940 --> 02:13:13,560
And I believe that to be the case.

2991
02:13:13,650 --> 02:13:15,000
I take what you got west.

2992
02:13:15,060 --> 02:13:19,860
What we got right in the West is the
idea of that the political system,

2993
02:13:20,100 --> 02:13:21,210
the economic system,

2994
02:13:21,211 --> 02:13:22,290
the familial system,

2995
02:13:22,470 --> 02:13:25,320
all of that rests on your shoulders.

2996
02:13:25,500 --> 02:13:27,600
You're corruption corrupts everything.

2997
02:13:28,330 --> 02:13:31,080
You're [inaudible] and that's a terrible,

2998
02:13:31,670 --> 02:13:34,260
but it also something that
gives you some to take to.

2999
02:13:34,350 --> 02:13:36,390
It turns out that you are,

3000
02:13:36,620 --> 02:13:38,110
or you might say,

3001
02:13:38,990 --> 02:13:42,830
well that's all I ever wanted to know
that I'm important that I haven't put rule

3002
02:13:42,840 --> 02:13:43,450
delights like,

3003
02:13:43,450 --> 02:13:44,150
yeah,

3004
02:13:44,150 --> 02:13:47,510
you better think that
through because there's,

3005
02:13:47,550 --> 02:13:49,140
there's two ways this works.

3006
02:13:49,350 --> 02:13:52,650
Either you're a Dusko and everything
you do is meaningless and who the hell

3007
02:13:52,651 --> 02:13:53,220
cares?

3008
02:13:53,220 --> 02:13:57,740
What difference is it going to make it a
million years or everything you do not.

3009
02:13:57,990 --> 02:13:59,220
And when you make a mistake,

3010
02:13:59,250 --> 02:14:03,300
everything shapes and that's
how you make a mistake.

3011
02:14:03,480 --> 02:14:03,970
Everything

3012
02:14:03,970 --> 02:14:08,970
[inaudible]

3013
02:14:14,160 --> 02:14:14,811
guilty about it.

3014
02:14:14,811 --> 02:14:19,100
If that wasn't the case and you do feel
talking about at that guiltless counter

3015
02:14:19,101 --> 02:14:23,130
escape from that killed except by
stopping stopping those things.

3016
02:14:23,580 --> 02:14:24,630
So it's filtering.

3017
02:14:25,220 --> 02:14:28,520
So that's why I say we're going to be
helping people notice what I teach it

3018
02:14:28,550 --> 02:14:31,260
because like that's a
hell of a thing to teach.

3019
02:14:31,860 --> 02:14:33,670
It's a healthy thing to realize yourself.

3020
02:14:34,110 --> 02:14:37,740
It's partly why I'm trying to be careful
with what I say because I've learned

3021
02:14:37,741 --> 02:14:38,910
that I should be careful

3022
02:14:39,000 --> 02:14:39,850
with what you're saying.

3023
02:14:43,480 --> 02:14:48,070
Is it hard for me to be away from my
briefing while my wife's comes along with

3024
02:14:48,071 --> 02:14:48,820
me?

3025
02:14:48,820 --> 02:14:49,653
So

3026
02:14:49,740 --> 02:14:54,740
[inaudible]

3027
02:15:02,040 --> 02:15:02,873
patients with her,

3028
02:15:03,130 --> 02:15:08,130
which is like a 16 hour a day occupation
because our life is very complicated

3029
02:15:09,611 --> 02:15:12,560
and I'm very complicated with

3030
02:15:14,900 --> 02:15:17,450
all the complexity and she
also has to put up with me.

3031
02:15:17,560 --> 02:15:18,710
That's not an easy thing.

3032
02:15:19,160 --> 02:15:21,530
So she's in this heart and soul,

3033
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:23,510
thank God for that
because I couldn't do it.

3034
02:15:25,060 --> 02:15:30,060
[inaudible]

3035
02:15:36,500 --> 02:15:37,333
they're in it.

3036
02:15:38,090 --> 02:15:40,130
They're all attitude where
they know what's going on.

3037
02:15:41,480 --> 02:15:42,760
You don't want to spend
more time with them.

3038
02:15:43,700 --> 02:15:48,700
When I get home and we get along just
fine and they're supporting what I'm doing

3039
02:15:48,971 --> 02:15:53,390
and have been my daughter works for
me full time now and she or kindness,

3040
02:15:53,391 --> 02:15:58,340
my schedule that she's quite interesting
creature in your own right because she,

3041
02:15:58,420 --> 02:16:02,870
she's back from an absolutely devastating
disease is doing quite well now.

3042
02:16:04,490 --> 02:16:05,323
Good,

3043
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:07,633
good.

3044
02:16:07,640 --> 02:16:08,451
It's always been good.

3045
02:16:08,451 --> 02:16:11,270
Ever since he was a little
kid at why is counseling.

3046
02:16:11,271 --> 02:16:15,470
We always listened to him as if he had
something to say and it turned up in

3047
02:16:16,360 --> 02:16:21,360
[inaudible].

3048
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:28,403
I,

3049
02:16:29,500 --> 02:16:30,310
my computer's

3050
02:16:30,310 --> 02:16:32,620
having a small one second.

3051
02:16:35,790 --> 02:16:39,420
How long before you do a video
conversation with Kanye West?

3052
02:16:51,520 --> 02:16:52,353
It

3053
02:16:53,640 --> 02:16:54,660
is helpful.

3054
02:16:56,880 --> 02:16:57,713
I mean,

3055
02:16:58,740 --> 02:16:59,930
I don't even know what to say about

3056
02:17:01,900 --> 02:17:02,880
Candice Owens,

3057
02:17:03,320 --> 02:17:04,153
right?

3058
02:17:05,850 --> 02:17:07,940
I mean it's just absurd.

3059
02:17:07,980 --> 02:17:09,810
So we'll see.

3060
02:17:12,030 --> 02:17:12,863
We'll see what happens.

3061
02:17:13,050 --> 02:17:14,800
My wife and I are expecting a Sunday,

3062
02:17:14,900 --> 02:17:19,900
the 25th you'll be listening to you like
what's your advice on [inaudible] Care

3063
02:17:20,710 --> 02:17:21,543
Business?

3064
02:17:22,710 --> 02:17:26,420
Well there a chapter in your old 12 call.

3065
02:17:27,420 --> 02:17:27,840
Sorry,

3066
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:28,673
chapter

3067
02:17:32,280 --> 02:17:35,250
soon that the person
knows something you don't,

3068
02:17:35,430 --> 02:17:35,700
okay,

3069
02:17:35,700 --> 02:17:38,220
so I'm going to tell the
story about the marriage.

3070
02:17:38,920 --> 02:17:40,360
This is tiny.

3071
02:17:40,520 --> 02:17:41,190
Cool.

3072
02:17:41,190 --> 02:17:42,980
So I had,

3073
02:17:43,020 --> 02:17:45,740
this is wild curls.

3074
02:17:46,090 --> 02:17:50,060
He went to sweet get married
because he's Swedish,

3075
02:17:50,180 --> 02:17:51,470
Swedish Canadian,

3076
02:17:52,270 --> 02:17:53,103
and

3077
02:17:54,230 --> 02:17:54,920
you're married.

3078
02:17:54,920 --> 02:17:55,753
Ceremony.

3079
02:17:56,770 --> 02:18:00,670
The apple had to hold
accountable on being married.

3080
02:18:00,671 --> 02:18:03,940
You're taking your balances and
that was very interesting to me.

3081
02:18:04,890 --> 02:18:05,723
You know,

3082
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:08,500
in the Christian symbolic world,

3083
02:18:08,570 --> 02:18:11,340
marriage is a sacrament of the sacred.

3084
02:18:11,740 --> 02:18:14,800
What'd you need to do some big acts you
about it can fundamental and knocked to

3085
02:18:14,801 --> 02:18:15,400
be mass.

3086
02:18:15,400 --> 02:18:17,640
The cows maybe of course.

3087
02:18:17,641 --> 02:18:18,451
That's what you assume.

3088
02:18:18,451 --> 02:18:19,550
When you take the bottom,

3089
02:18:20,550 --> 02:18:24,300
you're going to make this a
foundation that you don't shake.

3090
02:18:24,710 --> 02:18:28,670
You found when you were
kind of to yourself on your,

3091
02:18:28,970 --> 02:18:30,810
absolutely stayed to yourself on it.

3092
02:18:31,290 --> 02:18:32,480
One of the things about God,

3093
02:18:32,490 --> 02:18:34,200
and this is worth knowing perhaps,

3094
02:18:34,201 --> 02:18:36,990
especially to the people in this
audience who haven't been married yet,

3095
02:18:36,991 --> 02:18:39,270
but maybe to those of people
who are already married,

3096
02:18:39,800 --> 02:18:44,800
there's an idea which is your marriage
cannot work unless you're all in.

3097
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:46,501
That's,

3098
02:18:46,501 --> 02:18:48,250
what about has he falls,

3099
02:18:48,270 --> 02:18:51,420
let's say monogamous powers are
very common around the world,

3100
02:18:51,421 --> 02:18:51,751
by the way.

3101
02:18:51,751 --> 02:18:53,100
I made a lot more the society,

3102
02:18:53,230 --> 02:18:56,280
but they tend to be very unstable
for all sorts of complicated reasons.

3103
02:18:56,281 --> 02:19:01,281
So there's a strong proclivity towards
social enforcement all coming along and

3104
02:19:02,220 --> 02:19:05,480
there's a strong need to make it in viola.

3105
02:19:05,720 --> 02:19:07,860
Now there's a psychological
reason for that,

3106
02:19:07,890 --> 02:19:10,500
which is that you are not going
to be committed enough to,

3107
02:19:10,501 --> 02:19:13,770
your partner will take care of them
unless you bloody well know you wanted to

3108
02:19:13,771 --> 02:19:17,880
shut it off without you are shocking
to the inescapable lead for the rest of

3109
02:19:17,881 --> 02:19:18,714
your life.

3110
02:19:19,660 --> 02:19:22,330
Why are you going to be
serious enough about it?

3111
02:19:22,331 --> 02:19:22,630
It's like,

3112
02:19:22,630 --> 02:19:22,921
really?

3113
02:19:22,921 --> 02:19:25,200
I have to put up with
you for like 50 years.

3114
02:19:25,500 --> 02:19:29,990
We better get our in order
because otherwise he's going
to be some spice in hell

3115
02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:34,640
because you're just screwed
up in a horrible as Nisha so,

3116
02:19:35,150 --> 02:19:36,560
so is that something that's very,

3117
02:19:36,561 --> 02:19:37,394
very seriously.

3118
02:19:37,410 --> 02:19:39,320
So He'd go with your
partner has a problem.

3119
02:19:39,330 --> 02:19:40,430
If you have a problem,

3120
02:19:40,580 --> 02:19:43,850
you want to solve that because otherwise
you're going to have it maybe every day

3121
02:19:43,851 --> 02:19:44,750
for the rest of your life.

3122
02:19:44,990 --> 02:19:45,621
And you might think,

3123
02:19:45,621 --> 02:19:45,771
well,

3124
02:19:45,771 --> 02:19:48,290
I don't have to because I can
run away and find someone else.

3125
02:19:48,310 --> 02:19:48,621
It's like,

3126
02:19:48,621 --> 02:19:48,771
well,

3127
02:19:48,771 --> 02:19:52,030
good luck with that because they're
going to come with just as many flaws

3128
02:19:52,090 --> 02:19:56,600
probably as you have probably as your
partner has given to bring all your

3129
02:19:56,601 --> 02:19:57,371
insecurities.

3130
02:19:57,371 --> 02:19:59,370
Media sees into the new
relationship anyway,

3131
02:19:59,380 --> 02:20:00,201
so listen,

3132
02:20:00,201 --> 02:20:01,090
want to be alone,

3133
02:20:01,100 --> 02:20:05,180
which is still picking again generally a
fairly quick route to kind of insanity.

3134
02:20:05,240 --> 02:20:09,610
Then you're pretty much stuck with the
fact that you have flaws in them anyways,

3135
02:20:09,630 --> 02:20:12,670
so they're standing
with this candle bones.

3136
02:20:12,830 --> 02:20:13,850
Here's the IBM.

3137
02:20:14,230 --> 02:20:15,260
It's the same ideas.

3138
02:20:15,290 --> 02:20:16,450
Can't believe Christmas,

3139
02:20:17,130 --> 02:20:17,921
so complicated,

3140
02:20:17,921 --> 02:20:18,711
but you know something,

3141
02:20:18,711 --> 02:20:18,801
you,

3142
02:20:18,801 --> 02:20:19,880
most of you act out

3143
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:23,020
in the darkness of the way.

3144
02:20:23,021 --> 02:20:26,370
Can you bring the tree inside was what
the hell are you up to if you don't know

3145
02:20:26,380 --> 02:20:27,320
what to do it anyways,

3146
02:20:28,160 --> 02:20:30,140
but a bunch of lights
in it because of course,

3147
02:20:30,290 --> 02:20:32,570
what do you want to do when you bring
the tree in your house and she would

3148
02:20:32,600 --> 02:20:33,050
light.

3149
02:20:33,050 --> 02:20:34,850
That stands to reason,

3150
02:20:34,851 --> 02:20:35,151
right?

3151
02:20:35,151 --> 02:20:35,984
And when does it,

3152
02:20:36,490 --> 02:20:36,890
like,

3153
02:20:36,890 --> 02:20:40,490
you don't know why it was to
symbolize illumination in darkness.

3154
02:20:40,730 --> 02:20:41,300
And it's,

3155
02:20:41,300 --> 02:20:41,600
it's,

3156
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:42,170
it's a,

3157
02:20:42,170 --> 02:20:43,280
it's a pagan ritual,

3158
02:20:43,281 --> 02:20:44,480
but it's being Christianized.

3159
02:20:44,870 --> 02:20:48,950
You put an angel perhaps if the top of
the tree to signified that which is at

3160
02:20:48,951 --> 02:20:53,450
the top of a news and you celebrate the
reemergence of the light and the dark

3161
02:20:53,451 --> 02:20:53,840
areas.

3162
02:20:53,840 --> 02:20:55,430
So it's a little ritual.

3163
02:20:55,670 --> 02:20:59,740
It's 80 back laying up in the world in
terms of good and evil with lightning,

3164
02:20:59,780 --> 02:21:01,400
good darkness be evil.

3165
02:21:01,940 --> 02:21:05,300
And it's a good thing to do in the
winter because it's dark and you're also

3166
02:21:05,301 --> 02:21:07,190
celebrating to be birds of the sonnets.

3167
02:21:07,430 --> 02:21:07,761
Very,

3168
02:21:07,761 --> 02:21:08,594
very complicated.

3169
02:21:09,560 --> 02:21:14,050
So the category in the
tree is a sight and vision,

3170
02:21:14,130 --> 02:21:16,040
like it's a Christmas tree.

3171
02:21:16,041 --> 02:21:19,580
So it's associated with the idea of the
birth of the mythological hero for the

3172
02:21:19,581 --> 02:21:20,091
Messiah.

3173
02:21:20,091 --> 02:21:20,820
That's crazy.

3174
02:21:20,820 --> 02:21:24,460
And so you're doing all that at the
same time right now for celebration mode

3175
02:21:24,530 --> 02:21:27,650
because it's a great thing when
a new hero inches the world.

3176
02:21:28,040 --> 02:21:31,700
That's what happens when you give
birth to a child was the child has,

3177
02:21:32,420 --> 02:21:35,310
is a locus of divine consciousness is,

3178
02:21:35,390 --> 02:21:40,390
is that birth like putting different
logical hero always is because he's small

3179
02:21:40,520 --> 02:21:44,450
and fragile and all of that
hopefully goes up to do great things.

3180
02:21:44,510 --> 02:21:46,160
So that's all tangled up in that.

3181
02:21:46,310 --> 02:21:48,170
So the,

3182
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:53,120
the candle is a simple of the light in
the world and the light in the world is,

3183
02:21:53,121 --> 02:21:54,430
but there's a logical here at work,

3184
02:21:54,431 --> 02:21:56,090
it's Christ and the Christian drama.

3185
02:21:56,091 --> 02:21:57,410
So we'll use that.

3186
02:21:57,560 --> 02:22:01,280
So you hold the camera above your head
when you're getting married to symbolize

3187
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:03,260
what you are subordinate to.

3188
02:22:04,220 --> 02:22:04,881
Because you might say,

3189
02:22:04,881 --> 02:22:05,631
what did the marriage,

3190
02:22:05,631 --> 02:22:05,841
well,

3191
02:22:05,841 --> 02:22:07,420
the wife is subordinate to the husband.

3192
02:22:07,490 --> 02:22:11,630
That's the claim that's put out by
those who think that marriage is a

3193
02:22:11,631 --> 02:22:12,261
patriarchal,

3194
02:22:12,261 --> 02:22:13,910
oppressive institution,

3195
02:22:13,970 --> 02:22:15,260
which it is by the way,

3196
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:16,193
which you know,

3197
02:22:16,250 --> 02:22:20,270
because the only people that get married
now are rich people and rich people

3198
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:23,210
don't oppress themselves
as far as we know.

3199
02:22:23,211 --> 02:22:26,160
And what if you look at
the demographics chosen,

3200
02:22:26,170 --> 02:22:27,030
disintegrated,

3201
02:22:27,120 --> 02:22:30,150
it's disintegrated from the
lower socioeconomic classes.

3202
02:22:31,800 --> 02:22:35,130
Come up with a reason for why didn't
you privilege people would impress

3203
02:22:35,131 --> 02:22:35,710
themselves.

3204
02:22:35,710 --> 02:22:38,130
Then the whole notion that
marriage is not oppressive.

3205
02:22:38,131 --> 02:22:40,470
Patriarchal structure is
pretty much English proof.

3206
02:22:41,010 --> 02:22:41,730
So,

3207
02:22:41,730 --> 02:22:42,331
so we'll say,

3208
02:22:42,331 --> 02:22:42,571
well,

3209
02:22:42,571 --> 02:22:44,280
waves aren't as important
to their husbands,

3210
02:22:44,281 --> 02:22:48,480
but we also say husbands aren't
supporting it to the wives as well.

3211
02:22:48,540 --> 02:22:49,590
And Fair enough.

3212
02:22:49,650 --> 02:22:50,111
So,

3213
02:22:50,111 --> 02:22:55,111
so what is it that a couple of subordinate
to and answers what's symbolized by

3214
02:22:56,611 --> 02:22:57,444
the light?

3215
02:22:57,900 --> 02:23:00,810
And so what that means
now there's an old idea.

3216
02:23:01,110 --> 02:23:02,190
It's a very sick boy.

3217
02:23:02,191 --> 02:23:02,480
Again,

3218
02:23:02,480 --> 02:23:04,920
a weird idea that Christ was androgynous,

3219
02:23:04,921 --> 02:23:06,600
a combination of male and female.

3220
02:23:06,601 --> 02:23:10,900
He was a reconstruction of the original
Adam who is male and female before he

3221
02:23:10,901 --> 02:23:11,820
was pulled apart.

3222
02:23:11,880 --> 02:23:12,900
This is a dream,

3223
02:23:12,901 --> 02:23:13,140
right?

3224
02:23:13,140 --> 02:23:14,190
It's a cultural Greek.

3225
02:23:14,191 --> 02:23:18,060
And so praise is the property
union of masculine and feminine.

3226
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:20,180
And so that's where the marriage is.

3227
02:23:20,270 --> 02:23:24,150
The property can be that masculine and
feminine and the people in the marriage,

3228
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:27,930
the husband and the wife are supposed
to be subordinate to the ideal union of

3229
02:23:27,931 --> 02:23:29,160
masculine and feminine.

3230
02:23:29,640 --> 02:23:31,500
And what that idea of union is,

3231
02:23:31,530 --> 02:23:36,000
that spirit that's created by proper
and truthful the baby dialogue.

3232
02:23:36,420 --> 02:23:37,111
So what you do,

3233
02:23:37,111 --> 02:23:37,521
if you,

3234
02:23:37,521 --> 02:23:38,550
if you're married to someone,

3235
02:23:39,380 --> 02:23:40,380
you have to contend with,

3236
02:23:40,381 --> 02:23:40,760
everything,

3237
02:23:40,760 --> 02:23:41,820
have to contend with a few.

3238
02:23:41,821 --> 02:23:44,130
And that's a real bad if
you're actually communicated,

3239
02:23:44,131 --> 02:23:46,980
cause you're not saying that
different personalities,

3240
02:23:46,981 --> 02:23:48,000
you have different values,

3241
02:23:48,001 --> 02:23:48,930
you have different aims,

3242
02:23:49,130 --> 02:23:51,540
are different sections
like you're different.

3243
02:23:51,960 --> 02:23:56,340
And that if you could incorporate that
difference of both of you can incorporate

3244
02:23:56,341 --> 02:24:00,600
that every time you both why went
out and you're full of flaws and your

3245
02:24:00,601 --> 02:24:01,650
partner's full of flaws,

3246
02:24:01,651 --> 02:24:04,260
but he knows something you don't
and you know something he does.

3247
02:24:04,380 --> 02:24:06,900
And so as you can start
that information exchanged,

3248
02:24:06,901 --> 02:24:09,030
going that peripheral dialogue,

3249
02:24:09,240 --> 02:24:13,620
then both of you can be transformed me
in the course of the August speech that

3250
02:24:13,621 --> 02:24:15,060
constitutes the relationship,

3251
02:24:15,330 --> 02:24:18,180
that negotiation and what
you're supposed to do.

3252
02:24:18,180 --> 02:24:21,870
And this is what symbolized by the candle
is both subordinate yourself to that

3253
02:24:21,871 --> 02:24:23,250
ongoing negotiation.

3254
02:24:23,730 --> 02:24:24,271
So you know,

3255
02:24:24,271 --> 02:24:27,040
one thing you don't want to do is
don't want to beat your wasting,

3256
02:24:27,870 --> 02:24:29,000
even though you already want to.

3257
02:24:29,270 --> 02:24:29,481
I mean,

3258
02:24:29,481 --> 02:24:30,720
you absolutely want to,

3259
02:24:30,721 --> 02:24:31,870
and you're going to act that out too.

3260
02:24:31,871 --> 02:24:33,600
And she's going to do
the same thing to you.

3261
02:24:33,630 --> 02:24:37,590
It's just not that helpful because
you have to live with her tomorrow.

3262
02:24:37,760 --> 02:24:40,290
And so if you'll give
the hearing an argument,

3263
02:24:40,470 --> 02:24:40,591
well,

3264
02:24:40,591 --> 02:24:41,510
here's the options.

3265
02:24:41,580 --> 02:24:42,001
A,

3266
02:24:42,001 --> 02:24:43,380
she was writing and you were wrong.

3267
02:24:43,381 --> 02:24:44,490
If you just argument better,

3268
02:24:44,491 --> 02:24:47,850
and so what the hell
good is that she's right.

3269
02:24:47,900 --> 02:24:51,660
You have them solve a problem or you
would write and you need your good.

3270
02:24:51,930 --> 02:24:54,840
Then she's like in and
not very happy about it.

3271
02:24:54,841 --> 02:24:56,580
Who's gonna do the same thing to you?

3272
02:24:56,581 --> 02:24:58,350
As soon as the opportunity arises,

3273
02:24:58,620 --> 02:25:00,300
that's not very helpful.

3274
02:25:00,390 --> 02:25:01,380
So what do you want to do?

3275
02:25:01,381 --> 02:25:03,450
And you want to find out
what the hell the problem is,

3276
02:25:03,451 --> 02:25:06,990
which is really painful and horrible
thing to do because people sometimes don't

3277
02:25:06,991 --> 02:25:08,250
even know what the coffee is.

3278
02:25:08,251 --> 02:25:12,030
And then you have to listen to them like
for three days while they play a lot

3279
02:25:12,040 --> 02:25:16,230
with trying to tell you what's wrong
cause they know no and you have to shut up

3280
02:25:16,231 --> 02:25:20,140
and not offer solutions too early
because otherwise they can go through the

3281
02:25:20,141 --> 02:25:22,440
painful process of figuring
out what the problem is.

3282
02:25:22,770 --> 02:25:27,770
Maybe some problem they have with the of
1975 and it takes to get to the bottom

3283
02:25:30,640 --> 02:25:31,473
of that.

3284
02:25:31,550 --> 02:25:32,050
But if you're,

3285
02:25:32,050 --> 02:25:32,883
listen,

3286
02:25:34,110 --> 02:25:34,950
if you listen,

3287
02:25:34,960 --> 02:25:37,440
knowing that if you solve the problem,

3288
02:25:37,460 --> 02:25:39,220
you don't have to have any again,

3289
02:25:40,230 --> 02:25:43,450
then you can get that negotiated
dialogue going continually.

3290
02:25:43,451 --> 02:25:45,730
And that's what you're
supposed to be subordinate to.

3291
02:25:46,180 --> 02:25:48,010
And so then to answer this question,

3292
02:25:48,340 --> 02:25:50,510
which is get back to appearance,

3293
02:25:54,190 --> 02:25:58,180
my wife and I are spending the summer
in 25th one group advice on telling sick

3294
02:25:58,200 --> 02:25:58,720
childcare,

3295
02:25:58,720 --> 02:25:59,620
marriage and business.

3296
02:25:59,621 --> 02:25:59,981
It's like,

3297
02:25:59,981 --> 02:26:02,080
well my advice is

3298
02:26:04,990 --> 02:26:06,610
stick to your damn cow.

3299
02:26:06,980 --> 02:26:11,980
So you can't run away and then continue
with your wife because the two of you

3300
02:26:12,280 --> 02:26:16,630
have you do brings rather than one who
probably be able to figure out how to do

3301
02:26:16,690 --> 02:26:17,620
this as you go.

3302
02:26:17,650 --> 02:26:19,330
If you actually talk to each other.

3303
02:26:19,750 --> 02:26:24,750
That's part of the utility of free speech
that you give to think out loud and if

3304
02:26:24,971 --> 02:26:29,480
there's someone else around you is also
thinking and whose life is intertwined

3305
02:26:29,530 --> 02:26:32,050
with yours and you both
Amy from what's good,

3306
02:26:32,380 --> 02:26:35,440
then between the you might be
able to get the process going.

3307
02:26:35,441 --> 02:26:36,210
That's the,

3308
02:26:36,210 --> 02:26:38,290
that's the exchange of the logos,

3309
02:26:38,291 --> 02:26:39,040
let's say.

3310
02:26:39,040 --> 02:26:43,390
That will enable you to overcome the
problems of life and then maybe have you

3311
02:26:43,391 --> 02:26:43,900
done that.

3312
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:46,010
You'll make yourself into a unit,

3313
02:26:46,020 --> 02:26:47,650
a reasonably intelligent,

3314
02:26:47,780 --> 02:26:48,480
wise.

3315
02:26:48,480 --> 02:26:49,990
It's also capable of learning.

3316
02:26:50,230 --> 02:26:53,230
And then when your child
encounters that unit,

3317
02:26:53,680 --> 02:26:55,300
there'll be a nice wall around them.

3318
02:26:55,350 --> 02:26:55,810
You know,

3319
02:26:55,810 --> 02:26:56,231
you know what?

3320
02:26:56,231 --> 02:26:57,320
Kids are like this.

3321
02:26:57,660 --> 02:26:58,120
They're,

3322
02:26:58,120 --> 02:26:58,510
they're,

3323
02:26:58,510 --> 02:27:01,570
they're pushy little prime next and
they'll do everything they can to find a

3324
02:27:01,571 --> 02:27:02,680
hole in the wall.

3325
02:27:02,740 --> 02:27:03,970
They'll just purchase the torture.

3326
02:27:04,010 --> 02:27:04,491
With George,

3327
02:27:04,491 --> 02:27:07,210
he sees me as a weakness
somewhere they want to know.

3328
02:27:07,510 --> 02:27:09,490
And if they can set you against your wife,

3329
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:10,940
they will absolutely do that.

3330
02:27:11,350 --> 02:27:11,980
But if you,

3331
02:27:11,980 --> 02:27:13,090
because why wouldn't they?

3332
02:27:13,091 --> 02:27:14,650
Because they want to see what's real.

3333
02:27:14,830 --> 02:27:17,380
They're not messing around
or trying to live right.

3334
02:27:17,381 --> 02:27:19,960
And they want to see what's real and then
they're going to push the boundaries.

3335
02:27:20,560 --> 02:27:25,000
And if you have a solid relationship
and the kid comes up and pushes against

3336
02:27:25,001 --> 02:27:25,151
that,

3337
02:27:25,151 --> 02:27:25,930
it's like,

3338
02:27:25,930 --> 02:27:26,110
no,

3339
02:27:26,110 --> 02:27:26,890
how could you talk?

3340
02:27:26,890 --> 02:27:28,640
Or we're going to walk once or twice.

3341
02:27:28,641 --> 02:27:30,100
So stand up underneath a table.

3342
02:27:30,140 --> 02:27:32,620
It's too short and
snappy is had a good one.

3343
02:27:32,860 --> 02:27:36,370
But because of the table
never changes shape.

3344
02:27:37,090 --> 02:27:38,570
He'll only do that once.

3345
02:27:39,370 --> 02:27:40,850
And so now if we change,

3346
02:27:41,270 --> 02:27:44,770
he was changing shape all the time
where the kid would be underneath there

3347
02:27:44,771 --> 02:27:46,880
trying to bang his head on it nonstop.

3348
02:27:46,990 --> 02:27:51,990
So if you and your wife has forged a
unit that that isn't editable in some

3349
02:27:52,241 --> 02:27:53,074
sense,

3350
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:56,880
then they're going to push and push until
they find out that that doesn't work.

3351
02:27:56,950 --> 02:27:58,750
And to play that game anymore.

3352
02:27:59,230 --> 02:28:02,110
And that's going to be really good for
you because then your children will

3353
02:28:02,170 --> 02:28:05,320
tortured to death and it's really
going to be good for your child because

3354
02:28:05,330 --> 02:28:09,850
they're going to have tested the limits
and find out that there are walls to

3355
02:28:09,851 --> 02:28:13,690
keep the chaos out and that's going to
make me feel secure and then they're

3356
02:28:13,691 --> 02:28:16,240
going to be able to develop
within that security.

3357
02:28:16,570 --> 02:28:18,160
So that's a perfect deal.

3358
02:28:18,400 --> 02:28:22,620
And so that's fine advice
or you was happy summer

3359
02:28:24,160 --> 02:28:29,160
[inaudible]

3360
02:28:36,260 --> 02:28:40,310
how should I structure my future
children's education fully prepared for

3361
02:28:40,680 --> 02:28:44,040
[inaudible] and respect their culture?

3362
02:28:45,180 --> 02:28:45,391
Well,

3363
02:28:45,391 --> 02:28:47,340
one of the things that you
might want to think through,

3364
02:28:47,490 --> 02:28:48,480
I have a chapter

3365
02:28:50,250 --> 02:28:52,890
that children do anything
that makes you dislike them.

3366
02:28:53,180 --> 02:28:55,530
And I thought about lecturing
about that tonight too.

3367
02:28:55,650 --> 02:28:58,140
It's kind of a dark chapter as well.

3368
02:28:58,650 --> 02:29:00,650
I guess maybe the whole book is like that

3369
02:29:03,980 --> 02:29:04,510
locally.

3370
02:29:04,510 --> 02:29:06,630
The more you're able to
confront the darkness,

3371
02:29:06,631 --> 02:29:10,950
the more people are likely to assume
that you have something to say.

3372
02:29:11,180 --> 02:29:13,530
I would say because it's,

3373
02:29:13,980 --> 02:29:18,880
you have every reason to shy away
from the dark every reason and so,

3374
02:29:19,480 --> 02:29:21,660
and everyone knows how dark life can be.

3375
02:29:21,750 --> 02:29:24,570
And so if you pretended
that it sounds like that,

3376
02:29:24,690 --> 02:29:26,790
then why should anyone listen to you?

3377
02:29:27,120 --> 02:29:27,301
I mean,

3378
02:29:27,301 --> 02:29:28,320
I know what life was like.

3379
02:29:28,321 --> 02:29:31,110
I've spent $20,000
counseling people through.

3380
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:35,730
The most difficult thing is sometimes
that were so difficult that I couldn't

3381
02:29:35,731 --> 02:29:36,564
help.

3382
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:37,550
I know they would just,

3383
02:29:37,880 --> 02:29:38,580
I couldn't,

3384
02:29:38,580 --> 02:29:40,680
I couldn't help them solve a problem,

3385
02:29:40,830 --> 02:29:42,920
even with the best of
willow in their apartment.

3386
02:29:43,380 --> 02:29:44,340
And we're just cornered.

3387
02:29:44,341 --> 02:29:45,520
And there was no damn way out.

3388
02:29:45,590 --> 02:29:46,381
It was very,

3389
02:29:46,381 --> 02:29:47,214
very bad.

3390
02:29:47,520 --> 02:29:52,320
But most of the time it was
a very positive experience
because very frequently

3391
02:29:52,321 --> 02:29:53,100
people,

3392
02:29:53,100 --> 02:29:55,120
even in dire straits
can make advice along.

3393
02:29:56,480 --> 02:29:57,313
So,

3394
02:29:57,320 --> 02:29:58,200
but to do that,

3395
02:29:58,230 --> 02:29:58,411
well,

3396
02:29:58,411 --> 02:30:01,530
you have to have to confront
what's terrible about life.

3397
02:30:02,130 --> 02:30:04,890
Life is tragic events by level.

3398
02:30:06,020 --> 02:30:07,860
And so you have to be
able to deal with that.

3399
02:30:08,130 --> 02:30:08,963
So

3400
02:30:10,640 --> 02:30:11,580
how's your destruction?

3401
02:30:11,660 --> 02:30:13,080
What would your children's education?

3402
02:30:13,081 --> 02:30:13,410
Well,

3403
02:30:13,410 --> 02:30:18,120
the first thing that'll EMC
back into little five hour look,

3404
02:30:19,440 --> 02:30:22,360
the reason you don't want to
let the children do anything
that makes you dislike

3405
02:30:22,361 --> 02:30:23,610
or just because you'll be needing,

3406
02:30:23,611 --> 02:30:27,450
if you don't like that and you're way
bigger than them and you're really capable

3407
02:30:27,451 --> 02:30:31,230
of being needy and you might
be mean because it's like
you're the sort of person

3408
02:30:31,231 --> 02:30:34,280
who abuses your child physically lash out.

3409
02:30:34,290 --> 02:30:38,190
You have a terrible temper and your
Anglian Emily May succeeded her brutal or

3410
02:30:38,191 --> 02:30:43,020
you might get a sort of person that
smothers dependent law and either way you

3411
02:30:43,021 --> 02:30:47,250
can just do that again and you can do
both of those unbelievably mean and if you

3412
02:30:47,251 --> 02:30:48,180
don't make the children,

3413
02:30:48,300 --> 02:30:51,120
that is exactly what you
do and you might take off.

3414
02:30:51,121 --> 02:30:51,331
No,

3415
02:30:51,331 --> 02:30:52,430
you won't get he loved all.

3416
02:30:52,431 --> 02:30:52,740
It's like,

3417
02:30:52,740 --> 02:30:53,760
yes it will happen.

3418
02:30:54,090 --> 02:30:55,140
That's when people are like,

3419
02:30:55,170 --> 02:30:59,190
and that's why families are often such
snake heads of catastrophe and they don't

3420
02:30:59,191 --> 02:31:03,740
have to be like a frequently are and
lots of people's whole life turning his

3421
02:31:03,780 --> 02:31:07,080
fight their way home to
unbelievably pathological family.

3422
02:31:07,350 --> 02:31:08,920
That's the whole Freud in nightmare.

3423
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:09,833
I'm not sure.

3424
02:31:10,140 --> 02:31:10,973
So

3425
02:31:12,420 --> 02:31:15,960
you want to encourage your children to
behave in a manner that makes you deeply

3426
02:31:15,961 --> 02:31:17,700
appreciate the fact that they exist.

3427
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,780
Now you're kind of,

3428
02:31:19,710 --> 02:31:22,950
because you're only one person and so
hopefully you have someone around you that

3429
02:31:22,980 --> 02:31:24,060
your longterm partner,

3430
02:31:24,061 --> 02:31:24,690
let's say,

3431
02:31:24,690 --> 02:31:28,110
who can slap it on the back of the
head when you're being too insane.

3432
02:31:28,230 --> 02:31:29,670
Because you know,

3433
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:32,310
part of what might make you
dislike your children's,

3434
02:31:32,311 --> 02:31:35,160
the fact that you just don't have your
act together very well and they're doing

3435
02:31:35,161 --> 02:31:37,590
perfectly okay things if
you happen to be irritated.

3436
02:31:38,370 --> 02:31:41,820
And so that's partly why you need a
partner can sort of alerted to when you're

3437
02:31:41,821 --> 02:31:43,490
being unreasonable about your demand.

3438
02:31:43,620 --> 02:31:45,420
And hopefully the two of
you were different enough.

3439
02:31:45,421 --> 02:31:46,680
So you're in Melville,

3440
02:31:47,030 --> 02:31:51,290
one to half decent sequent together
person and that person helped you.

3441
02:31:51,500 --> 02:31:53,430
Did y'all learn how to be likable?

3442
02:31:53,431 --> 02:31:54,620
So other people like them.

3443
02:31:54,900 --> 02:31:56,610
So the first thing you want to say grout,

3444
02:31:56,670 --> 02:32:00,860
if you want your child to have
a proper relationship with Ba,

3445
02:32:00,861 --> 02:32:03,450
etc. Is whether that's
actually what you want.

3446
02:32:04,540 --> 02:32:05,070
You know,

3447
02:32:05,070 --> 02:32:05,910
because you might be able to,

3448
02:32:05,911 --> 02:32:06,211
of course,

3449
02:32:06,211 --> 02:32:07,710
that's what people want for the children.

3450
02:32:07,711 --> 02:32:08,011
It's like,

3451
02:32:08,011 --> 02:32:08,611
no,

3452
02:32:08,611 --> 02:32:09,930
not of course.

3453
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:11,190
And it's not what we have.

3454
02:32:11,490 --> 02:32:16,300
Lots of people have terrible parents and
they're not just fair to neglect mean

3455
02:32:16,350 --> 02:32:17,071
that's bad,

3456
02:32:17,071 --> 02:32:17,820
but it's not.

3457
02:32:17,820 --> 02:32:20,430
That's only where that starts at neglect.

3458
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:21,740
The kids can handle that.

3459
02:32:21,741 --> 02:32:22,141
It's movies,

3460
02:32:22,141 --> 02:32:23,220
it's not total.

3461
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:25,890
But like I've had clients
whose parents did.

3462
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:28,530
Every time that person did something good,

3463
02:32:28,531 --> 02:32:32,550
their parents punished every single
time until they were terrified of doing

3464
02:32:32,551 --> 02:32:33,540
anything at all.

3465
02:32:33,570 --> 02:32:35,890
And even punish them by
criticizing them to death.

3466
02:32:35,920 --> 02:32:40,920
And they had the goal to try
to do something useful in
the world or acting as if

3467
02:32:41,820 --> 02:32:45,900
they were absolutely terrified and
stole every type of child took a risk,

3468
02:32:46,140 --> 02:32:49,480
which is the sort of helicopter parenting
that so absolutely catastrophic,

3469
02:32:49,640 --> 02:32:51,360
but don't upset your mother,

3470
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:52,140
you know,

3471
02:32:52,140 --> 02:32:55,350
with your courageous and
forthright action in the world.

3472
02:32:55,650 --> 02:32:55,921
Right.

3473
02:32:55,921 --> 02:32:59,850
And so then see if you knew that they
can associate courageous auction with

3474
02:32:59,851 --> 02:33:00,684
guilt.

3475
02:33:00,810 --> 02:33:02,590
If you really want to give
it to your kids and have not,

3476
02:33:02,591 --> 02:33:03,600
it's an excellent trick.

3477
02:33:03,600 --> 02:33:06,870
You take the best thing about them
and make it feel horrible about it,

3478
02:33:07,230 --> 02:33:08,250
that's a good trick.

3479
02:33:08,490 --> 02:33:10,140
And if you don't take
your capable of that,

3480
02:33:10,141 --> 02:33:12,390
then you're not taking it
because you aren't capable of it.

3481
02:33:12,630 --> 02:33:13,710
And to real danger.

3482
02:33:13,920 --> 02:33:15,410
It's the danger of over protected,

3483
02:33:15,411 --> 02:33:17,810
which cause it takes a
real courageous parent too.

3484
02:33:18,470 --> 02:33:19,350
It's so interesting.

3485
02:33:19,351 --> 02:33:20,580
I watched this video last night,

3486
02:33:20,600 --> 02:33:21,221
my wife should be,

3487
02:33:21,221 --> 02:33:22,054
to me,

3488
02:33:22,110 --> 02:33:23,190
I think it was from Russia.

3489
02:33:23,340 --> 02:33:26,280
I don't think this could have ever
possibly happen with North America.

3490
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:28,890
This kid was about to,

3491
02:33:28,950 --> 02:33:30,240
I think still in diapers,

3492
02:33:30,480 --> 02:33:31,710
pretty mobile.

3493
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:36,450
And the in parents that put up when
those little doorways that you put up for

3494
02:33:36,451 --> 02:33:41,010
kids in the door that keeps them in the
room or maybe stops falling down the

3495
02:33:41,011 --> 02:33:41,844
stairs.

3496
02:33:41,850 --> 02:33:44,850
And so had one of those little
things that were in the doorway.

3497
02:33:45,090 --> 02:33:48,870
There was actually two of them on top
of each other because this kid have

3498
02:33:48,871 --> 02:33:52,020
learned how to climb up the attic,

3499
02:33:52,100 --> 02:33:55,800
like to and learned how
to quiet the little,

3500
02:33:56,580 --> 02:34:00,750
the little door with them as
opposed to another one on top.

3501
02:34:00,751 --> 02:34:02,130
And he climbed up that up too.

3502
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:06,180
But he's having a hell of a fine time
falling over the top and he was in

3503
02:34:06,181 --> 02:34:06,691
diapers.

3504
02:34:06,691 --> 02:34:07,270
And look at that.

3505
02:34:07,270 --> 02:34:11,300
You think that because
of what's been happening,

3506
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:13,470
but the parents didn't interfere.

3507
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:14,710
They videotaped it.

3508
02:34:16,950 --> 02:34:17,410
It's like,

3509
02:34:17,410 --> 02:34:17,681
no,

3510
02:34:17,681 --> 02:34:19,720
it's not what's abusive.

3511
02:34:19,750 --> 02:34:21,510
Here's what's abusers is you.

3512
02:34:21,511 --> 02:34:22,211
When you come to kid,

3513
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:23,630
he's three quarters of the way up.

3514
02:34:23,690 --> 02:34:24,640
The second one,

3515
02:34:24,760 --> 02:34:28,570
so like five feet off the ground and
then you have a little panic attack about

3516
02:34:28,571 --> 02:34:29,590
how dangerous it is.

3517
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:31,480
So then you went to Sanford child,

3518
02:34:31,510 --> 02:34:35,890
so that all and hurts himself and then
you'd tell them that's what happens when

3519
02:34:35,891 --> 02:34:36,910
you do that sort of thing.

3520
02:34:37,530 --> 02:34:40,330
That's a user and they didn't do them.

3521
02:34:40,690 --> 02:34:45,690
[inaudible] masquerade and he's like,

3522
02:34:50,110 --> 02:34:52,020
it's a courageous parent who stands doc.

3523
02:34:52,021 --> 02:34:52,810
And I think so,

3524
02:34:52,810 --> 02:34:53,643
you know,

3525
02:34:53,740 --> 02:34:55,000
I don't want that kid to fall,

3526
02:34:55,001 --> 02:34:56,800
but I'm not getting a
fuck about these zones.

3527
02:34:56,810 --> 02:34:58,630
They're like master new world.

3528
02:34:58,750 --> 02:35:00,400
So naturally to do,

3529
02:35:00,401 --> 02:35:03,640
if you have some courage and you
let your children take your lumps,

3530
02:35:03,900 --> 02:35:04,990
if you don't have lumps,

3531
02:35:04,991 --> 02:35:06,520
are going to get blocked beginning.

3532
02:35:07,020 --> 02:35:07,853
So,

3533
02:35:09,950 --> 02:35:12,340
so you decide you want the
best for your children.

3534
02:35:12,880 --> 02:35:16,150
And you've got to ask yourself
that question seriously
because there's at least,

3535
02:35:16,210 --> 02:35:17,920
there's a big part of that Katie part,

3536
02:35:17,930 --> 02:35:20,500
let's say it does not appoint
the business with your children.

3537
02:35:20,870 --> 02:35:22,960
That would be annoyed
if they were successful.

3538
02:35:23,290 --> 02:35:24,560
It would be unhappy with me.

3539
02:35:24,561 --> 02:35:26,360
Succeed and so,

3540
02:35:26,410 --> 02:35:30,220
and if you don't think that's true that
you do not know anything before because

3541
02:35:30,221 --> 02:35:33,070
it is true and PB had
everyone's like that.

3542
02:35:33,071 --> 02:35:35,170
Some people are really like that.

3543
02:35:35,740 --> 02:35:37,160
So when you mentioned cubs dark,

3544
02:35:37,840 --> 02:35:38,673
it doesn't matter.

3545
02:35:38,680 --> 02:35:40,110
It's real easy to start

3546
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:46,920
[inaudible].

3547
02:35:49,960 --> 02:35:54,210
What would you say to someone who doesn't
feel like enough while you're right,

3548
02:35:55,500 --> 02:35:56,333
right.

3549
02:35:56,880 --> 02:35:57,940
That's okay.

3550
02:35:58,330 --> 02:36:01,030
What you should do is beat
yourself up because of that.

3551
02:36:01,600 --> 02:36:03,640
Like you're not enough and you shouldn't.

3552
02:36:03,730 --> 02:36:04,650
You shouldn't think you are.

3553
02:36:04,680 --> 02:36:05,051
You can think,

3554
02:36:05,051 --> 02:36:05,884
what the hell are you?

3555
02:36:06,130 --> 02:36:06,790
Are you going to you?

3556
02:36:06,790 --> 02:36:08,430
If you're already a candy bowl,

3557
02:36:08,431 --> 02:36:09,480
you have nothing to do.

3558
02:36:09,820 --> 02:36:10,180
You know,

3559
02:36:10,180 --> 02:36:14,890
one of the things that I
noticed it talking to audiences
like this over the last

3560
02:36:14,890 --> 02:36:15,670
year and a half,

3561
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:17,080
the audience is very quiet.

3562
02:36:17,140 --> 02:36:18,610
When I talk about two things.

3563
02:36:19,390 --> 02:36:21,770
One is responsibility and Ruben,

3564
02:36:21,780 --> 02:36:22,613
who's quiet.

3565
02:36:22,660 --> 02:36:23,680
That's so cool.

3566
02:36:23,710 --> 02:36:24,390
Cause Grips,

3567
02:36:24,390 --> 02:36:26,560
PE know it's like well
there's something to that.

3568
02:36:27,100 --> 02:36:29,310
And you know that in
an audience was quiet,

3569
02:36:29,320 --> 02:36:30,220
we were talking comes up,

3570
02:36:30,490 --> 02:36:31,830
you know there's something in the air,

3571
02:36:32,130 --> 02:36:34,030
it's an unspoken necessity,

3572
02:36:34,090 --> 02:36:35,260
it's manifested itself,

3573
02:36:36,550 --> 02:36:37,940
it's that and

3574
02:36:41,360 --> 02:36:43,480
this issue of self esteem.

3575
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:46,360
So what I'm suggesting to people,

3576
02:36:46,540 --> 02:36:47,550
psychologists,

3577
02:36:47,680 --> 02:36:51,520
bless her soul that
aren't very well informed,

3578
02:36:51,820 --> 02:36:56,820
have been telling people for five decades
that he should have high self esteem.

3579
02:36:57,610 --> 02:36:58,120
It's like,

3580
02:36:58,120 --> 02:36:58,960
hey,

3581
02:36:59,470 --> 02:37:03,670
most of what passes for self esteem as
mentioned by psychologist is actually a

3582
02:37:03,671 --> 02:37:04,930
temperamental trait.

3583
02:37:05,230 --> 02:37:08,070
So if you take self esteem
scales and you score high,

3584
02:37:08,071 --> 02:37:10,450
it's because you're extroverted
and low in neuroticism.

3585
02:37:10,600 --> 02:37:12,580
So the scales are wrong.

3586
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:13,810
So that's one.

3587
02:37:14,050 --> 02:37:17,660
And number two is [inaudible] says
you should have high self esteem.

3588
02:37:17,720 --> 02:37:21,180
What's so great about you and you think,

3589
02:37:21,200 --> 02:37:22,880
well that's a terrible
thing to tell people.

3590
02:37:22,881 --> 02:37:26,480
It's like going snow on because people
aren't very happy with who they are.

3591
02:37:27,190 --> 02:37:28,040
And so if you tell them,

3592
02:37:28,041 --> 02:37:28,371
oh no,

3593
02:37:28,371 --> 02:37:29,540
you're good the way you argued.

3594
02:37:30,020 --> 02:37:30,853
Wait a second,

3595
02:37:31,310 --> 02:37:33,710
I'm not happy with the
way things are with me.

3596
02:37:33,980 --> 02:37:36,800
And so I'm supposed to be
happy with the way I am.

3597
02:37:36,801 --> 02:37:38,600
Then like what about all this misery?

3598
02:37:38,601 --> 02:37:39,740
That's part of my life.

3599
02:37:40,130 --> 02:37:43,400
And so it's not a good thing to tell
people that they're just okay the way they

3600
02:37:43,401 --> 02:37:43,910
are.

3601
02:37:43,910 --> 02:37:45,200
That's not good at all.

3602
02:37:45,700 --> 02:37:49,310
What do you want to tell them is
you could be way more than you are.

3603
02:37:50,060 --> 02:37:51,710
You could be way more than you are.

3604
02:37:52,100 --> 02:37:53,110
And that would be that.

3605
02:37:53,170 --> 02:37:56,050
That would be better for you and it
would be better for your families,

3606
02:37:56,070 --> 02:37:57,320
would be better for the country,

3607
02:37:57,390 --> 02:37:58,410
be better for everyone.

3608
02:37:58,870 --> 02:38:03,110
And there's something about
insufficient and wretchedness war.

3609
02:38:03,170 --> 02:38:04,850
They did start that,

3610
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:08,060
start on that pathway
and be successful at it.

3611
02:38:08,360 --> 02:38:13,360
And so it isn't that you should be
that you should be happy with yourself

3612
02:38:14,211 --> 02:38:15,050
because of who you are.

3613
02:38:16,070 --> 02:38:20,720
It's that you should be respectful of
yourself because you are the sort of

3614
02:38:20,721 --> 02:38:23,750
person who could transform
herself into who you could be.

3615
02:38:24,140 --> 02:38:26,180
And now it's way better.

3616
02:38:26,750 --> 02:38:31,750
And so [inaudible] want to put
a little bit boundary rub that,

3617
02:38:36,081 --> 02:38:36,740
look,

3618
02:38:36,740 --> 02:38:38,690
I know that people can
be themselves often.

3619
02:38:38,720 --> 02:38:39,920
They do that all the time.

3620
02:38:40,010 --> 02:38:44,420
And so you can be too judgmental
with regards to yourself.

3621
02:38:44,421 --> 02:38:47,510
And that leads to depression and
high levels of anxiety can be really

3622
02:38:47,511 --> 02:38:50,300
destructive and can culminate
suicide like you got to,

3623
02:38:50,720 --> 02:38:52,850
despite the fact that you're
not everything you could be,

3624
02:38:52,851 --> 02:38:55,640
you have to have a little bit of mercy
that you're touch towards yourself.

3625
02:38:55,641 --> 02:38:56,360
You don't want to,

3626
02:38:56,360 --> 02:38:57,170
you don't want it.

3627
02:38:57,170 --> 02:39:00,200
You want to treat yourself with
someone that you're trying to help.

3628
02:39:00,860 --> 02:39:01,041
Right?

3629
02:39:01,041 --> 02:39:01,871
That's another rule.

3630
02:39:01,871 --> 02:39:02,980
And you talk to us for life.

3631
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:05,590
Treat yourself like you're someone
you're responsible for helpful.

3632
02:39:05,720 --> 02:39:07,190
And that would be hard
as it bit of detachment.

3633
02:39:07,400 --> 02:39:11,510
Imagine that you're worthwhile despite
your anatomy nurses and they've your

3634
02:39:11,511 --> 02:39:15,430
necessary in the world at least
as a bulwark against help.

3635
02:39:15,590 --> 02:39:19,460
And I think that's absolutely the case
because you could certainly generate a

3636
02:39:19,461 --> 02:39:21,470
little held on yourself
without too much effort.

3637
02:39:21,470 --> 02:39:24,880
So you could at least not do
that and that might be important.

3638
02:39:25,490 --> 02:39:28,860
So it's reasonable to treat yourself
with a certain amount of detached with

3639
02:39:28,870 --> 02:39:31,280
respect and then to regard yourself as,

3640
02:39:31,281 --> 02:39:32,840
so when you should try to help.

3641
02:39:32,910 --> 02:39:36,450
Like you would help someone who can
carry forward in a detached sort of way.

3642
02:39:36,451 --> 02:39:38,810
Because if people have value,

3643
02:39:39,080 --> 02:39:43,640
if other people have value that you have
value and you open yourself the safe,

3644
02:39:43,641 --> 02:39:47,140
ethical responsibility that you will
welcome people and maybe what you will

3645
02:39:47,150 --> 02:39:51,410
other people is the responsibility to
help move along the way so that the world

3646
02:39:51,411 --> 02:39:51,890
gets better,

3647
02:39:51,890 --> 02:39:52,820
relevant works.

3648
02:39:52,880 --> 02:39:55,820
And so that's the same attitude
that you should make yourself.

3649
02:39:55,821 --> 02:40:00,050
So despite the fact that we are all
making showed me and despite the fact that

3650
02:40:00,051 --> 02:40:01,860
you have plenty to allergic
and you should learn,

3651
02:40:01,861 --> 02:40:02,990
there you go.

3652
02:40:03,050 --> 02:40:07,220
You also don't get to beat yourself to
death with a stick all the time because

3653
02:40:07,221 --> 02:40:09,800
you're insufficient in 15 different ways.

3654
02:40:10,340 --> 02:40:12,290
So justice,

3655
02:40:12,350 --> 02:40:13,183
that's the,

3656
02:40:13,560 --> 02:40:16,230
and mercy is what people seem
to tolerate the children.

3657
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:17,640
And you need to use disposable.

3658
02:40:17,650 --> 02:40:21,660
That was in order to establish the
proper relationship with your life.

3659
02:40:22,080 --> 02:40:27,080
And so you're not enough and say going
for that cause you wouldn't have anything

3660
02:40:27,150 --> 02:40:31,290
worthwhile to do if you were enough and
you do have something worthwhile to do,

3661
02:40:31,291 --> 02:40:34,230
which is to make things better
than they are of yourself.

3662
02:40:34,350 --> 02:40:36,870
And so do it.

3663
02:40:37,430 --> 02:40:42,430
[inaudible]

3664
02:41:00,320 --> 02:41:02,100
do you pray?

3665
02:41:05,370 --> 02:41:05,970
Well,

3666
02:41:05,970 --> 02:41:06,803
I don't know.

3667
02:41:10,020 --> 02:41:12,140
I don't ask God for famous.

3668
02:41:13,880 --> 02:41:14,190
Right?

3669
02:41:14,190 --> 02:41:15,940
And I think that's what people do,

3670
02:41:15,941 --> 02:41:16,774
that the prayer

3671
02:41:21,140 --> 02:41:23,340
prayer is actually something that works,

3672
02:41:24,450 --> 02:41:27,150
but ask them for favors with God.

3673
02:41:27,151 --> 02:41:29,430
That doesn't work because
that is how it works.

3674
02:41:30,160 --> 02:41:34,650
He couldn't ask to have enough
courage to see the truth.

3675
02:41:35,940 --> 02:41:37,530
And that's a painful thing to do.

3676
02:41:37,710 --> 02:41:38,521
So for example,

3677
02:41:38,521 --> 02:41:38,881
here's a,

3678
02:41:38,881 --> 02:41:41,580
here's a prayer of sorts.

3679
02:41:41,880 --> 02:41:43,170
It's imagine you're hugging the site guys,

3680
02:41:43,171 --> 02:41:43,740
your white,

3681
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:44,760
and it's not a good fight.

3682
02:41:44,820 --> 02:41:48,000
It's this sort of fight that makes you
wonder whether you should be it the damn

3683
02:41:48,001 --> 02:41:48,834
relationship.

3684
02:41:49,530 --> 02:41:54,530
And so every fight contending that
direction is often quite people won't have

3685
02:41:55,141 --> 02:41:58,830
fights because we can open up
that entire space of catastrophe.

3686
02:41:59,190 --> 02:42:01,860
And it's partly why you want
to be serious about your vows.

3687
02:42:02,490 --> 02:42:06,120
You don't want to open up the possibility
that you can leave every time you have

3688
02:42:06,121 --> 02:42:06,600
a fight.

3689
02:42:06,600 --> 02:42:06,931
I mean,

3690
02:42:06,931 --> 02:42:07,590
good God,

3691
02:42:07,590 --> 02:42:08,970
you really want that choice.

3692
02:42:09,030 --> 02:42:10,920
What that 40 day.

3693
02:42:10,980 --> 02:42:11,311
It's not,

3694
02:42:11,311 --> 02:42:12,420
that's not freedom.

3695
02:42:12,500 --> 02:42:17,160
It's just chaos has some choices you
don't want to have to make all the time.

3696
02:42:17,370 --> 02:42:20,130
It was hard enough to figure
out that you should get married.

3697
02:42:20,131 --> 02:42:20,230
You're,

3698
02:42:20,230 --> 02:42:24,380
you want to choose whether or not you're
going to stay married every day because

3699
02:42:24,430 --> 02:42:25,920
that's just not good.

3700
02:42:26,250 --> 02:42:26,940
So,

3701
02:42:26,940 --> 02:42:27,530
so anyway,

3702
02:42:27,530 --> 02:42:32,530
let's say you're having a fight with your
wife and it's Brooklyn and you want to

3703
02:42:32,821 --> 02:42:35,080
win and the notion was
wrong and he liked it,

3704
02:42:35,081 --> 02:42:36,090
a theater and all of that,

3705
02:42:36,091 --> 02:42:38,790
and you get to the addictive about
it and she's seeing the same thing.

3706
02:42:38,820 --> 02:42:40,830
And so it's sort of
spiraling out of control.

3707
02:42:40,890 --> 02:42:42,600
And so here's something you can do.

3708
02:42:43,200 --> 02:42:47,520
You can go your separate ways momentarily
and you can sit on the edge of your

3709
02:42:47,521 --> 02:42:48,780
bed and you think,

3710
02:42:50,310 --> 02:42:51,143
okay,

3711
02:42:51,750 --> 02:42:54,410
I probably did something outstanding,

3712
02:42:54,550 --> 02:42:57,450
stupid in the last three months.

3713
02:42:57,990 --> 02:43:01,560
Then increased the probability that
you're having this terrible fight.

3714
02:43:01,890 --> 02:43:03,120
I'd probably get some,

3715
02:43:04,260 --> 02:43:05,093
what was it?

3716
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:10,050
But you have to want to go down cause
that's the prayer that's knocking on the

3717
02:43:10,051 --> 02:43:10,321
door.

3718
02:43:10,321 --> 02:43:13,120
We'll right ask and you
will receive this like one,

3719
02:43:13,121 --> 02:43:14,570
it depends on when you ask for.

3720
02:43:15,160 --> 02:43:17,830
So if you ask from what
would be best for you,

3721
02:43:17,831 --> 02:43:19,030
maybe you'll get it.

3722
02:43:19,060 --> 02:43:20,600
That doesn't mean that you'll like it.

3723
02:43:21,520 --> 02:43:23,710
And so if you sit on the edge
of your bed and you think,

3724
02:43:23,711 --> 02:43:24,544
okay,

3725
02:43:25,600 --> 02:43:26,680
in my maybe a seat,

3726
02:43:26,710 --> 02:43:29,710
what did I do to contribute
to this horrible fight?

3727
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:34,030
You sit there two or three minutes
actually wanting to build the answer,

3728
02:43:34,060 --> 02:43:37,450
which you will know cause you
don't want them to answer.

3729
02:43:37,960 --> 02:43:38,700
You'll get it.

3730
02:43:38,700 --> 02:43:40,570
You'll get an answer just
as clear as could be.

3731
02:43:40,571 --> 02:43:40,931
You'll think,

3732
02:43:40,931 --> 02:43:41,351
oh yeah,

3733
02:43:41,351 --> 02:43:42,041
that's what I did.

3734
02:43:42,041 --> 02:43:42,431
That was,

3735
02:43:42,431 --> 02:43:43,030
and then you'll think,

3736
02:43:43,030 --> 02:43:43,950
well that's when county,

3737
02:43:44,230 --> 02:43:46,560
that's only contributing
5% of the problem.

3738
02:43:46,570 --> 02:43:48,840
She's still 99% of lane.

3739
02:43:48,870 --> 02:43:49,703
It's like,

3740
02:43:49,720 --> 02:43:50,021
yeah,

3741
02:43:50,021 --> 02:43:52,960
maybe guardian to 5%
so that's been enough.

3742
02:43:52,961 --> 02:43:57,820
And then you can go back to her and
maybe she's done the same thing and she

3743
02:43:57,821 --> 02:43:58,511
could tell you what,

3744
02:43:58,511 --> 02:43:59,191
she's an idiot.

3745
02:43:59,191 --> 02:44:02,830
Then you could tell her when you're an
Indian and then you two idiots might be

3746
02:44:02,831 --> 02:44:04,950
able to have a conversation
and solve the problem.

3747
02:44:05,140 --> 02:44:07,180
And that's a prayer.

3748
02:44:07,480 --> 02:44:08,710
And that work.

3749
02:44:08,740 --> 02:44:12,910
If you want to know why you're
stupid and you ask yourself,

3750
02:44:12,940 --> 02:44:13,870
you will get announced.

3751
02:44:14,810 --> 02:44:16,000
And that's prayer.

3752
02:44:16,030 --> 02:44:21,030
[inaudible]

3753
02:44:25,660 --> 02:44:27,750
the one more in entire,

3754
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:30,130
I don't want to say anything stupid.

3755
02:44:32,860 --> 02:44:34,480
What do I think of polygamy?

3756
02:44:35,870 --> 02:44:38,290
Give me personally or

3757
02:44:43,220 --> 02:44:44,530
I think that it's,

3758
02:44:50,530 --> 02:44:52,900
it leads to unstable societies.

3759
02:44:52,910 --> 02:44:54,010
It leads to unhappy,

3760
02:44:54,370 --> 02:44:54,971
resentful,

3761
02:44:54,971 --> 02:44:55,511
aggressive,

3762
02:44:55,511 --> 02:44:56,380
angry men.

3763
02:44:57,250 --> 02:44:58,900
Because there are men
who don't have any women.

3764
02:44:59,320 --> 02:45:01,700
And that leads to the
stabilization of society.

3765
02:45:02,560 --> 02:45:03,610
It's a bad idea,

3766
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:08,390
which is why you see a strong proclivity
towards monogamy among human cultures.

3767
02:45:09,100 --> 02:45:10,100
It's a clinic.

3768
02:45:10,470 --> 02:45:10,991
You know what I mean?

3769
02:45:10,991 --> 02:45:14,950
People are capable and willing to
engage in polygamous relationships.

3770
02:45:16,060 --> 02:45:17,740
All things considered.

3771
02:45:17,741 --> 02:45:19,180
It's a bad solution,

3772
02:45:19,780 --> 02:45:20,060
right?

3773
02:45:20,060 --> 02:45:22,210
So what does all things considered me?

3774
02:45:22,240 --> 02:45:23,073
Well,

3775
02:45:23,230 --> 02:45:23,771
you've got to think,

3776
02:45:23,771 --> 02:45:23,921
well,

3777
02:45:23,921 --> 02:45:25,600
what's good for you right now?

3778
02:45:25,770 --> 02:45:25,940
What?

3779
02:45:25,940 --> 02:45:29,470
He might take unlimited
sexual opportunity right now.

3780
02:45:29,560 --> 02:45:31,740
So it doesn't take much
thinking to understand.

3781
02:45:31,741 --> 02:45:35,710
Probably probably that that's
not a very sophisticated and so,

3782
02:45:35,770 --> 02:45:37,060
but if you're describing certs,

3783
02:45:37,080 --> 02:45:38,140
it might seem attractive.

3784
02:45:38,980 --> 02:45:40,240
What's good for you right now,

3785
02:45:40,740 --> 02:45:41,950
which is good for you right now in a way,

3786
02:45:41,951 --> 02:45:43,210
this good for you with a week,

3787
02:45:43,690 --> 02:45:44,650
it's good for you to month

3788
02:45:46,620 --> 02:45:49,570
it's been for you in 10 years is
continue across your lifespan.

3789
02:45:50,260 --> 02:45:51,093
What is,

3790
02:45:51,190 --> 02:45:51,491
well,

3791
02:45:51,491 --> 02:45:54,760
we'll kind of know this
probably better not to be alone.

3792
02:45:55,360 --> 02:46:00,360
It's probably better to have someone
with you through your life because all

3793
02:46:02,081 --> 02:46:02,950
things considered,

3794
02:46:02,951 --> 02:46:03,784
it works better.

3795
02:46:04,360 --> 02:46:07,240
Now that doesn't mean it's a picnic or
that it's easy for any of those things,

3796
02:46:07,241 --> 02:46:08,290
but of course it doesn't.

3797
02:46:08,560 --> 02:46:09,393
Of course not.

3798
02:46:09,860 --> 02:46:11,420
And then it isn't just
put your finger for you,

3799
02:46:11,530 --> 02:46:13,460
it's which bigger for your family.

3800
02:46:13,870 --> 02:46:17,540
The evidence for that children is crystal
clear and I can't believe we even have

3801
02:46:17,541 --> 02:46:18,800
this discussion in our society.

3802
02:46:19,310 --> 02:46:21,580
It's like other families in our work.

3803
02:46:21,880 --> 02:46:26,880
Well that doesn't mean that all families
without fathers are catastrophes and it

3804
02:46:27,021 --> 02:46:29,590
doesn't get that all families
with one if they're successful,

3805
02:46:31,490 --> 02:46:32,870
but the evidence is quite clear.

3806
02:46:32,870 --> 02:46:37,640
It looks to be like the nuclear family
is the minimal viable social unit.

3807
02:46:38,270 --> 02:46:39,440
Now extended families,

3808
02:46:39,680 --> 02:46:44,680
they have the pros and the cons and
maybe a also worker but you can't get it

3809
02:46:44,720 --> 02:46:49,670
smaller than husband and
wife and have things work.

3810
02:46:50,510 --> 02:46:51,440
That's what it looks like.

3811
02:46:51,441 --> 02:46:54,080
And I think the psychological
literature on that is quite clear.

3812
02:46:54,710 --> 02:46:59,060
So can I just get a conversation by the
way with word Fairport who wrote a book

3813
02:46:59,061 --> 02:47:03,500
called the boy crisis and another book
called why men earn more than both of

3814
02:47:03,501 --> 02:47:07,490
those books are for three and Pharaoh
and I have a nice discussion about the

3815
02:47:07,491 --> 02:47:11,100
role that for this plate he really
illuminated something to be,

3816
02:47:11,110 --> 02:47:16,110
he said that his research and indicated
Amnon is primary research review of the

3817
02:47:16,371 --> 02:47:18,280
research that what fathers do.

3818
02:47:18,470 --> 02:47:20,180
This was so cool cause it's so smart.

3819
02:47:20,690 --> 02:47:24,280
I knew already that father's engage in
rough and tumble play with their kids to

3820
02:47:24,281 --> 02:47:27,250
go to it to a higher proportion of degree.

3821
02:47:27,590 --> 02:47:28,221
Women do too,

3822
02:47:28,221 --> 02:47:29,940
but not as much as men tend to do it more.

3823
02:47:30,440 --> 02:47:35,440
And I knew that rough and tumble play
and that kind of exciting exploratory

3824
02:47:35,541 --> 02:47:38,600
physical play was necessary
for the development,

3825
02:47:38,750 --> 02:47:40,940
not only of children of animals as well.

3826
02:47:40,941 --> 02:47:44,060
You'll see the same thing happening with
wraps for example and other sorts of

3827
02:47:44,061 --> 02:47:44,500
mammals.

3828
02:47:44,500 --> 02:47:49,500
They engaging couple of plates for
all sorts of reasons and so that helps

3829
02:47:49,551 --> 02:47:51,380
children understand that when things are,

3830
02:47:51,510 --> 02:47:54,040
when they don't get what
the extent of the body is,

3831
02:47:54,290 --> 02:47:58,070
what's exciting about play and how to
trust someone when the stakes are rather

3832
02:47:58,071 --> 02:48:01,130
highlight when you'd be thrown in the
air and all of these things and how to

3833
02:48:01,131 --> 02:48:04,710
take turns if you're playing with
multiple kids at the same time,

3834
02:48:04,850 --> 02:48:08,410
how not to stick your thumb in your
father's eye and what still finding what's

3835
02:48:08,470 --> 02:48:12,300
exciting and all of these things that
are very complex and sophisticated and

3836
02:48:12,640 --> 02:48:12,900
humble.

3837
02:48:12,900 --> 02:48:17,900
Glade does that in children love it work
like mad and engaging and fathers would

3838
02:48:18,021 --> 02:48:21,830
you'd like it to and it tends to
terrify mothers because mothers are very

3839
02:48:21,831 --> 02:48:23,270
tightly bonded with their children,

3840
02:48:23,271 --> 02:48:24,290
especially when they're young.

3841
02:48:24,560 --> 02:48:26,450
They tend to be more
on the protective side.

3842
02:48:26,630 --> 02:48:27,530
How sticky that way.

3843
02:48:27,531 --> 02:48:28,850
So there has to be that guy now,

3844
02:48:29,300 --> 02:48:34,300
but by Farrell said something
very interesting which
was that his understanding

3845
02:48:34,491 --> 02:48:38,090
is it would fathers do to
scaffold delay of gratification,

3846
02:48:38,120 --> 02:48:40,640
which if that sacrificial
attitude we already talking about,

3847
02:48:40,641 --> 02:48:41,140
you know,

3848
02:48:41,140 --> 02:48:46,140
do something that you don't want to do
now is difficult and don't impulsively

3849
02:48:46,551 --> 02:48:50,750
rewarding so that the future
will be mattered and sort
of the basis of civilized

3850
02:48:50,780 --> 02:48:51,410
endeavor.

3851
02:48:51,410 --> 02:48:54,170
Fundamentally it's the attitude
that's necessary for work.

3852
02:48:54,710 --> 02:48:59,710
Pharaohs notion was that father scaffolded
that by using play as a reward for

3853
02:49:00,891 --> 02:49:04,910
delay of gratification so far doesn't
play with your kids and then that would be

3854
02:49:04,911 --> 02:49:05,430
enough for you.

3855
02:49:05,430 --> 02:49:07,590
Kids want to keep playing
in the folks and look,

3856
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:09,570
you know you can't play all the time.

3857
02:49:09,630 --> 02:49:09,861
Cool,

3858
02:49:09,861 --> 02:49:10,800
clean up your room,

3859
02:49:10,830 --> 02:49:11,820
go do your homework,

3860
02:49:11,821 --> 02:49:12,660
go set the table,

3861
02:49:12,720 --> 02:49:14,100
go do this little task,

3862
02:49:14,101 --> 02:49:16,260
whatever it is and then we'll place.

3863
02:49:16,830 --> 02:49:17,221
I thought,

3864
02:49:17,221 --> 02:49:17,581
God,

3865
02:49:17,581 --> 02:49:21,240
that's so smart because you want to use
a prime member of the board source to

3866
02:49:21,241 --> 02:49:21,950
scaffold them.

3867
02:49:21,950 --> 02:49:24,270
Delayed gratification can use food.

3868
02:49:24,300 --> 02:49:26,580
That's what you scratch
and allowed for example,

3869
02:49:26,581 --> 02:49:28,530
but does not a great morning for kids.

3870
02:49:28,531 --> 02:49:30,840
Only you can use it for your
toilet train for example,

3871
02:49:31,050 --> 02:49:31,980
can be very effective.

3872
02:49:32,280 --> 02:49:36,540
But that idea that what what fathers do
is use play as a scaffold for teaching

3873
02:49:36,541 --> 02:49:37,620
delay of gratification.

3874
02:49:37,621 --> 02:49:38,800
I thought that was plugging really is.

3875
02:49:39,150 --> 02:49:40,260
And so anyways,

3876
02:49:40,261 --> 02:49:42,660
we had quite a lengthy discussion
about the role of fathers.

3877
02:49:43,020 --> 02:49:43,853
So,

3878
02:49:44,400 --> 02:49:45,233
uh,

3879
02:49:45,580 --> 02:49:46,680
let me see here.

3880
02:49:46,750 --> 02:49:50,540
Now this is why I have to stop because
I'm forgetting what the questions are

3881
02:49:50,550 --> 02:49:51,270
now.

3882
02:49:51,270 --> 02:49:51,780
So,

3883
02:49:51,780 --> 02:49:52,613
Oh yes,

3884
02:49:53,260 --> 02:49:54,093
I was

3885
02:49:55,470 --> 02:49:56,110
so,

3886
02:49:56,110 --> 02:49:59,490
so the reason that you set up among
the monogamous relationships as well,

3887
02:49:59,491 --> 02:50:02,730
it's not going to be that it's good for
you and your future self and your wife

3888
02:50:02,731 --> 02:50:04,710
and her future self and
you as a comparable,

3889
02:50:04,711 --> 02:50:06,240
but because it's good for your kids.

3890
02:50:06,820 --> 02:50:09,930
And I think part of the reason that you
take the narrative about was because

3891
02:50:09,931 --> 02:50:11,190
that's the best thing for children.

3892
02:50:11,191 --> 02:50:12,810
And once you have children,

3893
02:50:13,350 --> 02:50:14,790
it's not about you anymore.

3894
02:50:15,330 --> 02:50:17,280
It's not spoken kit.

3895
02:50:18,090 --> 02:50:18,361
So,

3896
02:50:18,361 --> 02:50:21,000
and that I think if the hallmark
of adult responsibility,

3897
02:50:21,480 --> 02:50:23,970
and so play to me is not,

3898
02:50:24,240 --> 02:50:26,640
it's not commensurate
with a fully functional,

3899
02:50:26,641 --> 02:50:30,330
civilized society and it tends to
be generated to anarchic violence.

3900
02:50:30,331 --> 02:50:33,000
And so most cultures evolve
away from it quite wrapping up.

3901
02:50:33,900 --> 02:50:35,400
So that's that.

3902
02:50:35,460 --> 02:50:37,320
And so thank you very much.

3903
02:50:37,550 --> 02:50:42,550
[inaudible].
