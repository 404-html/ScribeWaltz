1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:07,200
So niches idea was that human beings,
we're going to have to create their own

2
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:10,770
values essentially.
Now he understood that we had bodies and

3
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:14,700
that we had motivations and emotions
like he was a romantic thinker in some

4
00:00:14,701 --> 00:00:16,800
sense,
but way ahead of his time because he

5
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:20,940
knew that our capacity to think wasn't
some free floating soul,

6
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:25,590
but was embedded in our physiology,
constrained by our emotion,

7
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:27,780
shaped by our motivation,
shaped by our body.

8
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:31,020
He understood that,
but he still believed that the only

9
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:35,850
possible way out of the problem would be
for human beings themselves to become

10
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:39,210
something akin to God and to create
their own values.

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,730
That was,
that's and he thought that the person he

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,570
talked about the person who could create
their own values as the overmanned or

13
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:48,390
the superman,
and that was one of the parts of

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,150
Nietzschean philosophy that the Nazis,
I would say,

15
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,160
took out of context and used to fuel
their superior man ideology.

16
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,920
So we know what happened with that.
That didn't seem to turn out very well.

17
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:02,640
That's for sure.
