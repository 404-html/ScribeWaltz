1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,700
People turn to possession by very,

2
00:00:02,701 --> 00:00:04,800
very strict ideological ideas.

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:05,460
And you know,

4
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,450
they were willing to be possessed by
those ideas to the point where they would

5
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:13,410
undertake actions that you'd think
would be completely impossible for

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,660
theoretically civilized people.

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:16,560
You know,

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,210
it turned out that those actions,

9
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:18,661
not only,

10
00:00:18,661 --> 00:00:21,390
we're not impossible for civilized people,

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,880
but that the people themselves,

12
00:00:23,881 --> 00:00:24,450
you know,

13
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:25,650
especially in Nazi Germany,

14
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:27,690
they pretty much knew what
the hell was going on.

15
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:28,230
You know,

16
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:31,980
you don't take several million people
out of your population without rumors

17
00:00:31,981 --> 00:00:32,611
spreading,

18
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:33,444
let's say.

19
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:34,171
And so,

20
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:34,411
you know,

21
00:00:34,411 --> 00:00:36,510
we should never forget
that Hitler was elected,

22
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:36,991
you know,

23
00:00:36,991 --> 00:00:39,420
and he was elected by a
large margin majority too.

24
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:40,680
It was a landslide vote.

25
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,190
The kind of vote that no modern
democratic leader ever gets.

26
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:45,593
So,

27
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:46,741
you know,

28
00:00:46,741 --> 00:00:48,210
although it's difficult to,

29
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,460
it's difficult for people to swallow.

30
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,593
Um,

31
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,320
it's hard not to assign culpability for
what happened in Germany to the society

32
00:00:59,671 --> 00:01:00,990
at every strata.

33
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,240
You can't just dump it on the leaders.

34
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,293
And in fact,

35
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,880
one of the things that,

36
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:06,421
here's,

37
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:08,550
here's something to think
about with regards to Hitler.

38
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,121
So,

39
00:01:09,121 --> 00:01:10,800
because one of the
things you might ask is,

40
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:12,360
how the hell could he be so,

41
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,830
so absolutely compelling to his audiences.

42
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:17,220
But here,

43
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,311
here,

44
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:18,630
I'll give you an explanation.

45
00:01:18,631 --> 00:01:19,590
So let's,

46
00:01:19,591 --> 00:01:20,424
let's make the,

47
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,840
let's make a few assumptions.

48
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:26,430
The first assumption is there are a lot
of resentful Germans kicking around.

49
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,713
Why?

50
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,470
Well,

51
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,970
they lost the first world war.

52
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:30,870
That wasn't so good.

53
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,680
And then there were a lot of brutal man
left because they'd been in the trenches

54
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:35,514
and they'd been shooting,

55
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,520
fighting and shooting at each other under
absolutely a Borat conditions for like

56
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:40,921
years and years.

57
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:43,050
And so there were plenty
of brutalized men around.

58
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:44,453
Um,

59
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,210
and then their whole damned economy
collapsed because they were forced into

60
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:51,990
signing what historians regard
is a very punitive peace treaty.

61
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:52,651
And so,

62
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:53,430
like,

63
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,480
everything had fallen apart to a degree
that we can't even begin to imagine.

64
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:58,290
And so,

65
00:01:58,290 --> 00:01:58,890
you know,

66
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,880
in the 1930s,

67
00:01:59,881 --> 00:02:02,130
the Germans were starting to
get back on their feet and,

68
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:02,940
and,

69
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,420
um,

70
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,560
when Hitler came to power,

71
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:07,980
he started not only to rearm but
to reindustrialization the economy.

72
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:09,600
And he was actually
pretty damn good at that.

73
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,270
So now Hitler was a good orator,

74
00:02:12,271 --> 00:02:13,020
but he,

75
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,853
but he,

76
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:16,500
it isn't exactly clear that he was a,

77
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,980
a coherent philosophical fear riser.

78
00:02:19,981 --> 00:02:23,520
Although to think of him as stupid as
it is completely missing the point,

79
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,870
he was by no means stupid.

80
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,100
Um,

81
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,410
I wouldn't say that he
was particularly educated,

82
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,000
but he had a very powerfully developed
aesthetic sense and he spent a lot of his

83
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:36,900
time designing the cities that would
be built after World War II was over in

84
00:02:36,901 --> 00:02:39,630
those cities were generally
conceptualized by him,

85
00:02:39,631 --> 00:02:41,550
has places where the arts,

86
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,580
or at least the Nazi version
of the arts could flourish.

87
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:45,211
You know,

88
00:02:45,211 --> 00:02:49,320
so there's no real evidence that what
was wrong with the Nazis was that they

89
00:02:49,321 --> 00:02:50,520
were civilized.

90
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,750
There's more evidence,

91
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:52,141
actually,

92
00:02:52,141 --> 00:02:53,700
I think that they were
two civil civilized.
