1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,010
Noah was a just man and
perfect in his generations.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,480
And Noah walked with God.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,320
That's an interesting line because if you
remember back in the story of Adam and

4
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:12,040
Eve,

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:16,420
what happens to Adam once he
eats the fruit of the tree,

6
00:00:16,421 --> 00:00:20,050
of the knowledge of good and evil and
wakes up the scales fall from his eyes,

7
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:21,220
become self conscious,

8
00:00:21,221 --> 00:00:24,940
develops the knowledge of good and evil
is he won't walk with God when God calls

9
00:00:24,941 --> 00:00:25,774
him in the garden.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,400
And so Noah is Adam without
the fall essentially.

11
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:33,430
And there's something that
Noah is doing right that

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:40,930
motivates God to spare him or maybe to
show him a pathway through the emergent

13
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:41,351
chaos,

14
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:42,071
something like that.

15
00:00:42,071 --> 00:00:47,071
And that's worth thinking about a lot
because there will be situations in your

16
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:50,320
life where what you face
is the emergent chaos.

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:54,400
And maybe that'll be some terrible
catastrophe inside your family.

18
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,580
Or maybe it'll be something that's
occurring on a much broader social level.

19
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,850
But the chaos is coming and what you're
going to want to know unless you want to

20
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:05,910
be a dentist and of the chaos
or even a contributor to it.

21
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,360
And perhaps that is what you want because
many people under those circumstances

22
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,470
choose that.

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:14,250
What you want is to know

24
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,310
how you build an Ark and get through it.

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,313
That's what you,

26
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:23,591
if you're,

27
00:01:23,591 --> 00:01:25,060
if you're interested in life,

28
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:30,090
if you're interested in proper being and
you're disinclined to produce any more

29
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:31,781
suffering,

30
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:32,561
the necessary,

31
00:01:32,561 --> 00:01:36,880
then you want to know how
to conduct yourself when the
catastrophe comes so that

32
00:01:36,881 --> 00:01:38,830
you have a reasonable possibility of

33
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,330
okay,

34
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,010
of moving through it and,

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,480
and starting a new.

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,040
So when,

37
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:48,010
when this old story says,

38
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,091
well,

39
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:51,310
God's not happy and he's
going to wipe everything out,

40
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,241
it's like,

41
00:01:52,241 --> 00:01:52,421
well,

42
00:01:52,421 --> 00:01:54,190
you might want to take that seriously.

43
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:58,670
And then when it says,

44
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,570
but there's one person who had a motive
being that protected him from that.

45
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,930
That's also something you might want to
take seriously because you might want to

46
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:09,050
know what that mode of being is
because you might need to use it.

47
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,100
And so these sorts of things are
practical in the deepest possible sense.

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,120
They're real in the deepest possible sense
and practical in the deepest possible

49
00:02:17,121 --> 00:02:17,600
sense.
