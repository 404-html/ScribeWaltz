1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:07,080
When I,

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,420
when I talked to friends
or family and I tell them,

3
00:00:09,421 --> 00:00:12,200
what if we don't stop behaving this way,

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,920
it would be you don't stop lying.

5
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:16,230
If you don't become more too
thrilled about what's happening,

6
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,320
then this could end in,

7
00:00:18,321 --> 00:00:18,591
in,

8
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:22,230
in genocide and they just look like,

9
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,400
why are you talking about

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:23,741
you?

11
00:00:23,741 --> 00:00:24,840
I'd always does that.

12
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:25,960
I mean that's true.

13
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,420
There's not even a shock.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,120
Yeah,

15
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:28,361
I know.

16
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:32,080
It shouldn't even be a shark because
it's the natural state of affairs that

17
00:00:32,081 --> 00:00:33,040
always happens.

18
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:33,731
You know,

19
00:00:33,731 --> 00:00:33,931
we,

20
00:00:33,931 --> 00:00:37,210
we also think that there was something
that was in some sense limited to,

21
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,270
well let's say what happened
in Germany in the 20th century,

22
00:00:40,271 --> 00:00:41,740
but it's not limited to that at all.

23
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:42,600
It happens everywhere.

24
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:42,941
Berlin,

25
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:43,421
where I live,

26
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:47,620
it's full of monuments from
the Holocaust museums with,

27
00:00:47,621 --> 00:00:47,800
with,

28
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,210
Oh

29
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:48,950
I know,

30
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:49,783
never forget.

31
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,990
Still it's,

32
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:52,540
it's,

33
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,260
it's not something that we
have internalized somehow that,

34
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:55,420
okay,

35
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,253
then you can read,

36
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,050
you can remember what
you don't understand.

37
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:00,220
Great.

38
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,100
No matter how hard you
try and the issue is,

39
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,830
what does it mean to remember?

40
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,500
But what I know what it means to remember,

41
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,680
like technically if you make a mistake
and you've represented it properly in

42
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,794
your memory,

43
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,870
you don't make the same mistake again.

44
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,910
That's actually what memories for,

45
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,241
right?

46
00:01:19,241 --> 00:01:19,931
Because you think,

47
00:01:19,931 --> 00:01:20,764
well,

48
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,510
why do you remember the past?

49
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,430
Well there's two reasons.

50
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:29,431
One is to repeat things you did well
that worked out and to not repeat things

51
00:01:30,371 --> 00:01:31,330
you did badly.

52
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,660
The purpose of memory is to do that.

53
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:36,670
It's not to represent the world.

54
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,571
I mean it is,

55
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:41,680
but only institute works works basically
and to not do what doesn't work.

56
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:41,981
Yeah,

57
00:01:41,981 --> 00:01:42,491
exactly.

58
00:01:42,491 --> 00:01:46,060
He used to bring the success as into
the future and leave the failures behind

59
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,441
you say,

60
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,800
well we're going to
remember the Holocaust.

61
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:51,460
Okay,

62
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,630
well what are you going to remember?

63
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,470
So humans cannot have like a collective
memory that they used to like a warning

64
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:57,850
signal.

65
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,421
Oh sure.

66
00:01:58,421 --> 00:01:59,171
We do that too.

67
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:00,910
But we have formulated properly.

68
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:01,211
You know,

69
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:02,044
so,

70
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:06,550
so one question while a question and
this question has plagued me forever,

71
00:02:06,551 --> 00:02:07,384
I would say is,

72
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,231
well,

73
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:12,640
what is it that we're supposed to have
learned from what happened in Germany in

74
00:02:12,641 --> 00:02:13,510
the 1930s?

75
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,450
What are we learn that there was
something wrong with Germans?

76
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,560
Is that the lesson?

77
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,510
That's not really a very useful lesson.

78
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,943
Um,

79
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,820
that,

80
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,031
that,

81
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:24,610
that was isolated to
that time and place that,

82
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:29,650
that it was the consequence of
following pathological leadership.

83
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,830
That it was a consequence
of economic turmoil.

84
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,280
And there's all sorts of
things you could learn from it.

85
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,390
My sense is that what needs to be
learned from it is that that's what we're

86
00:02:42,791 --> 00:02:43,624
like.

87
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,480
So it's not this sub culture is a country,

88
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,860
it's not the German and the Dutch sheets,

89
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,410
chimpanzees do it.

90
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:54,340
This is the great
discovery of Jane Goodall,

91
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:54,850
right?

92
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,460
She found that the chimps raided,

93
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,580
you know,

94
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:58,930
and,

95
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,600
and when they were
juveniles in particular,

96
00:03:01,601 --> 00:03:02,434
and when they,

97
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,370
when they're out on the borders of
their territory doing their patrols.

98
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,240
Yeah.

99
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,940
And they came across
chimps from another troop,

100
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:11,650
they tear them to pieces.

101
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:12,581
It's like,

102
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,270
well,

103
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:14,020
okay,

104
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,920
that's not human.

105
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:15,580
That's,

106
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,510
this is deeper than,

107
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,000
it's even deeper than human.

108
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,330
This wasn't,

109
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:21,040
she rolls up we into desk.

110
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:21,903
Absolutely.

111
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:23,181
Yeah.

112
00:03:23,181 --> 00:03:24,310
She was shocked.

113
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,181
She was shocked.

114
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:25,600
Well,

115
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,560
for a bunch of reasons.

116
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:26,801
I mean,

117
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,281
first of all,

118
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:32,140
she was properly cautious because she
thought that human interactions with the

119
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:34,840
chimpanzees might have interfered
with their natural behavior.

120
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:36,460
And that was such a shocking finding.

121
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:37,900
She was unwilling to publish it.

122
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,370
But I also think it violated
her noble savage assumption.

123
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,061
You know,

124
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,550
that the state of nature
was basically good.

125
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,000
And I mean,

126
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:49,950
lots of people think the reason that
human beings are corrupt because they're

127
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,220
socialized to be corrupt.

128
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:51,431
You know,

129
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:52,810
that the reason we're war,

130
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:53,650
like for example,

131
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:56,270
is because we're socialized improperly.

132
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,030
And I mean you can certainly socialize
people to be more or less warlike,

133
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,910
but this is a way deeper problem.

134
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,700
Then mirror socialization,

135
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,391
you know,

136
00:04:07,391 --> 00:04:09,160
even though socialization is very,

137
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:10,030
very important.

138
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,601
So she,

139
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:10,841
yeah,

140
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:12,790
she was very hesitant to publish it,

141
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,051
but she did.

142
00:04:14,051 --> 00:04:14,884
And it's been,

143
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,670
it's become clear in the,

144
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,630
in the decades following that that was
normative behavior for chimpanzees.

145
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,890
So,

146
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,320
but it's also partly the
fact that people have,

147
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,480
we have ourselves backwards.

148
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,970
We always ask stupid questions.

149
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,211
Like,

150
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,350
why are we anxious?

151
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:34,090
That's a stupid question.

152
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,291
The question,

153
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:40,291
the real question is how is it ever
that anyone has ever calm even for a

154
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:41,380
microsecond?

155
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,251
Right?

156
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,310
And it's the case.

157
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,980
Why are we aggressive?

158
00:04:44,981 --> 00:04:45,814
It's like,

159
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,983
no,

160
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,170
how is it that we can
now and then be peaceful?

161
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,430
That's the question.

162
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,760
So we have these things backwards.

163
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,140
We don't understand ourselves and we
can't remember what we don't understand.

164
00:04:59,230 --> 00:04:59,381
Yeah,

165
00:04:59,381 --> 00:05:01,150
you can remember what
you don't understand.

166
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,013
It's uh,

167
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,100
it's a,

168
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:08,100
in some sense to try to remember what
you do and understand is to be in a state

169
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:09,184
of trauma.

170
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,370
And I would say that that
would characterize the Germans.

171
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,300
Hitler was,

172
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,773
um,

173
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:19,150
a singular personality in very creative,

174
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:20,110
very assertive,

175
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,673
um,

176
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,430
and also very good at

177
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:26,890
pattern recognition.

178
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:28,150
It was part of his creativity.

179
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,201
Okay.

180
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,580
So now here's the,

181
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,361
Oh yes,

182
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:32,680
he was a very creative person.

183
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:34,870
Oh yes.

184
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:34,961
Well,

185
00:05:34,961 --> 00:05:37,300
it's part of being creative
is to recognize patterns.

186
00:05:37,301 --> 00:05:39,910
To pick them up unconsciously
because that's what an artist does,

187
00:05:39,911 --> 00:05:43,120
is pick up patterns unconsciously
and then portray them right.

188
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:46,090
And in an attempt to make them conscious
that that's part of the artistic

189
00:05:46,091 --> 00:05:46,924
process.

190
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:47,441
Okay.

191
00:05:47,441 --> 00:05:50,110
So now he's brutalized,

192
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:50,321
right?

193
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:54,010
He went through trench warfare and World
War One and he's thought it because he

194
00:05:54,011 --> 00:05:55,260
wanted to become an artist and,

195
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,260
and he applied to become an artist.

196
00:05:57,261 --> 00:05:58,094
I think it was in,

197
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,660
I think it was in Vienna.

198
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,513
Yeah,

199
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,790
I think it was three times.

200
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:02,330
And he was,

201
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,100
Hebrews rejected all three times.

202
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,323
Homeless.

203
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,590
Many of his friends had been
killed in world war one was brutal.

204
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,080
And there's no evidence that he
was a coward in World War One.

205
00:06:12,081 --> 00:06:13,460
He got a medal for valor,

206
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:14,271
you know,

207
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,040
and if I remember correctly,

208
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,940
there was one time in his life
where he was in trench warfare,

209
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:23,900
is seen with his friends and
he wandered off away from them.

210
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,190
And when he came back,

211
00:06:25,191 --> 00:06:28,040
a mortar had landed in the middle
of the group and killed everyone.

212
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,710
Now that does something to
you psychologically as well,

213
00:06:30,711 --> 00:06:30,921
right?

214
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,510
Because it makes you feel special,

215
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,820
marked out because you didn't die.

216
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:36,020
But everyone else did.

217
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:36,740
Right.

218
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:37,790
So anyways,

219
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,450
so there is Hitler and then he's
surrounded by brutalized man in Germany is

220
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:42,800
completely demolished and,

221
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:43,670
and,

222
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:47,270
and the economy is in shambles in the
communists or threatening and it's like,

223
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:47,991
and then,

224
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,180
and then of course there's
hyperinflation and,

225
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,540
and,

226
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,140
and,

227
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,350
and the Germans all feel betrayed
and it's like it's a mass,

228
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:54,801
a mass,

229
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:57,290
the magnitude of which we
can barely even imagine.

230
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:02,090
And so then he starts talking to
people cause he's not very happy and,

231
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:05,240
and he's willing to go
with the crowd leads him.

232
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,410
That's the thing.

233
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,700
Now the funny thing is,

234
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:12,050
is that a good leader has
a dialogue with the crowd,

235
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:17,270
but a good leader isn't willing to
go wherever the crowd wants to go.

236
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,670
It's a dialogue and not Hitler.

237
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,620
It's not a dialogue precisely.

238
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,311
Or if it is,

239
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:24,140
it's a dialogue with a darker side of it.

240
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:25,340
So this is,

241
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,330
this is what happened.

242
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:31,331
So he stands up in front of the crowd
and he has some oratorical ability so we

243
00:07:31,671 --> 00:07:32,900
can captivate people.

244
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:37,340
And because maybe he is one of those
vessels through which the crowd can speak.

245
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,420
So he says these sentences,

246
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:42,350
nothing happens.

247
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,090
And he says these sentences and he
gets a bit of rise out of the crowd.

248
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,850
And then he says the same sentences,

249
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,010
but he puts a flourish on them and then
it gets a real rise out of the crowd.

250
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:55,640
And the little pattern recognition
module in his mind thinks,

251
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,474
okay,

252
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,710
not so much of that and
quite a bit more of this.

253
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:03,590
And so then he does that again
and he gets a little better at it.

254
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:07,700
And so there's quite a bit more of the
crowd pleasing rhetoric and the crowds

255
00:08:07,701 --> 00:08:12,701
get more enthusiastic and he's watching
and attending and shifting his behavior

256
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,113
pattern.

257
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,093
The pattern,

258
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,340
the pattern is met,

259
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,840
the pattern of the crowds desire is
manifesting itself in his imagination and

260
00:08:20,841 --> 00:08:22,130
he's giving voice to it.

261
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,331
The question is,

262
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:24,020
well,

263
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,770
what does the angry post
war German crowd want?

264
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:33,610
So you could think of Hitler as the
articulated embodiment of the maddened

265
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:35,743
crowd,

266
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,040
right?

267
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,270
And then there's a dynamic,

268
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:38,481
right?

269
00:08:38,481 --> 00:08:40,910
So the crowd boot broadcasts,

270
00:08:40,911 --> 00:08:42,290
it's resentment to the leader,

271
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,010
and the leader says,

272
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:43,191
oh,

273
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:44,720
this is what you mean in the crowd goes,

274
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:45,554
yes,

275
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
that's what we mean.

276
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,260
And then they get more fired up and,

277
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,820
and,

278
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,400
and the leader listens and
recognizes the pattern,

279
00:08:52,401 --> 00:08:52,641
says,

280
00:08:52,641 --> 00:08:54,200
so this is what you want?

281
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,800
And the crowd goes yes.

282
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,540
And feedback loop.

283
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,120
Right then he was very good at that.

284
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,631
He was,

285
00:09:00,631 --> 00:09:05,631
you willing to use the gift of his voice
in the service of the darkest desire of

286
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:09,000
the maddened crowd.

287
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,950
While it's like calling Satan himself
up from the depths to good enough

288
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:14,521
metaphor,

289
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:15,354
men,

290
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,580
unless someone can come
up with a better one,

291
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,930
like that's a good one.
