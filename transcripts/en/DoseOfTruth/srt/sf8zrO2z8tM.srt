1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,000
And the keeper of the prison
committed to Joseph's hand.

2
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:11,400
All the prisoners that were
in the prison whatsoever,

3
00:00:11,401 --> 00:00:13,080
they did there he was the doer of it.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:16,530
The keeper of the prison look not to
anything that was under his hand because

5
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:17,400
the Lord was with him.

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:18,240
And that what she did,

7
00:00:18,241 --> 00:00:19,530
the Lord made it to prosper.

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,780
So it's a repeat.

9
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:28,660
It's a repeat of exactly what happened
when he was the slave of the pharaoh,

10
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:31,010
except it's one rung deeper into hell,

11
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:31,661
so to speak.

12
00:00:31,661 --> 00:00:31,901
Right?

13
00:00:31,901 --> 00:00:35,530
So it's slave pharaoh and here
it's prisoner jail master,

14
00:00:35,531 --> 00:00:36,580
but it doesn't matter.

15
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,510
The same thing happens.

16
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:42,040
So now Joseph has imprisoned and the
Pharaoh has a fit one day of peak and

17
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,330
throws the chief of his Butler's into
prison and the chief of his bakers and

18
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:47,170
they have a dream,

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,980
each of them.

20
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:48,390
And,

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,223
uh,

22
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,020
Joseph interprets the dreams,

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,090
just seems to be something that he can do.

24
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:55,283
And uh,

25
00:00:55,530 --> 00:01:00,530
he tells the Butler that history means
that the f Pharaoh was going to forgive

26
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,620
him and put him back in his position
and he tells the baker that the Pharaoh

27
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:07,340
isn't going to forgive him.

28
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:10,370
And that he's going to take off
his head and hang them in a tree,

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,980
which rather rough dream.

30
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:13,963
But that is what happens.

31
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:14,960
That's what happens.

32
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,130
So anyways,

33
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:19,130
that the baker or the Butler
goes free and Joseph says,

34
00:01:19,131 --> 00:01:19,371
look,

35
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:19,641
you know,

36
00:01:19,641 --> 00:01:21,950
maybe you could just keep
in mind the fact that I

37
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,820
did you a bit of a favor here and told
you something that was accurate but that

38
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,460
the chief didn't really remember once he,

39
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,600
once he was freed

40
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,810
interpreting dreams in prison.

41
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:42,390
And so now the pharaoh has a dream
and he actually has two dreams.

42
00:01:42,531 --> 00:01:44,540
So it's another one of
those doubled motifs.

43
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:49,541
So the idea is these are really important
dreams because they came in a pair and

44
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,620
behold there came out of the river
seven well favored kind and fat fleshed,

45
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:57,490
so cattle and they fed the meadow,

46
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:01,750
meadow and behold seven other
cattle came up after the motive.

47
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,360
The river ill favored and lean fleshed,

48
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:09,130
starving and stood by the other cows
on the brink of the river and the ill

49
00:02:09,131 --> 00:02:14,131
favored and lean fleshed kind did eat
up the seven well favored and fat.

50
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:15,881
So feral,

51
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,900
it woke pay,

52
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:17,500
fair enough.

53
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,760
It's pretty nasty dream.

54
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:24,810
And then he has another dream big go to
hit it home and he slept and dreamt the

55
00:02:25,001 --> 00:02:25,601
second time.

56
00:02:25,601 --> 00:02:30,601
And behold seven years of corn came up
upon one stock rank and good and behold

57
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,080
seven thin years and blasted with the
east wind sprung up after them and the

58
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:38,140
seven thin years devoured the
seven rank and full years.

59
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:42,820
And Pharaoh woke and beheld it was a
dream and then it says a little later.

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,880
And for that the dream was
doubled unto Pharaoh twice.

61
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,270
It is because the thing is established
by God and God will shortly bring it to

62
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:50,050
pass.

63
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,771
It's interesting,

64
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:50,951
you know,

65
00:02:50,951 --> 00:02:55,750
because one of the better theories about
dreams is that they're part of the way

66
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:59,380
that the right and left hemisphere
communicate or maybe the nonverbal of the

67
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:01,030
brain communicates with the verbal brain,

68
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,260
verbal part of the brain.

69
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,800
And so the nonverbal part of the brain
which is less differentiated and thinks

70
00:03:09,071 --> 00:03:09,821
more globally,

71
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:13,420
is looking for patterns
and anomalies in the world.

72
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,800
Things that don't fit well with the
current way of conceptualizing the world.

73
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,280
Things that make you anxious and
uncertain and those are things you haven't

74
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:21,791
mastered,

75
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:21,971
right?

76
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:25,750
So they don't fit well into your
conception of realization of the world by

77
00:03:25,751 --> 00:03:26,380
definition.

78
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,090
Because if you had mastered them,

79
00:03:28,091 --> 00:03:29,110
they wouldn't make you anxious,

80
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:29,890
nervous.

81
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:33,790
And so the the nonverbal parts of
your brain or like an alarm system,

82
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:38,350
they're looking around for places where
you're probably wrong and then they put

83
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:43,351
those in images and try to conceptualize
them so that you can update your model

84
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:45,130
of reality to take them into account.

85
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:47,620
But that also produces a
fair bit of negative emotion,

86
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:48,790
especially at night.

87
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,433
And so,

88
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,090
so we know that we know if you deprive
people of dreams that they go insane very

89
00:03:58,091 --> 00:03:58,660
rapidly.

90
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,710
Animals as well,

91
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,840
necessary part of mental equilibrium.

92
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,490
The way you do that with rats in Casey
want to know is that you've got rats that

93
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:07,324
you want to drive insane.

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,273
This is how you do it.

95
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,270
So you put the rat on a like a pedestal.

96
00:04:12,271 --> 00:04:13,270
It's pretty small.

97
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,530
And then when he fought,

98
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,110
that's surrounded by water
and then when he falls asleep,

99
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:18,910
his nose hits the water,

100
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:19,631
then he wakes up.

101
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:21,340
And so you can deprive the route of sleep.

102
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,600
And that doesn't,

103
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:26,440
the rats don't respond to that very
well after some period of time.

104
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,240
So that's one of the ways
that that's been discovered.

105
00:04:31,241 --> 00:04:32,074
But anyways,

106
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,300
the dream does seem to
be an update mechanism.

107
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:35,650
And so if,

108
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,100
if,

109
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,630
if you have a very powerful dream,

110
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,470
like a nightmare,

111
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,790
especially if it's repeating,

112
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,840
it's like something is trying to hammer
on the door that needs to be let in,

113
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,420
and often you don't know
how to let it in and that's,

114
00:04:46,421 --> 00:04:47,200
that's a problem.
