1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:07,660
In the United States,

2
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:10,090
we have about 330 million people.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,510
And because of the distribution,

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,840
relatively normal
distribution of Iq scores,

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:22,140
about 16% have iqs of 85 or two means
they're not going to graduate school.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,241
No,

7
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:27,170
it means that from,

8
00:00:27,171 --> 00:00:28,610
from what I've read practically,

9
00:00:28,611 --> 00:00:31,370
it means the wonderlic company
has actually done a really,

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,830
they have a nice I cute tennis
from the commercial perspective,

11
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:34,011
you know,

12
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:38,900
it's actually psychometrically valid
and they've linked Iq levels to,

13
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:39,370
uh,

14
00:00:39,370 --> 00:00:41,900
to job specifically the job categories,

15
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:42,734
you know?

16
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:43,610
No,

17
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,510
not a lot.

18
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,540
I was going to say is they're not
only not going to graduate school,

19
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,900
they're not going to find a stable
job that pays a livable wage.

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,220
Yeah.

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:56,351
Now,

22
00:00:56,351 --> 00:01:00,180
especially even given that so many of
the service jobs now require a fair high

23
00:01:00,181 --> 00:01:03,220
degree of computational
savvy or leader built,

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,780
no,

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,620
not computation,

26
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:09,390
but ability to interact with complex
computational technology loves the typical

27
00:01:09,391 --> 00:01:14,391
till Latta and a checkout market or the
till at a Mcdonald's because Mcdonald's

28
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:16,080
is actually very complicated,

29
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,010
is often far beyond the ability of
people who are on the low end of the

30
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:21,300
intelligence distribution.

31
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,410
And they claimed,

32
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,940
I think it was wonderlic,

33
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,751
although it might know,

34
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,470
it might've been,

35
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:27,180
it might've been hunt.

36
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,373
What's his name?

37
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,280
Uh,

38
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,300
Iq researcher.

39
00:01:30,301 --> 00:01:31,140
He said Earl haunt,

40
00:01:31,141 --> 00:01:36,141
I think possibly what he claimed that
that if you have an Iq of below 90,

41
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:38,790
that it's,

42
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,780
it's difficult.

43
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:44,250
It's difficult for you to read well enough
to translate what you're reading into

44
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:44,940
action.

45
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,580
So you can't actually read
instructions and follow them.

46
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,320
You don't have that level of literacy.

47
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,363
That's correct.

48
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,413
Yeah.

49
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,740
I was going to say that in,

50
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:54,030
in the United States,

51
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,900
this bottom 16% translates
into 51 million people.

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,830
Right.

53
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,460
Including 13 million
children who are in school.

54
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,450
Right.

55
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,520
This is a very difficult problem.

56
00:02:08,521 --> 00:02:08,731
You know,

57
00:02:08,731 --> 00:02:09,540
I knew where Ohio,

58
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,150
he passed away when I
knew him pretty well.

59
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:17,300
He also would say that there is this
a cognitive segregation in society.

60
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:22,920
This is a point that Charles Murray makes.

61
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:23,580
Yeah.

62
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,080
Well,

63
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,640
and Earl would often ask,

64
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:26,280
uh,

65
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:26,490
you know,

66
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,080
when's the last time you had someone
over for dinner who wasn't a college

67
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,943
graduate?

68
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:32,491
Well,

69
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:35,550
that was something that Marie and her
Bernstein wrote about in their book the

70
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:36,181
bell curve,

71
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:38,310
which really struck me because
I read that book twice,

72
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:40,260
unlike most of the people criticized it.

73
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,880
And you know,

74
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,670
we're one of the things that
they pointed out in there,

75
00:02:44,671 --> 00:02:44,851
it was,

76
00:02:44,851 --> 00:02:45,530
look,

77
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,920
the,

78
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,753
the typical,

79
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:52,110
the typical educated person thinks that
someone isn't very bright if they have

80
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:55,250
an Iq of 150 grand.

81
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,760
How'd you at graduate level,

82
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:01,420
Phd level research
institutions cause 115 there's,

83
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:05,560
there's as many people at 115
above as there are at 85 and below.

84
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,780
And so it's a minority of the population
and that's the top 15% and you know,

85
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,230
that's,

86
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,300
that's the dollar undergraduate,

87
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,171
right?

88
00:03:14,171 --> 00:03:15,004
So why don't you just,

89
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:15,731
people have to see,

90
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:18,160
I'm a clinical psychologist
and I've dealt with people who,

91
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,450
how do I ranges in the low eighties and
tried to find them jobs and tried to

92
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:22,871
train them.

93
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:27,871
And I have some real knowledge about the
stunning gap between people at the low

94
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:30,010
end of the EICU distribution
and the high end.

95
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:30,620
And it's,

96
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,600
it's no bloody wonder.

97
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,950
People hate Iq research and intelligence
research because it reveals a set of

98
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:36,850
seriously,

99
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:37,900
uh,

100
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,900
dismal facts about the incredible
range of ability among human beings.

101
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,500
Yes.

102
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,333
Um,

103
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,170
this is true.

104
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:48,280
And Moreover,

105
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,210
I would add to this that
people in universities,

106
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,540
professors and couple
of graduate students,

107
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,690
uh,

108
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:59,440
have a hard time understanding what the,

109
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:01,450
what everyday life is.

110
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,284
Like.

111
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:07,290
If you have an Iq of 85
and we're making your way,

112
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,800
you're living independently,

113
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:10,600
you were making your way in the world,

114
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,110
but it is a challenge.

115
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,240
It is a really,

116
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,870
I mean,

117
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,370
uh,

118
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:17,910
just,

119
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,140
just barely begins to describe it.

120
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:20,750
I had a,

121
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:25,750
I had a client who he probably had an Iq
of under 80 and nonverbal portion of it

122
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:26,771
anyways.

123
00:04:26,771 --> 00:04:27,500
And,

124
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:27,970
um,

125
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,490
he was indistinguishable in
physical appearance from,

126
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:31,900
from let's say,

127
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,300
I hate to use the frame normal person,

128
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:36,940
but there's nothing mark
that mark Timm out about,

129
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:38,680
particularly intellectually impaired,

130
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:39,543
you know,

131
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:40,001
and,

132
00:04:40,001 --> 00:04:40,630
uh,

133
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,770
I tried at one point,

134
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:42,940
this is this,

135
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:43,720
this was so,

136
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,160
so telling to me.

137
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,760
I got him an inch,

138
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,880
a volunteer job,

139
00:04:48,881 --> 00:04:49,421
which by the way,

140
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:50,231
it's very difficult.

141
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:53,440
It's harder to get a volunteer job in a
real job because you have to do police

142
00:04:53,441 --> 00:04:54,730
screening and all sorts of things.

143
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:56,650
And the selection process
is just as extreme.

144
00:04:56,651 --> 00:04:59,920
But I eventually ended up getting
him a job at a bike store,

145
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:00,981
bike,

146
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:01,361
slash,

147
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:06,361
bookstore and at that place couldn't
hold him once the subsidy program had

148
00:05:06,491 --> 00:05:06,970
expired.

149
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:11,970
And then I got him a job at a charity and
his job was to fold letters into three

150
00:05:13,841 --> 00:05:15,670
so that they can be put into envelopes.

151
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:21,150
Well that sounds easy except that he
also had a bit of a motor tremor and you

152
00:05:21,211 --> 00:05:21,970
know,

153
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,970
it took me about 30 hours to train
him to fold up a piece of paper with

154
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:31,300
sufficient precision so that it can be
put in an envelope rapidly so that the

155
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:35,350
envelope wasn't so mangled that it
would get stuck in the automatic sorting

156
00:05:35,351 --> 00:05:36,184
machine.

157
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,590
And another is high
performance demands on him too.

158
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:43,390
He had to whip through those letters
pretty quickly and then sometimes the

159
00:05:43,391 --> 00:05:48,160
letters would have a photograph appended
to them that was stapled on and they

160
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:50,200
weren't always stapled
on in the same place.

161
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,460
So then he had to calculate how to fold
the paper over the photograph without

162
00:05:54,461 --> 00:05:59,030
bending the photograph in precise third
so that would still fit in the envelope.

163
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:04,040
And then he had to separate the French
letters from the English letters and

164
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:08,120
associate them with the proper envelopes
and like that level of complexity just

165
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,960
did him in.

166
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,570
Let me say two things about this.

167
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,590
One is I hope common sense and the other
is pretty provocative but common sense

168
00:06:18,831 --> 00:06:19,130
things.

169
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,130
We had to be very careful when we have
these discussions not to devalue the

170
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:29,420
human dignity of people who aren't
in the upper end of the distribution.

171
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,820
And if there's one criticism that I
think is fair as sometimes in these

172
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:35,780
conversations,

173
00:06:35,781 --> 00:06:40,781
it sounds like we're devaluing people at
the lower end and the distribution and

174
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,360
we have to be very careful
that we don't do that.

175
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,810
A human life has dignity and Iq was not
the most important thing that defines

176
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:52,610
human gifts and beams.

177
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,410
EAGAN,

178
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:53,560
it's

179
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,150
not associated with wisdom.

180
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:59,560
It's not necessarily associated with
truth or with courage or with many virtues

181
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,523
that

182
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,310
you like it at all with being
likable there or on time.

183
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,070
How many of all,

184
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,590
we know the psychometric test,

185
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,120
the psychometric relationship between
intelligence and conscientiousness is

186
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:13,954
zero.

187
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,793
Right?

188
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,390
We have to make that point.

189
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,340
Yes,

190
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,010
I agree.

191
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,843
I agree.

192
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:22,690
I'm trying to make the point about how
difficult it is for people who are on the

193
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:25,320
low end of the cognitive
spectrum to survive in a,

194
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,250
in an increasingly complex,

195
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:29,470
cognitively sophisticated environment.

196
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,101
Right.

197
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:31,600
Your obs are just disappearing.
