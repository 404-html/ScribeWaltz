1
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,181
Daniel,

2
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:13,090
how to be a good partner to
someone suffering from depression.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,471
That's a tough one,

4
00:00:14,471 --> 00:00:15,280
man.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,980
It's very hard to live with someone
who's suffering from depression.

6
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,670
We are helping without enabling and
pushing without being too judgmental.

7
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:23,290
Well,

8
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:23,681
again,

9
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:24,910
the devil's in the details.

10
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:28,140
Is the person seeing a counselor
because if they're depressed,

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,700
then they need to talk to someone.

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,470
Have they tried antidepressants?

13
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:33,670
Because if they're depressed,

14
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,380
they should try antidepressants.

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,903
Okay.

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,640
And they should be strongly
encouraged to do so.

17
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:45,570
And maybe that encouragement should even
border on a demand because depression

18
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:45,961
is just,

19
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,710
it's terrible.

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,750
It's terrible for the person
who's experiencing it,

21
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:50,250
like unalterably terrible.

22
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,593
Um,

23
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,080
and it's terrible for the person who
is living with the person who has

24
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:58,621
depression.

25
00:00:58,621 --> 00:01:02,670
And so it's incumbent on the person who
has depression to do everything they

26
00:01:02,671 --> 00:01:06,690
possibly can in order to set it straight.

27
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:07,351
And it's hard.

28
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:08,070
But you know,

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:11,550
there's lots of potential treatments for
depression that have some efficacy in

30
00:01:11,551 --> 00:01:12,301
antidepressants.

31
00:01:12,301 --> 00:01:14,010
Really do work wonders on people.

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,380
You could try five hydroxy tryptamine too.

33
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,131
You could look that up.

34
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:18,420
Five HTP,

35
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,970
it's usually three times
a hundred milligrams.

36
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,090
Um,

37
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:22,561
and you can,

38
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:23,371
if you try that,

39
00:01:23,371 --> 00:01:26,670
sometimes you can find out
if antidepressants will
work for you without having

40
00:01:26,671 --> 00:01:28,950
to resort to the
antidepressants themselves.

41
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,150
Um,

42
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,390
you can also help the depressed
person make a plan in the morning.

43
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,170
That can be really useful or maybe a
plan the night before if they're just not

44
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,430
in any shape to do it in the morning,

45
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,480
to sit down and say,

46
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:39,811
okay,

47
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:41,970
well you have to get through tomorrow.

48
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:43,830
And that's another good,

49
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,290
that's another good piece of advice.

50
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,960
And so in rule 12,

51
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:52,500
I talk about that sometimes
in relationship to depression,

52
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:55,230
real 12 is pet a cat when you
encounter one on the street.

53
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:58,410
And it's a bit of a meditation about
what to do when your life is in absolute

54
00:01:58,411 --> 00:01:59,220
crisis.

55
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,630
But one of the things you can do with
someone who's depressed is narrow.

56
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,470
And this is what I discuss in this
chapter is narrow their timeframe.

57
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,071
You know,

58
00:02:08,071 --> 00:02:10,710
maybe a depressed person
can't think a week ahead,

59
00:02:10,711 --> 00:02:13,770
but maybe they can think about
tomorrow and you can sit down and say,

60
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:14,041
okay,

61
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,390
well you have to get through tomorrow.

62
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,690
And so how are we going to structure
tomorrow so that it will be okay and so

63
00:02:18,691 --> 00:02:21,870
that you'll be able to sleep reasonably
soundly when you go to bed tomorrow

64
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:21,871
night.

65
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:24,090
And then tomorrow night
we'll do the same thing.

66
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,000
And helping someone come up
with a daily plan can be,

67
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,060
now they might object and
squawk and complain about it,

68
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:31,200
but you should be.

69
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:31,860
Um,

70
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,080
I would say relatively
persistent about that.

71
00:02:34,081 --> 00:02:34,591
And you can say,

72
00:02:34,591 --> 00:02:34,861
look,

73
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:36,330
let's just try it for a week.

74
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,500
And if they say no,

75
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:37,951
then you say,

76
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:38,071
well,

77
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:39,780
let's try it for one day.

78
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:40,650
You know,

79
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,220
Christ,

80
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,230
the person's got to be
pretty unreasonable if they,

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,870
let's plan for 10 minutes
just for tomorrow,

82
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:47,040
and see if that's helpful.

83
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:47,700
You know,

84
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,720
if the person objects,

85
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:52,650
you can keep cutting the magnitude of
what you're asking down until you finally

86
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:53,484
get a bit of a,

87
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,290
a bit of an agreement from them.

88
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,840
But helping someone depressed
plan can help a lot.
