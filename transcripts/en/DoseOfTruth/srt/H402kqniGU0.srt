1
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,223
Okay.

2
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,490
What happens when you're
facing by something that
you really don't understand?

3
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,300
Partly what happens is
each of who you partner,

4
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,530
why you don't hear any popping up,

5
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:45,750
all sorts of dramatic theories
about what they might have.

6
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:46,584
Really be humble,

7
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:47,670
right?

8
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,110
There's paranoia and doubt and cynicism
and bitterness and all of that,

9
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:54,120
but that's your right hemisphere time,

10
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,600
naked picture of reality into
generating these fantasies.

11
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:01,500
Trying to come up with an account that
makes sense of what happened and that's

12
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,540
the way the company cope with
radically new information.

13
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:06,600
Something like that,

14
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,490
except the TV more complicated,

15
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,590
and I'm telling you all this because
I want to specify how is what.

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:19,610
I want to specify why it's necessary to
go to the deepest level of analysis and

17
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,020
to try to understand what's there.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,480
The more mysterious something is,

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,810
the more you have to use your imagination.

20
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,090
In some senses it's representative
because you do need to,

21
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,020
what did you fantasize
and hypothesize about?

22
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:33,903
Gaffney dream.

23
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:36,863
Okay,

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,140
you'll this office,

25
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,540
but dreams

26
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,410
concentrated on what we eat.

27
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,820
So the part of your brain tells me,

28
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,790
hey,

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,420
some things in the normal world,

30
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,560
but that doesn't work perfectly because
what you know doesn't work perfectly.

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,550
And so you started recruiting errors
along the way and then your right

32
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,900
hemisphere collects those areas.

33
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,060
It starts to try to figure
out what to do about them.

34
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:02,931
If you wait,

35
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,060
people have on their CP and the dreaming,

36
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,830
the most common emotion they related to
his anxiety and it's because at night

37
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:13,310
what you do is tried to reconfigure what
you know to take into account what you

38
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:14,060
don't know.

39
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,980
And that's an anxiety provoking process
and use notion with regards to dream

40
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:19,620
analysis,

41
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,800
it was the same with sport to
some degree was that you could,

42
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,320
if people were facing
an attractable mystery,

43
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,790
they didn't know how to proceed.

44
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,540
So for example,

45
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,770
then you come and see me,

46
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,380
you're not happy in your job that you
don't want to give it up because of the

47
00:02:30,381 --> 00:02:34,520
security or like it's a
complicated situation and you
can't see any way forward.

48
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,631
Then I might say,

49
00:02:35,631 --> 00:02:37,220
well do you dream?

50
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,900
And if you said yes,

51
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,100
some people drink a lot.

52
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:40,940
And remember it.

53
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:45,290
And we might take a look at your dreams
to see if he could catch the new story

54
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:49,130
that's emerging Hunter d your knowledge
about where it is that you might go.

55
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,151
And that can be very,

56
00:02:50,151 --> 00:02:55,130
very illuminating and people differ in
the complexity and sophistication of

57
00:02:55,131 --> 00:02:56,810
their drinks and their
ability to remember that.

58
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:58,590
But we also might fucking your fantasies.

59
00:02:58,591 --> 00:03:02,260
So maybe know you have your fantasy about
what you really liked to say to your

60
00:03:02,261 --> 00:03:04,300
boss and it's a fairly Weldon,

61
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,430
I'm seeing in your head embarrassed about
it because it's kind of violence and

62
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,520
well,

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,690
tell me about the fantasy.

64
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,680
Do you lay it out?

65
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,560
That's fine.

66
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,660
We can take weekend at the seeds of who
you might be calm because maybe you're

67
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:19,831
in,

68
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm standing up for yourself
and not for your boss.

69
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:22,670
It's time to retire,

70
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,450
right?

71
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,450
And so you have this fantasy that you
rooted in the then ladies out at the

72
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:30,630
landscape of what look
like if you find it,

73
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,940
you just got up enough courage to march
in there and say exactly what you had to

74
00:03:33,941 --> 00:03:34,774
say.

75
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,400
And so that's something you want.

76
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:40,240
And if you're thinking about changing
careers and we want to figure out what you

77
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:40,691
want,

78
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:43,960
and so she can look up when you're
fantasizing about what you wanted,

79
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:46,480
maybe you could find some
seeds of what you want.

80
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,381
You might say,

81
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:47,920
well,

82
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,070
you're not going to be happy in the next
job regardless of what you do unless

83
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:54,640
you become somewhat more assertive because
he was just carried the same problem

84
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,260
into your next jobs would be the problem.

85
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,580
And the problem is this,

86
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:03,581
that you're not doing enough of what you
really need to do to thrive in work and

87
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:05,200
you can try to solve that problem.

88
00:04:05,201 --> 00:04:07,780
And then we started figuring out whether
that would also mean that you would

89
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:09,010
have to shift careers.

90
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,820
And so that's how you can
use to be analysis of say,

91
00:04:11,821 --> 00:04:13,840
fantasies and dreams to shed light on,

92
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,560
on how it is that the person
might conduct themselves.

93
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,793
No,

94
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,140
this is where it gets tricky.

95
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,250
Casey hasn't got treats,

96
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:32,863
Huh?

97
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:41,550
All right.

98
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,100
So here's another way that you can
figure out how to act in the world.

99
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,600
Let's say your your child,

100
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,490
and there's a lot here.

101
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,720
So how do you handle that?

102
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:55,621
Well,

103
00:04:55,621 --> 00:04:57,300
you stay the simplified environment,

104
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,453
right?

105
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,430
You don't crawl out onto the
street with your 10 months old.

106
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,960
Parents aren't like you do that.

107
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,561
They keep you in.

108
00:05:04,561 --> 00:05:07,650
The family did and they
keep you close to them.

109
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,050
And what you do is,

110
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,150
you know,

111
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:15,890
which isn't very much mostly it's how
quick things in your vote and investigate

112
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,160
cause that's her,

113
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,210
that's what kids do.

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,930
And at the smiling kids
to play a little bit,

115
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:26,270
but it's a frat house piece of
knowledge and it's easily disrupted.

116
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:27,930
And when it's disrupted,

117
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,773
you cry.

118
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,930
And that's a signal of the disruption.

119
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,000
And then your parents move in.

120
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:37,290
If they're a greater knowledge and they
fix whatever the problems and what you

121
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:42,291
do is you watch and imitate what I'd
like you to know what the rep can you,

122
00:05:42,641 --> 00:05:44,850
cause you're not sophisticated
enough to know what they're up to.

123
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,060
No child can you give a full town
with the behavior of the parents?

124
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,511
No.

125
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,390
Parents should give a
full account of her own.

126
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,100
Me.

127
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,160
You certainly country
expect that from a child.

128
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,790
But children obviously grow up to
take care of their own children.

129
00:05:56,791 --> 00:06:00,140
Just like animals grow up to
take care of their own offspring,

130
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,330
never knowing what they're doing.

131
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,160
Exactly.

132
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,160
So you learn by mutation and what that
means is that collectively we've faced

133
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:13,160
things that we didn't understand for very,

134
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:17,660
very long period of time and we've
figured out how to act so that it works.

135
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,400
But we don't know.

136
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:23,030
We don't know the rules that underlie
that makes up you don't know exactly what

137
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:23,864
that means.

138
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,430
We just figured it out.

139
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:29,680
So there's was a way of
being a good product.

140
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,760
Let's say there's a way
being a good mother,

141
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:34,910
mostly you understand what that is.

142
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,990
We you fail.

143
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,131
Or when your child,

144
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,600
he accuses you of failing at it,

145
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,230
right?

146
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,320
Because it's only in the failure that
you realized that you deviate from

147
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:44,160
whatever the ideal is because you're not,

148
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:47,660
who the hell knows what the rules
are for being a good father?

149
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,550
It's very difficult to detail them,

150
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,190
but you know when you failed.

151
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:51,771
Okay,

152
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:56,290
so you know how to be a controlling and
you know that because you imitated your

153
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:56,691
father.

154
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:58,010
And he indicated his father,

155
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,190
his father,

156
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,140
and it's like waiting way back
as far as you can possibly joke.

157
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,280
That's the rule.

158
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,420
We also know that,

159
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:05,781
and here's,

160
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:10,040
here's an example of what have a cloth
called colleague at the University of

161
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,940
Toronto who spends a maternal behavior
tracks and you're actually very

162
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,790
sophisticated.

163
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,440
They have somewhat of a cultural
state pass on through imitators.

164
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:22,330
But if you take rap cops
away from their mother and,

165
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:23,160
and,

166
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,580
and treat the Webinar
so that they live in,

167
00:07:25,581 --> 00:07:26,540
which is not that easy,

168
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:31,460
by the way is feeding them and giving
them enough water and warmth and so forth

169
00:07:31,461 --> 00:07:32,000
isn't enough.

170
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,490
You also have to attend it to them.

171
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:37,610
You have to touch the plaintiff
and won't they die anyways.

172
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:41,120
If you take the rep hops away from their
mother and then you let those routes

173
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:45,950
grow up and after round tops and then
those that grow up and have red pumps,

174
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:46,843
et Cetera,

175
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:50,360
you find that the maternal behavior
is disruptive for three generations.

176
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,970
So that shows you why you need that
imitative continuity in order to keep

177
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:59,690
knowledge that's implicit
propagating into a culture.

178
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,810
So once it's disruptive,

179
00:08:02,811 --> 00:08:05,700
it's very difficult to
locals once again ask.

180
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,063
So

181
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,500
we've learned how to be good and bad by
trial and error for very long periods of

182
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,624
time.

183
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,940
We've learned that with imaging that
from the people that we see who are good

184
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,083
and bad,

185
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,060
we've learned how to embody that.

186
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,510
And so we carry that
with us in our actions.

187
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,350
Now you actually include this
in quite a sophisticated way,

188
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,710
even though if you can't
describe it exactly.

189
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,480
So let's say you go to a party and
there's someone that gets annoying and

190
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:44,820
they're annoying because they tell jokes
that aren't funny and they've been help

191
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,270
license conversation and,

192
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:50,600
and they don't pay any attention to
anyone else because they're full of micro

193
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,473
errors.

194
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,360
That made me socially tolerable.

195
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:54,943
And so what,

196
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,910
what they are doing is easy.

197
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,210
Anything from her in person,

198
00:08:58,860 --> 00:08:59,580
right?

199
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,450
That's why they were annoying,

200
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,933
obviously,

201
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,940
because they're not engaging
the way they should be hated.

202
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,990
And you can tell that
because they're annoying.

203
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:11,040
And so what that means is that you have
an ideal that you're expecting from

204
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,210
other people all the time.

205
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,500
That that isn't the case.

206
00:09:13,501 --> 00:09:15,030
Because wherever we go,

207
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,590
we meet people and we expect
that they will act out the ideal.

208
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,680
And when they don't want we knows.

209
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:25,710
But that doesn't mean you can say what
it is cause you know you might go home

210
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:27,750
with your partner and
say I was that person.

211
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:28,640
So in the way,

212
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,650
and then you guess a bunch out.

213
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,500
Right.

214
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,430
But it's hard to specify it because you
don't move the ideal that you don't know

215
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,870
exactly what it was to break through.

216
00:09:36,871 --> 00:09:38,640
It's very difficult to
meet this articulate,

217
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:40,650
but you do have the an ideal in mind.

218
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,150
Okay.

219
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:47,150
So what that means is stuff we can act
out and conceptualizing this deal before

220
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:54,150
we could describe the words
what that ideal he is.
