Hi Jp.

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:12,810
I'm wondering how the computer program
that rates university courses as

3
00:00:12,811 --> 00:00:13,920
worthwhile or not.

4
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:15,210
It's coming along well.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,400
It isn't rating them as worthwhile.

6
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:21,240
It's rating them as postmodern Neil
Marxist or not and it's actually fully

7
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:22,074
developed.

8
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,000
I was going to launch it and I didn't,

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,590
I didn't design it.

10
00:00:25,591 --> 00:00:25,860
Uh,

11
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,850
somebody volunteered to design it and
presented it to me and it seems to work

12
00:00:29,851 --> 00:00:30,684
very well.

13
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:31,290
Um,

14
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,070
I was going to launch it at the end of
August so that this year's university

15
00:00:35,071 --> 00:00:36,480
students could benefit from it.

16
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:41,220
But there was the Charlottesville event
and then I got busy and I also wasn't

17
00:00:41,221 --> 00:00:45,510
feeling great and so I just didn't
hit the window of time properly.

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:50,540
But I hope to be able to launch it for
the January incoming class to do a video

19
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:53,400
about what's wrong with
the university system,

20
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,520
that many things that are wrong with
the university system and to launch the

21
00:00:56,521 --> 00:00:57,720
website at the same time.

22
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,560
Also had people suggest to me that maybe
it wasn't a good idea that it would

23
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,540
increase polarization,

24
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,360
but I've thought about that
for about a month and a half.

25
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:08,640
And I think that the
benefit to the consumer,

26
00:01:08,641 --> 00:01:12,830
so that would be the informed student
outweighs any danger of polarization.

27
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:13,740
And besides that,

28
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:17,070
something has to be done because the
situation in the universities is really

29
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:17,904
ridiculous.

30
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,163
So,

31
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,580
okay.

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,021
All right,

33
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:23,690
so let's see what else we've
got here in the chat room.

34
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:28,181
D.

35
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:28,490
E v.

36
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:28,821
S.

37
00:01:28,821 --> 00:01:29,121
S.

38
00:01:29,121 --> 00:01:29,511
K.

39
00:01:29,511 --> 00:01:29,870
H.

40
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,081
E.

41
00:01:30,081 --> 00:01:30,381
R.

42
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,214
Three.

43
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:32,510
That's quite a mouthful.

44
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,160
Says I'm studying to be a teacher,

45
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:35,330
but I'm also an introvert.

46
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,860
Could this be a big problem?

47
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,930
Can I still be a successful teacher?

48
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:39,764
Actually,

49
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,960
what seems to predict success at
teaching best is intelligence and

50
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:46,040
conscientiousness.

51
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,570
That's the data so far.

52
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:49,220
So if you're conscientious,

53
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:51,140
then you'll probably be fine.

54
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:51,790
I mean,

55
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,580
x extra introverts have a harder
time speaking in front of groups,

56
00:01:55,581 --> 00:01:56,900
but you can learn to do that.

57
00:01:56,901 --> 00:01:57,111
You know,

58
00:01:57,111 --> 00:02:00,260
an introvert can become a very
successful public speaker.

59
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:03,080
May Not enjoy it the same
way that an extrovert might.

60
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,600
But that doesn't mean that
you can't learn the skills.

61
00:02:05,601 --> 00:02:09,710
And what I would recommend
for an introvert is the same
thing that I do when I'm

62
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:11,960
lecturing is I never
talked to the whole group.

63
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:12,530
You know,

64
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:13,970
it doesn't matter how big the crowd is,

65
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:18,170
I'm always picking out individuals in
the group and talking specifically to

66
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:18,440
them.

67
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,040
So I'll make a point to an individual
and I watched their face and see if

68
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:23,840
they're nodding and understanding right?

69
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:27,580
Because that way you make contact with
the entire audience and then you know,

70
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:30,200
all talk to someone for
about 15 seconds or so.

71
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,940
I don't want to put them
on the spot too much.

72
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,290
And then I shift my attention to someone
else and I sort of pinpoint around the

73
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:40,040
room and that keeps everybody in the
room focused on what I'm saying because

74
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:43,430
each person reflect the
entire crowd back to you.

75
00:02:43,431 --> 00:02:46,880
And so I would say if you're an introvert
or if you want to speak in public in

76
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:47,480
general,

77
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,980
forget about the damn crowd.

78
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,360
It doesn't exist.

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,460
Speak to people one on one.

80
00:02:52,461 --> 00:02:54,800
At a time and an introvert
can do that just fine.

81
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,113
So,

82
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,043
you know,

83
00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,710
that's where your strength would be.

84
00:02:58,711 --> 00:02:59,890
And I would say you're,

85
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:04,870
you're much more likely to be unsuccessful
as a teacher if you don't work hard

86
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:05,230
at it.

87
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,580
And if you're not interested in it.

88
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,720
So if you're an introvert,

89
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,830
I wouldn't worry about that.

90
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:09,760
Um,

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,400
I don't think that that will be the
biggest problem that you'll face.

92
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:13,960
So.
