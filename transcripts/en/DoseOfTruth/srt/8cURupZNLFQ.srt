1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,210
I read some,
a dissertation about how male feminists

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,390
think about themselves and how they go
about having sex.

3
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:16,240
For example,
every one of the men said that he's,

4
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:21,270
he's way to approach sex was that he
didn't take any initiative because he

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,760
would,
he would foul,

6
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:23,960
uh,
the,

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,100
the file,
the,

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:27,270
the whole situation and the woman.

9
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:27,931
Yeah.
Well,

10
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:31,320
it's like Andrea to work in a back in
the 70s that horrible.

11
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,990
She's a horrible creature.
Andrea at the work.

12
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,453
And,
uh,

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,000
you know,
she said that it's men engaged in sexual

14
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:42,400
behavior with an erect penis.
That that was,

15
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,720
ah,
that,

16
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:45,570
that was equivalent to violence.
Right.

17
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,680
That was equivalent to rate.
Yeah.

18
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:49,140
So,
I mean,

19
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,940
I don't even know what to say about
that,

20
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:56,050
except that that's exactly what Andrea
to work and was like.

21
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:58,660
And she was a real heroine to the
radical feminists,

22
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:01,000
you know,
Harun where someone else around that

23
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:02,080
period of time,
dude,

24
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,450
Catherine Mckinnon,
I think her name was equally,

25
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:06,803
equally

26
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,360
well,
I think a red book.

27
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,363
Yeah.
Well,

28
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:13,780
you would've,
you would've.

29
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:14,291
Yeah.
Yeah.

30
00:01:14,291 --> 00:01:16,540
I mean,
from my perspective as a clinician,

31
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:20,740
those people have clear every indication
of serious personality disorders.

32
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,990
And I actually think to some degree that
we've made a haven for people who have

33
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,780
serious personality pathology in these,
in these pseudo disciplines,

34
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,450
in the universities.
And you know,

35
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,310
you said something interesting you said
that,

36
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,480
uh,
you know,

37
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:39,810
when you went to,
to when you took your sociology degree,

38
00:01:39,811 --> 00:01:42,780
that these were basically fringe views.
Now their center views in the

39
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:45,210
university,
but also implying that they're

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,220
increasingly dominant views in society.
And that's the thing is that people

41
00:01:50,221 --> 00:01:52,920
think that these are somehow ivory tower
arguments.

42
00:01:52,921 --> 00:01:57,000
But what happens in the university's
happens in society five to 10 years

43
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,110
later.
And so,

44
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:00,000
and that's exactly what's happening
right now.

45
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,403
So

46
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,340
I think these,
these leads us into the me to a debate

47
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,320
because will you have people in Sweden
right now?

48
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,850
I think the,
me too phenomenon is much larger in

49
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,950
Sweden than in any other country.
I mean,

50
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:22,490
it's,
it's dominated the media for one month

51
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:23,151
now.
And,

52
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:26,660
uh,
every profession has,

53
00:02:26,661 --> 00:02:27,590
uh,
uh,

54
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,720
uh,
has an mi to a sort of article with

55
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,050
thousands of women,
uh,

56
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,190
signing on to it.
So the teachers and the lawyers and the

57
00:02:41,731 --> 00:02:45,780
doctors.
So what one thing is interesting about

58
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:49,650
this is how the men are handling it
because

59
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:55,270
um,
there are a lot of men writing that I as

60
00:02:55,271 --> 00:02:56,420
a man,
uh,

61
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,560
have a responsibility for this
happening.

62
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,650
I a man as a male,
I'm responsible and I'm guilty and

63
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,310
actually it was one.
So there are a lot of articles like

64
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:08,240
that.
And then one of them,

65
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,450
one of the men that was accused of doing
something inappropriate,

66
00:03:11,451 --> 00:03:16,451
it was the former leader for the left
Radical Party.

67
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,040
And if the thing he had done was,
was not so reprehensible,

68
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:26,080
he had approached a woman and then she
had said no and he had apologized,

69
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,920
but then she didn't accept that.
Then now he's under investigation police

70
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:34,160
investigation and we have this sort of
witch hunt

71
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,480
is that almost all,
all manifestations of male sexuality are

72
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:44,880
going to be brought under legal control.
And he actually wrote

73
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,660
the article that said,
yes,

74
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,420
I am responsible because I say I'm
responsible.

75
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:53,990
I'm better than the majority of men's
reactions to this.

76
00:03:53,991 --> 00:03:58,370
So actually he turned the thing that he
was being under investigation into

77
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,000
because he showed that because he
admitted he showed that he was better.

78
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,290
Yup.
So,

79
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,390
so
it's very our stay,

80
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:09,720
I mean the whole idea was that you were
supposed to come to terms with your

81
00:04:09,721 --> 00:04:14,430
class guilt and then confess and then,
and then indicate that you could be

82
00:04:14,431 --> 00:04:16,800
brought back into the etiological fold
properly.

83
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,870
The thing is,
it's a lot of muddy thinking.

84
00:04:18,871 --> 00:04:21,240
It's like,
well man should take responsibility for

85
00:04:21,241 --> 00:04:24,900
their aggressive sexuality and they
should incorporate it.

86
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,550
Right.
Because if you repress it,

87
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:29,370
it just comes out in the most ugly way.
So I mean,

88
00:04:29,371 --> 00:04:33,270
part of the ideas that men,
boys should be socialized like little

89
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,530
girls,
you know?

90
00:04:34,531 --> 00:04:36,480
But that's complete rubbish.
In fact,

91
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:39,510
even little girls perhaps shouldn't be
socialized like little curls,

92
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:42,840
but whatever.
I mean that's beside the point that that

93
00:04:42,841 --> 00:04:47,640
aggressive capacity that's associated
with sexuality as well as Freud pointed

94
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:50,430
out so long ago,
needs to be integrated within the

95
00:04:50,431 --> 00:04:52,710
personality so that it's under control,
right?

96
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:55,410
And then it's,
it's the hint of darkness and it's the

97
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:57,330
capacity for malevolence,
but it's,

98
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,900
but it's brought under,
but it's brought under civilized

99
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,660
regulation.
And so then you get to have your cake

100
00:05:03,661 --> 00:05:04,471
and eat it too,
right?

101
00:05:04,471 --> 00:05:08,370
You can be strong and potentially
dangerous and mysterious and all of

102
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:10,740
those things that,
that are definitely attractive.

103
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,520
That's an attractive features of men,
not only to women,

104
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:19,080
but also to other men.
So you have to take responsibility for

105
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,640
that.
But that doesn't mean that you should

106
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:25,140
identify yourself as the member of a
guilty group because of a class based

107
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:26,730
accusation.
Right.

108
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:30,270
That's just,
you're not guilty as the member of a

109
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:32,040
class.
I mean,

110
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,370
that's part of the reason that I've been
pushing so hard against these

111
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:38,070
postmodern,
neo Marxist ideas because one of their

112
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,540
essential predicates is that you can be
guilty as the member of a class.

113
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:46,260
And that is,
I don't know if there's a more dangerous

114
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:48,360
idea then,
then that there might be,

115
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:52,490
because you know,
there's a very large number of extremely

116
00:05:52,491 --> 00:05:54,140
dangerous ideas,
but that one's,

117
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,100
that one's up near the top.
Yeah.

118
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,600
It's happening to great degree in the
United States to lesser so in Canada,

119
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:07,601
but every day there's another slew of,
of influential man who are being outed

120
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,930
for their past sexual misbehavior and,
you know,

121
00:06:14,931 --> 00:06:15,800
and that,
and,

122
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,960
and that's,
that's,

123
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,030
uh,
I don't have much to say about that

124
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:22,700
except that to use that as evidence for
the

125
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,410
group-based guilt of men as such.
Yeah.

126
00:06:29,831 --> 00:06:31,150
Well,
whatever,

127
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,240
whatever,
I'm going to get a hell of a lot worse

128
00:06:34,241 --> 00:06:35,860
before it gets better,
I'm afraid.
