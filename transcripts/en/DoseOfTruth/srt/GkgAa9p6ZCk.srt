1
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:07,600
We've talked a little bit,

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,463
I think in this,

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,480
in this series about Pinocchio,

4
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:11,890
but if we have it doesn't matter.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,283
Um,

6
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,600
you see there's Jimminy cricket at
the opening of the Pinocchio movie

7
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,030
pointing to a star,

8
00:00:21,031 --> 00:00:24,120
which is roughly the Nativity
Star for all intents and purposes.

9
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:25,280
And it's um,

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,100
it's a symbolic indicator of
something diamond light and pure,

11
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,710
right glimmering in the darkness that's
transcendent and above the horizon upon

12
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,280
which to fix your eyes.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:41,550
And so that's the thing is
you need that technically.

14
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:46,551
And the reason you need that is because
we know enough about psychology now to

15
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:49,940
know that almost all of the positive
emotion that you're going to experience in

16
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,970
your life and positive emotion
is analgesic by the way,

17
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:53,211
right?

18
00:00:53,211 --> 00:00:54,470
It actually quells pain.

19
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:55,640
So it's not just positive.

20
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,260
It also gets rid of negative,

21
00:00:57,261 --> 00:00:58,400
which is a big plus.

22
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,250
Almost all the positive emotion
that you're going to feel.

23
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:06,440
You're going to feel in relationship to
a goal because you feel positive emotion

24
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:07,880
as you approach a goal.

25
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:10,280
And so if you want to
feel positive emotion,

26
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:11,480
then you need a goal.

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,381
And then you might think,

28
00:01:12,381 --> 00:01:12,501
well,

29
00:01:12,501 --> 00:01:14,840
if you want to maximize
that positive emotion,

30
00:01:14,841 --> 00:01:18,680
which is enthusiasm and also what
pulls you out into the world as well as

31
00:01:18,681 --> 00:01:19,514
feeling good,

32
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,370
then you need the best possible goal.

33
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:27,550
Well that because that's going to engage
the largest segments of the year being

34
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:31,290
like if your goal is too narrow,

35
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:33,570
then a bunch of you isn't
going to be on board for it.

36
00:01:33,571 --> 00:01:34,200
You know?

37
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,080
If the goal is well
developed and multifaceted,

38
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:38,820
then all of you can partake in that.

39
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:39,960
Even your negative elements,

40
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:43,590
even your anger and your fear
can get on board with that,

41
00:01:43,591 --> 00:01:45,330
let's say so you need a goal,

42
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:45,631
man,

43
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:47,100
that's worthy.

44
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,640
You got us.

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,061
Thank you.

46
00:01:48,061 --> 00:01:48,181
Good.

47
00:01:48,181 --> 00:01:51,450
You need a goal that justifies the
tragedy and malevolence of life.

48
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,490
That seems to be the bottom line.

49
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,050
Now maybe you think,

50
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:55,201
well,

51
00:01:55,201 --> 00:01:56,550
there's no goal that can do that.

52
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:56,911
It's like,

53
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:57,744
well,

54
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,060
there are still better and worse schools,

55
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,281
so and I,

56
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm not convinced that there
are no goals that can do that.

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,030
I think that's an open question.

58
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,980
You'd never know that until you pursued
the proper goal long enough to find out

59
00:02:13,981 --> 00:02:17,520
who you would be as a
consequence of pursuing it.

60
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:20,640
That's also your destiny
or your existential voyage,

61
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:20,851
right?

62
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,280
It's also not something that
anyone else can do for you.

63
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,480
Someone can say,

64
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:27,300
get your act together for
Christ's sake and get it.

65
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:28,410
Get good at it.

66
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:29,640
That's,

67
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,950
that'll make the world
unfold best for you.

68
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:35,400
But there's no way you can
know that without doing it.

69
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,340
And unless you think you've done a
particularly stellar job of that,

70
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:45,990
then you have no reason to
doubt its potential validity.
