1
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,360
Specialized sub circuits and they're
variable in their expression.

2
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:19,170
And what that basically means is
that on average across people,

3
00:00:19,171 --> 00:00:21,630
they're likely to be
located in the same place.

4
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,063
Now there's,

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,670
there's,

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,420
there's some discrepancies
cause lefthanders are
different than right handers

7
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:29,310
and people also have mixed dominance.

8
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:33,540
And so their brains can be organized
in ways that are not exactly cononical.

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,820
So we're saying roughly speaking,

10
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,470
and it extends,

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,400
it extends in some weird ways to phenomena
that you wouldn't necessarily think

12
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:43,380
could possibly be
organized in that manner.

13
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:44,340
So for example,

14
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:50,030
the part of the brain that you use for
silent reading and the visual Cortex is

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:51,504
back here.

16
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,300
And then the auditory
cortex is about here.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,110
And then the part of the brain that
you use for silent reading is where the

18
00:00:58,111 --> 00:01:00,900
auditory and the visual cortex overlap.

19
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,220
So that's pretty cool.

20
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:05,910
So what it means is that you look at
words and you'll hear them because your

21
00:01:05,911 --> 00:01:09,240
eyes are using the auditory cortex
as a representational structures.

22
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,113
That's pretty cool.

23
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,670
And so it turns out that people who silent
read pretty much used the same brain

24
00:01:14,671 --> 00:01:15,630
area to do that.

25
00:01:15,631 --> 00:01:19,290
And so you might think about that as
biological preparedness in some sense.

26
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:20,070
But of course,

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:23,850
people didn't learn to read
silently til 500 years ago,

28
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:24,810
roughly speaking.

29
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:25,051
You know,

30
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,450
even the earliest literate people,

31
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,430
most of them read out loud,

32
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,810
silent reading was a very,

33
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,920
very rare phenomenon.

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,610
Julius Caesar could read silently and
people thought that that was part of his

35
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,530
magical power because it's,

36
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:37,801
well,

37
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:39,150
it's pretty damn weird.

38
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:39,421
You know,

39
00:01:39,421 --> 00:01:41,130
that you can use your eyes to here,

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:41,791
you know,

41
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,720
cause you can all do it.

42
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:43,081
You think,

43
00:01:43,081 --> 00:01:43,390
yeah,

44
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,340
anybody can do that.

45
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:45,174
But you know,

46
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,150
it's a pretty new thing on
the evolutionary horizon.

47
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,040
And to be able to hear with your eyes,

48
00:01:50,041 --> 00:01:51,210
it's like good work guys.

49
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:51,930
That's,

50
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:53,520
that's not an easy thing to manage.
