1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,610
So the last time,

2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,690
last lecture I ended with the Abrahamic
stories with the death of Sarah and that

3
00:00:15,361 --> 00:00:16,470
was Abraham's wife.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,710
And so we're going to
continue from from there.

5
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:21,570
Remember Abraham had a son,

6
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:22,141
Isaac,

7
00:00:22,141 --> 00:00:25,200
and he was asked by God
to sacrifice his son,

8
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:30,201
which we talked about in some depth and
I was attempting to make the case that,

9
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:33,061
you know,

10
00:00:33,061 --> 00:00:35,850
the idea of sacrifice
was one of human kinds,

11
00:00:35,851 --> 00:00:39,990
great discoveries because it
meant the discovery of the future,

12
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:40,830
it essentially,

13
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:44,160
but it also meant the discovery that
the future was something that you could

14
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:47,190
make a bargain with and that
you could give up something now,

15
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,330
something impulsive,

16
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,340
some pleasure,

17
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,330
even a deep pleasure in the moment.

18
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,640
And you could strive and hypothetically
you could make a covenant,

19
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:57,090
a bargain with the future.

20
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,650
And if your sacrifices were acceptable
and that seemed to mean ethically

21
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:02,310
acceptable,

22
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:04,170
you had to sacrifice the right thing,

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,860
that that vastly increased the
probability that not only you would be

24
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,000
successful,

25
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:09,990
let's say,

26
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:11,640
but that your descendants would be too.

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,050
And I don't think that that's
an irrational proposition.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,250
I mean you have to leave in it a bit
with the realization that sometimes you

29
00:01:20,251 --> 00:01:20,520
know,

30
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,920
you get sliced off at
the knees no matter what,

31
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,311
right?

32
00:01:23,311 --> 00:01:27,720
Because life has an arbitrary element
and and that can't be tossed out.

33
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,020
But building in the arbitrary element,

34
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:32,670
we'll say you still want to think,

35
00:01:32,671 --> 00:01:36,090
well what's your best bat given
a certain amount of randomness.

36
00:01:36,091 --> 00:01:41,091
And it seems to me that conscious self
aware sacrifice and proper ethical

37
00:01:42,151 --> 00:01:43,740
striving is your best bet.

38
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:44,750
And you know,

39
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:49,790
there's another idea that I've always
explained it when I've explained it to

40
00:01:50,341 --> 00:01:50,701
people.

41
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:53,280
I've always used the movie
Pinocchio as an example.

42
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:58,281
You know that when Japan was trying to
make his puppet into a self aware and

43
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,410
autonomous moral agent,

44
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,440
which is what he wants above all else,

45
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:04,711
you know,

46
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:08,070
he aims at the highest
good that he can conceive,

47
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:12,700
which is the star that he
prays to essentially and
hopes for the transformation.

48
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:17,370
And there's also something in that that's
unutterably profound and maybe that is

49
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:21,690
somewhat independent of the idea
that you have to believe in God.

50
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,740
I would also say that what it means to
believe in God in the Old Testament is by

51
00:02:25,741 --> 00:02:26,790
no means clear.

52
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,490
And that's something I also
really want to talk about tonight.

53
00:02:29,491 --> 00:02:32,910
It's not obvious what it means and well,

54
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:35,580
Japan know what he does,

55
00:02:35,581 --> 00:02:40,110
at least is aim at the highest
good of which he can conceive.

56
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,411
You know,

57
00:02:40,411 --> 00:02:44,410
and that that's actually been
a philosophical definition
of God upon occasion,

58
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:46,950
that God is the highest
good of which you conceive.

59
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,383
And

60
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,340
you know,

61
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,030
that's different than the
idea of a transcendent being.

62
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:54,661
Precisely.

63
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:55,920
But it's in line with,

64
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,280
it's inline with certain interesting
psychoanalytic speculations.

65
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:01,410
This is one of the things I
really liked about Carl Young.

66
00:03:01,411 --> 00:03:01,740
You know.
