1
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,880
The idea about having a coat of many
colors would be that the person who is the

2
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,540
appropriate leader because we met,

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,220
or the proper person,

4
00:00:17,221 --> 00:00:18,300
which would be the same thing.

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,040
One of the things that these old stories
are trying to express and to figure out

6
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,080
is how is it that you should act,

7
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:28,230
which is the same as what
constitutes the ideal.

8
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:33,120
Those are the same questions and the
hand here with Joseph is while you should

9
00:00:33,121 --> 00:00:34,440
wear a coat of many colors,

10
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:38,610
which means that you should be able to
go have a drink in the pub with the guys

11
00:00:38,611 --> 00:00:39,444
who were,

12
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:39,750
you know,

13
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,770
dry walling year your house and you
should be able to have a sophisticated

14
00:00:43,771 --> 00:00:48,290
conversation with someone who's more
educated in an abstract way and that maybe

15
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,700
you should be equally
comfortable in both situations,

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:51,181
right?

17
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:52,020
Because you might think,

18
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:53,550
well there's more.

19
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,510
One of the indications that there's
more to you is that you can be put more

20
00:00:58,511 --> 00:01:01,450
places and function properly.

21
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,980
And that would be a good thing to aim at.

22
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:03,814
Because

23
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,430
here's the other issue is that you know
perfectly well that the fundamental

24
00:01:09,431 --> 00:01:14,200
tragedies of life and your exposure to
malevolence in the course of that life.

25
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,790
So those being the worst things,

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:21,040
there's not a lot you can do to alter
that fundamentally because their

27
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:22,210
conditions of existence,

28
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:26,020
you're going to be subject
to your vulnerability and
your going to be subject to

29
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:26,591
malevolence.

30
00:01:26,591 --> 00:01:27,424
That's that.

31
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,370
And you can't hide from it cause
it actually makes it worse.

32
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:32,660
So you're stuck with it.

33
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,280
So then the question is,

34
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:34,521
well,

35
00:01:34,521 --> 00:01:35,360
what are your options?

36
00:01:35,361 --> 00:01:39,080
And one option is to curse the structure
of being for being malevolent and

37
00:01:39,081 --> 00:01:40,760
tragic and fair enough.

38
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:45,870
And now there is to make yourself so
damn differentiated and Dynamic and Abel

39
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,110
that you're more than a match for that.

40
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,970
Now that's not an easy thing,

41
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:56,150
but it doesn't matter because
what's the alternative?

42
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,040
There's no good alternative.

43
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:59,330
And that's also worth knowing.
