1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,640
The meaning that sustains you
in life and responsibility,

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,200
which is not a case that's made very
effectively but needs to be made.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,560
Because most of the meaning that
people experience in their lives that's

4
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:19,030
worthwhile is a consequence of,

5
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,510
of adopting voluntary responsibility.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,913
How do you mean?

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,250
Well,

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:26,780
you think about the people you admire,

9
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:27,041
her,

10
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,320
the reason that you get
out of bed on a hard day,

11
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:33,130
it's because you have worthwhile things
to do that you think are necessary and

12
00:00:33,131 --> 00:00:33,701
important.

13
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,570
And those usually involve at
minimum taking care of yourself.

14
00:00:37,571 --> 00:00:38,404
But if you're,

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,573
if you're,

16
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,010
if you're developed in
a reasonable manner,

17
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:45,160
then you have a family to take care
of and you have a community to set,

18
00:00:45,161 --> 00:00:45,521
right?

19
00:00:45,521 --> 00:00:50,380
And you have things that need to be
done to reduce the amount of unnecessary

20
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:54,100
suffering in the world and to constrain
the amount of malevolence that you

21
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:59,101
manifest or that you encounter and you
need that sort of meaning to offset the

22
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:00,460
fact that life is difficult.

23
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,183
The,

24
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,490
the title of your book
is at 12 rules for life,

25
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,690
an antidote to cows and
I come to chaos laser.

26
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,630
But the 12 rules as you read them,

27
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:14,380
standup state,

28
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,340
just shoulders back,

29
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,430
don't get children,

30
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:21,720
do anything that makes you dislike
them at set your house in perfect order

31
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,240
before you criticize the world app.

32
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:25,803
Get kind of,

33
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,570
they sound like common sense,

34
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:29,741
common sense.

35
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:32,770
But if people forget why
common sense is common,

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:33,880
you know,

37
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,300
it's common for a reason or and and in,

38
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,670
in then if those common
sense dictums are challenged,

39
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,970
people don't necessarily know how
to defend them because they're,

40
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:44,150
they seem self evident.

41
00:01:44,151 --> 00:01:48,400
So partly what I've done in the book
is to take things that people know,

42
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,270
um,

43
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,530
and purposefully so,

44
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,100
and to outline why they're true and
conceptually and philosophically,

45
00:01:56,291 --> 00:01:59,170
but also why they're necessary
to apply practically.

46
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,010
And to do both of those at the same time
cause abstract conceptions aren't much

47
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,640
use unless you can nail them
down to something that's
practically implementable.

48
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,490
And so I made sure I bridged
the gap between those,

49
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,683
those,

50
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,790
what extremes in the book.

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,953
What,

52
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,490
what do you think makes
you so controversial?

53
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:18,581
Well,

54
00:02:18,581 --> 00:02:19,570
I think that's a,

55
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:20,710
that's a good question.

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,670
I mean many things are controversial in
today's politically polarized climate.

57
00:02:24,671 --> 00:02:26,020
And everything gets politicized.

58
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,420
I am controversial.

59
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:31,920
I became embroiled in
controversy in part because of,

60
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:32,710
uh,

61
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,310
uh,

62
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:35,890
because I'm no friend of
the collectivist left wing.

63
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:41,110
And I've made that very
clear and I objected to some
legislation in Canada that

64
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:44,350
was passed that compelled speech
in a manner that had never been,

65
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:49,950
never been attempted in any system that
utilizes English common law and which I

66
00:02:51,461 --> 00:02:54,940
thought and still believe it was an
absolutely appalling piece of legislation.

67
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,830
But to push it simply for our listeners,

68
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,970
that's me patronizing the listeners.

69
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:01,840
But I mean,

70
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,640
you talk about these things at length,

71
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,110
it has to do,

72
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:05,471
no,

73
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:07,180
you tell me what it has to do with,

74
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:07,810
well,

75
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:12,810
it has to do as far as I'm concerned
with the attempts by a coterie of

76
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:18,481
relatively radical left wing collectivist
to establish linguistic dominance in

77
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:20,620
certain conceptual spheres.

78
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,371
So for example,

79
00:03:21,371 --> 00:03:26,371
we have the idea that gender expression
and gender identity are purely socially

80
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:30,610
constructed and also,

81
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,720
um,

82
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,920
independent of biology.

83
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,590
That's basically be written into
the legal fabric in Canada now.

84
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,910
And that's preposterous.

85
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,860
It's factually incorrect,

86
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,170
overwhelmingly factually incorrect.

87
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:43,210
And it's purely ideological stance.

88
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,170
But people do w trans as they say,

89
00:03:47,171 --> 00:03:49,290
and he put a Stencil,

90
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:53,890
really are female do
become male and vice versa.

91
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,190
Yeah.

92
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:57,910
But that doesn't mean that they very
independently things can be linked in

93
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,753
still,

94
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,070
I'm still variation.

95
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,720
Well the overwhelming majority of people
who are biologically male identify as

96
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:05,200
male.

97
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,060
It's more than 99.9% and the
overwhelming majority of people who are

98
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,630
biologically female identify
as female and are heterosexual.

99
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,470
And so the idea that those
things are independent is insane.

100
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,970
They're not even close to independent.

101
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:20,110
That doesn't mean there aren't,

102
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:21,370
there aren't exceptions.

103
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,830
And when you're crafting laws,

104
00:04:22,831 --> 00:04:26,560
especially when it's associated
with scientific facts,

105
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,420
you have to get your terminology right.

106
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:33,190
The claim of the social constructionists
is that all of these areas,

107
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:33,940
uh,

108
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,140
biological sex,

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,400
gender expression,

110
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,480
gender identity,

111
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:38,420
um,

112
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:43,420
so sexual preference vary independently
and it's all a consequence of

113
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:44,380
socialization.

114
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,700
That's wrong.

115
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,160
It's wrong at every
single level of analysis.

116
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,110
And it's important.

117
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,840
Well,

118
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,880
there are biological influences play
a major role on people obviously.

119
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:56,350
And not only that,

120
00:04:56,650 --> 00:04:59,500
as your societies become more egalitarian,

121
00:04:59,501 --> 00:05:02,320
and this has been demonstrated
clearly in the Scandinavian countries,

122
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,800
as societies become more egalitarian
in their social policies,

123
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,050
the differences between
men and women get bigger,

124
00:05:08,051 --> 00:05:08,920
not smaller.

125
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,750
How well,

126
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:14,590
because it turns out that if you flatten
out the socio cultural structure,

127
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,120
which is one of the things that make men
and women the same as it turns out the

128
00:05:19,121 --> 00:05:20,920
biological differences maximize.

129
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,130
So the biggest differences
in personality and interest,

130
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:26,140
which partly determines
occupational choice.

131
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,651
For example,

132
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:30,550
the biggest differences are in the
Scandinavian countries and they've grown.

133
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,950
Has the Scandinavian countries,

134
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:34,150
Scandinavian countries have
become more egalitarian.

135
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,440
And how does that manifest?

136
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,740
What manifests itself and
occupational choice for example,

137
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:40,720
but and but also in in personality.

138
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,970
How do you mean in occupation or choice?

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,660
I mean there are fewer women in the
stem studies as societies in the stem

140
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:47,200
fields,

141
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,531
science,

142
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,191
technology,

143
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,240
engineering and mathematics.

144
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:51,100
As societies become more egalitarian,

145
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,500
fewer women go into the stem fields,

146
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,370
not more.

147
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:56,980
And it looks like it's a
consequence of their free choice.

148
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,860
Partly because the personality
differences between men and women,

149
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,800
between men and women grow as
societies become more equal.

150
00:06:03,801 --> 00:06:05,810
And so do the differences
in their interest.

151
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,130
It's because men and women are actually
biologically different to some degree.

152
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:10,760
Now,

153
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,060
you know,

154
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,160
men and women are quite the,

155
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,213
quite similar.

156
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,600
So for example,

157
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:16,760
if you look at a trait like aggression,

158
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:21,380
if you pick a random man and a random
woman out of the population and you had to

159
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,180
lay a bet on who was more aggressive,

160
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:24,260
if you bet on the woman,

161
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:26,390
you'd be right 40% of the time,

162
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,500
which an yes.

163
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,910
And so that's quite an overlap,

164
00:06:28,911 --> 00:06:29,540
right?

165
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,560
But then if you go out to the extremes
and if you had to pick the one in 100

166
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:35,180
most aggressive person,

167
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,950
it would almost always be male.

168
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,320
And that's why so many men are in prison.

169
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,890
So it's 10 to one males
to female in prison.

170
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:43,701
Now.

171
00:06:43,701 --> 00:06:47,330
And that's partly because you can have
very much similarity in population

172
00:06:47,331 --> 00:06:48,770
overlap in the middle,

173
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,050
but quite a lot of
difference at the extremes.

174
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,483
You.

175
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,030
It was alleged that you made
very controversial remarks
following the m Harvard

176
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:03,440
events in Toronto where a man who's at,

177
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,680
I presume we'll do life killed,

178
00:07:06,681 --> 00:07:11,681
I think it was 10 people and
drove insurable and wanted
to do more and arising

179
00:07:12,321 --> 00:07:13,154
from that,

180
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:18,490
it was implied that somehow that this
had to do with the fact that he couldn't

181
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,560
have sex with a woman.

182
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:22,460
Well,

183
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,190
you said it was alleged that
I make controversial comments.

184
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:26,180
That's exactly right.

185
00:07:26,181 --> 00:07:27,680
You got the terminology right there.

186
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:32,681
What I pointed out was that social in
enforcement of monogamous norms is one way

187
00:07:32,961 --> 00:07:34,400
that societies around the world,

188
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,050
male aggression at bay,

189
00:07:36,051 --> 00:07:40,130
and that's an absolutely solid finding
from a hundred years of anthropology,

190
00:07:40,131 --> 00:07:42,410
one that's often cited
by people on the left.

191
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:46,490
So what happened in the New York Times
article that you're referring to was that

192
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,630
that was taken radically out of context
and their old reporter knew that

193
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:51,411
perfectly well.

194
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,210
She was very intelligent young woman.

195
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,640
She knew exactly what she
was doing when she did that,

196
00:07:55,970 --> 00:07:58,820
and to make the case that
monogamous social norms,

197
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,220
which are pretty much
universal around the world,

198
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:02,030
by the way,

199
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,510
even though people have some
tendency towards multiple partners,

200
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,110
the reason that monogamous social norms
emerge is partly to keep male aggression

201
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,973
under control.

202
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,560
That's not controversial.

203
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,430
Anybody who knows the anthropological
psychological literature understands it's,

204
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,140
that's the purpose of it.

205
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,450
Well,

206
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,750
there's a variety of purposes,

207
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:21,950
but that's definitely one.

208
00:08:21,951 --> 00:08:24,740
Polygamous societies are way more violent,

209
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,630
not a little bit more violent,

210
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:28,070
way more violent.

211
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:28,641
Yeah,

212
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:29,810
so that's part of the purpose.

213
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:31,190
There's a variety of purposes.

214
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,270
You want people to have longterm stable
partners because that's probably better

215
00:08:35,271 --> 00:08:36,470
for men and women in general.

216
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,353
Now the,

217
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:37,880
well,

218
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,211
yes,

219
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:38,981
that would be good if,

220
00:08:38,981 --> 00:08:39,341
if it,

221
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:41,280
if it can be managed in how,

222
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:43,820
I think on many situations
that's a luxury.

223
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,121
I mean,

224
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,260
people have hard lives,

225
00:08:45,261 --> 00:08:47,150
have had hard lives throughout history,

226
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,830
and they've made decisions for,

227
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,050
for very basic economic reasons.

228
00:08:51,051 --> 00:08:51,530
If,

229
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:54,920
if your relationship is
also characterized by love,

230
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,800
great.

231
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,790
But you know,

232
00:08:56,791 --> 00:09:00,270
life is very difficult for people and
has been for a very long period of time.

233
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:05,540
The primary reason that
monogamy is enforced socially
is for children as far as

234
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,451
I can tell,

235
00:09:06,451 --> 00:09:11,100
because of course obviously children are
dependent for very long periods of time

236
00:09:11,101 --> 00:09:13,110
and we know even in western societies,

237
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:15,150
which are relatively prosperous,

238
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:20,040
people who serve as single parents tend
to plummet down the economic hierarchy

239
00:09:20,041 --> 00:09:21,180
because it's very,

240
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,080
very difficult to have a
fulltime productive job and
take care of children by

241
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:25,914
yourself.

242
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,150
And we also know the literature on
child development indicates w beyond the

243
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:31,050
shadow of the doubt,

244
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:34,770
the two parent families are far more
effective with regards to the outcome of

245
00:09:34,771 --> 00:09:36,300
children than single parent families,

246
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,770
which is an imagine many people
we'd be ringing in to say not to,

247
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:42,250
not to handle,

248
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:42,751
they want.

249
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:46,020
There's a literature developed on this
that's developed over decades that

250
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:47,820
indicates this extraordinarily clearly.

251
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,380
So fatherlessness for example,

252
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:52,350
is a very potent predictor of
negative outcomes among children.

253
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:56,880
That doesn't mean that every person
who's a single parent is doing a bad job.

254
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,380
Those are not the same claims.
