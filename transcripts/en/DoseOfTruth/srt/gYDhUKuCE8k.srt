1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,321
Yeah.

2
00:00:00,321 --> 00:00:00,670
So,

3
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:00,860
so,

4
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:01,131
okay,

5
00:00:01,131 --> 00:00:04,180
so there is something we could talk
about for a minute because you know,

6
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:04,790
there's,

7
00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:05,623
uh,

8
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:07,580
there's political,

9
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:11,780
what do you call rumblings about the
fact that I think a lot of this is

10
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:14,180
generated by the radical left types,

11
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,900
particularly on the campuses,

12
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:18,980
but the system is rigged and that
it's an oppressive patriarchy.

13
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:22,670
And that the reason that people are at
the top is because they played power

14
00:00:22,671 --> 00:00:23,121
games.

15
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:23,781
And you know,

16
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:24,614
it's this,

17
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,890
my sense is that the
control is that we're,

18
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,050
we're ethnic or racial or gender groups
and we're competing in the Marxists

19
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:34,790
manner and those who win have
one because of oppression.

20
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:39,030
But I know the literature on the
relationship between individuals,

21
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:44,060
individual differences and longterm life
success in the Western world and the

22
00:00:44,061 --> 00:00:45,530
literature is actually very clear.

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,920
So intelligence seems to account for
about 20% of the variants in longterm life

24
00:00:51,141 --> 00:00:51,974
success.

25
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,370
And then trait conscientiousness
accounts for perhaps another,

26
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,440
maybe 10 to 15%.

27
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,190
And then there's smaller
contributions of emotional stability,

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,270
um,

29
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,130
and also have trait openness,

30
00:01:04,131 --> 00:01:06,510
which seems to be a good predictor
of entrepreneurial ability.

31
00:01:06,511 --> 00:01:11,511
So it looks like in the West that you
can attribute about 40 to 50% of the

32
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:12,320
variants.

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,340
Maybe that's a little high,

34
00:01:13,341 --> 00:01:13,700
but it's,

35
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,330
it's not,

36
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,500
it's not a radical over estimate to the
sorts of individual differences that are

37
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:23,150
associated with productivity because
increases in Iq hierarchy you at higher

38
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:25,670
conscientiousness definitely
make people more productive.

39
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,720
It seems to me that you can
use that as an index of the,

40
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,143
um,

41
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:31,760
of the,

42
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:36,260
of the genuinely meritocratic nature of
a culture and also as an index of its

43
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,630
willingness to engage in fair
play because you'd expect if it,

44
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,840
if your culture is aimed at productivity
and it turns out that those are the

45
00:01:44,841 --> 00:01:48,650
most PR and it turns out that the
most productive people are in fact

46
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:49,910
differentially rewarded.

47
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,860
That seems to me to be a reasonable
index of the success of this society now

48
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:59,360
that that is still leaves 50 to
60% of the variance on explained.

49
00:01:59,361 --> 00:02:00,194
And so you can,

50
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,210
in there you could include racism and
prejudice and the tyranny of the system

51
00:02:05,211 --> 00:02:09,740
and blind luck can physical health and
all of the arbitrary and random events

52
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:13,730
that make up that determined whether
someone is successful or fails in life.

53
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,560
But it does seem to me to provide a
metric saying that not only is our society

54
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:23,390
crazily productive and reasonably and
reasonably good at district distributing

55
00:02:23,391 --> 00:02:23,991
the spoils,

56
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,550
even though there's still some inequality,

57
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:29,780
but a fair bit of inequality is
actually generated as a consequence of

58
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:33,290
differences in genuine productivity
that seem reasonable to you.

59
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,550
Yeah,

60
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,330
maybe it ought to be obvious and,

61
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:37,821
but now,

62
00:02:37,821 --> 00:02:40,450
except for the fact that in
a lot of intellectual life,

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:45,040
the assumption is that the correlation
between a psychological traits and

64
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:45,940
success is zero.

65
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:46,870
So the fact that it's,

66
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:47,650
you know,

67
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:48,640
let's say it's 40%,

68
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:53,260
I think it says 33% I bet a lot higher
than in most people are willing to

69
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,573
acknowledge.

70
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:56,350
And what you said is exactly right.

71
00:02:56,351 --> 00:03:00,970
That leaves more than half of the
variance not to be correlating that with

72
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,080
individual differences.

73
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,213
And of course,

74
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:03,570
uh,

75
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,550
various inequities could go into that,

76
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,230
that got 50 or 60%.

77
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,630
And uh,

78
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,210
there's no,

79
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,043
they're not mutually

80
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,210
I,

81
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,043
it seems hard.

82
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,320
Uh,

83
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:14,830
we,

84
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:17,580
we know that there's a lot of gaming
of the system particularly yeah.

85
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,970
United States by,

86
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,820
by the wealthy.

87
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,640
Uh,

88
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,870
and that should obviously be eliminated.

89
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:23,704
It's not,

90
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,690
not fair.

91
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,360
It's not.

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,360
If we could also ask another question
is whether the rewards that go to the

93
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:36,320
talented are necessarily in sectors
that lead to what we might call a

94
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:37,790
productivity in the sense of,

95
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,180
of,

96
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:38,930
um,

97
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,370
increasing societal wealth.

98
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,090
And an argument can be made that there's
some misallocation of intellectual

99
00:03:44,091 --> 00:03:45,710
resources that we have,

100
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,360
uh,

101
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:46,880
that the,

102
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,211
uh,

103
00:03:47,211 --> 00:03:47,930
economy,

104
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:48,081
uh,

105
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:48,441
is,

106
00:03:48,441 --> 00:03:48,950
is,

107
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:49,140
uh,

108
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:49,520
to,

109
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,420
to driven by,

110
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,070
by finance that the,

111
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:52,620
uh,

112
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,750
there are too many lawsuits.

113
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,940
Legal system is each other.

114
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:56,331
Uh,

115
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:56,960
and so,

116
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,340
uh,

117
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,790
our estimated by intellectuals,

118
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,650
this does still leave a,

119
00:04:00,651 --> 00:04:00,840
a,

120
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,990
a place for criticizing a number of the,

121
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:03,510
uh,

122
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:03,860
uh,

123
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,540
the reason which our economy is set up.

124
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,120
There's always scope for improvement.

125
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:08,881
Yes.

126
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,881
And we were talking about why despite
the fact that a fair bit of the variance

127
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,250
or a third to half of the variance in,

128
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,040
in life success is taken up by let's say,

129
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,450
individual attributes,

130
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:24,390
there's still room for a
systemic critique that's valid.

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,310
Yeah.

132
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,230
One of the pathologies of intellectual
life that I wrote about it in the blank

133
00:04:30,231 --> 00:04:34,010
slate about denial of
human nature was that,

134
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:34,700
uh,

135
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,830
the in,

136
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:38,480
in polite company and
the intellectual circles,

137
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,810
the amount of light success determined
by a inherent and largely heritable

138
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,160
psychological traits has to be zero.

139
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,100
I mean that just the,

140
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,360
the,

141
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,530
the only acceptable position.

142
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,101
And you,

143
00:04:52,101 --> 00:04:53,480
and I know it's not zero.

144
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,110
Well,

145
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,270
so let me interject for one second.

146
00:04:56,271 --> 00:04:57,104
I'm also,

147
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,950
there's a fairness element there.

148
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,300
But the other thing is,

149
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,510
it seems to me that that's extraordinary
self serving of people too.

150
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,540
Because you know,

151
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,350
if you get together with a
group of Harvard professors,

152
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:08,184
for example,

153
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:09,210
um,

154
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,170
it's pretty obvious that their innate
intelligence is one of the factors that

155
00:05:13,171 --> 00:05:14,400
determine their success.

156
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:19,401
And to deny the fact that
heritable differences make
a difference means perhaps

157
00:05:19,951 --> 00:05:24,780
to act as an Avatar of a
social justice orientation,

158
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:27,060
but equally to deny the role of,

159
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,830
of the benefits of Champs in
your own success and to their,

160
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:36,000
for lack a certain degree of humility
that you might otherwise be required to

161
00:05:36,001 --> 00:05:36,834
have.

162
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,130
So it's not all,

163
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,790
and I'm not claiming that you
were implying this at all,

164
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:46,791
but it's not all in the service of higher
social ideals that people denied they,

165
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,230
the contribution of,

166
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,240
of heritable components,

167
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:52,074
for example,

168
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,100
the birth laundry.

169
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,383
So,

170
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,860
okay.

171
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,330
Okay.

172
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:56,601
Whoops.

173
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,434
We just,

174
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:58,973
okay.

175
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:04,220
I unfortunately the video
just froze and after you said,

176
00:06:04,221 --> 00:06:06,380
I'm not saying you claimed this,

177
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:06,840
uh,

178
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,270
you suddenly froze on the screen.

179
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,430
We're not saying you're claiming this.

180
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:12,970
Sure.

181
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:13,301
Well,

182
00:06:13,301 --> 00:06:13,960
it's just,

183
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,290
it seems self serving for people
who are particularly bright,

184
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,124
for example,

185
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:23,430
to not be grateful for the fact that
they won the genetic lottery in that in

186
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:29,011
that manner and insufficiently humble,

187
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,800
um,

188
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:35,680
to not know what the role
of that arbitrary chance in
determining their success.

189
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:38,440
I mean it's not like they don't
deserve their success because of that,

190
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:42,500
but claiming a certain degree
of biological determinism,

191
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:47,140
it doesn't necessarily make you a bad
person even though it can be read that way

192
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:51,430
because it makes you very sensitive
to your own good fortune if you,

193
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,900
if you think it through carefully.

194
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:54,870
Oh absolutely.

195
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:55,321
In fact,

196
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:58,080
successful people are the winners
of at least three lotteries.

197
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,030
One of them that you mentioned,

198
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:01,920
of course it's the
genetic lottery lottery.

199
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,120
The fact that does that some people
were born with greater intelligence and

200
00:07:06,121 --> 00:07:08,520
conscientiousness and
openness to experience.

201
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,970
Another is that there's a a second
lottery in a human development that is not

202
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,020
strictly genetic,

203
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:19,680
but it is in a sense
constitutional or developmental.

204
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,570
The fact that I might consider this one
of the most profound discoveries in the

205
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:25,680
history of psychology,

206
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,250
that correlation is between
identical twins reared together,

207
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,240
are generally on the order of 0.5.

208
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,110
Uh,

209
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,420
and they share not only their genome,

210
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,260
but,

211
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:37,520
uh,

212
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,320
the vast amount of their
environments that their parents,

213
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,101
their neighborhoods,

214
00:07:41,101 --> 00:07:41,911
they're older sibs.

215
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:42,840
They're younger sibs,

216
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,340
the number of books in the house,

217
00:07:44,341 --> 00:07:45,420
number of guns in the house,

218
00:07:45,421 --> 00:07:46,710
number of TVs in the house,

219
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,450
yet they're not indistinguishable.

220
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:52,350
A identical twins are a
correlate quite highly,

221
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,940
but no one near perfectly,

222
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:58,710
which means that there is a second lottery
that has to do either with just the

223
00:07:58,711 --> 00:07:59,170
way the,

224
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,003
the brain,

225
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,450
uh,

226
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,160
congeals during development,

227
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,850
which can't be specified down to
the last synapse by the genes.

228
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:06,600
Uh,

229
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,120
and perhaps by chance life events,

230
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:14,121
which might leave unpredictable traces
that we can't add a documenter or

231
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:15,600
systematically understand.

232
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:16,411
And then of course,

233
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,940
there's the third lottery of,

234
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:18,450
uh,

235
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,590
what happens to you in your profession.

236
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,230
Did you bet on the right sector?

237
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,120
Did you happen to have a good
relationship with the boss?

238
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,643
Numerous.

239
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,320
Right?

240
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,100
It's a matter of being in the
right place at the right time,

241
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,243
the right time.

242
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,020
So all that having been said,

243
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,320
um,

244
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:38,561
and,

245
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:38,891
and you're,

246
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:39,790
you're absolutely right.

247
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,300
We have to acknowledge
the none zero role of,

248
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:44,383
uh,

249
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:44,741
uh,

250
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:49,300
of hereditary can permit and
talent the one zero role of chance.

251
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,570
And that still leaves a big chunk of the
variance that could be due to systemic

252
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,640
features of the system that
perhaps ought to be changed.

253
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:00,180
There's just no doubt
that the wealthy game,

254
00:09:00,181 --> 00:09:00,721
the system,

255
00:09:00,721 --> 00:09:03,800
particularly in the United States in
a number of ways that don't work to,

256
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,550
to the,

257
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,750
the benefit of society at large.

258
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:11,430
There are also aspects of the system
that are perhaps fair but irrational.

259
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,020
The fact that so much of our intellectual
talent now gets sucked into finance.

260
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,680
Now of course we do need a financial
sector and it's good that they're smart

261
00:09:19,681 --> 00:09:21,000
people in it,

262
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:26,270
but having a lot of our brain power
devoted to figuring out how to act on

263
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:27,630
financial information,

264
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:32,860
it Microsoft microsecond faster than
ones competitors is probably not the best

265
00:09:32,881 --> 00:09:35,280
use of our society's intellectual capital.

266
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:35,941
Likewise,

267
00:09:35,941 --> 00:09:36,540
a lot of,

268
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,600
there's no doubt that we have far
too much brain power invested in,

269
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,730
in the the legal system in a
corporation suing each other,

270
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:48,000
patent trolling and another
not so productive uses.

271
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:48,371
Yeah.

272
00:09:48,371 --> 00:09:50,080
Well the funny thing is too,

273
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,133
there's an,

274
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,600
there's a new routing in erotic
or amount of pathology in,

275
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,520
in a system in some sense.

276
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:02,200
I mean one of the things that struck me
quite hard for example is that if you

277
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:07,201
look at the creativity
curves across the lifespan,

278
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,140
they matched the criminality
curves almost perfectly.

279
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,080
And one of the things that made me think
when I was doing that research was so

280
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,470
that as young men become more antisocial,

281
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,820
they also become more creative.

282
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,770
Even though those things
might not be correlated,

283
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,760
but they do map on top of one another
and we're sticking in a society like the

284
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:25,630
United States,

285
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,560
which has a fair degree of criminality
but also a fair degree of creativity.

286
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:34,770
We have no idea how loose the system has
to be so that malfeasance can thrive so

287
00:10:36,911 --> 00:10:40,720
that it can also be simultaneously loose
enough so that creativity can thrive.

288
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:41,740
Right.

289
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,560
Because you might think if you were
optimistic that you can tighten up the

290
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:48,730
system and get rid of the
criminal behavior without
adding a totalitarian layer

291
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:51,940
to this system that would
also simultaneously demolish,

292
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:52,990
you know,

293
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:54,970
individual variability and creativity.

294
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:55,751
We just,

295
00:10:55,751 --> 00:10:59,560
our models just aren't sophisticated
enough to tease such things apart,

296
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,370
you know.

297
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:01,050
Well,

298
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,490
they,

299
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:01,701
I,

300
00:11:01,701 --> 00:11:03,130
I'm not so sure there.

301
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,040
I do agree with you that
there's a certain amount of,

302
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:06,720
uh,

303
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,000
uh,

304
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
risk taking or young men on the bake
that might underlie both criminality and,

305
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:12,880
uh,

306
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,990
productive creativity.

307
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:14,610
But,

308
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:14,930
uh,

309
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,120
over the course of history,

310
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,450
I think one of the accomplishments
of civilization and indeed of,

311
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,360
uh,

312
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:20,951
uh,

313
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:24,730
of enlightenment driven progress is that
we have managed to tease them apart.

314
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:29,800
Just two examples are the fact that the
rate of homicide punished by a factor of

315
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:33,430
about 35 from the Middle Ages
to the 20th century and that,

316
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,860
and that includes the
scientific revolution,

317
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,360
the Industrial Revolution,

318
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:40,210
and the enlightenment to all of
the events of the 20th century.

319
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,490
So justice people were
not stabbing each other.

320
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:43,870
So if we're in salts,

321
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,550
they were also coming up with the theory
of evolution than the atomic theory of

322
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:49,180
matter.

323
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,830
And then again,

324
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,830
the 1990s when the rate of violent
crime in the United States fell by half,

325
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,030
and they were also declines in Canada,

326
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:57,790
Britain,

327
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:58,900
other western countries.

328
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,600
This certainly was not a time
of economic stagnation or tech.

329
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:03,511
No,

330
00:12:03,511 --> 00:12:04,010
no.

331
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:04,800
Fair enough.

332
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,520
I guess then the question starts to become
is how in the world did those things

333
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:12,210
get teased apart so that we are able to
regulate anti social behavior without

334
00:12:12,211 --> 00:12:14,490
simultaneously making things,

335
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,673
um,

336
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:18,000
excessively rigid,

337
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,560
unregulated totalitarian.

338
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,513
We managed it.

339
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,790
Maybe it's part of that same incremental
process that you detailed out at the

340
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,720
beginning of our talk.
