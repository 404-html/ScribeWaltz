1
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:02,971
All right,

2
00:00:02,971 --> 00:00:07,971
we're going to play a video real quick
and then a liquid and I are going to talk

3
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:09,534
about it.

4
00:00:10,270 --> 00:00:11,103
Sounds good.

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,970
Let me find it.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:25,990
I'm already failing here.

7
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,753
Alright,

8
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,060
well you know when you also have
to look with regards to that.

9
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:45,210
The shadow ideas like you have
to get in touch with your anger.

10
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:46,341
You know,

11
00:00:46,341 --> 00:00:49,130
lots of people are resentful
about all sorts of things.

12
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:50,190
They're resentful about,

13
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:51,523
oh

14
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,250
women and they're resentful about men and
they're resentful about the patriarchy

15
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:57,370
and they're resentful about the left wing,

16
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,220
resentful about the right wing and the
resentful about politicians and they're

17
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:06,221
resentful about the cataclysmic force
of nature and its ability to make people

18
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:12,671
sick and and suffer and they're resentful
about their own inadequacies in the

19
00:01:12,801 --> 00:01:13,101
boat.

20
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:18,101
Their bad parenting and God like the
list is just bloody endless and that can

21
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:19,730
make you very,

22
00:01:19,731 --> 00:01:24,731
very angry and that's part of that
resentment and cynical and bitter and dark

23
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:29,210
and full of fantasies about destruction
and the desire to bring things down and

24
00:01:29,211 --> 00:01:33,380
the wish that everyone else suffered and
the desire to shake your fist at God.

25
00:01:33,381 --> 00:01:35,810
And all of that's really dark.

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,440
You know,

27
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,251
young said,

28
00:01:37,251 --> 00:01:37,670
well,

29
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:40,730
the shadow human shadow extends
all the way down to hell.

30
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,353
Okay,

31
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,860
we're going to try that one more
time because I failed there.

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,030
Uh,

33
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,930
let's try this again.

34
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,230
I touch with the depths of your anger.

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,010
You know,

36
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:00,770
lots of people are resentful
about all sorts of things.

37
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:01,840
They're resentful about,

38
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,143
oh,

39
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,691
women.

40
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:08,130
And they're resentful about men and their
research and they're resentful of the

41
00:02:08,131 --> 00:02:08,481
left.

42
00:02:08,481 --> 00:02:09,260
Wait 26,

43
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:14,260
present politicians and
resentful about the,

44
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:19,730
like the cataclysmic force of nature
and its ability to make people sick and

45
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,460
suffer and they're
resentful about their own.

46
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,470
And now he's in the boat.

47
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,680
They're bad parents suffer
both nature and stuff.

48
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:29,970
And it's true.

49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,080
A lot of people

50
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,290
say that say the systems that we live
in are what causes our suffering,

51
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:37,891
and that's true.

52
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,060
It can add to the suffering,

53
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,850
but ultimately the suffering
is just being itself,

54
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,773
you know,

55
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,913
and.

56
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:44,640
Yeah.

57
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,473
Uh,

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,141
yeah.

59
00:02:46,141 --> 00:02:47,100
And you know,

60
00:02:47,101 --> 00:02:47,934
the,

61
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,670
the very idea of resentment.

62
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:56,350
I've just come across a paper
or a book called on resentment.

63
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,310
I'm forgetting who the
authors are and it's a

64
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:01,961
constantly.

65
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:06,961
It goes over different people including
a nature and Virginia Woolf on and finch

66
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:10,210
who was a 17th century poet,

67
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:10,560
I think,

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:10,810
you know,

69
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,810
she was a very much against the Patriarchy
and Virginia Woolf basically spells

70
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:20,320
out that it was a and finches,

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:20,680
you know,

72
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,680
dwelling in her own writing
that contributed to her
a resentment and that the

73
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:30,670
very act of writing for her was,

74
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:31,653
you know,

75
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,141
the,

76
00:03:32,141 --> 00:03:32,974
uh,

77
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,750
the source of her own mental illness.

78
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:35,710
And it's constantly,

79
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,760
it,

80
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,760
you constantly see that these authors
or writers mentioned resentment as a

81
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,270
mental illness.

82
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,433
And I never,

83
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:47,681
I mean,

84
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:52,681
I've heard Peterson talk about it and
he may have even explicitly said that,

85
00:03:53,261 --> 00:03:53,820
but,

86
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,170
you know,

87
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:54,881
never have.

88
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,130
I,

89
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:55,963
uh,

90
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:57,700
you know,

91
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:01,160
never outside of him have I thought about
it like that or heard it from somebody

92
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:01,994
else.

93
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:02,871
Yeah,

94
00:04:02,871 --> 00:04:04,220
it's interesting.

95
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:04,541
Okay.

96
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:09,541
I've listened to a lot of his Bible
lectures and when the store is the way he

97
00:04:10,071 --> 00:04:11,660
describes the enable story,

98
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:17,200
it really made me think about like in my
own life when I've thought about house,

99
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:21,470
maybe I blame someone else for
my problems or how I blamed,

100
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:21,830
like,

101
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,191
you know,

102
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:25,460
the fact of being then I thought about
and that makes sense because like,

103
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:26,810
what am I actually blaming,

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,320
not blaming the fact that I'm just
alive and if I'm blaming that,

105
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:31,810
then uh,

106
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:36,230
maybe I should do something to make
that better rather than just blaming

107
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:37,160
everyone else.

108
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:38,570
Um,

109
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,400
yeah,

110
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,980
it certainly has.

111
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,060
I think it happens to everybody.

112
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,733
Yeah.

113
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,633
Uh,

114
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,633
you know,

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,680
if,

116
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:45,960
you know,

117
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,080
I,

118
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,330
I guess everybody can be a victim,

119
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:52,350
but I think what's another
interesting thing in that book it,

120
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,400
I forget the author who,

121
00:04:55,420 --> 00:05:00,420
I think it might've been a
character guard that said,

122
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,080
I'm not sure that might
be another person that,

123
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:05,800
you know,

124
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,510
you need a victim,

125
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,010
you need a victimizer,

126
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,840
but then you also need this,

127
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,111
you know,

128
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,590
this third person,

129
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:17,591
this spectator who basically
is emancipated from the
resentment or resentment or

130
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,720
sorry,

131
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,580
emancipated from the victimization,

132
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,650
who is able to see it and you know,

133
00:05:23,651 --> 00:05:28,540
almost empathize with the
people who are being victimized.

134
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,280
And Peterson talks about that too,

135
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:31,630
not necessarily in this video,

136
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,130
but he talks about how,

137
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,761
you know,

138
00:05:33,761 --> 00:05:34,594
it's,

139
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,300
it can be evil to,

140
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,343
um,

141
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,880
to empathize with somebody else's problems

142
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,403
and

143
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,150
you're robbing them of their
own capacity to solve them.

144
00:05:50,151 --> 00:05:50,800
Right?

145
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,190
They like taking on their problems,

146
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:52,551
stealing.

147
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:53,720
Then yeah,

148
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,530
I listened to a,

149
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,283
uh,

150
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Steven Hicks called a post explaining
postmodernism and kierkegaard comes up

151
00:06:05,391 --> 00:06:06,224
quite a bit,

152
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:06,461
but,

153
00:06:06,461 --> 00:06:06,650
uh,

154
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:06,900
anyway,

155
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,270
so I guess maybe we should get back to
the video and see what comes up next.

156
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:11,541
All right.

157
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,070
So I'm at 39 seconds.

158
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,150
Okay,

159
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:14,410
let me,

160
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,480
I'm at 49 and I'll come back to the.

161
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:17,600
I'll come back to 39.

162
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:18,963
Okay.

163
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,070
Likelihood you have of terrible capacity
for destructive testing in the boat.

164
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,393
They're bad.

165
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,120
God like the list is just bloody endless.

166
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,190
And that can make you very,

167
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:36,191
very angry that that's part
of that resentment at 54 dark.

168
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:41,380
And one thing you mentioned is a two says
the list is almost endless and that's

169
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:48,431
sort of goes along the lines of it reaches
to the deepest depths of hell if you

170
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:50,630
really follow that,

171
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,100
uh,

172
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,591
that list,

173
00:06:51,591 --> 00:06:52,424
right?

174
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,363
Yeah.

175
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:53,910
Yeah.

176
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:54,743
Uh,

177
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,370
you know,

178
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:59,900
you can always think of a
worse place you could be in.

179
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,480
You could always think of a
worse thing that you could do.

180
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:03,314
I mean,

181
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,030
yeah,

182
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,700
it's absolutely endless.

183
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:07,971
I mean,

184
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:08,081
you,

185
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,050
you hear about,

186
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,250
you know,

187
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,250
atrocities in the world and though
some stand out more than others.

188
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:16,910
Um,

189
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,600
and you know,

190
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,060
dare I say know genocide of

191
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,430
6 million plus you had
the concentration camps.

192
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,480
Then you also had the in the,

193
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:30,314
uh,

194
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:31,861
oh yeah.

195
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:35,120
Your blood left in eastern
Europe as they move towards

196
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,020
Russia.

197
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,570
Um,

198
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,680
but you know,

199
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:38,410
it

200
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,750
can always be worse.

201
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:40,863
I mean,

202
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,540
here's a visual for you.

203
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:47,541
So there's a train that night train that
goes from Moscow to St Petersburg and

204
00:07:47,741 --> 00:07:47,841
uh,

205
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,650
I took that terrain and the entire,

206
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,630
almost the entire length of
the railway is just grades

207
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,430
and it's quite the distance.

208
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:59,820
It takes a eight to nine hours
or so to the trainer there.

209
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,373
So

210
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,293
yeah,

211
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:03,640
that's it.

212
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,700
You can see them in the moonlight.

213
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,510
You could,

214
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,820
you just like the
reflections of the crosses.

215
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,430
It's millions or hundreds.

216
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:12,390
At least hundreds of thousands.

217
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:16,080
I could see like the one that
train track it was crazy.

218
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,143
Yeah,

219
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,441
like things,

220
00:08:19,441 --> 00:08:20,320
things going to be way more,

221
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,400
way worse than then you
could even imagine that.

222
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:25,710
Yeah.

223
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,540
I can't even comprehend that now.

224
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,913
I mean,

225
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,600
seeing that would just probably
leave me numb for a little while.

226
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,083
You know,

227
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,580
it was hard to really
contemplate when I was only 17,

228
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:40,050
but I still kind of remember it.

229
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:40,920
Um,

230
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,670
the,

231
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,503
it was not,

232
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,220
never seen anything like that before.

233
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,740
It reminded me of my
grandparents when they went to a,

234
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,510
their insurance stationed in
Germany after the war and uh,

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,130
they would go to the Canadian,

236
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,661
an ally,

237
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:59,661
a grave sites and it just the miles
and miles of a cross as well and looked

238
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:00,940
some,

239
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,600
I guess Jewish graves
in some Muslim grades,

240
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:05,040
but mostly mostly,

241
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:05,370
uh,

242
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,203
crosses.

243
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,250
But I remember my grandma,

244
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,950
my mom remembers my grandma just
crying and crying and crying.

245
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,280
Yeah.

246
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,020
Because these are all men
that she might've known,

247
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:15,854
right?

248
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,733
Yeah.

249
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:18,483
No.

250
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:18,651
Oh.

251
00:09:18,651 --> 00:09:19,360
Anyways,

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:19,701
so we're,

253
00:09:19,701 --> 00:09:20,990
I'm at 54 seconds.

254
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:22,481
I'll,

255
00:09:22,481 --> 00:09:22,820
uh,

256
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,390
I'll start.

257
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,130
You can go ahead,

258
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:24,500
start.

259
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,050
Maybe we'll stop at like why
you choose the next stop.

260
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,383
Alright.

261
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,860
Just tell me a desire
to bring things down.

262
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,970
Wished that everyone else suffered and
desire to shake your fist at God and all

263
00:09:36,971 --> 00:09:38,530
of that really dark.

264
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,250
You know,

265
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,001
Young said,

266
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:41,650
well the shadow human shout,

267
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:44,920
it extends all the way down to
help and he really meant that,

268
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,150
you know,

269
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:51,150
because all the terrible things that
people are motivated to do are associated

270
00:09:52,361 --> 00:09:53,690
with that shadow domain.

271
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:56,140
And like none of you are any.

272
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,260
None of you are saints in any likelihood.

273
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:03,130
You have a terrible capacity
for destructiveness and
when you start to consult

274
00:10:03,131 --> 00:10:05,380
your resentment and to
see how angry you are,

275
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,310
it can terrify you or deceive the depths
of that anger sometimes will manifest

276
00:10:09,311 --> 00:10:10,400
itself in very good.

277
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:11,080
Alright,

278
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,913
so I stopped at.

279
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:13,421
Yeah,

280
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:17,380
I wonder sometimes what it would be like

281
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,583
four,

282
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:20,800
some of the,

283
00:10:20,801 --> 00:10:21,634
uh,

284
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,333
people who

285
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,190
err on the side of social
justice to actually see what,

286
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:34,820
what the possibilities
of their own thinking,

287
00:10:34,821 --> 00:10:36,180
what the fruit of their

288
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,721
theories.

289
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:40,910
But if you were to play out their own

290
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,680
narrative,

291
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,061
yeah,

292
00:10:44,061 --> 00:10:46,280
if you were to play out
their own narrative,

293
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:49,220
what that would lead to and you know,

294
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:54,620
it's probably inevitably
leads to the same,

295
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:55,910
you know,

296
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:56,510
if it's,

297
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,040
if it's fueled by resentment,

298
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,400
probably if it fuels and is always
fed with the same resentment,

299
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:06,350
then it will inevitably lead to murder.

300
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,640
I mean that's,

301
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,810
well most utopic vision.

302
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,530
The problem with them is that
they can never really be achieved.

303
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,480
I guess good to have some goals,

304
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:17,100
like reduce suffering.

305
00:11:17,101 --> 00:11:17,940
That's not a bad goal,

306
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:22,560
but if your idea's elimination
of suffering at all.

307
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,513
Oh,

308
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:24,630
oh,

309
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:27,000
more suffering than it's ever been seen.

310
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,020
And history,

311
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,460
at least in the 20th century,

312
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,120
uh,

313
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,690
has shown us showing us that that's,

314
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,050
that's,

315
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:36,570
that's history that we know this
history in the past that's just as bad.

316
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:39,680
It's all for offer utopia.

317
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,173
Yeah.

318
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,670
You can never really achieve it.

319
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:45,830
Right.

320
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,370
Okay.

321
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:46,551
Yeah,

322
00:11:46,551 --> 00:11:47,330
you can't,

323
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,580
you can't eliminate suffering.

324
00:11:50,150 --> 00:11:50,840
But,

325
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:51,673
uh,

326
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:53,120
another interesting,

327
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,013
another interesting

328
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,490
idea in that book on resentment,

329
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,490
I'll throw it into the description though,

330
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:03,891
you know,

331
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,280
it's an 50 to $80 ebook

332
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,533
is,

333
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,500
and I forget who says this.

334
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,040
It's,

335
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,700
you know,

336
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,190
it's a thinker that most
other people would know,

337
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,450
but they mentioned that it's a,

338
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,950
that it's in an impotent lust for revenge.

339
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:25,901
You know,

340
00:12:25,901 --> 00:12:29,290
it's almost like the person
knows that they're vulnerable.

341
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:34,240
Victim knows that they're vulnerable,

342
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:36,610
but that they can't do anything.

343
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:41,640
And so their resentment is
fueled by their own impotency.

344
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,211
I mean,

345
00:12:43,211 --> 00:12:44,320
it's almost like this,

346
00:12:44,321 --> 00:12:45,154
uh,

347
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,890
the more whether or not they're,

348
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:52,780
they feel sorry whether or
not a person is wronged.

349
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:54,940
Like if a person continues to,

350
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,410
to,

351
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,243
uh,

352
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,043
to think

353
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,720
about being victimized,

354
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,090
then you know,

355
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:02,360
they,

356
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,990
they just keep fueling the
resentment and it's an,

357
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:05,910
it's easy.

358
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,310
It's,

359
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:06,551
you know,

360
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:07,540
it can easily happen,

361
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,190
especially if you start to,

362
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:09,720
you know,

363
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,340
like Peterson says you,

364
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,780
I don't know if he says this,

365
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:14,100
but you know,

366
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,610
if you keep feeding the dragon,

367
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:15,971
you know,

368
00:13:15,971 --> 00:13:20,780
it just keeps getting bigger and
bigger and just ignore it too.

369
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,670
Yeah.

370
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:22,600
And if you ignore it,

371
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:23,500
but,

372
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:23,771
you know,

373
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:24,604
even if you,

374
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,880
if you can stop for a little while
and then continue again later,

375
00:13:30,101 --> 00:13:30,521
you know,

376
00:13:30,521 --> 00:13:30,970
it's,

377
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,960
it made the dragon may have
gotten smaller but you know,

378
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,480
it's still a drag and then it
hasn't completely disappeared yet.

379
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Anything you ignore a will get bigger
in the background and we'll start taking

380
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:45,130
up more and more of your,

381
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:45,760
uh,

382
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,160
your thoughts because you're
not dealing with the problem.

383
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,553
Yeah.

384
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,040
But also,

385
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,060
but also if you feed it,

386
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,660
that's also gonna cause problems
as well because you know,

387
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,040
if you're adding to it,

388
00:13:57,130 --> 00:13:59,740
you're adding to the problem
rather than confronting.

389
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,460
It was really a,

390
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,220
when you confront resentment,

391
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:07,270
you're really just confronting yourself
and a lot of people don't have the

392
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:10,180
courage to do that and fair enough,

393
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:10,480
this,

394
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,590
that's a tough one to do,

395
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,810
but if you want to get better,

396
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,093
you've got to do it.

397
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:15,881
Yeah.

398
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:16,480
Because,

399
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:16,751
you know,

400
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:17,940
your resentment is,

401
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,970
is personal.

402
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,060
It's all the ways in which,

403
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:22,810
unless it's,

404
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:23,470
you know,

405
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:25,840
in fueled by ideology.

406
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,140
And then it may be that,

407
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,130
you know,

408
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:33,000
the idea that there is an idea that's
controlling you rather than you.

409
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
I'm expounding an idea,

410
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:40,590
but let's say that the resentment is
personal and there's not an idealogue

411
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,453
driving it.

412
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,853
Um,

413
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,760
then you really have to,

414
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:45,810
you know,

415
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:46,081
get a,

416
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:46,914
hold on it,

417
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,000
get a hold of it and
figure out what exactly.

418
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:53,871
Well,

419
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:54,060
yeah,

420
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:59,060
it seems like Peterson says like the
socialists and if he got that from Orwell,

421
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:01,550
uh,

422
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,220
the Socialists don't love the poor,

423
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:05,270
they just hate the rich.

424
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:08,510
And the strange thing with
that is that they actually,

425
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,440
they hate the rich,

426
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,000
but the ideal idealize Islam,

427
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,180
and that's why they hate them because
they're resentful of the fact that they're

428
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:16,160
not rich or you know,

429
00:15:16,161 --> 00:15:18,470
there's some sort of moral
quandary with having wealth,

430
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:20,030
which really there isn't.

431
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:22,250
The problem is they don't have it.

432
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,040
So they wanted to destroy
it and that's like the,

433
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:25,641
you know,

434
00:15:25,641 --> 00:15:28,070
the typical out difficult.

435
00:15:28,071 --> 00:15:30,340
But the Cain and Abel story is all,

436
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,010
is that,

437
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:36,010
that's what that can enable story is it's
someone who idealized is something and

438
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:40,310
then tries to destroy it in
order to make themselves better.

439
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,070
But what happens when you destroy it,

440
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,920
you realize that you've
just destroyed your ideal,

441
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,630
which in a sense you've
destroyed yourself.

442
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,431
Where your soul is.

443
00:15:49,431 --> 00:15:50,270
The Christians would say,

444
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:52,803
yeah,

445
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:53,990
let's just,

446
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,823
you know,

447
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,703
I'm going to continue on.

448
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,323
Yeah,

449
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,810
I'm at the [inaudible] 37.

450
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:00,381
Yeah,

451
00:16:00,381 --> 00:16:00,760
me too.

452
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,593
Okay.

453
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,630
Fit.

454
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:04,020
Just fantasies.

455
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,863
You know,

456
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,910
which you might not want to become
conscious of because they're so brutal,

457
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:11,581
let's say.

458
00:16:11,581 --> 00:16:15,330
And so aggressive that you can't even
believe that you generate them the nice

459
00:16:15,331 --> 00:16:15,841
person.

460
00:16:15,841 --> 00:16:16,674
That's you.

461
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,251
It's like,

462
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:21,090
so it's quite frightening to open that
door and see all that and that also

463
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:25,470
associates you with the
entire dark shadow of mankind,

464
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,160
right?

465
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,400
The tannic element of
the human character and,

466
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,230
but it opens the door to
understanding as well to,

467
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,700
to understanding how people can do
terrible things because you could see

468
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:38,370
yourself as one of the people
who could be positive things.

469
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,543
That's through twelfth.

470
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:45,180
So when he says people
like they're on aisle,

471
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,790
I've found a lot of people are like,

472
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,150
if you ask them a question that if
they're capable of doing a terrible thing,

473
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,350
they'll usually say no,

474
00:16:51,351 --> 00:16:51,591
right?

475
00:16:51,591 --> 00:16:52,670
Because there's not a monster,

476
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,290
but that's the problem.

477
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:58,700
Because if they're a human being and
other human beings are capable of doing

478
00:16:58,701 --> 00:16:59,534
that terrible thing,

479
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,270
then automatically you're capable
of doing that terrible thing too,

480
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:03,990
right?

481
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,710
The only thing that's
stopping you is something,

482
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:07,993
right?

483
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,860
So is it because you're a coward?

484
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,510
Which is what Nietzsche would say,

485
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:12,531
um,

486
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:17,030
or is it because the laws or is it
because you have a reason not to do it?

487
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:21,170
And if you asked where the
resentment thing comes in,

488
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,370
because maybe your reason is that you,

489
00:17:24,371 --> 00:17:24,621
okay,

490
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:25,371
you have resentment,

491
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,170
figured you're dealing with it yourself,

492
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:30,470
like it's your problem and you're
not externalizing it to those things.

493
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,304
And

494
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,410
Yeah,

495
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:32,710
I,

496
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,430
uh,

497
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,263
I read,

498
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,810
I haven't read police battalion are.

499
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,100
I haven't read ordinary men completely.

500
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,521
In fact,

501
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:41,390
they haven't even started
reading it yet because I was,

502
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,940
I was seeing little excerpts and one of
the excerpts that stood out to me was

503
00:17:45,941 --> 00:17:47,950
that a police battalion,

504
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,000
I think it was one on one,

505
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,820
was made up of,

506
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,880
I forget who the author.

507
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,330
I'm a classified three
different types of men.

508
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,440
The men who were eager
to kill the men who were,

509
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,153
I'm

510
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:06,833
a

511
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:09,783
who would,

512
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:14,440
who would kill but weren't
initiating the action.

513
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,600
They would have to be initiated against.

514
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,660
They would have to have
someone initiate them to kill,

515
00:18:19,661 --> 00:18:21,100
but they would kill willingly.

516
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:26,720
Then the men who would basically
try and avoid the killing.

517
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,560
And you know,

518
00:18:29,561 --> 00:18:30,490
obviously,

519
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:33,340
you know,

520
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,270
all three groups said we're,

521
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:37,990
well,

522
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,070
we're part of the problem.

523
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,600
Not only part of the problem,

524
00:18:41,601 --> 00:18:42,460
but you know,

525
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,850
I guess I'd have to read it to find
out maybe more about the groups

526
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:50,781
for sure.

527
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,550
Like I have a lot more reading to do.

528
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:55,100
I've been doing more and
more reading over time,

529
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:55,550
but uh,

530
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:55,910
you know,

531
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:56,990
there's a lot of stuff to read.

532
00:18:56,991 --> 00:18:58,230
So yeah.

533
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,270
I'm just wondering.

534
00:18:59,270 --> 00:18:59,511
Yeah,

535
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:00,051
I'm wondering,

536
00:19:00,051 --> 00:19:00,884
you know,

537
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,210
how much some of these individuals
were in touch with their own darkness?

538
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:08,620
You know,

539
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,110
I,

540
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,530
I,

541
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:12,080
I would be hard pressed to think that,

542
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:12,500
you know,

543
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,140
the eager killers were all,

544
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:16,100
you know,

545
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,200
in touch with their own.

546
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,610
Or maybe they would be the ones
in touch with their own darkness,

547
00:19:22,611 --> 00:19:24,530
but they were the ones
who continued to feed it.

548
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:25,461
Yeah.

549
00:19:25,461 --> 00:19:26,150
That's the other.

550
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,120
Feeding the dragon rather than
integrated into themselves.

551
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:30,680
Yeah.

552
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,100
If you're,

553
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,580
if you're,

554
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,440
if you're not really using
the tool of consciously,

555
00:19:33,441 --> 00:19:34,220
then then you're,

556
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,510
then you're just feeding the dragon.

557
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:36,290
If you're.

558
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,180
There's times when you
should be a monster,

559
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,970
but if it's like shooting women in the
back of the head and open and feels like

560
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,210
that's not really a time,

561
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,960
that's obviously,

562
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,350
that's obviously a pathological situation,

563
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,184
but

564
00:19:51,010 --> 00:19:52,040
you've got to control it.

565
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,570
And maybe the men who killed willingly
because they knew that they had to,

566
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,460
whatever that means.

567
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,400
Um,

568
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,220
we,

569
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:00,720
uh,

570
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,870
were ones who were in touch,

571
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,330
but because they wouldn't
initiate it themselves,

572
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,610
maybe they were ones who,

573
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,130
God,

574
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,040
it's hard to say because,

575
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:11,923
you know,

576
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:12,800
Peter.

577
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,131
Yeah.

578
00:20:13,131 --> 00:20:14,430
They were following [inaudible] Peterson,

579
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:14,680
you know,

580
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,670
obviously mentioned,

581
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,173
you know,

582
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,880
when you start to think for yourself that,

583
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:20,630
you know,

584
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,520
I could be one of the,

585
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,580
you think to yourself that I
can be one of those guards,

586
00:20:23,581 --> 00:20:23,791
w,

587
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:24,624
w,

588
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,320
what would I have to do to make sure
that that would never happen now will,

589
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,370
I don't know because I
haven't read the book,

590
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:36,371
but I don't know of any three
of any individual in that
group that chose not to.

591
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,811
Or how about this?

592
00:20:38,811 --> 00:20:40,370
Like what would it take?

593
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:44,000
What would your life have to be like
in order to make a decision like that?

594
00:20:45,290 --> 00:20:46,580
Like realistically,

595
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:48,953
yeah,

596
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:53,710
that's another question should be asked
to because maybe if anybody's capable of

597
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:54,544
it,

598
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,600
it maybe,

599
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,770
maybe it's good to realize
what you would have to,

600
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:04,240
what kind of situation you
would have to be in to a reset.

601
00:21:04,241 --> 00:21:05,680
Same sort of decision.

602
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,141
Yeah.

603
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:10,280
That's necessary to even
begin thinking about it,

604
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:10,611
you know,

605
00:21:10,611 --> 00:21:11,900
to put yourself in that position,

606
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:12,770
you have to wonder,

607
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,610
you know,

608
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,180
what,

609
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,220
what situation would I have to be in?

610
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:21,320
Especially for the people who claim that
they could never be in that position

611
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,090
because they're good people.

612
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:24,863
You know,

613
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,573
they were good people.

614
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:27,610
We only killed $100,

615
00:21:27,611 --> 00:21:32,530
million innocent civilians in
the 20th century for ideals,

616
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:33,491
but it was worth it.

617
00:21:33,491 --> 00:21:34,324
Right.

618
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,450
It's an absolute monsters.

619
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:38,080
Oh,

620
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:38,651
I wouldn't.

621
00:21:38,651 --> 00:21:40,300
If I was in charge of the utopia,

622
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,070
it would have been ushered in.

623
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:42,461
Okay,

624
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:46,830
well then what happens to people like
you a while you get taken out by the cell

625
00:21:46,831 --> 00:21:47,540
in type system,

626
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,820
what Peterson says anyways.

627
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,893
And that makes sense.

628
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,850
I know.

629
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,683
Yeah.

630
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,570
Yeah.

631
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,320
I'm going to continue to let this go.

632
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:55,300
I'm at 10 to 12.

633
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,283
Okay.

634
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,163
No,

635
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,053
because then you.

636
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,240
Well then maybe you start to be motivated
to be the sort of person who wouldn't

637
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:06,380
do terrible things.

638
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:06,831
You know,

639
00:22:06,831 --> 00:22:10,280
if you can really come to terms with
the fact that that's part and parcel of

640
00:22:10,281 --> 00:22:10,640
you.

641
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,430
It also is some perverse sense.

642
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,650
It's also a discovery of
your own strength though,

643
00:22:15,651 --> 00:22:18,980
because you know if you have
that desire for aggression,

644
00:22:18,981 --> 00:22:23,981
that desire for destruction and that
that ability to fantasize in that

645
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,460
aggressive manner,

646
00:22:25,461 --> 00:22:29,510
it also means that you can incorporate
some of that into your speech and into

647
00:22:29,511 --> 00:22:32,720
your actions so that you're
a lot more immovable,

648
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:33,950
right,

649
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:38,360
and and a lot more of a
force to contend with.

650
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:42,050
It can give you some respect for yourself
when you realize that you're a force

651
00:22:42,051 --> 00:22:44,240
of destruction as well as creation,

652
00:22:44,241 --> 00:22:48,200
and then you're also more likely to treat
yourself with a bit more intelligent.

653
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:49,034
Caution,

654
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:49,790
you know,

655
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,710
to know that you're a part of you is a
ticking bomb in some sense that could go

656
00:22:54,711 --> 00:22:56,300
off and so you,

657
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:56,900
you,

658
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,340
you tried a bit more lightly around
yourself and maybe you encourage people to

659
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,250
tread more lightly around you as well.

660
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,191
Okay,

661
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:08,680
so I know that's too in my life where,

662
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,500
uh,

663
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,260
if I'm,

664
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,290
if I'm passive,

665
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,070
people sort of tread all over you,

666
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,940
but if you take yourself seriously and
you don't let yourself get pushed around

667
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,710
and people read off that too,

668
00:23:23,711 --> 00:23:24,880
and then they treat you better,

669
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:25,900
you know,

670
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,890
they treat you seriously.

671
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,953
Yeah.

672
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,970
But I've also found

673
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,401
that,

674
00:23:29,401 --> 00:23:29,640
uh,

675
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,630
sometimes,

676
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:32,423
uh,

677
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,800
in my own experiences through work,

678
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:35,640
you know,

679
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,000
a lot of times when I
worked in a cabinet shop,

680
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:39,161
you know,

681
00:23:39,161 --> 00:23:44,161
I'd be somewhat aggressive sometimes
trying to rally people together and some,

682
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,233
you know,

683
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,320
more often than not that aggression,

684
00:23:48,321 --> 00:23:48,561
you know,

685
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:51,910
it could be a better place.

686
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,280
I'm trying to ask somebody for help,

687
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,283
uh,

688
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,300
and people just thinking,

689
00:23:59,301 --> 00:23:59,590
you know,

690
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,423
well,

691
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,450
we don't have to do that or you know,

692
00:24:02,451 --> 00:24:05,710
that's not required to me or
you're not my boss and the,

693
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,880
it would be for the good of the company,

694
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:08,743
you know.

695
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:09,501
Well,

696
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,291
that's another thing too,

697
00:24:10,291 --> 00:24:14,110
is like you have to match it with your
perceived competence competency to,

698
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:15,463
um,

699
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,330
if you've earned sort of the,

700
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,164
uh,

701
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,720
if you've earned your stripes so to speak.

702
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,530
I find that people are way more
willing to take you seriously.

703
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,460
Like I've,

704
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,710
I've worked in two different trades.

705
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:32,300
I've been a carpenter and I've been
a nominal electric later and uh,

706
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,150
I was a young guy so I had no experience.

707
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,440
I had very little knowledge by just
kind of like did all the hard work and

708
00:24:39,441 --> 00:24:42,170
eventually an ass a lot of questions
and eventually they're like,

709
00:24:42,171 --> 00:24:43,004
okay.

710
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,640
They started taking it more seriously
and I got my apprenticeship and stuff.

711
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,170
And then I met six months later I
moved to a different trade altogether,

712
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,910
but I just kept trying to move up.

713
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,300
But my point is,

714
00:24:54,301 --> 00:24:56,830
is that by getting up,

715
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:59,600
I actually jumped ahead
of other guys that were,

716
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,270
uh,

717
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,130
also apprentices,

718
00:25:01,131 --> 00:25:04,580
but there were there longer because
my work ethic pushed me into a more

719
00:25:04,581 --> 00:25:05,630
respectable position.

720
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,510
So when I would mention something
they would take it seriously,

721
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,950
which was also helpful.

722
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:13,970
But I haven't been in the other position
to where I'm trying to bring up ideas

723
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:18,800
and I have an earned my stripes yet I'm
kind of too incompetent to like make a

724
00:25:18,801 --> 00:25:22,330
change and then people just
ignore you or whatever.

725
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:23,210
Yeah.

726
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,220
I find it much more tough when you're a,

727
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:26,281
you know,

728
00:25:26,281 --> 00:25:31,281
you work longer and your competency
level is already fairly high.

729
00:25:31,481 --> 00:25:34,370
But know people aren't necessarily.

730
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:38,510
Well you might have a high.

731
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:41,670
But I'm not that I'm talking to myself up,

732
00:25:41,671 --> 00:25:41,880
but,

733
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:42,121
you know,

734
00:25:42,121 --> 00:25:44,220
I guess there's always
different situations.

735
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:44,880
Um,

736
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,350
but we'll have,

737
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:45,520
you know,

738
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,560
what exactly do you think
Peterson means by integrating,

739
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:49,730
integrating it,

740
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:54,300
your speech by what you're
saying by basically taking
yourself seriously and not

741
00:25:54,301 --> 00:25:54,871
being passive.

742
00:25:54,871 --> 00:25:56,970
Like what would be an
example you think of?

743
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,801
Like for example,

744
00:25:58,801 --> 00:26:00,360
when I was working in carpentry,

745
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,520
did we ever doing a garage for a,

746
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,090
a big,

747
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,380
a large residential building?

748
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:05,860
And uh,

749
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:10,860
I noticed that my cousin was actually
contracted us the person to do the roofing

750
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,130
and stealing and stuff
of all the concrete.

751
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:19,140
And I noticed that one of the walls on
the parking garage wasn't sealed with

752
00:26:19,141 --> 00:26:19,974
tar.

753
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,600
And I've mentioned that to my,

754
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,321
I was an apprentice,

755
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:25,800
so I mentioned to my carpenter
a journeyman and he's like,

756
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:26,071
oh yeah,

757
00:26:26,071 --> 00:26:26,904
that makes sense.

758
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,110
Normally as he called me.

759
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,650
And so I went and got
tempted to talk to her.

760
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,410
He went and went and talked
to the superintendent and
the Superintendent said,

761
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,711
ah,

762
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:35,970
now we don't need to worry about it.

763
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:37,800
So then they fill it in,

764
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:38,011
right?

765
00:26:38,011 --> 00:26:39,240
Because they're almost like the space.

766
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:44,210
And I fill that in with backfill and down
over the weekend it and all the water.

767
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,370
Although water from the rain soaked
through the concrete and was like,

768
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,300
that's a huge problem,

769
00:26:48,301 --> 00:26:48,660
right?

770
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:49,493
Yeah.

771
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,830
So they had to take it all out
and then we seal the whole thing,

772
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,440
which would have been solved
already if they listened to me,

773
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,320
but they didn't listen to me because
I was just a dumb apprentice by this.

774
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:01,260
Noted that there was a problem and I had,

775
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:02,280
I thought of a solution.

776
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,820
So I presented it and my journeymen
thought it was a good idea.

777
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,700
So he passed it on and then
they didn't take it seriously,

778
00:27:08,701 --> 00:27:09,960
but then they had to fix it anyways.

779
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,040
So it cost them lots of money.

780
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,913
Maybe that.

781
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,040
Yeah.

782
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,630
But because I did something like that,

783
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:16,340
they,

784
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,980
they'd take me.

785
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,300
It started taking more seriously.

786
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,440
Um,

787
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:19,921
fair enough.

788
00:27:19,921 --> 00:27:20,041
Right.

789
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:22,440
You don't want like there's a bunch of
young idiots out there that think they

790
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,274
know everything,

791
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,760
which is like the first
day when you think the.

792
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:31,680
So they say the Delphi of the Oracle of
Delphi said that socrates was the wisest

793
00:27:31,681 --> 00:27:33,960
of the Greeks because he
alone movie knew nothing.

794
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,640
And uh,

795
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,473
this true,

796
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,800
the more you know,

797
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:38,971
the more you know,

798
00:27:38,971 --> 00:27:39,804
you don't know.

799
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:43,980
So this sort of a good
thing to keep in mind.

800
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,520
You gotta know if you're competent
before you try to make change,

801
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,833
which a lot of people are like,

802
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:49,650
Eh,

803
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,483
I don't need to do that.

804
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,940
So they just go out and run around like
a bull in a China shop and no one takes

805
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:56,010
them seriously because why would you?

806
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,560
Right.

807
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,393
Yeah.

808
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,041
Yeah.

809
00:27:59,041 --> 00:28:00,090
That makes a lot of sense.

810
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,140
Yeah.

811
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,730
I think that's what Peterson means with a.

812
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,051
When he says like,

813
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:05,430
make you clean your room,

814
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,580
it's a prove to yourself that you have
competency to do so because if you can't

815
00:28:11,461 --> 00:28:11,941
do that,

816
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:16,920
then maybe you should reassess your own
competency and it's people make fun of

817
00:28:16,921 --> 00:28:18,120
it because it's like silly,

818
00:28:18,121 --> 00:28:18,954
right?

819
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,760
But the point is is you're supposed to
test your competency competency or making

820
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:26,250
a room and then you test your
competency and other things.

821
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:29,100
Maybe keeping your house clean and uh,

822
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,520
and then try to realize that if
you know that you're competent,

823
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:37,670
then you have the confidence in your
speech and the precision of your speech to

824
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,370
make a bigger suggestions more,

825
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:41,790
more,

826
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,320
more worldly inside your family or
inside your friend circle or your work

827
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,970
outside of your own personal life.

828
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:52,260
Maybe then you could have some confidence
in your competency because otherwise,

829
00:28:52,261 --> 00:28:52,860
what are you,

830
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,100
right?

831
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,933
You're just,

832
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,370
you could just be any
random joe with that ideas.

833
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,230
And are they supposed to
take everyone seriously?

834
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,930
It was too many people know to do that.

835
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:02,003
Yeah.

836
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,970
Yeah.

837
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:06,750
So that's why you're saying it's important
to prove to yourself that you have

838
00:29:06,751 --> 00:29:07,584
competency.

839
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:09,690
That's what the whole
cleaning room thing is

840
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:12,423
least in my opinion.

841
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,050
Yeah.

842
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,250
Yeah.

843
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,030
He tied it together nicely.

844
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:18,400
Yeah.

845
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,730
All right.

846
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:18,911
Well,

847
00:29:18,911 --> 00:29:19,601
do you want to keep going?

848
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:19,930
We got it.

849
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:20,620
Yeah.

850
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,100
Yeah.

851
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:21,341
Okay.

852
00:29:21,341 --> 00:29:22,660
I got a three.

853
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:23,840
18 almost started up.

854
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,113
Okay,

855
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:25,691
well did.

856
00:29:25,691 --> 00:29:27,160
I really admired that.

857
00:29:27,161 --> 00:29:32,161
I know have a clearly dangerous
side and you don't want to get,

858
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,950
you don't want to have that
activated any more than necessary,

859
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,830
but it's also what makes
them respectable and strong,

860
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,690
especially if they have
that under control.

861
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,063
So.

862
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:42,930
Oh,

863
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:45,310
that's a bit of a dialogue
about shadow integration.

864
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,323
It's a very

865
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,380
challenging undertaking,

866
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:50,830
you know,

867
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,830
to pull in that dark side of your
character and that would be all the things

868
00:29:56,801 --> 00:30:01,801
that you've repressed or failed to
develop as a consequence of trying to be a

869
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,300
harmless and uh,

870
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:06,630
well let's say harmless,

871
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:11,980
harmless citizen who looks
virtuous on the surface.

872
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,660
That's the union persona.

873
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,490
And you need that because everybody
needs a mask that they wear in public,

874
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:19,324
like a suit,

875
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:19,960
you know,

876
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:24,040
so that we can tolerate seeing
each other on the street.

877
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:28,270
We don't have to look right
into our depths every time
we interact you need that

878
00:30:28,271 --> 00:30:28,841
persona,

879
00:30:28,841 --> 00:30:32,290
but now it has to be transcendent.

880
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:35,500
And the way to transcend
that is to integrate.

881
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:40,740
The darker parts of the
character are very useful demand.

882
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,613
For example,

883
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:45,550
I've noticed that if you see
like sjws how they dress,

884
00:30:45,551 --> 00:30:46,384
they always stressed with like,

885
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:47,223
you know,

886
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,240
kind of unconventionally
a lot of the time.

887
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:49,991
Not all of them do,

888
00:30:49,991 --> 00:30:54,010
but sort of the crazy
ones do I haven't seen,

889
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:54,401
you know,

890
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:57,190
other than some of the protests
that Peterson has been at.

891
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,181
Yeah,

892
00:30:58,181 --> 00:30:58,511
I know.

893
00:30:58,511 --> 00:30:59,620
I kind of know what you're talking about.

894
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:00,454
Yeah.

895
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,270
Yes.

896
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,180
So that,

897
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,620
that's sort of like the reason why they
do that is because they're trying to be

898
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:06,460
unconventional,

899
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,070
but the result and uh,

900
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:11,450
the results and feelings from a,

901
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:16,060
I guess people that are conventional as
they see sort of see sort of the chaos

902
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,280
in their own minds being expressed.

903
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:18,850
Right?

904
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:23,850
So they show themselves as incompetent
and then they show themselves further and

905
00:31:24,581 --> 00:31:25,990
competent in the way they speak.

906
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,580
So when they cry and like that,

907
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,400
there's like those memes of people crying
when trump was elected or sworn in or

908
00:31:33,401 --> 00:31:34,130
whatever.

909
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:34,840
Um,

910
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,550
and it just,

911
00:31:36,551 --> 00:31:39,490
like these people are showing,

912
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,710
their masks are falling off essentially,

913
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,050
and it's important to have those masks,

914
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,180
like when,

915
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:46,930
if you're coming,

916
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:51,930
if you come across someone that's like
dressed shabbily and they smell and uh,

917
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,050
they're not,

918
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:53,770
they're sort of,

919
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:55,030
I guess you could say unconventional,

920
00:31:55,031 --> 00:31:56,410
but really they just have poor hygiene.

921
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,450
Your art kind of put off,

922
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:58,870
right?

923
00:31:58,870 --> 00:31:59,590
You don't watch it.

924
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:00,900
They might interact with light,

925
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,680
but you're going to try to avoid them.

926
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,970
Right.

927
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,803
And uh,

928
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,033
yeah.

929
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,040
So yeah,

930
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,500
I,

931
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:08,690
I,

932
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,401
I wonder,

933
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:10,234
um,

934
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:13,681
yeah,

935
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,600
I think I'll start looking for that more.

936
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:19,380
I definitely can say I have seen that in
some of the people that stick out in my

937
00:32:19,381 --> 00:32:20,520
head and some of the videos,

938
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:22,021
yeah,

939
00:32:22,021 --> 00:32:25,440
like if you've come across sort of like
a homeless guy and if you stare at him,

940
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,170
like he might start freaking out at you,

941
00:32:27,171 --> 00:32:28,004
right?

942
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,130
Because you're,

943
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,480
you're seeing him for what as he is and
he's probably a little bit embarrassed

944
00:32:35,581 --> 00:32:35,881
by that.

945
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:40,881
So he might come at you or he might yell
at you or he show his chaos and which

946
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,510
stocks because you don't want
to treat people like that,

947
00:32:44,511 --> 00:32:47,090
but that's just the way
things are sometimes.

948
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:48,320
So,

949
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:48,641
uh,

950
00:32:48,641 --> 00:32:52,400
it's important if you want to see
another important side of this competency

951
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:56,090
thing is you got to appear competent
because people might not know and if you

952
00:32:56,091 --> 00:32:58,400
show that you can appear competent,

953
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:02,050
then people are more likely to want to
interact with you because they're going

954
00:33:02,051 --> 00:33:02,630
to see you.

955
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,410
Uh,

956
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,830
that's a more peaceful person I guess
in some way because they're going to be

957
00:33:06,831 --> 00:33:07,551
able to know that,

958
00:33:07,551 --> 00:33:07,821
okay,

959
00:33:07,821 --> 00:33:08,031
well,

960
00:33:08,031 --> 00:33:10,280
if a person's able to take care
of themselves hygienically,

961
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:11,930
then you know,

962
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:16,160
maybe I can have an actual conversation
with this person compared to a guy going

963
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,290
to be covered in actual garbage.

964
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,910
Then this can be difficult,

965
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:20,121
right?

966
00:33:20,121 --> 00:33:21,620
Because you're going to
be constantly smelling or,

967
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,513
or whatever.

968
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:23,160
Yeah.

969
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:23,993
I

970
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,650
don't know how much it's
hearsay or where it came from,

971
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:29,260
but I heard that Marx was a.

972
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,710
was it pretty dirty,

973
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,473
dirty person?

974
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,403
Smelled,

975
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,420
or we call them,

976
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,240
we call them,

977
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,590
I call them dirty Santa Claus.

978
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,650
Man filled with resentment is so,

979
00:33:42,651 --> 00:33:46,010
so resentful that he almost started
his own children who really.

980
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,583
Yeah.

981
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,550
Well it doesn't even have a job.

982
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:51,830
So he wasn't really
keeping up with the Miller,

983
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,760
isn't he really is the only,

984
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,700
only reason he was able to like
get by lists because angles,

985
00:33:55,730 --> 00:34:00,730
who was a son of a rich industrialists
was sending him money basically

986
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,073
and uh,

987
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:05,060
to help him with his writings.

988
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,530
I suppose that's,

989
00:34:06,531 --> 00:34:09,850
that's the only reason why otherwise
I think he had like four or five kids.

990
00:34:09,851 --> 00:34:10,571
Don't quote me on that,

991
00:34:10,571 --> 00:34:11,790
but yeah.

992
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:12,700
Yeah.

993
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,290
Didn't you horror on his own wife to A.

994
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:16,931
I don't know.

995
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,670
I can't say if that's true or not.

996
00:34:18,671 --> 00:34:19,504
I don't know.

997
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:20,373
But yeah,

998
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:20,790
I mean,

999
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,320
well,

1000
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,153
okay.

1001
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,850
Don't want to pick on somebody that
can't defend themselves anymore.

1002
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,010
I want to start again at 4:32.

1003
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,280
Only a little bit left.

1004
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:30,630
So.

1005
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:30,850
Okay,

1006
00:34:30,850 --> 00:34:31,683
I'll start up.

1007
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,260
That's very difficult to
socialize that competitiveness,

1008
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:40,330
but unbelievably useful in terms of force
and the character if you could manage

1009
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:41,164
it.

1010
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:43,743
Yeah.

1011
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:44,411
Yeah.

1012
00:34:44,411 --> 00:34:45,660
I think a sane socialized,

1013
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,780
socializing the competitiveness,

1014
00:34:46,781 --> 00:34:51,470
that's has a lot to do with what you
were talking about with competency and

1015
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,043
um,

1016
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:54,663
no,

1017
00:34:55,170 --> 00:34:56,250
if you are competitive,

1018
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:56,760
you know,

1019
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,200
a great thing to do is first to
appear competent so that you can

1020
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,920
display your competitiveness with some.

1021
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,953
Perfect.

1022
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,020
I don't know what I'm saying.

1023
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:11,250
Well,

1024
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:11,940
when I was,

1025
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,571
when I was younger,

1026
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:13,530
I used to think I was really,

1027
00:35:13,531 --> 00:35:14,221
really competent.

1028
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:14,491
Like I,

1029
00:35:14,491 --> 00:35:15,980
I thought I knew everything right.

1030
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:21,120
Which you don't really understand like
when you're 18 and you think you know

1031
00:35:21,121 --> 00:35:21,660
everything,

1032
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:24,000
you don't realize how
little you actually know.

1033
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,163
Right.

1034
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,790
So what I was,

1035
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:30,960
what I would I changed over time was
I just started reading more and then I

1036
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:32,070
started realizing I'm like,

1037
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:32,611
Oh shit,

1038
00:35:32,611 --> 00:35:33,180
I almost,

1039
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:36,210
I know almost nothing
about the more I've read,

1040
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:37,383
um,

1041
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,700
the more I realized that,

1042
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,110
um,

1043
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,280
but there's like 17,

1044
00:35:41,281 --> 00:35:41,581
18,

1045
00:35:41,581 --> 00:35:42,450
19 year old kid,

1046
00:35:42,451 --> 00:35:46,080
sometimes 20 year olds that are out there
protesting and they don't really know

1047
00:35:46,081 --> 00:35:47,070
what the hell they're protesting.

1048
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:51,360
Like you can even see it in
even Peterson and his history.

1049
00:35:51,361 --> 00:35:54,030
He's been in this situation where he was,

1050
00:35:54,031 --> 00:35:54,750
he ran for healing,

1051
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,980
he was like 16 or something.

1052
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,690
I ran for the vice president of the,

1053
00:35:57,691 --> 00:36:00,390
a new Democratic Party in Alberta,

1054
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,310
which is the Socialist Party,

1055
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:04,440
sort of democratic
socialist party in Canada.

1056
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:10,650
And I was also a member of that party
and I used to like do campaigning for a

1057
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:15,651
couple of the people that are eventually
won seats and I was like a campaign

1058
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,160
called captain or whatever
have a section of the,

1059
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,043
of the city.

1060
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,580
And uh,

1061
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,241
I mean it was fine.

1062
00:36:21,241 --> 00:36:22,200
It was interesting experience,

1063
00:36:22,201 --> 00:36:23,160
but now I look back on it.

1064
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,570
There was a lot of Weirdos in that,

1065
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,590
in that grouping.

1066
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:29,640
Like there's a lot of people
that they weren't very competent,

1067
00:36:30,270 --> 00:36:31,440
but they thought they knew everything.

1068
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:32,910
Yeah.

1069
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:33,170
You know,

1070
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:34,860
and that's the dangerous combination.

1071
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,990
I'm actually remembering a couple of
times in my own hometown where I had seen

1072
00:36:39,991 --> 00:36:40,120
a,

1073
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,570
a,

1074
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,210
a random group that had popped up,

1075
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:43,380
but Lyndon Larouche group,

1076
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:47,400
which was like a halfway between
a conspiracy theory group.

1077
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,233
And

1078
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:49,801
I don't know,

1079
00:36:49,801 --> 00:36:52,860
I don't know exactly
how to more like a cult.

1080
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,820
A cult would be a good,

1081
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:56,430
a good way to define them,

1082
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:01,490
but I remember a lot of the people
and I know I'm harping on it again,

1083
00:37:02,071 --> 00:37:05,070
but we're dressed up
and dressed really odd.

1084
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:06,630
Yeah.

1085
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:07,590
And a lot of them were,

1086
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,430
you know,

1087
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:10,230
as old as me and it was just a,

1088
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,191
you know,

1089
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:15,030
I had approached the table because they
were just at the local post office and I

1090
00:37:15,031 --> 00:37:18,060
was there for something and
I'm thinking to myself like,

1091
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:19,260
these guys are a little bit weird.

1092
00:37:19,261 --> 00:37:21,680
So I grabbed the brochure and
started looking at it and you know,

1093
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,411
so you know,

1094
00:37:22,411 --> 00:37:24,890
some of the literature sound good?

1095
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:26,890
Yeah.

1096
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,780
It seems interesting on the surface,

1097
00:37:28,781 --> 00:37:29,850
but you know,

1098
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,110
just judging by the people
who are already there,

1099
00:37:32,111 --> 00:37:35,080
it's like I don't think I want to
get involved with these people.

1100
00:37:35,081 --> 00:37:38,230
It's kind of funny how that's
kind of habits unconscious.

1101
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,980
Something you picked up unconsciously.

1102
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:42,101
It might.

1103
00:37:42,101 --> 00:37:42,320
Yeah,

1104
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,790
it,

1105
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,150
it's,

1106
00:37:43,150 --> 00:37:43,960
it's,

1107
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,550
it's funny because it stares
you right in the face,

1108
00:37:45,551 --> 00:37:49,690
but it's still sort of unconscious
because you give them this era of respect

1109
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:54,100
that they may not deserve a
automatically because you know,

1110
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:56,110
that's a way to have a peaceful society,

1111
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,570
but unconsciously maybe
subconsciously or unconsciously you,

1112
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:01,910
you see the,

1113
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:02,350
you know,

1114
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,250
something's up with them.

1115
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:04,240
Yeah.

1116
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,170
Subconsciously I think it was
the word I was looking for.

1117
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:08,830
I'm not sure what the
proper terminology is.

1118
00:38:08,831 --> 00:38:09,551
That as again,

1119
00:38:09,551 --> 00:38:10,420
I'm not educated.

1120
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,393
I just read a lot.

1121
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,653
Um,

1122
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,411
but yeah,

1123
00:38:14,411 --> 00:38:18,040
it's interesting you see it with a
scientology people too sometimes,

1124
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,860
like,

1125
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,693
still crazy.

1126
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:21,130
Yeah.

1127
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:21,963
I've never,

1128
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:24,070
I've never come across
anybody in scientology.

1129
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:26,990
They have a chapter in Vancouver,

1130
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,640
in the poor area,

1131
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:32,540
like we're a lot of the homeless people
live now and I don't know exactly how

1132
00:38:32,541 --> 00:38:33,050
they,

1133
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,860
maybe they survived because
almost pick of the money,

1134
00:38:35,861 --> 00:38:38,680
which I think could be kind
of a bad marketing plan.

1135
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:39,610
Um,

1136
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:40,443
but uh,

1137
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:40,961
yeah,

1138
00:38:40,961 --> 00:38:42,610
they're right in the middle
of the downtown east side,

1139
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,570
like right beside the unit.

1140
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,830
Do you ever heard of Mark Emery?

1141
00:38:44,831 --> 00:38:45,664
The principal?

1142
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,313
No.

1143
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:47,951
Okay.

1144
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,101
Well,

1145
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:52,060
he has a store downtown or he did back
in the day called cannabis culture or

1146
00:38:52,061 --> 00:38:55,570
something and it was like right
beside the scientology office,

1147
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,360
which I thought was
funny because Mark Emery,

1148
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,070
he's the kind of guy that would get,

1149
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:02,110
you would expect him to make
sort of like a pot centric,

1150
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,343
a religion.

1151
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:03,820
Uh,

1152
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:04,653
ironically,

1153
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,231
but,

1154
00:39:05,231 --> 00:39:05,530
uh,

1155
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:06,530
he wouldn't have that.

1156
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,660
He would never join scientology,

1157
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:12,440
but I wonder if maybe I'm scientology
put themselves there on purpose or,

1158
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,080
or maybe it was just you
happened to be there.

1159
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,440
Well,

1160
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,370
they do a,

1161
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,010
they do kind of prey on the abused.

1162
00:39:20,011 --> 00:39:20,844
The addicted.

1163
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,343
Yeah.

1164
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,100
The vulnerable people vulnerable.

1165
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:25,221
Yeah.

1166
00:39:25,221 --> 00:39:26,120
That's a better way to.

1167
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:26,960
Yeah,

1168
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,270
that's a better word I'm
looking for and you know,

1169
00:39:29,271 --> 00:39:29,480
that,

1170
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,313
you know,

1171
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:35,420
it's scary because in 2005 or six,

1172
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,930
they were actually one of the will self.

1173
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,560
They claimed it themselves,

1174
00:39:39,561 --> 00:39:43,700
but they were one of the fastest
growing religions in the world.

1175
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,101
Uh,

1176
00:39:44,101 --> 00:39:47,060
I think they were publishing and oh man,

1177
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,830
I don't know how many different languages,

1178
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,110
which is scary.

1179
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:52,723
Yeah.

1180
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,490
Well,

1181
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:53,630
like,

1182
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:53,750
who?

1183
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,430
The Mormons are passing them.

1184
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,120
Not that I'm really a
fan of more medicine,

1185
00:39:57,121 --> 00:39:58,430
but it's definitely better than.

1186
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,853
Yeah,

1187
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,330
yeah.

1188
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,163
At least.

1189
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,050
Or an old drug addicted.

1190
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:05,030
They dress well and don't smell.

1191
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:08,970
So that's what wasn't good for wives,

1192
00:40:08,971 --> 00:40:09,460
you know,

1193
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,000
I'm just,

1194
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,880
there's nothing wrong with that.

1195
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:13,530
I would not lie for us.

1196
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:14,403
Way Too much.

1197
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,583
One's enough.

1198
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,663
One's enough.

1199
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,883
Exactly.

1200
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,220
But uh,

1201
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:20,053
yeah.

1202
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:20,800
Well,

1203
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,620
so what do you,

1204
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,110
what do you think seems pretty.

1205
00:40:24,111 --> 00:40:24,944
Well,

1206
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:25,341
I think,

1207
00:40:25,341 --> 00:40:26,120
uh,

1208
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:26,510
yeah.

1209
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:31,510
Maybe we will just cut it here and
we'll come back later and above.

1210
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:35,903
All right.

1211
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,003
Take care of

1212
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:38,960
it.

1213
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,230
Do.
