00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:02,430
What do you think about Adhd?

2
00:00:02,431 --> 00:00:03,001
I have it.

3
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:05,460
I'm frustrated by my failures
in life because of it.

4
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:08,550
I am trying to become a a chemist
and I am failing at school.

5
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,080
Um,

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,320
I think ADHD is a catch all diagnosis.

7
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,880
I think that people who are extroverted
and unconscientious for example,

8
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:19,770
often manifest the traits of,

9
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:20,790
of uh,

10
00:00:20,791 --> 00:00:22,200
attention deficit disorder.

11
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,400
Um,

12
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,200
I know that there isn't any real evidence
of longterm utility and cycle and

13
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:28,710
cycle.

14
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:31,740
What a psycho pharmacological
treatment for Adhd.

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:32,430
Um,

16
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,360
I would say though,

17
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:36,690
if you are having a hard time
concentrating on your goals,

18
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,110
that what you should probably do is
set yourself up with a therapist,

19
00:00:40,111 --> 00:00:41,370
find someone you can talk to,

20
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:41,601
you know,

21
00:00:41,601 --> 00:00:43,110
so see two or three therapists.

22
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,570
I know it's expensive but
so is not having a life.

23
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,740
Find someone you can talk to and
then make it and someone practical,

24
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:51,810
probably a behavioral
therapist would be best.

25
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,030
And then have them set goals with you
and help you strategize to stay on track

26
00:00:57,031 --> 00:00:57,780
week to week.

27
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,770
That's the best thing.

28
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:01,560
Or to set that up with a friend if
he can't do it with the therapist.

29
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,790
So that's,

30
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,340
that's the best advice I have for that.

31
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:06,151
And keep at it,

32
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:06,840
man.

33
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,410
You know,

34
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:09,300
but break your,

35
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,590
you gotta learn to schedule.

36
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:15,450
You got to learn to break your days down
into disciplined subsections and you've

37
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,340
got to practice out at and practice at it.

38
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:17,840
And,

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,300
um,

40
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,190
there isn't an easier
answer that I know of,

41
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,160
but having someone that will
help keep your responsible,

42
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:24,150
I think can be useful.

43
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:27,390
I've seen that be useful for
people who have attention deficits,

44
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,991
disorder,

45
00:01:27,991 --> 00:01:28,470
let's say.
