1
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:10,181
Okay.

2
00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:13,210
So now we're going to go back in time
to Sumeria and I'm going to show you how

3
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:15,610
this scenario creation
myth lays itself out.

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,750
And not only that,

5
00:00:16,751 --> 00:00:21,751
I'm going to describe to you the direct
political implications of the new my

6
00:00:22,661 --> 00:00:23,021
list,

7
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:24,100
a Sumerian creation,

8
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:24,281
Beth,

9
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:28,510
because the political implications of
that myth are well understood because the

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,860
political structure of Sumeria
was directly associated
with the structure of the

11
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:37,861
myth because the Sumerian emperor was
regarded as the earthly representative of

12
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,800
the highest God in the Mesopotamian
Pantheon whose name was Marduk.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,390
So in so far as you were emperor,

14
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:47,770
the reason that you were emperor,

15
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:52,771
and this is what gave your
sovereignty legitimacy,

16
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:53,620
right?

17
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,300
Cause sovereignty has to have legitimacy,

18
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,040
otherwise there's constant revolutions.

19
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:01,660
What gave sovereignty legitimacy in
Mesopotamia was the identification of the

20
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:05,470
emperor with Marduk and that hat that
had certain implications for the emperor,

21
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:07,090
which we'll discuss in some detail.

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,070
The story starts like this.

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,490
You've got this drag tie a mat.

24
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:16,660
And timeout is a great primordial

25
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,180
beast who lives at the bottom of the
ocean and the ocean is water and water is

26
00:01:25,781 --> 00:01:28,690
associated with the primal
element in archaic thinking.

27
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:30,820
And I told you there's
reasons for that already.

28
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,750
If you viewed the transformation of
deserts has a consequence of rain,

29
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:38,680
can understand why water would be
considered the element that gives life,

30
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:38,921
right?

31
00:01:38,921 --> 00:01:41,290
That the element that
that brings life fourth.

32
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,990
And we know from an evolutionary
perspective that that's accurate.

33
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,650
And we know that we're 90%
water and so to consider water,

34
00:01:47,651 --> 00:01:51,220
the primal element is
no trivial conclusion.

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:51,510
No,

36
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,120
no less than presuming that the
sun is the ultimate source of life,

37
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,200
the ultimate God,

38
00:01:56,201 --> 00:01:59,890
because the sun is the ultimate source
of life as far as we're concerned on

39
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:00,161
earth,

40
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:00,341
right?

41
00:02:00,341 --> 00:02:01,840
Cause it's the source of all our energy.

42
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:03,610
These aren't stupid concepts.

43
00:02:03,611 --> 00:02:03,881
All right?

44
00:02:03,881 --> 00:02:08,500
So timeout is this horrible creature
that lurks at the bottom of the primal

45
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,420
element.

46
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:09,910
All right?

47
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,680
Now she has a husband Appsu.

48
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:15,100
Now the massive detain me and creation
myth doesn't say much about Appsu.

49
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,080
We only know that he's the male con,

50
00:02:17,081 --> 00:02:18,730
sort of the dragon of chaos.

51
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:23,760
And we know from reading other sources
of mythology that the male consort of the

52
00:02:24,761 --> 00:02:28,570
dragon of chaos generally
represents either logos or culture.

53
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,040
So we're going to make the presupposition
in this particular case that the

54
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,770
husband of chaos is order or culture.

55
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,191
Okay.

56
00:02:36,191 --> 00:02:38,410
And then the Mesopotamians
don't say much about that.

57
00:02:38,411 --> 00:02:39,250
That that doesn't,

58
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:43,570
the development of the idea of apps
who are order or culture doesn't,

59
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,200
it doesn't take new force
until the ancient Egyptians.

60
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,460
We'll talk about them today too.

61
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:48,731
Okay,

62
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:53,731
so ty about naps who are locked into a
kind of sexual embrace according to the

63
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:55,690
Mesopotamian creation myth.

64
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,130
And what does that mean?

65
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,510
It kind of means two things.

66
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:02,800
It means that they're not
really distinguishable
because they're locked into

67
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,640
this embrace.

68
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,900
And it also means that they're up to
something creative because the act of

69
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:11,800
sexual congress in
mythology is most usefully,

70
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,690
is most frequently utilized,

71
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:18,691
has representation of something creative
or as representation of the probability

72
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,860
of some new form coming to be.

73
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,590
Right.

74
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,001
All right,

75
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:27,001
so abso in timeout are locked into this
embrace in a state that other creation

76
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:32,630
myths describe as egg.

77
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,720
Like the pre cosmo Gornick egg,

78
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,660
there are intermingling gives rise to
the initial state of being according to

79
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:42,401
the Sumerians.

80
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:46,970
And the initial state of being according
to the Sumerians is characterized by

81
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:49,040
the dominion of the elder gods.

82
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,270
These gods being none too bright,

83
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,650
make a tremendous amount
of rack doing things well.

84
00:03:58,670 --> 00:03:59,960
What does that mean exactly?

85
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,443
Well,

86
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,970
it means something like this.

87
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,340
They make a lot of racket and
they cause a lot of trouble.

88
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:12,050
They make a lot of wind and all of the
racket and trouble and wind and activity

89
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,430
rouses tie amat.

90
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,373
What does that mean?

91
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:18,311
Well,

92
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,020
it means if you do things
and get in trouble,

93
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,870
it means even if you're
trying to solve problems,

94
00:04:22,871 --> 00:04:25,660
you get into trouble because
the solution to a problem,

95
00:04:25,661 --> 00:04:28,330
Chin tends to generate a
whole bunch of new problems,

96
00:04:28,331 --> 00:04:28,511
right?

97
00:04:28,511 --> 00:04:29,430
It's like the Hydra.

98
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,770
So what it means is that it's more or
less fated that any form of activity

99
00:04:36,671 --> 00:04:37,690
whatsoever

100
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:44,890
is likely to produce the
threat of catastrophe.

101
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,701
And of course,

102
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:49,600
we're absolutely keenly aware of that
in the modern world because we are

103
00:04:49,601 --> 00:04:53,560
possessed by this sense that
all of our frenetic activity,

104
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:58,390
all of our frenetic motivated activity
is producing alterations in the world

105
00:04:58,391 --> 00:05:03,391
order such that nature itself is going
to be destroyed and eliminate us.
