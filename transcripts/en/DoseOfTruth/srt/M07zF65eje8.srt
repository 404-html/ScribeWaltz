1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,830
Young was so radical thinker.

2
00:00:08,831 --> 00:00:09,970
It's just beyond belief.

3
00:00:09,971 --> 00:00:12,580
Like I've read a lot of critics
of young and I've always,

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:16,090
I've always got a kick out of them because
the things they accused young of are

5
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:19,930
so trivial compared to the things
that young actually did that it's like

6
00:00:19,931 --> 00:00:23,020
accusing a murderer of jaywalking.

7
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:25,990
Like because young was
unbelievably radical.

8
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:27,610
Like here's one of his ideas,

9
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:27,851
you know,

10
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:30,100
he thought that it was necessary.

11
00:00:30,101 --> 00:00:34,390
He believed that psychotherapy could
be replaced by a supreme moral effort.

12
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,050
And so the moral effort would be
something like aiming at the good and then

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,570
trying to integrate yourself
around that and that

14
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:47,790
the good at which you aimed would be
something approximating what you would be

15
00:00:47,891 --> 00:00:52,360
like if you manifested your full potential
and that you'd have a glimmering of

16
00:00:52,361 --> 00:00:54,340
what that for full potential was.

17
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:57,460
So that would be the potential
future you and he thought of that.

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,070
He thought of people as
four dimensional entities,

19
00:01:00,071 --> 00:01:04,510
especially essentially that we're
stretched across time and that you as a

20
00:01:04,511 --> 00:01:05,950
totality across time,

21
00:01:05,951 --> 00:01:10,480
including your potential manifested
yourself also in the here and now.

22
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,680
And that part of what your potential
manifested itself was something like the

23
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:17,530
voice of conscious
conscience or intuition.

24
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,060
It's amazing idea.

25
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:20,140
It's an amazing idea,

26
00:01:20,141 --> 00:01:20,381
right?

27
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:24,040
Because it's like what you could be in
the future beckons to you in the present

28
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,040
and helps you determine the
difference between good and evil.

29
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,840
It's a mind boggling idea.

30
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:29,710
And you know,

31
00:01:29,711 --> 00:01:33,340
I think that it's an idea
you have to contend with.

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,650
And then he went further than that.

33
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:36,310
And this is,

34
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:39,370
this is also remarkable idea.

35
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,240
You know,

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,410
he was interested in this symbolic
representation of Christ and I mean

37
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:45,610
psychologically speaking,

38
00:01:45,611 --> 00:01:50,611
and he thought of Christ
as the representation of
the ideal potential human.

39
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,050
It's something like that.

40
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,900
So it was a symbolic at,

41
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,571
at minimum,

42
00:01:55,571 --> 00:01:56,530
that's what Christ was,

43
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:59,950
is a symbolic representation of the
ideal potential of a human being.

44
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,090
And so for young,

45
00:02:01,091 --> 00:02:02,620
there was no difference between,

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,510
there was no psychological difference
between who you could be in the future

47
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:11,890
beckoning to you and the prey in the
present and orienting yourself in

48
00:02:11,891 --> 00:02:13,150
relationship to Christ.

49
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,141
Psychologically.

50
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:15,850
Those were the same thing.

51
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,600
And then so that's a
pretty mind boggling idea.

52
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,500
Like seriously,

53
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:21,910
that's a mind boggling idea.

54
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,600
You know,

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,280
especially when you add the psychological
idea that one of the things that

56
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:31,000
characterizes your ideal future self
is the ability to make sacrifices,

57
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:31,600
right?

58
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,890
And the deeper the sacrifice,

59
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:33,670
the better.

60
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:36,160
And then also to recover
from the sacrifice,

61
00:02:36,161 --> 00:02:36,341
right?

62
00:02:36,341 --> 00:02:37,690
So that's the death and rebirth.

63
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:42,190
So the part of you that's most
essential to your full flowering as a,

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,460
as a being is your ability to let things
go and then spring back from that.

65
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:52,360
So to die in some sense and to be
reborn in the service of a higher good.

66
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,440
And then,

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,440
well then the next part of that is that
the direction of the world depends on

68
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,913
doing that.

69
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,450
So not only your own life,

70
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,440
but your family's life.

71
00:03:02,441 --> 00:03:02,840
And,

72
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,560
and because we're networked
so intently together,

73
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,180
you know,

74
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,660
the whole panoply of humankind,

75
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,330
and maybe the structure of the,

76
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,590
of the cosmos.

77
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:11,970
And,

78
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:12,240
you know,

79
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,821
you might think,

80
00:03:12,821 --> 00:03:13,061
well,

81
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:13,421
no,

82
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,440
but you know,

83
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,030
it's not so simple.

84
00:03:16,031 --> 00:03:17,050
It's not so simple.
