1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,910
All right.
Foglight says,

2
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:10,090
I love this guy.
Well,

3
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:11,040
thank you.
Fog Light.

4
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:13,260
I would probably love you too if I knew
you.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,330
Let's see.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:21,970
Okay,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,870
who's at Santa Christ says,
I'm a monster.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,250
Roar.
Good.

9
00:00:27,251 --> 00:00:28,240
Well,
that's a good start,

10
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:29,860
man.
That's a good start.

11
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:34,060
Practice that roar
and get good at it because there'll be

12
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:36,400
times when you need it.
So

13
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,620
Dj chronic says,
I let myself be that week monster for so

14
00:00:44,621 --> 00:00:45,131
long.
Yeah,

15
00:00:45,131 --> 00:00:47,170
well maybe you know what it's like,
man,

16
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,840
down in your basement fantasizing about
revenge.

17
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,670
That's no bloody fun.
But you know,

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,310
this is something now for an Adler new
too.

19
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:57,130
He's worth reading those fantasies of
revenge.

20
00:00:57,131 --> 00:00:58,840
You know,
they have the seeds within them.

21
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:02,050
Young knew this as well.
The seeds within them of the new you.

22
00:01:02,051 --> 00:01:04,540
You can let those fee.
You can let those fantasies.

23
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:07,720
What would you say?
Manifest themselves and see what seeds

24
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,360
of potential future development or
harbored within them.

25
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,550
That's also extremely useful.
