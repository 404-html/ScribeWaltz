1
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:07,060
I would,

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:07,890
Lauren asks,

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:11,220
I would love to hear you do a lecture
series on raising children properly.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,870
Is that something you would consider?

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:13,890
Well,

6
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:14,940
in my new book,

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,310
I've written a chapter on that called
don't let your children do anything that

8
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:21,480
makes you dislike them.

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,880
And I've laid out a bunch of,

10
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:24,520
uh,

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,520
I've laid out a philosophy of care and
discipline that's predicated partly on a

12
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:34,260
French philosophical legal notion,

13
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,310
which is do not multiply
rules beyond necessity.

14
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,330
It's sort of like illegal equivalent to
all comes razor and an English common

15
00:00:42,331 --> 00:00:46,050
law principle is which is
used minimal necessary force.

16
00:00:46,051 --> 00:00:47,940
And I think the Union of those two,

17
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:49,860
which is don't have too many rules,

18
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,330
but make sure that you properly enforced
the ones that you do have is a good

19
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:58,950
start for how you might consider your
attitude with regards to raising children.

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,370
The other thing you have to figure
out is exactly what's your aim.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,680
And you know,

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:09,030
one of the aims that people have
had most recently pushed by clueless

23
00:01:09,031 --> 00:01:09,781
psychologists,

24
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:10,321
I would say,

25
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:12,780
is that you want children
to have high self esteem.

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,063
And uh,

27
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,460
that's actually a large part trait.

28
00:01:17,461 --> 00:01:18,720
Neuroticism anyways,

29
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,041
but by,

30
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:21,690
and it can be modified to some degree.

31
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,480
Jerome Kagan has done some
very interesting work on that.

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,673
But,

33
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:26,903
um,

34
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,760
the best thing to do,

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,870
I think the best thing to orient yourself
towards with regards to children is

36
00:01:36,871 --> 00:01:39,660
that you're trying to make your child,

37
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:44,640
your children or help your children to
be delightful in the eyes of others.

38
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,330
And so that means they have to
be reasonably well socialized.

39
00:01:48,331 --> 00:01:50,820
And that really takes place
between the ages of two and four.

40
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:54,420
Because what you want for your children
is that when they go out into public,

41
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,510
when they're away from you or
even with you for that matter,

42
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,190
what you want for your children is for
other people to genuinely like them.

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,110
Because if they behave reasonably and
they attend properly to adults and they

44
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,490
know how to play with other children,

45
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:10,140
then wherever they go,

46
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,280
they're going to be,

47
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,630
um,

48
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,870
unless they encountered
someone truly malevolent,

49
00:02:15,871 --> 00:02:18,360
they're going to be welcomed
with smiles and open arms.

50
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:22,950
And that's not going to be fake because
almost every human being actually likes

51
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:26,310
children if they're reasonably behaved.

52
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,500
And so your job is to make your children
highly socially desirable because that

53
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,670
opens up the world to them.

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,780
So they're,

55
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,730
that's not a lecture series,

56
00:02:35,731 --> 00:02:37,350
but it's a little lecture.
