1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:10,751
No.

2
00:00:10,751 --> 00:00:11,620
Hypothetically,

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:14,230
it's an attitude of skepticism,

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,720
irony towards rejection
of grand narratives,

5
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:18,280
ideologies and universalism.

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,440
Critique,

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,920
criticize this objective,

8
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,060
notions of reason,

9
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:22,991
human nature,

10
00:00:22,991 --> 00:00:23,950
social progress,

11
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,810
absolute truth in objective reality.

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,430
It's predicated on the idea that
the reason that you categorize,

13
00:00:30,431 --> 00:00:35,431
especially the reason that you
categorize is to marginalize you.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,530
Categorize to marginalized,

15
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:38,460
to obtain power.

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:40,750
Power is pretty much all there is.

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,223
Um,

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,550
there's other elements of postmodernism.

19
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:49,330
One of them is that human nature
is merely a social construct.

20
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:51,581
See,

21
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,440
the reason for that as
far as I'm concerned,

22
00:00:53,441 --> 00:00:55,150
and this is a postmodern critique as well,

23
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:58,630
I'm going to move the center to the
margin and the margin to the centers.

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,260
Why would you think that human
nature is only a social construct?

25
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:02,981
Well,

26
00:01:02,981 --> 00:01:03,551
here's why.

27
00:01:03,551 --> 00:01:06,340
It's because that means you could
construct it any way you want to.

28
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,530
That was a very common idea
among this among the communists.

29
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,230
That's why my wanted to
wipe out Chinese history.

30
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:16,300
That's why the red guard
went around in China,

31
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,220
tried to destroy everything,

32
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,700
every element of China's history prior
to approximately 1960 at that great

33
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:25,271
culture,

34
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,400
thousands and thousands
of years old as well.

35
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:28,840
So you could bring in the new man.

36
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,270
But what does the new man,

37
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:36,070
well it was whatever slave mile happened
to fantasize about or it was the

38
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:37,220
utopian person.

39
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,260
You take your pick.

40
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:39,790
But like I said,

41
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,410
if you take a look at the corpses,

42
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,980
you can pretty much figure
out which of those two it was.

43
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,410
So what's up with these people?

44
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,770
These deconstructionists
sees postmodernists.

45
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:53,090
What are they up to exactly?

46
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:53,871
Well,

47
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:54,920
here's the first thing

48
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,150
they came about pretty much when
Marxism was no longer credible,

49
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,400
no longer tenable as an intellectual,

50
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:08,710
a set of intellectual propositions.

51
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,400
Now,

52
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,990
if you are a French intellectual,

53
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:15,010
you had to have a lot of corpses piled
at your feet before you were willing to

54
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,210
think that you were wrong.

55
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,390
So here's an example.

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,860
I don't remember his name.

57
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:24,820
He was the architect of the
killing fields in Cambodia,

58
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,050
wasn't Pol Pot.

59
00:02:26,051 --> 00:02:27,640
It was one of his advisors.

60
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:28,601
Unfortunately,

61
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:29,530
I can't remember his name.

62
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,450
He took his phd at the Sorbonne

63
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,310
and he developed the thesis in the
Sorbonne Would Marxists thesis that the

64
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,120
cities were parasites on,

65
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,993
on the land.

66
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:43,901
You know,

67
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:46,660
it's an extension of the whole
bourgeoisie proletarian thing.

68
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,730
The cities were full of bourgeois types,

69
00:02:48,731 --> 00:02:53,731
educated and educated
parasites essentially who were
doing nothing but stealing

70
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,560
what was rightly the farmers.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,310
So when he came back Cambodia,

72
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,560
he put that into action and empty Delta
cities and put all the intellectuals in

73
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,840
the city dwellers either
to death or to work,

74
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:12,870
which generally resulted in death and
killed about one sixth to one quarter of

75
00:03:13,331 --> 00:03:14,164
the population.

76
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:17,010
But he got his phd from the Sorbonne.

77
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:18,293
Okay.

78
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,910
That's a good story because that's
exactly how complicit the western leftist

79
00:03:23,911 --> 00:03:28,600
intellectuals were in facilitating
the horrors of the 20th century.

80
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,190
And it's not like we've
learned anything since then.

81
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,240
Quite the contrary,

82
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:36,530
we just gone underground
and that's what I see.

83
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,410
That's what I see when
I see postmodernism.

84
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,540
So what happened was,

85
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,860
despite the affinity Western
intellectuals for Marxism,

86
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,480
maybe because they weren't
paid as much as bankers,

87
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,373
let's say,

88
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,880
if we're being cynical about it,

89
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,540
because I've often thought that if you
paid sociologists as much as investment

90
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:02,290
bankers,

91
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,970
they'd be capitalist very rapidly.

92
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,800
Well,

93
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:11,480
which is also to say that you may underpay
intellectuals at your peril and you

94
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:14,840
know that's actually dangerous because
one of the things that's happening is

95
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:18,710
that as the universities have become
corporatized and corrupted in a variety of

96
00:04:18,711 --> 00:04:19,370
ways,

97
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,800
more and more of the
professors or adjuncts,

98
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:22,200
right?

99
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,010
Think it's up to 30 40
50% something like that.

100
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:26,310
Now they've got no tenure,

101
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,530
they've got no job security,

102
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,780
and they're paid like $24,000 a year.

103
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,740
It's not a good idea to radicalize the
people that are teaching your children.

104
00:04:34,010 --> 00:04:34,843
But anyways,

105
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,583
okay,

106
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,920
by the end of the sixties so much data
on the catastrophic failures of communism

107
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:53,441
had accrued that even the
most intransigent of French
intellectuals had to admit

108
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:56,060
that the Jig was up.

109
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,023
Okay.

110
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:03,030
But that's a problem because
that's the whole ideology,

111
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:03,491
right?

112
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:06,120
That's the whole raise on debt.

113
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:08,860
But he says in his
terrible Alberta French,

114
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,850
you're going to just give that up.

115
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:15,010
What are you gonna do after that?

116
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,261
Well,

117
00:05:17,261 --> 00:05:20,050
what happened was
postmodernism was invented.

118
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:23,410
And so it's a slight of
hand as far as I can tell.

119
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,273
So,

120
00:05:24,410 --> 00:05:27,430
and with postmodernism identity politics,

121
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:31,480
and so the postmodern transformation is,

122
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,123
well,

123
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,440
we were a little wrong with
the working class thing.

124
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,860
It turns out that
Communists killed them all.

125
00:05:38,861 --> 00:05:41,080
And capitalists make them all rich.

126
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:43,870
And that's actually exactly the
opposite of what we predicted.

127
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:48,900
But maybe there's still a
way this could be salvaged.

128
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:49,780
How about if we,

129
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,650
we don't say working class capitalists,

130
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:54,640
we say oppressor,

131
00:05:54,641 --> 00:05:55,510
oppressed.

132
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:56,681
Well,

133
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:57,514
just,

134
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:00,681
well,

135
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,940
just trends transform the terminology a
bit and we'll start thinking about all

136
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:07,490
the other ways that people
are oppressed and then,

137
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,650
and all the other ways
that people are oppressors.

138
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:12,800
And then we can play the same
damn game under a new guys.

139
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,200
And now look,

140
00:06:15,201 --> 00:06:16,940
the postmodernists were Marxists.

141
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,710
So let's make no mistake about that.

142
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:22,340
Derrida himself said that postmodernism
was a transformation of Marxism.

143
00:06:22,341 --> 00:06:23,570
I'm not making this up.

144
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,441
The question is,

145
00:06:24,441 --> 00:06:25,274
why?

146
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:29,300
Well because you could say
what postmodernism is a
valid philosophical school

147
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:32,120
and we'll get into that for a minute
and they make some valid claims.

148
00:06:32,121 --> 00:06:32,570
One of them,

149
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:33,141
for example,

150
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:34,820
this is a central postmodernist claim,

151
00:06:34,821 --> 00:06:38,420
is that there's an infinite number of
ways of interpreting the world and that

152
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,520
actually turns out to
be technically correct.

153
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,660
Part of the reason that we've had a
very difficult time building robots,

154
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:47,480
AI robots that can
operate in the real world,

155
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:51,710
is because perceiving the real world turns
out to be so difficult that we really

156
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:56,711
can't figure out how human beings do it
cause it is susceptible to an infinite

157
00:06:56,961 --> 00:06:58,250
number of interpretations.

158
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,540
So that's actually correct.

159
00:06:59,570 --> 00:06:59,751
Now,

160
00:06:59,751 --> 00:07:02,930
I'm not going to give the postmodernists
a tremendous amount of credit for

161
00:07:02,931 --> 00:07:06,170
discovering that because it was
discovered simultaneously and about five

162
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:08,300
disciplines at pretty much the same time.

163
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,640
But you give the devil his due.
