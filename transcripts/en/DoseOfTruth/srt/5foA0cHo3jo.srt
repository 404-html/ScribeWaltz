1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,780
You also felt that sort of embedded
inside the shower where the contract

2
00:00:03,781 --> 00:00:07,890
sexual tendencies and so for example,
sometimes you see people who are well

3
00:00:07,891 --> 00:00:09,690
developed.
Men let say,

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:12,090
and we can.
We can also talk about women in this

5
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:15,150
regard.
Men who've integrated their shadow often

6
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:19,710
also develop a kind of peculiar grace
that would be a consequence of not only

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,860
allowing their aggressive side to step
forward,

8
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,010
but also their,
their feminine and in Compassionate side

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,110
that might,
that they may have kept squelched

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,900
because of embarrassment about it or
because they'd been harassed for being

11
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,030
weak or any number of things.
So,

12
00:00:33,031 --> 00:00:35,520
but the practical approach for
developing your shadow,

13
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:40,521
I would say is to contemplate and
consider your resentment and notice what

14
00:00:40,861 --> 00:00:44,640
it says and because your resentment will
also tell you what you have to say.

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,740
You know,
so look,

16
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,330
look at what happened at Google this
weekend.

17
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:50,700
You know,
James Damore wrote that memo and you can

18
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:55,080
imagine he was pretty angry and perhaps
even somewhat resentful at having to

19
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:57,810
attend that diversity seminar.
And I'm really just using this as an

20
00:00:57,811 --> 00:01:01,890
example.
But what he did was decide that that

21
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,310
meant that he had something that he had
to say and then look at the consequences

22
00:01:05,311 --> 00:01:07,710
of that man.
It's an absolutely unbelievable.

23
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,440
And so you know,
if you're feeling oppressed at work or

24
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:13,310
you're oppressed in your life or,
or you know where you're oppressing

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,810
yourself,
then you got to notice that you're

26
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:17,580
feeling oppressed.
Then you have to notice that you're

27
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:21,120
feeling resentful,
resentful and angry and bitter,

28
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:24,850
and maybe even like Cain in the story of
Cain and Abel because Cain is sort of

29
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,200
the archetypal bitter man.
And then you have to decide what it is

30
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:31,560
that you need to do in order to remove
from yourself that bitterness.

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,650
And that's usually means that there's
something that you have to say and then

32
00:01:34,651 --> 00:01:37,050
you have to say it because you're sold
depends on it.

33
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,030
And not only does your soul depend on
it.

34
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:42,570
I would say the fate of the world
depends on it because you know you might

35
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:45,090
be wrong and then you should be
straightened out.

36
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:47,790
Maybe you're just being whiny and you
have to talk to somebody about that.

37
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:50,880
But it may be that you're actually
detecting something wrong,

38
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:53,640
some tyranny that's directed towards you
and other people,

39
00:01:53,641 --> 00:01:56,490
and it's like your moral obligation to
speak up about it.

40
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,120
And so many workplaces become toxic to
use a terrible cliche,

41
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:04,350
cliche because the people in the won't
speak up for what they actually want,

42
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:07,920
or they speak up too late and then
they're all twisted up about it and,

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,340
and you know they're torturing other
people because they're so unhappy and so

44
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:15,330
forth and so on.
So practical approach for developing

45
00:02:15,331 --> 00:02:20,280
your shadow fundamentally is radical.
Honesty and young said that in a genuine

46
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,800
moral effort was a good substitute for
psychotherapy.
