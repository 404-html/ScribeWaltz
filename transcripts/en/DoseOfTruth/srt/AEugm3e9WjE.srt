1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,300
I thought we might close.

2
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:12,300
I have a question for you about your,

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,960
your derivation of these moral virtues
specifically from the enlightenment and

4
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:20,220
I'm curious about that because,

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:21,271
well,

6
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,240
first of all you could make a case that
it wasn't so much the enlightenment as

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:28,710
it was the specifically the rise of
empirical science and then you could of

8
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,110
course have a discussion about
how those two things are related.

9
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,610
But I'm also curious,

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,470
I've been reading Ian McGilchrist book,

11
00:00:35,471 --> 00:00:37,950
the master and his emissary and Miguel.

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,430
Chris makes a pretty strong case.

13
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:44,431
I would say that yet the rationalistic
enlightenment values are in some sense a

14
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:49,561
consequence of the articulation of an
underlying set of principals that are more

15
00:00:51,291 --> 00:00:52,430
metaphoric in nature,

16
00:00:52,431 --> 00:00:53,630
more narrative in nature.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:54,201
The case,

18
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,830
I also made it my book maps of meeting
and to some degree in 12 rules for life

19
00:00:57,831 --> 00:00:59,660
that the enlightenment project,

20
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:04,200
and it's rationalities nested inside a
deeper web of metaphor and ritual and

21
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:09,080
damage that would be associated with
longer scale cognitive processes,

22
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,090
some of which are expressed
in religious thinking,

23
00:01:11,091 --> 00:01:15,950
but some of which are grounded in not
so much rationality as in motivation and

24
00:01:15,951 --> 00:01:16,471
emotion.

25
00:01:16,471 --> 00:01:19,760
And I mean the way your
book is structured,

26
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:24,761
and I think the way enlightenment thinkers
think is that there was a miracle of

27
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:29,630
sorts that occurred sometime in the last
three to 500 years and people woke up

28
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,800
and became rational.

29
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,360
And then the question is to what degree
was the ground for that awakening

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:40,010
prepared by events that weren't the
awakening itself but that were associated

31
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,120
with other processes?

32
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,600
And I'm just curious as to
what your thoughts are on that.

33
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:45,551
Yeah.

34
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:45,910
So,

35
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:46,360
uh,

36
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,150
there's nothing new under the sun and a,

37
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:53,160
I have good intellectual historian can
find the antecedents of any intellectual

38
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,200
movement didn't in various precursors.

39
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:56,120
Um,

40
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,500
you know,

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,333
it's hard to,

42
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,380
I,

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,450
I don't think there's a,

44
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:02,630
a lot in the enlightenment that
can specifically be attributed to,

45
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,810
um,

46
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:04,590
to uh,

47
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:04,890
uh,

48
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,251
religion,

49
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:08,310
particularly Christianity just based on
the fact that it was already around for

50
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:10,500
a thousand years and
nothing much happened.

51
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:14,100
So it couldn't be religion
itself or Christianity itself.

52
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,180
Although there are as,

53
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:15,751
as you say,

54
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:19,200
there are strands that were
carried over in particular.

55
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,341
And this is a,

56
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,021
I didn't cite that,

57
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:23,070
that I got from my other half,

58
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:23,940
Rebecca Goldstein,

59
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:24,720
my wife,

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:24,950
uh,

61
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:25,270
who,

62
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,491
who,

63
00:02:25,491 --> 00:02:25,621
uh,

64
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:26,640
you've appeared on stage.

65
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,493
One of it,

66
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,750
one thing that the
Greeks didn't have that,

67
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,260
uh,

68
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,640
the Christianity did,

69
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:33,540
uh,

70
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,800
was the idea of compassion
for the week and,

71
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,850
and universal human flourishing.

72
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,690
Uh,

73
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:42,420
you don't really have that
for all of the brilliance of,

74
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:42,751
uh,

75
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:43,770
of ancient Greece.

76
00:02:43,771 --> 00:02:46,050
That wasn't a big feat.

77
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,750
But the enlightenment of course,

78
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,870
did not spring out of,

79
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,670
out of nowhere.

80
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:54,410
If I were to identify the antecedents,

81
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,170
what and why,

82
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,290
what happened prior to the 18th century
that allowed it to kind of pull down as

83
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:01,060
opposed to a couple of
hundred years earlier,

84
00:03:01,061 --> 00:03:02,290
a couple of hundred years later,

85
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,640
one of them was the scientific
revolution conventionally located in the,

86
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:07,810
in the 17th century,

87
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,130
which not only provided a
paradigm for understanding,

88
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,020
namely,

89
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,420
uh,

90
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,980
testing propositions
against the empirical world,

91
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,440
seeking deeper,

92
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,710
naturalistic explanations for phenomena.

93
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,540
And which of course
overturned a millennia.

94
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:30,541
Old Dogmas reminding people that
bear their own common sense,

95
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:31,750
their own societies,

96
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:32,520
convictions.

97
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:32,710
Uh,

98
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,460
we're fallible.

99
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,250
So that was,

100
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:34,570
uh,

101
00:03:34,570 --> 00:03:36,370
an essential precursor.

102
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,860
Another one was the discovery of the,

103
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:39,431
uh,

104
00:03:39,431 --> 00:03:40,450
of the new world.

105
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,670
That there were entire civilizations,

106
00:03:42,671 --> 00:03:44,420
entire world,

107
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:48,520
literally worlds in their sense that
that had been a unknown in that the

108
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,750
knowledge base that they have been part
of a Western civilization for Millennia

109
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:58,030
was radically incomplete.

110
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,590
And technologically,

111
00:03:59,591 --> 00:04:00,880
I suspect that the,

112
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,763
the greater,

113
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,260
uh,

114
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,150
exchange of ideas and people,

115
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:04,871
uh,

116
00:04:04,871 --> 00:04:09,220
was a contributor there prior to be
just prior to be lightened in the second

117
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,390
half of the 18th century.

118
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:13,510
There's a massive growth
in the efficiency of,

119
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:13,890
uh,

120
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:17,020
printing printing presses itself.

121
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,920
But it was the democratization
of books and pamphlets,

122
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,130
the rise literacy,

123
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,040
uh,

124
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,210
and the movement of people.

125
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,890
It became easier for,

126
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:27,520
uh,

127
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,520
for heretics and radicals to jump ship
and move to where things were cooler if

128
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,940
things got too uncomfortable
where they were.

129
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,810
And it's amazing how many of the
enlightenment thinkers were persecuted for

130
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:41,644
their beliefs.

131
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,990
They were threatened with
imprisonment or death.

132
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,770
Many of them ended up in,

133
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:49,570
in Holland or Paris or London or jumped
around to wherever they had made the

134
00:04:49,571 --> 00:04:50,404
greatest freedom,

135
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,060
but also just the sheer,

136
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:52,590
uh,

137
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,460
I'll kind of precursor of the,

138
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:54,940
uh,

139
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,631
the web today.

140
00:04:55,631 --> 00:05:00,040
The fact that pamphlet can be introduced
and within a few months it would be

141
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:01,270
translated into,

142
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:02,443
uh,

143
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:02,800
uh,

144
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,650
a dozen European languages and,

145
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:06,610
and smuggled in.

146
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,791
So the exchange of,

147
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:08,830
of ideas,

148
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:09,161
uh,

149
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:09,994
I think,

150
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,391
uh,

151
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:12,370
help to accelerate the,

152
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,030
uh,

153
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,863
the enlightenment.

154
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,150
Although since it only
happened once in human history,

155
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:20,680
we can never really know for
sure why it happened when it did,

156
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:21,850
but at those are three.

157
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,020
Good,

158
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,310
good.

159
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:23,550
Yes.

160
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,700
Well,

161
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:23,861
I mean,

162
00:05:23,861 --> 00:05:28,060
we're in an interesting time now where
we can sit and make a video like this and

163
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:32,380
publish it almost instantaneously and
share it with half a million people.

164
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:37,910
I mean that that ability to share ideas
rapidly is developing a pace and God

165
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:40,840
only knows what the
consequence of that is.

166
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,111
We're,

167
00:05:41,111 --> 00:05:42,310
we're in a situation now,

168
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:44,320
which was only occurred
to me about last year,

169
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:48,340
where the spoken word for the first time
in human history has the same reach and

170
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:49,870
longevity as the written word.

171
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,100
And it's easier for people to listen.

172
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:52,390
You know,

173
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:54,320
audio books are becoming very popular.

174
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,990
Lots and lots of people
listen to podcasts,

175
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,620
know I have working class people come
to my talks all the time and say,

176
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:00,861
look,

177
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:04,580
I'm sitting in my forklift for three
hours a day and I'm doing nothing but

178
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:05,810
listening to podcasts,

179
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,470
you know?

180
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:07,303
So that's,

181
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,170
that's a really remarkable thing.

182
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,430
So I think,

183
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,080
I think I'm going to let you go.

184
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,880
You've been very generous with your time.

185
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,180
I appreciate the conversation very much.

186
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,620
I'm going to close by

187
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:23,660
showing your book again and Steven
Pinker's new book enlightenment now,

188
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,780
which is tearing up the bestseller
charts and which is a guide to proper end

189
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,410
intelligent optimism in the 21st century.

190
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,530
And maybe I'd ask you just in closing,

191
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,860
what do you think there are
things that individuals,

192
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:40,160
what do you think individuals should be
particularly optimistic about right now?

193
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:45,161
And what do you think individuals could
do to spread the message that things are

194
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:48,650
getting better and that
we can solve our problems?

195
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,270
Yeah.

196
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,103
Um,

197
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,480
the fact that there are new efforts to
try transcend political divisions and

198
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:02,570
find out what works to
depoliticize and rationalize,

199
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,540
uh,

200
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,220
problems like poverty,

201
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,450
like climate change,

202
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,350
uh,

203
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:07,650
like,

204
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,690
like war and peace like crime.

205
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:10,923
Um,

206
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,540
those are very much worth supporting
that there are organizations like at a

207
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,374
political,

208
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,590
there are NGOs that tried to
monitor the state of the world.

209
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,450
There's effective altruism that just the
general application of rationality to

210
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:31,140
solve our problems that is responsible
for the progress that we've enjoyed in

211
00:07:31,141 --> 00:07:31,711
the past.

212
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:35,010
And if there's going to be progress
ahead of us will be responsible for what

213
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:36,000
will enjoy in the future.

214
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,370
All right,

215
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:38,860
well,

216
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,360
I'm,

217
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:39,840
I'm,

218
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,673
um,

219
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:45,920
would like to close to by mentioning to
everyone who's listening that you know,

220
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,280
things aren't getting better.

221
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,180
They're getting better because people are
facing problems and actually trying to

222
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:51,691
solve them.

223
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:54,120
They're doing micro
analysis of the problems,

224
00:07:54,121 --> 00:07:56,250
breaking them down into
their constituent elements,

225
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,150
being humble enough to use
incremental solutions to solve them.

226
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,340
And to address them at,

227
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,400
at at a high level of resolution
instead of a low level of,

228
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,260
or a low resolution level
of ideological debate.

229
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,490
And it's really working.

230
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,863
And I would,

231
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:11,853
um,

232
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:16,980
what would we say encourage people to
pick up Dr Pinker's book because the world

233
00:08:17,231 --> 00:08:19,960
is getting better and we should know
it and we should be happy about it.

234
00:08:19,961 --> 00:08:23,680
And we should continue to foster that
development in every way that we can.

235
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,780
And I think this is an excellent,

236
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:29,590
this book is an excellent contribution
to that effort as well as your other

237
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,783
books like are,

238
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,430
are better rangers,

239
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:33,453
better,

240
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,170
better angels of our nature.

241
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,120
So thank you very much for spending the
time with me today and for talking with

242
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:41,560
me and it was a pleasure to meet you.

243
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,151
Thanks so much.

244
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:44,130
Thanks for having a Jordan.

245
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:45,220
Who's the pleasure was mine.
