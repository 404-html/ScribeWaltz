1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:06,931
You know,

2
00:00:06,931 --> 00:00:10,640
my entire schooling and
all my professors were,

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:12,110
each one of them was,

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,620
I would say we're radically left.

5
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:15,630
I don't think I had a central professor.

6
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,710
All my supervisors and colleagues
have been very strong leftist,

7
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:22,350
social justice warrior
types of radical feminists.

8
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,700
And I always say to people
that it astonishes me when,

9
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:27,960
um,

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,320
that Laurie a video came out and those
professors called showing your video

11
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:34,681
quote Hitler.

12
00:00:34,681 --> 00:00:38,790
Like I was absolutely astonished because
out of every professor I've ever had,

13
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,740
almost every person I've ever met.

14
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:43,380
And these are very leftist
people who clean compassion.

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,890
You have taken the strongest stance that
of everyone I've ever met on atrocities

16
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:51,240
of the 20th century Nazi Germany,

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,321
uh,

18
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,790
Stalin's regime.

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,570
Um,

20
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,980
what happened in the Soviet Union.

21
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,630
You are always warning people
about the dangers of that path.

22
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,490
You are the one that writes about,

23
00:01:02,491 --> 00:01:02,611
it,

24
00:01:02,611 --> 00:01:03,421
speaks about it,

25
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,201
talks about it,

26
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:04,981
tweets about it,

27
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:05,731
emails about it,

28
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:09,090
and yet you were referred to,

29
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:09,960
um,

30
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,500
and compared to when most
evil people in human history.

31
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:13,771
And,

32
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:14,604
um,

33
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,000
of course,

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,571
Einstein.

35
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,150
But I'm wondering your
feelings around that.

36
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:23,110
Well at some point the accusations
gets so absurd that it's just surreal.

37
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:24,063
Yeah.

38
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:29,290
You can't even take it
personally because it's so crazy.

39
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,860
Yeah.

40
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:30,101
I mean,

41
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:35,101
I've spent a lot of time talking to
my students about and on videos about

42
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:36,101
Stalin,

43
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:39,880
but equal amounts of time talking about
the Holocaust and Nazi Germany and

44
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:45,090
taking it apart and trying to indicate
to people how lapses in personal

45
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:51,121
responsibility paved the road for four
totalitarian atrocity essentially.

46
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,361
And yeah,

47
00:01:52,361 --> 00:01:55,270
it's really amazing to
have done all that work.

48
00:01:55,271 --> 00:01:59,410
And then to be subject to that kind of,

49
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,480
what would you call it?

50
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:02,501
Well,

51
00:02:02,501 --> 00:02:03,880
character assassination,

52
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,740
and it's even more amusing with,

53
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,603
well the Wilford,

54
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,220
but what I've learned over the last year,

55
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:10,390
at least in part Serena,

56
00:02:10,391 --> 00:02:13,150
is that to be patient
with this sort of thing,

57
00:02:13,151 --> 00:02:16,690
because what's happened so far
is every time I've been attacked,

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,480
the attackers in validate themselves.

59
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:20,771
You know,

60
00:02:20,771 --> 00:02:25,771
I feel like I'm in a judo like position
because I think it's in judo where your

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,170
attackers momentum against themselves,

62
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:30,670
you just roll with the punches,

63
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:31,001
you know?

64
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:33,340
And that's worked out incredibly well.

65
00:02:33,341 --> 00:02:38,320
Wilfred Laurier is handling the Lindsay
Shepherd affair so badly that you

66
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:40,060
couldn't script it worse.

67
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,070
I was watching the agenda.

68
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:43,670
I don't know.

69
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,280
I think you must have seen
that episode where they had,

70
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:46,790
uh,

71
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:47,820
Janice Stein.

72
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:48,450
Yeah.

73
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,430
Professor Walcott.

74
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,060
And um,

75
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,760
of course your name came up and I was,

76
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:55,580
I was really hoping you were
there to give your position,

77
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,803
but I found

78
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,830
I'm going on the agenda in January.

79
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,221
That's great.

80
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,080
That's that they're going to grill me,

81
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,000
they're going to roast me over the coals.

82
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:04,871
So,

83
00:03:04,871 --> 00:03:06,220
which is a good thing I think.

84
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,240
Yeah.

85
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,900
I was really surprised at the comment
by Professor Walcott when he said,

86
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:15,901
you're not an expert and
you're not qualified to
comment on the issues of gender

87
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:20,890
or gender and sexual identities,

88
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:21,400
et cetera.

89
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,200
But yet he is a black man,

90
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,740
is the director of the women's programs.

91
00:03:25,741 --> 00:03:28,690
So how is he qualified to be
in that position as a male?

92
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:29,920
I don't understand that.

93
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:32,170
I don't understand that
inconsistent way of thinking.

94
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,131
Well,

95
00:03:33,131 --> 00:03:33,964
I wouldn't,

96
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:34,931
first of all,

97
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:38,560
I wouldn't say that consistency is
the hallmark of postmodern thinking.

98
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,960
It's whatever argument goes at the time.

99
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:41,441
And Yeah,

100
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:45,670
I thought w Walcott's performance on the
agenda was absolutely reprehensible as

101
00:03:45,671 --> 00:03:48,850
well as his comments about
the white Tas who were,

102
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,590
who were always oppressing,

103
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,970
you know,

104
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,850
professors of color to use those horrible,

105
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,860
that horrible phrase ology that the
radical left seems to insist upon.

106
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:00,371
You know,

107
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:04,630
he described the University of Toronto
was a white supremacist organization,

108
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:09,430
I think four times failing to recognize
entirely that he's hired in a very,

109
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,300
let's call it the privileged
position at that university,

110
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:17,560
and the mere fact of his positioning
is indication for the fall.

111
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,670
So of his claims.

112
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,340
Any sense would see

113
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,540
all you have to do is pick any building
at u of t downtown and just go walk

114
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:26,380
through the hallways.

115
00:04:26,381 --> 00:04:30,200
Anybody that suggests that it's a
white supremacist institution is,

116
00:04:30,201 --> 00:04:31,430
is not thinking clearly.

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:31,811
They're out of there.

118
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:31,980
Their

119
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,401
mind.

120
00:04:32,401 --> 00:04:32,701
I was,

121
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:37,701
I was just at the university yesterday
and I drove by a bunch of students who

122
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:41,910
were standing outside waiting to
take their exams and if anything,

123
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:45,330
the Caucasian kids were in the minority.

124
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,770
It's really true at the University of
Toronto and increasingly true and very

125
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:50,670
rapidly,

126
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:51,750
increasingly true.

127
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,160
Certainly women or men are in the
minority already out by a large margin,

128
00:04:56,161 --> 00:04:58,590
a dangerously large
margin in my estimation,

129
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,980
but the idea that that that you could
call it the University of Toronto,

130
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,080
which I think you'd have to think,

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,550
I really believe this,

132
00:05:08,551 --> 00:05:13,551
that you'd be hard pressed to go anywhere
in the world and find an organization.

133
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:19,240
It's actually done a better
job of integrating such a
tremendously diverse range

134
00:05:19,831 --> 00:05:23,520
of people into a functioning unit
in the University of Toronto.

135
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:28,830
I think you could just say some positive
things about u of t two last year they

136
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,360
wrote me a couple of letters asking
me to keep my mouth shut basically,

137
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:36,300
and which I think was a strategic error,

138
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,670
but they did host the debate afterwards,

139
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:40,620
which was a good thing.

140
00:05:40,621 --> 00:05:44,490
And I would also say that the University
of Toronto seems to have come down

141
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,190
pretty firmly on the side
of free speech since then.

142
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:52,020
And I also feel that my position
there as a professor is in no danger

143
00:05:52,021 --> 00:05:52,740
whatsoever,

144
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,910
despite the fact that,

145
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:54,571
you know,

146
00:05:54,571 --> 00:05:55,620
every couple of months,

147
00:05:55,621 --> 00:06:00,621
200 of the usual usual suspects find it
necessary to write a petition claiming

148
00:06:02,551 --> 00:06:05,850
that I've done something reprehensible
and that the university should fire me.

149
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,680
But there's no,

150
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,260
I don't feel that my position
is in danger there at all.

151
00:06:10,261 --> 00:06:10,560
So.
