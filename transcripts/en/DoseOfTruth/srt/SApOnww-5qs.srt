1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,630
Were these differences in belief systems?

2
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:10,680
Just arbitrary.

3
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,900
And that's actually a postmodern question.

4
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:14,100
I didn't know that at the time.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:15,180
No,

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,720
because you might say the postmodernists
do say there's a very large number of

7
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:23,721
ways of interpreting the world and it
isn't obvious how you determine which of

8
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:28,170
those ways are correct and so perhaps
you can't determine that any of them are

9
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:28,980
correct.

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,000
And then as a consequence of your
inability to determine if any of them are

11
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:33,451
correct,

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:38,451
then you have to turn to something
like power dispute to establish which

13
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,770
interpretation is going
to take precedence.

14
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:43,920
I would say in a nutshell,

15
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,660
that's a postmodern is theory.

16
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,140
Now that's tainted to some degree
with Marxist preconceptions,

17
00:00:49,141 --> 00:00:50,280
but we won't get into that.

18
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:53,880
But that's basically the idea and
it's an idea with a certain amount of

19
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,470
justification.

20
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,980
There is a very large number of ways
of interpreting the world and it isn't

21
00:00:58,981 --> 00:01:03,981
obvious which way or ways are
right or why they're right.

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,630
So it's a complicated problem.

23
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,830
And so I was curious,

24
00:01:07,831 --> 00:01:08,430
he's like,

25
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:11,340
was this merely a difference of opinion?

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,850
The West had a certain set of axioms that
it was acting out in the world and the

27
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:20,820
Soviet bloc and the rest of the communist
countries had another set of axioms

28
00:01:20,821 --> 00:01:25,821
and they were both arbitrary and it was
a matter of power or was there something

29
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,200
deeper at stake?

30
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:29,760
So that was question number two.

31
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,260
Question number three was

32
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,730
was there an alternative to brutal combat?

33
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:44,190
Was there an alternative way of solving
the dispute too brutal group combat,

34
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,300
something like that.

35
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:50,100
And so cause I always believed that if
you understood the problem that you could

36
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:50,910
solve it.

37
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,220
In fact that if,

38
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,240
if when you analyze the problem,

39
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:56,430
a solution didn't emerge
from the analysis,

40
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:58,830
then you actually didn't
understand the problem.

41
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,200
And so I thought if I

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,920
delved into the problem deeply enough,

43
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,850
then maybe I could figure out
what might constitute a solution.

44
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:10,940
And assuming there was such
a thing because I couldn't,

45
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:14,700
I knew after writing a fair
bit of it that we were,

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,320
that there was a real problem because

47
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,850
you can get belief systems that are
locked in combat and then obviously the

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,710
terrible consequence
of that is the combat.

49
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,750
But then I also knew,

50
00:02:27,751 --> 00:02:30,360
and this was probably more from
reading nature than anything else,

51
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:32,520
that if your belief system collapses,

52
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:32,941
you might say,

53
00:02:32,941 --> 00:02:33,121
well,

54
00:02:33,121 --> 00:02:37,050
I don't want to fight with you about
whose belief system is correct.

55
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,060
I'll just let my mind go.

56
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,790
But the problem is if you
let your belief system go,

57
00:02:41,791 --> 00:02:45,950
then you're swamped by
nihilism and hopelessness and,

58
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,370
and that's not helpful.

59
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:47,851
First of all,

60
00:02:47,851 --> 00:02:48,450
it's very,

61
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,300
it's not helpful psychologically because
it produces emotional pain and anxiety

62
00:02:53,301 --> 00:02:56,880
and maybe at unbearable levels
you can't have a pointless life.

63
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,460
It's,

64
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:57,810
it's,

65
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,290
it's,

66
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,340
it's a suffering,

67
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:04,210
a pointless life is pointless suffering
and people can't sustain that without

68
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:06,400
becoming demoralized.

69
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:08,380
That's only where they start demoralized,

70
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:08,861
bitter,

71
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:09,371
cruel,

72
00:03:09,371 --> 00:03:10,204
resentful,

73
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:10,961
angry,

74
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:11,711
hostile,

75
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,371
murderous,

76
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,181
genocidal.

77
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:16,150
Like all those things
follow one from another if,

78
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,190
if things are sufficiently hopeless.

79
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,590
So you can't just let
your belief system go,

80
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,180
but if you're locked into it and there's
another one that you're competing with,

81
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:26,040
then the,

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,420
the consequences war.

83
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:28,841
It's like,

84
00:03:28,841 --> 00:03:32,410
so what is it nihilism on the one hand
and war on the other that didn't seem

85
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,130
like,

86
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,580
especially given outcome of
like say it the Third World War,

87
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:40,120
that neither of those seemed
like acceptable alternatives,

88
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:41,500
but I couldn't see any other,

89
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,970
I couldn't see that there was anything
else other than those two alternatives.

90
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:50,050
And so that's what I tried
to lay out in this book.

91
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:54,010
Maps of meaning most of the thoughts
that I expressed in 12 rules for life,

92
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,023
not all of them,

93
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,210
and in the lectures that I've done
that have become popular on Youtube,

94
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,410
were all developed during the 15 year
period that I worked on that book and I

95
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,273
worked on it.

96
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,100
I would say obsessively really.

97
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:11,101
I wrote about three hours a day and I
thought about it for pretty much 12 other

98
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:12,724
hours.

99
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,070
And so I was thinking constantly.

100
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:15,700
It was,

101
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,200
it's not an obvious why,

102
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:17,560
but,

103
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,771
well,

104
00:04:17,771 --> 00:04:22,330
I told you why for some reason all that
manifested itself to me as a cardinal

105
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:23,164
problem,

106
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:29,530
but I concluded and tried to
lay out the rationale for this,

107
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:30,364
that

108
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,273
the,

109
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:32,930
the,

110
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:35,590
the fight between these
two belief systems,

111
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:36,191
but let's,

112
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:37,450
let's look at the belief systems.

113
00:04:37,451 --> 00:04:39,340
It's not communism versus the West.

114
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:41,380
It's not communism versus the free market.

115
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:41,910
It's,

116
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:42,760
it's different than that.

117
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,600
It's collectivism in it's far right form,

118
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:51,250
let's say the far right form of the Nazis
and the far left form of the radical

119
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:51,751
leftist,

120
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,870
the communists that's
collectivism versus individualism.

121
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,390
That's the fundamental conflict.

122
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,080
And there are variants of
the collectivist viewpoint,

123
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,870
but it doesn't matter.

124
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,120
They can be grouped under
the rubric of Collectivism.

125
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,560
There's important differences,

126
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:06,730
but we don't have to get into that.

127
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,580
But the western take wasn't collectivist.

128
00:05:09,581 --> 00:05:14,581
It was individualist and the central
idea of the West was that although people

129
00:05:15,191 --> 00:05:20,191
are obviously obviously aggregate
into groups and many different groups,

130
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,190
cause all of you are members of
very of many different groups,

131
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:25,203
ethnicities,

132
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,110
genders,

133
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,890
sexes,

134
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,723
races,

135
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,720
family groups,

136
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,740
community groups.

137
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,290
You can be grouped a very large number
of ways and you tend towards the adoption

138
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:38,230
of something approximating a
group identity because you know,

139
00:05:38,231 --> 00:05:41,920
you take care of your family and you're
a member of your community and you have

140
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:46,420
a certain amount of justifiable
patriotism in relationship to your state.

141
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,180
The group identity is
definitely part of who you are.

142
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,380
The question is what the fundamental
defining characteristic of who you are and

143
00:05:56,201 --> 00:06:01,201
the collectivists is that you
are the Avatar of a collective.

144
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:04,460
And that's fundamentally who you are.

145
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:06,770
But the western perspective is not that.

146
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:11,390
The Western perspective is that despite
the fact that people have an individual

147
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,280
level and a collective level,

148
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:16,970
the individual level is to
be regarded as paramount.

149
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:21,710
You're to be treated above all
else above all as an individual.

150
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,443
Now,

151
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,870
and I looked into that very deeply
and I thought that isn't arbitrary.

152
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,150
It's actually correct.

153
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:31,820
That's the right way of
looking at the world.

154
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,171
And then you might say,

155
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:33,321
well,

156
00:06:33,321 --> 00:06:34,760
what do you mean the right way?

157
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,120
And of course that's the right
question because that is the question.

158
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,880
If something's the right
way of looking at something,

159
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,370
well why is it the right
way of looking at it?

160
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,300
But I want to put a little spin on that
too because usually when we talk about

161
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:50,960
individualism in the West,

162
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,210
at least in the modern world,

163
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:56,750
maybe let's say for the last 50
years or something like that,

164
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:58,190
maybe it's after World War II,

165
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,720
I don't know exactly the parameters.

166
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,321
It doesn't matter.

167
00:07:00,321 --> 00:07:05,321
Certainly since the 1960s when we think
about the tradition of individuality in

168
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:06,110
the west,

169
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:11,030
we think about the tradition of individual
rights and there's a problem with

170
00:07:11,031 --> 00:07:11,864
that because

171
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:18,610
the fundamental individual tradition of
the West is not individual rights and

172
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,390
rights have a problem.

173
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:24,080
Rights are sort of like you're
privileged compared to other people.

174
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:29,140
I have these rights and don't tread on
them that that wall's me off and makes me

175
00:07:30,981 --> 00:07:33,260
privileged in some sense.

176
00:07:33,261 --> 00:07:35,500
It means that I have
the right to do things.

177
00:07:35,501 --> 00:07:37,910
I have the right to
pursue my own interests.

178
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:39,950
I have the right to pursue happiness,

179
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:40,784
for example,

180
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,580
that's explicitly laid out
in the American system.

181
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,880
The rights or what is special about me?

182
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:50,870
And so when you look at individuality
or individualism from that perspective,

183
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,780
you can think about it as a selfish idea.

184
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,460
And it's often criticized by collectivists
precisely for that selfishness.

185
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,720
But the fundamental idea of the
individual in the West isn't predicated on

186
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,733
rights.

187
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,970
Even though that's important,

188
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,520
it's predicated on responsibility,

189
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:08,991
right?

190
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:13,991
So your role as an individual in the
West isn't to be the bearer of rights of

191
00:08:16,251 --> 00:08:17,330
intrinsic rights.

192
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,770
Even though those are important,

193
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:24,730
your responsibility as an individual in
the west is to bear the responsibility

194
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,240
of an individual.

195
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,700
And it's in bearing that
responsibility that you set yourself,

196
00:08:31,701 --> 00:08:32,061
right,

197
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:32,811
and your family,

198
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:33,440
right?

199
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,480
And You keep the state on track.

200
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,940
It's not from expressing your rights,

201
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,970
it's from shouldering your responsibility.

202
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:46,390
And I would say that the reason that you
have rights in the West is so that you

203
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:48,710
can shoulder your responsibility.

204
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,330
It's not the other way around.

205
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:55,070
It's so that you can do what's best
on your behalf and in that manner,

206
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:00,090
what's best on your family's behalf and
in that manner contribute to the degree

207
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:02,010
that you can to the community.

208
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,040
And that if you do all
those things simultaneously,

209
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,980
which means to accept the
responsibility for that,

210
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:12,990
then things move ahead as
well as they can move ahead,

211
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,260
which doesn't necessarily mean well
because life is very difficult and there's

212
00:09:18,331 --> 00:09:20,610
no sure way through it.

213
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:25,020
There's only less bad approaches.

214
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,760
That might be a way of thinking about it,

215
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,090
and the least bad approach you can manage
is to shoulder your responsibility as

216
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:33,780
an individual.
