1
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,410
Yeah.

2
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:09,120
Can you share with us your reading habits?

3
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:09,954
Max says,

4
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,980
I'm sorry I'm skipping over some questions
but I have to answer some easier ones

5
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,070
because I'm out of the capacity
to answer difficult ones.

6
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:19,220
Okay.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,570
I'll answer this one instead.

8
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,790
If you could talk to
Donald Trump for a day,

9
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:25,130
what would you try to say
or convinced them about?

10
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,250
I don't think I would try to
convince them about things.

11
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,070
I don't actually try to
convince people about things.

12
00:00:31,071 --> 00:00:33,890
I don't think I tried to ask them.

13
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,930
I'd ask him a whole bunch of questions.

14
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:39,230
I try to figure out how we thought
cause I'm really curious about that.

15
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:40,820
I'd ask them all sorts of questions,

16
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:41,841
ask,

17
00:00:41,841 --> 00:00:43,610
see if I could find out what he was up to.

18
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,170
I'd like to know what he's aiming at.

19
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,110
I'd like to know why he
thinks he became president,

20
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,973
what he did right,

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,000
what he did wrong,

22
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:50,701
what,

23
00:00:50,701 --> 00:00:52,040
what he dreads,

24
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,980
like what he would consider
a catastrophic failure,

25
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,410
where he thinks his
biggest weaknesses are,

26
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,210
what he'd like to leave as a,

27
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:00,620
as a legacy.

28
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:01,933
Um,

29
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,040
okay.

30
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,150
That would be fascinating.

31
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:04,984
But see,

32
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:07,150
I find generally speaking,

33
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:10,330
it's much more interesting
to ask people questions,

34
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:11,680
especially people like that,

35
00:01:11,681 --> 00:01:13,450
than ever to try to
convince them of things.

36
00:01:13,451 --> 00:01:14,890
Because the thing is,

37
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,030
I already know what I know,

38
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:18,340
but I have no idea what he
knows or what he's like.

39
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:20,950
And so it'd be amazing to
be able to talk to them.

40
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:24,790
And so I have a bit of that opportunity
now in Canada because I've been speaking

41
00:01:24,791 --> 00:01:26,500
to a lot of political figures in Canada.

42
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,300
I'm going to have that
opportunity in Europe.

43
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,500
But a lot of,

44
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,090
a lot of what you want to do when you
meet people is ask them questions because,

45
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,391
you know,

46
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:36,280
they'll tell you all sorts
of things you don't know.

47
00:01:36,281 --> 00:01:36,860
And,

48
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,210
um,

49
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,690
that's also an entry point to a really
good conversation is to ask questions.

50
00:01:40,691 --> 00:01:41,620
So that's what I would do.

51
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:44,740
I'd ask questions like mad
until he chased me away.

52
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:45,933
So,

53
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,300
okay.
