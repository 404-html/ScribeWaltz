1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:10,050
How does one distinguish a statement
coming from oneself rather than from

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:10,650
radiology?

3
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:10,921
Hey,

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,690
I got a good hint about that.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,460
If you're saying something that
almost anyone else could say,

6
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:21,360
then it's likely to be either
cliched or ideological.

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:22,921
Where is,

8
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:24,510
if you're speaking from yourself,

9
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,380
then in some sense you're the only
person who could be saying that.

10
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:31,980
And so what that means in some
sense is that you've taken ideas,

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,791
philosophical,

12
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:33,900
even ideological,

13
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:39,170
and you've made them personal so that
you're speaking from a position that only

14
00:00:39,571 --> 00:00:40,650
you can speak from.

15
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:42,810
And then then you have
something original offer.

16
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,013
Um,

17
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,180
in Solzhenitsyn school,

18
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:45,961
like archipelago,

19
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:46,780
he talked about,

20
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,160
uh,

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:51,150
like radical communists who were thrown
into the Gulag and they used to play

22
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,320
comrade with them.

23
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:53,061
It was a game.

24
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:58,061
And what they would do is bait them
into making continual propagandistic

25
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,550
communists statements.

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,910
It was an attempt to try to educate
them out of their possession.

27
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,800
But it's a good,

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,090
see if you can predict what someone is
going to say on the basis of their set of

29
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:09,924
beliefs,

30
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,940
then they're not speaking.

31
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,140
The ideology is speaking.

32
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:14,460
And if the ideology is speaking,

33
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,600
you don't even have to listen to them.

34
00:01:15,601 --> 00:01:19,140
You could just read about the ideology
and make up your own mind now.

35
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:19,860
So that's,

36
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,730
that's sort of the,

37
00:01:20,731 --> 00:01:21,390
uh,

38
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,171
what would you call it?

39
00:01:22,171 --> 00:01:25,830
That's the objective view of this.

40
00:01:25,831 --> 00:01:29,940
The subjective view is that statements
come from yourself that come from

41
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,451
yourself.

42
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,261
I think first of all,

43
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:34,770
frighten you to some degree because you
actually opened yourself up to the world

44
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:36,270
by saying something genuine,

45
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,450
but they also make you stronger.

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,110
They make you feel stronger put
because I think you're confronting your

47
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,430
vulnerability properly.

48
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,301
You know?

49
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:49,080
Because if I tell you something that I
really don't believe and you criticize,

50
00:01:49,081 --> 00:01:50,070
it's like who cares?

51
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,290
Because I don't really believe
but believe it anyways,

52
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,830
so maybe I have an ideology
that's like a mask or a persona,

53
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:58,340
which is generally the case personas,

54
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,390
a end concept that means mask.

55
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:03,810
And it's often the thing that people
confuse with their real identity.

56
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:04,411
Well,

57
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:06,540
if I have a persona and
someone criticizes it,

58
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:06,960
it's like,

59
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:07,111
well,

60
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:08,580
you haven't got to the real meat.

61
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,870
But if I say something that I
really believe deeply believe,

62
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:14,250
and then it gets criticized,

63
00:02:14,251 --> 00:02:15,990
like I've really put myself on the line.

64
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,550
And so people don't do that.

65
00:02:17,551 --> 00:02:18,780
It's kind of frightening,

66
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,200
but it's,

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,700
it's still the way to genuine
strength because you need,

68
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,320
and also not just strength,

69
00:02:25,321 --> 00:02:26,310
but also value.

70
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:31,311
You need to manifest yourself in the
world because you're a unique thing and

71
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:34,140
people bite need.

72
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:35,340
What's unique about you?

73
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,960
Everybody else might really need that.

74
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:41,460
I believe that you don't because each
person has something that's unique to them

75
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,830
to bring into being.

76
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,360
And if they hide that,

77
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:46,800
they hide their light under a Bushel,

78
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:49,140
that everyone is poorer for it.

79
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,930
And you do that in part
as Social Nitsa says,

80
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:52,651
by turning in,

81
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:56,430
you're turning over your God
given sole to human dogma.

82
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,110
It's a very bad idea.

83
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,400
Very bad idea.
