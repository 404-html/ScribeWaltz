00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:06,741
Hello,

2
00:00:06,741 --> 00:00:07,491
Dr. Peterson.

3
00:00:07,491 --> 00:00:08,900
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,210
And my question is regarding Adhd,

5
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,180
which is something I haven't
heard you speak a whole lot about,

6
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,014
maybe a little bit.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,233
Um,

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,060
now it seems to me that we
are at least maybe just me,

9
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:25,090
do not quite understand ADHD to what
could be its full capacity maybe.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,360
And uh,

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,110
cause there's many,

12
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:32,110
many voices saying that it's
an overdiagnosed overblown
small mental variance

13
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:36,260
that's prevalent in boys or it's
just young boys being young boys.

14
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,530
And then there are some that would
fight and advocate for a very different

15
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:43,640
treatment in the academic world.

16
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:44,893
Um,

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,280
and I was wondering what you,

18
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,400
what your thoughts are on Adhd itself.

19
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:50,383
Um,

20
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,493
and on,

21
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:52,363
uh,

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,060
the,

23
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,860
whether you think it's overdiagnosed and
maybe advice for me as someone who has

24
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:02,861
been diagnosed with ADHD on
how to overcome it without
maybe becoming completely

25
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:05,930
reliant on prescribed medication.

26
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:07,791
Okay.

27
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,590
So first of all,

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,540
it's definitely overdiagnosed.

29
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,213
Second,

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,410
it's,

31
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,080
it's very unreliable.

32
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,700
Psychiatric diagnosis.

33
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,900
Many psychiatric diagnosis are
unreliable and that's because psychiatric

34
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,750
diagnosis aren't precisely
scientific categories.

35
00:01:26,751 --> 00:01:27,800
They're weird hybrids,

36
00:01:27,801 --> 00:01:28,041
right?

37
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:28,790
First of all,

38
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,290
psychiatrists aren't scientists.

39
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:31,220
They're engineers.

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,090
Engineers are trying to do
something rather than to
describe the objective world

41
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:37,460
and psychiatrists are trying
to make people healthy,

42
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:38,480
whatever that means.

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,190
It's actually partly ethical.

44
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,600
It's very complicated.

45
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:46,480
Okay.

46
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,900
We don't know how to distinguish
it from temperamental variation.

47
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,131
So for example,

48
00:01:51,131 --> 00:01:53,950
if you're high in openness and
high in extroversion and low in

49
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:55,150
conscientiousness,

50
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,050
yeah,

51
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:58,010
low in agreeableness,

52
00:01:58,011 --> 00:02:01,340
conscientiousness and
and high in neuroticism,

53
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,520
you're likely to manifest
symptoms of Adhd.

54
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,860
It's because your exploratory,

55
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,300
you don't like to sit down,

56
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,410
you're full of ideas,

57
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:13,490
your attention scatters across a wide
variety of topics and you're not very

58
00:02:13,491 --> 00:02:14,324
stable,

59
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,530
temperamental variation.

60
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,690
It's also much more common among boys.

61
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,933
Um,

62
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,450
Panksepp showed same guy with rats that
if you deprive young routes of rough and

63
00:02:26,631 --> 00:02:27,620
tumble play,

64
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,800
which is what the young boys
are deprived of in school,

65
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,420
let's say that,

66
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:32,870
uh,

67
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:37,870
they get hyperactive and
then their prefrontal cortex
is don't develop very well

68
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:41,480
because they're not having the right kinds
of experiences and that you can treat

69
00:02:41,481 --> 00:02:45,440
that quite effectively with
psychomotor stimulants like Ritalin.

70
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,420
So that's kind of an interesting bit of
scientific information that no one pays

71
00:02:50,421 --> 00:02:51,260
any attention to.

72
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,760
There was also absolutely no evidence
whatsoever that longterm use of

73
00:02:55,761 --> 00:03:00,761
psychomotor stimulants produces increases
in cognitive gate zero and there's

74
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,440
plenty of evidence that it's harmful.

75
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,123
So

76
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:09,150
then the second part
of that was what about,

77
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,133
yeah,

78
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,520
adjustments for in the academic world
say that would be disability adjustments.

79
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:22,090
It's like that's a such a rat's nest
that I don't want to even discuss it.

80
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,290
I mean it it,

81
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:26,050
I'll discuss it for like 15 seconds.

82
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,630
There is a never ending
multiplication of disabilities.

83
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,190
That's what's happening right now.

84
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:36,850
The disability offices in
the universities are swamped.

85
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:40,090
Like I know some people
have it rough like,

86
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,751
believe me,

87
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,890
I know that I was,

88
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,763
I prob,

89
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,350
I seriously know that I've dealt with
extraordinarily damaged people in my life.

90
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,930
[inaudible] you're bloody hard pressed
to find someone who doesn't have a

91
00:03:53,931 --> 00:03:58,931
serious problem or who doesn't have a
serious problem in a close family member.

92
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:01,730
It's like,

93
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,310
where do you draw the line
with regards to disability?

94
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:04,851
Well,

95
00:04:04,851 --> 00:04:05,684
you can't,

96
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:06,860
you can't.

97
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,000
They multiply just like
LGBT identities multiply.

98
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:14,210
Just know g really
technically just like that.

99
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,140
Just like intersectionality
categories of oppression multiply.

100
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:18,831
It's,

101
00:04:18,831 --> 00:04:19,240
it's,

102
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,460
it's inevitable the way
that you deal with it.

103
00:04:22,461 --> 00:04:24,200
As you have objective standards,

104
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,430
you apply them to everyone.

105
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,410
Not because that's fair.

106
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,461
It's not fair.

107
00:04:28,461 --> 00:04:29,294
If you,

108
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:32,930
if your criteria for fairness is
that everyone has the same outcome,

109
00:04:32,931 --> 00:04:33,920
it's not fair at all.

110
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:35,450
It's not even close to fair.

111
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,750
It's just less tie radical
then the alternatives.

112
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,010
Now we don't know that yet because we
haven't seen the full range of the tyranny

113
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,140
of the alternatives manifest itself.

114
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,220
Not In our culture,

115
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:48,080
but it certainly did in other cultures.

116
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,150
I think it's a bad idea now.

117
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,090
I don't want to be absolute about that.

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,953
Like

119
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,271
it's tricky,

120
00:04:58,271 --> 00:04:58,601
you know,

121
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:01,300
because if you have a disability

122
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:03,823
that

123
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,740
would allow you to do the work in the
university and in the workplace with a

124
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,030
modification,

125
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,120
then perhaps the
modification could be made.

126
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,240
But I think that was done a lot better
when I was in the hands of the professors

127
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:21,100
and not in the hands of these crazy
bureaucratic structures that have risen up

128
00:05:21,101 --> 00:05:22,420
around the disability issue.

129
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,350
Like they're one of the 10 things that
are going to kill the universities or

130
00:05:26,351 --> 00:05:27,430
maybe have already killed them,

131
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,630
possibly because they may,

132
00:05:29,631 --> 00:05:33,010
they're walking corpses as
far as I can tell zombies,

133
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:33,460
so,

134
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,390
and that might be wrong,

135
00:05:34,391 --> 00:05:36,100
but is what it looks like to me.
