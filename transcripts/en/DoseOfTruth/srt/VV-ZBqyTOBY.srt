1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,680
And then the question is what
rushes in to fill a vacuum?

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:10,401
Well,

3
00:00:10,401 --> 00:00:12,230
if you look at the case
of the Soviet Union,

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:13,550
it seems quite instructive,

5
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,130
doesn't it?

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,750
I mean,

7
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:19,750
there's a 30 year period where there's
tremendous intellectual class say between

8
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:25,790
a materialist and empirical perspective
and an Russian Orthodox perspective.

9
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,820
The Russian Orthodox perspective loses
its attractiveness for the reigning

10
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:35,480
intellectual elite and the
preset positions of communism,

11
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:37,490
which appear rational by contrast,

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:41,300
which by all evidence we're
not rush in to fill the gap.

13
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,270
And I want to read you
something that nature wrote.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:47,540
It's perhaps the most
famous thing he ever said,

15
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,320
although it's almost entirely taken
out of context and misquoted and if not

16
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:51,830
misquoted,

17
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:52,970
at least misunderstood.

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:57,650
Because nature was one of these strange
people who was capable of living 50 or

19
00:00:57,651 --> 00:00:59,270
even 100 years into the future.

20
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:00,470
And although he was,

21
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:05,480
is generally regarded as an enemy of
Christianity and superstition and was

22
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:09,410
certainly an unbelievably outspoken
opponent of Christian traditionalism.

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:13,790
He also knew that if you
let the old gods die,

24
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:18,920
the probability that blood would flood
the land was virtually 100% so let me

25
00:01:18,921 --> 00:01:20,030
read you what he wrote.

26
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:26,170
Have you not heard of that mad man who
lit a lantern in the bright morning

27
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:27,560
hours,

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,080
ran to the market place
and cried incessantly?

29
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,630
I seek God as many of those who do not
believe in God were standing around just

30
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:35,841
then.

31
00:01:35,841 --> 00:01:37,640
He provoked must much laughter.

32
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,250
Why did he get lost?

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,113
Said one.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,690
Did he lose his way like a child
said another or is he hiding?

35
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,800
Is he afraid of us because he
gone on a voyage or emigrated?

36
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,880
That's the yelled and laughed.

37
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,080
The Madman jumped into their midst
and pierced them with his glances.

38
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,340
Where there is God,

39
00:01:55,341 --> 00:01:55,941
he cried.

40
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:56,810
I shall tell you,

41
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,070
we have killed him.

42
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,083
You and I,

43
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:00,980
all of us are as murderers,

44
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,080
but how have we done this?

45
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:05,660
How were we able to drink up the sea?

46
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,290
Who gave us the sponge to
wipe away the entire horizon.

47
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,790
What did we do when we unchained
this earth from its sun?

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,400
Whether is it moving now,

49
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,450
whether are we moving
now weigh from all sons?

50
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:24,290
Are we not plunging
continuously backwards,

51
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,890
sideward forward in all directions?

52
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:30,950
Is there any up or down left?

53
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,270
Are we not straying as though
through an infinite nothing?

54
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,030
Do we not feel the breath of empty space?

55
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:43,390
Has it not become colder is not night
and more night coming on all the while?

56
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,450
Must not lanterns be lit in the morning.

57
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,010
Do we not hear anything yet of the noise
of the grave diggers who are burying

58
00:02:52,011 --> 00:02:52,844
God?

59
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,790
Do we not smell anything
yet of God's decomposition?

60
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,770
God's to decompose.

61
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,220
God is dead.

62
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,810
God remains dead.

63
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,070
We have killed him.

64
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,561
How much shall we,

65
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,300
the murderer of all murderers,

66
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,160
comfort ourselves?

67
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,690
What was holiest and most powerful of
all that the world has yet owned has bled

68
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,160
to death under our knives.

69
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,170
Who will wipe this blood office?

70
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,290
What water is there for
us to clean ourselves?

71
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,210
What festivals of Atonement?

72
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,790
What Sacred Games shall we have to invent?

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:27,940
He's not the greatness of
this deed too great for us.

74
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,480
Must we not ourselves become
God simply to seem worthy of.

75
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,314
It

76
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:43,700
allows you can tell that's
a much different notion
from the casual God is dead

77
00:03:45,171 --> 00:03:48,030
quotation that's most generally
associated with nature.

78
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,230
Well,

79
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,190
what is he saying?

80
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:49,881
What he's saying?

81
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:50,900
Something like this.

82
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,790
A system like Christianity
or any system that's con,

83
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:02,950
that's oriented as society for thousands
and thousands of years can't simply be

84
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:06,410
eradicated by a casual gesture,

85
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,890
without consequences in
suing and its aftermath.

86
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:13,580
What consequences will need you says,

87
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:14,751
well,

88
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,550
we all know longer know up from down.

89
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,450
What does he mean by that metaphorically?

90
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,770
Well App.

91
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,850
That's where you're headed,

92
00:04:22,851 --> 00:04:24,110
right and down.

93
00:04:24,111 --> 00:04:27,620
That's what you want to stay away
from and when you eradicate the most

94
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:30,950
fundamental presuppositions
of your system of values,

95
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,030
then there is no up and there is no
down and then where are you precisely?

96
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:35,871
Well,

97
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:36,890
it's not so easy.

98
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,900
It's not so easy to say having not
necessarily ever been in that position.

99
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,000
What is your life like
when you don't know?

100
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:44,631
Up from down?

101
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:45,830
Is it merely neutral?

102
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,170
Is to is they're merely no value left.

103
00:04:48,171 --> 00:04:52,640
Or could it possibly be the case that if
up and down have both been eradicated,

104
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:56,690
that the place that you're left in is
something much more akin to a permanent

105
00:04:56,691 --> 00:05:01,691
state of suffering because maybe it's
only the case that the constant capacity

106
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:07,571
to strive for up in being an up that you
believe in the constant striving for up

107
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:10,220
is actually what makes
your life bearable to you.

108
00:05:10,221 --> 00:05:12,230
And if you lost the sense of up and down,

109
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,310
the place that you would end up would
be not so much neutral as terrible.

110
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:17,271
Now,

111
00:05:17,271 --> 00:05:19,160
if you have any belief system at all,

112
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:19,761
you do this.

113
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:22,820
So let's say you're an
advocate of left wing politics.

114
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:26,300
You take a pro environmental
stance or an anti corporate stance.

115
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,330
This is a relatively common
thing to do among undergraduates.

116
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,450
What do you do when you
hold that belief system?

117
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,880
You view the world as it lays itself out
and you explain the manner in which it

118
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:41,510
manifests itself in terms of the
axioms of that belief system.

119
00:05:41,511 --> 00:05:44,210
And you may know that you can do it right.

120
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:49,540
You can tell a credible story about why
the world is the way it is by adopting

121
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:49,971
say,

122
00:05:49,971 --> 00:05:54,260
an anti corporate perspective because
there are all sorts of terrible things

123
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:57,020
about the world that are a
consequence say of corporate.

124
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,350
And you might also say that,

125
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,580
and Piaget would say this,

126
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:06,581
that it's a necessary developmental
stage to acquire allegiance to a given

127
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,600
belief system.

128
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,823
Why?

129
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,281
Well,

130
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:11,930
any APP is better than none.

131
00:06:11,931 --> 00:06:14,270
That might be the first observation.

132
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,470
So even if your belief system
is relatively insufficient
and easily challenged

133
00:06:18,471 --> 00:06:21,170
on an intellectual grounds and
perhaps not very complete anyways,

134
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,320
the fact that it does lay out a
moral structure for you and tell you,

135
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,041
good for me,

136
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,420
evil and right from wrong,

137
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,643
that's up.

138
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,580
That's a plus.

139
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:29,720
That's an advantage.

140
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:34,100
Now it's relative intellectual
weakness and it's incoherence.

141
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:34,790
Assuming it,

142
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,680
it is incoherent to some degree,

143
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,180
that's a flaw,

144
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:41,570
but that doesn't mean that the effort
to establish a system like that is

145
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,553
worthless.

146
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,020
It's worthwhile and neat.

147
00:06:44,021 --> 00:06:44,481
Just said,

148
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:46,730
say with regards to
Christianity and Europe,

149
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,373
he said,

150
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,240
well,

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,500
the errors,

152
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:56,450
intellectual and moral of Institutional
Christianity are essentially beyond

153
00:06:56,451 --> 00:06:57,284
count.

154
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,070
But there's one thing
you have to remember,

155
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,051
first of all,

156
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:06,920
in ordering of that sort is
necessary because the alternative,

157
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:11,090
which is always hidden from you in so
far as you're inside a moral system,

158
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:15,050
the alternative as far
worse chaos that's worse.
