1
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:08,620
I don't know if you remember
what the article was about,

2
00:00:08,621 --> 00:00:09,460
but I wrote about,

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:10,983
uh,

4
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:16,140
Eric Green Murray is a professor at the
political science department and he was

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,410
forced to include,

6
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,040
uh,

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,940
Judith Butler,

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,433
Butler.

9
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:22,521
Oh yeah,

10
00:00:22,521 --> 00:00:22,851
right.

11
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,750
Chewed his butler.

12
00:00:23,751 --> 00:00:23,991
Yeah.

13
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:24,560
Yeah.

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,393
Great,

15
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:26,240
great.

16
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:26,541
And,

17
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:27,374
uh,

18
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:31,670
the course is about modern
society and its and its critics.

19
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:36,671
So it's been amazing basically about
the reactionary forces and a left wing

20
00:00:37,611 --> 00:00:40,250
extremist forces during the
turn of the last century.

21
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,320
So in the early 20th century,

22
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,810
late 19th century.

23
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:46,220
And then you read Butler,

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,633
um,

25
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,720
and actually one of the
course a and not Eric,

26
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,090
but,

27
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,370
uh,

28
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:51,910
his,

29
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,743
uh,

30
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,400
his teaching assistant interview

31
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:58,380
and she said that she
disagreed with the method.

32
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,220
So she agreed with the
professors that she did.

33
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:06,290
She thought that the academic
freedom was more important than,

34
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:06,800
uh,

35
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:10,840
being forced to teach
about a feminist authors,

36
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:11,890
certain gender science.

37
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:12,980
So she was actually,

38
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,580
uh,

39
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,413
on the other side.

40
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,830
Gender Science.

41
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:16,451
Yeah,

42
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:16,890
exactly.

43
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,030
Where is by no means a scientist
or even a credible academic?

44
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:21,110
As far as I'm concerned,

45
00:01:21,111 --> 00:01:24,050
I think she's a straight
out idealog and um,

46
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:26,750
and the fact that anybody would be forced,

47
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,350
well first of all forced to include
anything on their curriculum I think is

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,910
absolutely reprehensible.

49
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:35,690
It's top down interference with academic
freedom and it's extraordinarily

50
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:37,790
dangerous because once that

51
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,450
precedent is established,

52
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:45,350
then you opened the door for
political interference in the like,

53
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,340
I like,

54
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,570
like organized political interference
from outside the academy and it'll

55
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:52,490
collapse very rapidly underserved.

56
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,750
We saw that happening in Germany and also
in the Soviet Union and like that can

57
00:01:56,751 --> 00:01:58,460
happen so quickly that people can't,

58
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,953
can't,

59
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,540
it's almost impossible to believe.

60
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:07,470
Now we're in this weird situation where
the same thing seems to be happening to

61
00:02:07,471 --> 00:02:10,020
a large degree within the academy itself.

62
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,570
And so,

63
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,660
and what to do about that
is by no means obvious but,

64
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:20,250
but I don't think that allowing external
control of any sort over the contents

65
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:25,200
of the courses the professor
teach professors teach is,

66
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:26,161
it's a very,

67
00:02:26,161 --> 00:02:27,210
very bad idea.

68
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:28,651
We,

69
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:29,070
uh,

70
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:30,040
they have a rule,

71
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:31,050
rule of thumb,

72
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:31,501
they call it,

73
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:32,460
but it's basically,

74
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:33,960
it's much more a rule,

75
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,860
the rule of thumb.

76
00:02:34,861 --> 00:02:39,290
But at least 40% of all the
literature has to be written by women.

77
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,780
So if you are unbelievable,

78
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,220
if you're holding a course,

79
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,021
for example,

80
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:45,230
about Portland Society,

81
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:49,900
then it's critic critics with a lot of
primary literature from the turn of the

82
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,380
century,

83
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,810
then you run into a problem
because women weren't,

84
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:53,320
uh,

85
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,040
so,

86
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,760
uh,

87
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,490
there weren't a lot of women
were authors back then.

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:58,330
You,

89
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:58,720
oh,

90
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,530
he's so unbelievably,

91
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,033
yeah.

92
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,660
I would say resentful.

93
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,180
I really think that's the
fundamental issue here,

94
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,590
to push a doctor resentful and
uninformed to push a doctrine like that.

95
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:11,680
Yeah.
