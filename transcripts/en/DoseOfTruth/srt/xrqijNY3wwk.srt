1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,590
Speaking of white privilege,

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,690
I have to share with you this because I,

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:11,070
I'm,

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:14,100
I'm still in shock even though
it happened a few years ago.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,880
So when I was supervising students in
my last position as a counselor to a

6
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:18,720
women's shelter,

7
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:23,460
we had a few students every year you
always get students from George Brown

8
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:25,680
because they have that
very specialized program.

9
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,270
It's basically specializing in being
a counselor for assaulted women and

10
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,110
children advocate.

11
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:37,030
My students told me that within
the first week of class and the,

12
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,590
I don't know if this is being
done in all their classes,

13
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:42,150
but certainly one or two of their classes,

14
00:00:42,151 --> 00:00:45,780
all the white students were asked to stand
against the left side of the wall and

15
00:00:45,781 --> 00:00:48,660
all the students of color rosters
and on the right side of the wall.

16
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,490
And then each and every white student
had to basically take a step forward and

17
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:54,720
talk about a,

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,960
how they benefited from white privilege
and be almost like groveling and

19
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:02,880
apologizing for what they,

20
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,190
for all the people of color.

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,200
That assistance.

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:06,541
Yes,

23
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:06,991
I have to get it.

24
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:08,610
And I kept saying to them like,

25
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:09,511
what?

26
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:13,620
Like I was so shocked and stunned
when I heard this and these are 17,

27
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:15,760
18 year olds coming into you.

28
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,530
Uh,

29
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,650
many of them were actually sort
of coming in from the suburbs.

30
00:01:19,651 --> 00:01:23,430
They were very sheltered and they
weren't even exposed to urban life and in

31
00:01:23,431 --> 00:01:26,220
their first week of college
to be exposed to this.

32
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,420
I found it reprehensible and I
was telling my friend about it,

33
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:31,710
who's also a social worker.

34
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,970
She told me she went to George Brown and
while she was waiting for the professor

35
00:01:38,011 --> 00:01:41,250
to finish with her lesson before
she was going to speak to the class,

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,810
the professor reprimanded the class and
said that even if Xiang Ghomeshi was

37
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:46,680
found innocent,

38
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,020
we believe women period,

39
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,800
that that's,

40
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,560
that's her position and that
should be the classes position,

41
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,870
so no respect for the law whatsoever.

42
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:58,430
What do you see that with the Ontario
Human Rights Commission to which has

43
00:01:58,431 --> 00:02:03,431
placed itself outside normal
jurisprudential practice
because the people who run

44
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:07,880
those organizations are convinced that
English common law is nothing but an

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,830
oppressive patriarchal institution,

46
00:02:09,831 --> 00:02:13,820
which is exactly count runs
exactly counter to the,

47
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,470
to the reality of the situation.

48
00:02:15,471 --> 00:02:19,250
English common law is an amazingly humane,

49
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,280
amazingly humane,

50
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,660
evolved system.

51
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:23,990
And,

52
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,471
and it's,

53
00:02:24,471 --> 00:02:26,930
it's one of the world's
great achievements.

54
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,910
To think of it as a tool of
patriarchal oppression is absurd.

55
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:33,020
Beyond comprehension.

56
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:33,141
Yeah.

57
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:33,640
Yeah.

58
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:33,950
But,

59
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,700
but then,

60
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:35,810
but Dr. Peterson,

61
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,330
so then what happened is when a
couple of students put up their hand,

62
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:38,541
I mean,

63
00:02:38,541 --> 00:02:39,620
this is a bloody college,

64
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:40,820
you're supposed to engage in dialogue,

65
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:43,130
in rigorous debate and sort of said,

66
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,491
oh,

67
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:44,271
by the way,

68
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:45,670
this man was found,

69
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,670
he was acquitted,

70
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,130
and we kind of have a legal system with a,

71
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,000
once you're acquitted and the
professor just blasted them and said,

72
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:53,834
no,

73
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,140
regardless of the decisions
made by the court,

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:02,560
it is her position and she wants it
to be the classes position that he is

75
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,240
guilty.

76
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,890
The verdict has no relevance.

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,490
Yeah.

78
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:06,701
Okay.

79
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,630
That is terrifying to me because it also
speaks to the whole title nine what's

80
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,280
happening in the u s and other like,

81
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,593
um,

82
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,430
this is very terrifying.

83
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:17,140
This is absolute indoctrination.

84
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:17,910
Yeah.

85
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,620
Well you ran,

86
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,550
one of the things that you have
to add to this sort of debate as,

87
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:24,541
I mean,

88
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:27,420
I know that your family's
experience in Canada,

89
00:03:27,421 --> 00:03:28,860
it was really pretty damn harsh.

90
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:29,420
I mean,

91
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,540
if I remember correctly,

92
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,600
your dad was one of the first people
to wear a turban in Toronto and it was,

93
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,480
you guys had the misfortune
of moving into a pretty rough,

94
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:37,800
uh,

95
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,210
working class neighborhood where there
was some thugs after you won a fairly

96
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:43,140
regular basis.

97
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,000
I know that you were featured in Macleans
magazine on the cover consequence of

98
00:03:48,001 --> 00:03:48,834
all the,

99
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:49,921
I would say,

100
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:53,060
persecution that you endured and you
were just a kid when that was happening.

101
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:53,750
Yep.

102
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:56,750
My Dad was one of five men in
a turban and this was 1970s,

103
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:59,540
Toronto and we were living in
sort of east Toronto at the time,

104
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,160
the pape and Danforth area,

105
00:04:01,161 --> 00:04:01,994
but south of there.

106
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,030
Uh,

107
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:07,220
and our home was vandalized and cars
trashed and we were constantly bullied and

108
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:07,790
attacked.

109
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:12,080
And my dad was denied a job as a
security guard at George Square because,

110
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:13,790
because he wore a turban.

111
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,193
Um,

112
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,130
but here's the thing,

113
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:16,911
like my dad,

114
00:04:16,911 --> 00:04:19,280
my family that happened in
the seventies and eighties,

115
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:23,060
but we have never ever had a
problem in the last 25 years.

116
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:24,770
We have equal access to everything.

117
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:24,981
I mean,

118
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:28,400
Jag meets thing is wearing a turban
and he's the leader of the NDP.

119
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:31,880
So Canada has changed drastically.

120
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:34,340
And if I had to choose another
country in the world to live in,

121
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,360
I wouldn't choose one.

122
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:37,310
I can't imagine a better place to live.

123
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,481
So yes,

124
00:04:38,481 --> 00:04:42,200
horrible things happened and we were
in Maclean's and we suffered immensely,

125
00:04:42,201 --> 00:04:43,190
especially my dad.

126
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,593
Um,

127
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:48,950
but this is what's
amazing is Canada is now,

128
00:04:48,951 --> 00:04:52,370
I'd say like probably the
least racist place on earth.

129
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:57,371
Yet there are some people who are adamant
that we are still living back in the

130
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,030
fifties or sixties when things were
unbearable for people of color.

131
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,080
And that's just not true.

132
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:06,440
And when I pointed out it's just not
true and I know it because I've lived it.

133
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,640
I'm told I suffer from internalized
colonialism and internalized racism.

134
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,670
That's the classic leftist argument
to anybody who fits one of their

135
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,000
hypothetically victimized groups
who dares to stand up and say,

136
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,660
ah,

137
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,261
wait a minute.

138
00:05:21,261 --> 00:05:25,250
That's actually not been my experience
and I'm really happy to be living here.
