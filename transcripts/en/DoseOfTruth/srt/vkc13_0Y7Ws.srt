1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,110
One of the things we do know is that,

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,223
you know,

3
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:14,270
as you stretch out the inequality you
make men particularly on the lower end of

4
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,740
the distribution,

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,900
more and more likely to be aggressive.

6
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,620
It's sort of like imagine every
man has a threshold for violence.

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:23,730
Um,

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,070
and status is important,

9
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,510
demand knocked that it's
not important to women,

10
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,190
but it's different.

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,990
It's a different kind of status.

12
00:00:30,991 --> 00:00:34,500
It status is important to men because
it's one of the things that makes them

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,870
marketable as partners to women.

14
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,090
So it actually turns out to
be quite important to Mandan.

15
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,870
Men tend to compete with
one another for status,

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:47,160
hierarchy position and in
a really unequal society.

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,700
If you're like a low rung guy then and
you don't have any opportunity to rise

18
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:58,080
because the society isn't
structured so that there's mobility,

19
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:03,470
then the more aggressive guys tend to
turn into criminality and you know,

20
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:09,381
and so you could say there's a threshold
for criminality and the more inequality

21
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,740
pressure you put on a particular area,

22
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,570
geographic or political area,

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,880
the more inequality
pressure you put on it,

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,130
the more men slip past that
threshold and into criminality.

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:23,971
And you know,

26
00:01:23,971 --> 00:01:28,971
there's been pretty good studies
done of drug gang in Chicago.

27
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:32,430
That was the best one is
sociologist actually went
and hung out with a drug gang

28
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:32,970
for,

29
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,810
he got into it.

30
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:36,120
I guess the drug gang leader was,

31
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,043
no,

32
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,460
I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic,

33
00:01:41,461 --> 00:01:44,040
but that might be a reasonable
way of thinking about it.

34
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,700
And he was kind of happy with the idea
of maybe being a subject of a book and,

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:55,890
and so this guy was able
to associate with them,

36
00:01:55,891 --> 00:01:57,270
got to know them quite well.

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:02,780
And then the housing project in which
the gang was housed was slated for

38
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:07,881
demolition and the gang broke up and he
got the books because they kept books.

39
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,340
And what he found was the
average street drug dealer,

40
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,370
first of all was employed in another
job as well and was making far less than

41
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:19,710
minimum wage now.

42
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,820
But the guy is,

43
00:02:20,821 --> 00:02:21,091
you know,

44
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:25,110
further up the chain of course
followed the Prieto distribution.

45
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:28,350
And so there was a tiny minority of them
who were raking in a tremendous amount

46
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:29,184
of loot.

47
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,410
And the guys at the bottom,

48
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,850
we're just waiting around for the
possibility that they could rise up the

49
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:36,780
hierarchy and you know,

50
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:37,990
it's pretty violent game.

51
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,830
So the chances that someone is going to be

52
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:47,660
taken out is pretty high and then a little
slot opens up for some opportunistic

53
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,590
second rater and perhaps he
can move up the hierarchy.
