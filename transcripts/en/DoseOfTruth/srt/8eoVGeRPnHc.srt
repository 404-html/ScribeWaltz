1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,290
Did you please offer advice for
individuals with high intelligence but

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,680
low extroversion and low agreeableness
and making and maintaining social

3
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,870
connections and friendships?
Well,

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:18,890
I would,
that's Roger,

5
00:00:18,891 --> 00:00:20,060
Roger.
I would say

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,880
make a plan.
Again,

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,660
spend some time on it weekly.
Go to things like meetups.

8
00:00:30,661 --> 00:00:34,050
There's a site called meetup.com that's
a good place to meet people.

9
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:35,640
Do whatever you have to do.
Meet people,

10
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:38,220
take a course,
strike up a conversation,

11
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,270
you know,
and,

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:42,180
and ask questions and listen that,
that's particularly good.

13
00:00:42,181 --> 00:00:44,390
If you're low in agreeableness,
um,

14
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,840
people really like to be listened to.
You know,

15
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:49,350
you don't want to pester them with
questions too badly,

16
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:53,070
but you can get an awful long ways by
listening to people and asking them

17
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:54,050
questions.
It's a,

18
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,850
people hardly ever get listened to and
they're so damn help,

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:58,460
happy when you do it,
that,

20
00:00:58,930 --> 00:00:59,970
um,
that,

21
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,570
that they're likely to open themselves
up to you very,

22
00:01:03,571 --> 00:01:07,200
very rapidly.
So get them talking.

23
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,850
And when they say something,
you don't quite catch your understand,

24
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:14,070
ask them about it and,
and that can help you move forward.

25
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,370
But put some time into it.
Like you need to be going out at least

26
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:18,870
once a week,
um,

27
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,440
and find some social places that you can
go to regularly.

28
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:23,880
That's another thing you can do,
you know,

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,630
was the pick a couple of hangouts,
like a local bar or something like that

30
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:30,690
or whatever.
But go there regularly and say hi to the

31
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,940
people who own it and run it.
Then,

32
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,670
you know,
eventually you'll be irregular and then

33
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:37,560
you can start to meet people by doing
that.

34
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:38,221
But,
you know,

35
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:40,560
it might take you two or three years to
get good at it.

36
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:44,640
Um,
I've seen people go to go from being

37
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,260
afraid to strike up a two to have a
conversation with a friend in a,

38
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,850
in a coffee shop,
you know,

39
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,760
like have a panic attack.
Thinking about that to actually doing

40
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:57,150
stand up comedy.
So you can really move yourself along

41
00:01:57,151 --> 00:01:59,370
ways if you,
if you make a long time plan.
