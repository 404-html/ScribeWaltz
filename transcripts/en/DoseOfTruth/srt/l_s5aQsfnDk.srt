1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:04,121
The Marxists,

2
00:00:04,121 --> 00:00:06,760
we're happy that religion had collapsed
because they thought that that would

3
00:00:06,761 --> 00:00:09,190
eliminate an entire strata of oppression.

4
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:11,500
And you can see that it's
not like the Catholic church,

5
00:00:11,501 --> 00:00:12,101
for example,

6
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,600
was free of corruption.

7
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:14,231
You know,

8
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:17,950
it was in many ways it corrupt enterprise
and you could read it as solely a

9
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:18,940
corrupt enterprise.

10
00:00:18,941 --> 00:00:19,360
And you know,

11
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:19,961
to hell with it,

12
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:20,980
it's good that it's gone.

13
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:21,971
And,

14
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:22,804
uh,

15
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:25,101
you know,

16
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:27,020
the Friday and it's basically
thought the same way.

17
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:28,370
And so did most intellectuals,

18
00:00:28,371 --> 00:00:31,160
Freud thought that
religion was nothing than,

19
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:31,430
uh,

20
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:34,100
than a childish delusion that people

21
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,510
identified with because
they were afraid of dying.

22
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:39,170
It was a,

23
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:39,471
you know,

24
00:00:39,471 --> 00:00:41,180
it was a defense against death,

25
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:41,930
anxiety.

26
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:42,261
Look,

27
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:43,610
the Marxist argument and the,

28
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,600
and the Friday and argument,

29
00:00:44,601 --> 00:00:46,190
those are bloody powerful arguments,

30
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:46,520
you know,

31
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,420
cause you can see it.

32
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,051
You do.

33
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,870
People use the religious belief
as a defense against things.

34
00:00:50,871 --> 00:00:52,370
They're too terrified to confront.

35
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:52,910
Well,

36
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,780
obviously,

37
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:54,770
you know,

38
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:55,970
there's the Churchill press,

39
00:00:55,971 --> 00:00:56,691
people did it.

40
00:00:56,691 --> 00:00:56,781
Oh,

41
00:00:56,781 --> 00:00:57,441
press people,

42
00:00:57,441 --> 00:00:57,771
get it.

43
00:00:57,771 --> 00:00:58,620
Engage in,

44
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,151
you know,

45
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:01,940
conspiracies with people
in power across centuries.

46
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:02,390
It's like,

47
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:03,350
obviously,

48
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:04,483
you know,

49
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,480
the question is,

50
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:06,050
well,

51
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:07,130
what do you make of that?

52
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,371
Well,

53
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,610
partly you make of it that all
sorts of structures do that.

54
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,250
It's like structures do that and you know,

55
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,550
you can't just damn one structure
and thanked the others are going to,

56
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:16,941
you know,

57
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:18,020
it's like the right wingers,

58
00:01:18,021 --> 00:01:19,550
they're always owned about big government,

59
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:20,510
how terrible that isn't.

60
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,960
Left wingers are always on about
how big corporations are terrible.

61
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:24,530
It's like,

62
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:24,861
well,

63
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:26,180
Bang is terrible.

64
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,170
It doesn't matter if it's government or
corporations because things tend to tilt

65
00:01:30,171 --> 00:01:34,580
towards corruption across time and
then that has to be taken into account.

66
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:37,230
But anyway,

67
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:39,740
so the Friday ends and the
intellectuals and the Marxists,

68
00:01:39,741 --> 00:01:43,610
we're all pretty happy when the religious
dream started to come apart and they

69
00:01:43,611 --> 00:01:47,930
believe that the new edifice is that
they were going to construct fascist and

70
00:01:47,931 --> 00:01:51,260
communist would be so much better
than what they replaced that,

71
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:51,801
you know,

72
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:55,400
everybody would be
drowning in utopia and uh,

73
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,990
it's kind of too bad that
isn't how it turned out,

74
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,100
but it's certainly not how it turned out.

75
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:05,300
How it turned out was,

76
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:06,943
hmm.

77
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,220
Sometimes when you tear something down,

78
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,660
even if you think it's terrible,

79
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,850
you end up constructing something on its
ruins that makes the previous terrible

80
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:19,070
look like the work of rank amateurs.

81
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,680
And that's certainly what
happened in the 20th century.

82
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,263
I mean,

83
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,540
no matter what you say about the
Catholic Church and its basic barbarism,

84
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:29,720
especially when you know they were
involved in the witch hunt in the middle

85
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:29,721
ages,

86
00:02:29,721 --> 00:02:31,040
it's like those guys,

87
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,640
they were amateurs compared to
the fascists and the communists.

88
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:34,850
You know,

89
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:37,190
they were counting their victims
in the tens of thousands,

90
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,860
not the hundreds of millions.
