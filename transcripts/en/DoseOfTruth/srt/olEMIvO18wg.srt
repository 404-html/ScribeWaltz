1
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:10,760
And I'm going to compare the Marxist
theory of suffering to the Judeo Christian

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:13,760
theory of suffering and the
Judeo Christian would be.

3
00:00:13,761 --> 00:00:17,060
And the reason I'm doing that is because
I think the Judeo Christian theory of

4
00:00:17,061 --> 00:00:21,020
suffering is actually one of the
foundation stones of our entire culture.

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,560
And so it actually matters why
you think they're suffering.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,750
And so the story that describes the
entry of suffering into the world,

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,570
that mythological story
is the story in Genesis,

8
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:33,650
the story of Adam and eve.

9
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:37,160
And basically what happens in the story
of Adam and Eve is Adam and eve are

10
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:38,630
unconscious to begin with.

11
00:00:38,631 --> 00:00:42,290
And they're sort of in this paradise
will state there's no death or at least

12
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:43,430
there's no knowledge of death.

13
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:45,680
There's also no knowledge of self.

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,510
And then eve eats the apple that the
serpent gives her and the scales fall from

15
00:00:50,511 --> 00:00:55,511
her eyes and she gives the apple
to Adam and he eats it as well.

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,320
So she makes him self conscious.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,400
They both wake up.

18
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:02,360
The first thing that happens is they
realize that they're naked and they cover

19
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:03,141
themselves up.

20
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:06,380
And the second thing that happens as a
consequence of that realization is that

21
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:10,400
they come to know the difference between
good and evil and I mean that's a

22
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,520
insanely complicated story that's dealing
with a re absolutely incomprehensible

23
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:22,181
number of complex phenomena simultaneously
but it basically goes something like

24
00:01:22,821 --> 00:01:27,821
this is that to be aware that you're
naked is to be aware of your fragility and

25
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:30,681
your mortality.

26
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:34,040
When when you have a nightmare about
being naked in front of a crowd,

27
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:36,350
it means that you're exposed to the crowd,

28
00:01:36,351 --> 00:01:37,280
all your flaws,

29
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:42,110
all your mortal vulnerability is exposed
to the crowd for for for them to see,

30
00:01:42,111 --> 00:01:44,660
for you to be ashamed
of for them to judge.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
That's partly why we're all close.

32
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,740
That's partly why human being human.

33
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,110
Why clothing is a human universal.

34
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,060
There's many human universals by the way,

35
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,500
clothing is one of them although it's
used for many different purposes so Adam

36
00:01:57,501 --> 00:02:01,190
and eve cover themselves up and so
because they've realized that they're,

37
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,750
that they're vulnerable,

38
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,770
they're naked and vulnerable.

39
00:02:03,771 --> 00:02:04,970
That self consciousness,

40
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:06,890
human beings are self conscious animals.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,530
We're really the only
self conscious animals.

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:13,430
Other animals have the
glimmerings of self consciousness.

43
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,490
Some of them can identify
themselves in a mirror for example,

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,860
but we have whole theories of ourselves.

45
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:23,750
We have whole articulated verbal and
philosophical theories of what a human

46
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:25,910
being is and what we
each are as individuals.

47
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:28,550
So really those aren't in
the same conceptual universe.

48
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,780
It's a whole different,

49
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:32,360
it's a qualitatively different issue.

50
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:34,470
In the case of human
beings were self conscious,

51
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,750
self consciousness,

52
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:39,480
loads on trait neuroticism technically
speaking which means that self

53
00:02:39,481 --> 00:02:43,250
consciousness is primarily something
that manifest itself in the form of

54
00:02:43,251 --> 00:02:45,860
negative emotion and we all
know that you're on stage,

55
00:02:45,861 --> 00:02:46,940
you get self conscious.

56
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,200
Is that a good thing?

57
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,333
No,

58
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,650
you can give so self conscious
that your tongue tied,

59
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:51,891
right?

60
00:02:51,891 --> 00:02:52,581
It's not good.

61
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:56,630
You don't want to be self conscious
on stage or maybe ever you get self

62
00:02:56,631 --> 00:02:57,340
conscious in the,

63
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:59,120
in the face of someone
you're trying to impress.

64
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,951
He turned all red.

65
00:02:59,951 --> 00:03:00,784
You Stammer.

66
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,570
It's like self consciousness is a rough
business and it's no wonder because you

67
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:07,870
know yourself for the f for
the fragile fool that you are,

68
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:10,600
and it's even worse than that because see,

69
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:14,650
it took me a long time to figure out why
it was that when Adam and eve woke up,

70
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:16,750
they also develop the
knowledge of good and evil.

71
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:19,830
I just couldn't figure that out because
it didn't make sense to me what,

72
00:03:19,831 --> 00:03:23,800
how selfconsciousness
knowledge of vulnerability
and the knowledge of good and

73
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:28,150
evil we're tangled together or even
really what the knowledge of good and evil

74
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,984
meant.

75
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:30,940
But I figured it out eventually I thought,

76
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,211
oh,

77
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,690
I get it.

78
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,081
I get it.

79
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:34,510
It was like a real revelation to me.

80
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:36,910
As soon as you know you're vulnerable,

81
00:03:36,911 --> 00:03:38,560
you know the difference
between good and evil.

82
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,630
Because as soon as you
know you're vulnerable,

83
00:03:40,631 --> 00:03:42,100
then you know everyone else is.

84
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,740
And as soon as you know that
everyone else is vulnerable,

85
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:45,910
you know how to hurt them.

86
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:52,150
And so that means you consciously
know how to bring suffering into big,

87
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,070
and that's the knowledge of good and evil.

88
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,280
And you know that because let's say that
you're really good at torturing people,

89
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:57,591
hadn't,

90
00:03:57,591 --> 00:04:00,940
there's no doubt a number of people in
the audience who are actually quite good

91
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:01,450
at that,

92
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,880
and maybe you all have a
bit of an affinity for it.

93
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,233
Um,

94
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,581
if you're married,

95
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:08,650
I'm sure your partner
would testify to that.
