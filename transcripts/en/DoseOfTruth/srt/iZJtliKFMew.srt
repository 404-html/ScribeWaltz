1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,660
What is the evolutionary reason
for having consciousness?

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,300
I think that was Toby who
asked that God only knows.

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,223
Um,

4
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:20,970
that's been a problem that people have
been hammering on for a long time.

5
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:21,181
I mean,

6
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:25,560
that's the so called Zombie problem
that David Chalmers is as described,

7
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:26,640
which is something like,

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:32,190
how do you know that other people aren't
exactly like you except acting in a

9
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:35,110
completely determined matter
and devoid of consciousnesses?

10
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,603
Um,

11
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,630
I don't know what the evolutionary
reason is for consciousness.

12
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:40,020
I mean,

13
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,110
I can speculate like what
consciousness seems to be,

14
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,190
at least in part,

15
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,713
is,

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,970
uh,

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,750
a mechanism of repair.

18
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,040
So a lot of the things that
you do are unconscious.

19
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:53,281
You know,

20
00:00:53,281 --> 00:00:54,360
like when you're driving,

21
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:55,620
if you're an expert driver,

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,350
you're using your eyes to watch the road
and your eyes are moving your hands and

23
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:02,184
your arms,

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,700
but you're not really thinking
about what you're doing.

25
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,330
You're not attending to it consciously
because you've built circuitry already

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,150
specialized circuitry that
handles all those tasks.

27
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:12,661
Now,

28
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:14,820
what happens when you're driving?

29
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:16,440
Let's say that you make a mistake.

30
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,830
Well then what happens is you consciously
attend to the mistake and you attempt

31
00:01:22,141 --> 00:01:26,130
to revise the part of the automatic
structure that produced the error.

32
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:27,480
So imagine this,

33
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:30,810
imagine you're playing the piano and
you're playing a very complicated,

34
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:31,770
uh,

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:35,190
sequence and you stumble over part of it.

36
00:01:35,191 --> 00:01:38,520
So you're zooming along and you stumble
over part of it and then you attend to

37
00:01:38,521 --> 00:01:43,521
that and you'd go back and you slow down
and you move your fingers slowly and

38
00:01:43,711 --> 00:01:48,240
you try to reprogram those
little automatic units that
have handled that part of

39
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:48,600
it.

40
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,040
You repair them and reprogram them and
you get faster and faster out it as they

41
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,390
automatize and then you go.

42
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:59,391
So consciousness seems to be something
that watches what you do automatically,

43
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,890
checks for errors and then repairs it.

44
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,540
And so that's its function.

45
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,880
Now you might ask why a repair mechanism
like that would have to be associated

46
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,910
with awareness and answered.

47
00:02:10,911 --> 00:02:11,610
That is,

48
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:11,910
uh,

49
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,170
not only do I not know,

50
00:02:13,171 --> 00:02:17,730
I don't think anyone knows if I was
speculating and which I've done.

51
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,900
I think consciousness actually plays
an integral role in being itself,

52
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:26,820
because I'm not convinced that there would
be any being of any recognizable sort

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,890
without a conscious observer.

54
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,560
So I think consciousness is
actually like a center point of,

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,490
of the cosmos in some sense.

56
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,950
And I think it's because
of ideas like that,

57
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:39,090
that the,

58
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,860
the grand archetypal idea of the soul
has emerged and I think it's correct.

59
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,370
Um,

60
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,203
so,

61
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,920
but how to precisely integrate
that with evolutionary theory,

62
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,030
um,

63
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:54,960
apart from the description
that already provided,

64
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:55,620
I just don't,

65
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,610
I just don't know.
