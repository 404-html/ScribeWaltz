1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:07,661
Hi,

2
00:00:07,661 --> 00:00:08,391
Dr. Peterson.

3
00:00:08,391 --> 00:00:09,870
Now I'd been wanting to ask you this,

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:10,210
uh,

5
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,300
for a while now since I
started watching your lectures.

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:13,990
Um,

7
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:17,200
after I started reading a
Nietzsche's beyond good and evil,

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,740
I came upon a paragraph in his
chapter on scholars that really,

9
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:26,260
really bothered me and it's
actually bothers me to this day.

10
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:26,881
Uh,

11
00:00:26,881 --> 00:00:27,120
he,

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,750
he talks about this kind of person,

13
00:00:28,751 --> 00:00:30,430
like they were a just a mirror.

14
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:31,421
I like,

15
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:32,231
they stretched,

16
00:00:32,231 --> 00:00:36,280
he said every part of their skin
basically to allow every new piece of

17
00:00:36,281 --> 00:00:40,660
information that they took on and
that all they ever were was just an

18
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:41,201
instrument.

19
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:44,200
They were just a mirror on
reflecting what they had learned,

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,290
never actually having generated
anything on their own.

21
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:47,890
And it's,

22
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:51,490
it's bothered me because I feel
like in a way it sort of like,

23
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:51,721
it's,

24
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:52,000
it's,

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,910
it's impacted my identity
a lot because I don't know,

26
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:57,520
how are you supposed to create something,

27
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,010
you know,

28
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,500
so.

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:58,771
Okay,

30
00:00:58,771 --> 00:00:59,640
well that's okay.

31
00:00:59,641 --> 00:00:59,941
That,

32
00:00:59,941 --> 00:01:01,110
that's a really good question.

33
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:01,890
I mean,

34
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,680
neat chip is often clashed
with the existentialists,

35
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:04,921
right?

36
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:07,590
And so one of the tenants
of existentialist,

37
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:09,840
there's two real tenants
of existentialism.

38
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:11,191
There's more,

39
00:01:11,191 --> 00:01:13,140
but obviously we're oversimplifying,

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,840
but one is that life is a problem.

41
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,570
It isn't because there's
something wrong with you.

42
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,000
It's that life is a problem.

43
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,270
And so that's often contrasted
with the Friday and view,

44
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:26,250
which is that if you have a problem,

45
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:29,280
it's because something went
wrong during your development.

46
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:30,600
The existentialist said,

47
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:30,820
no,

48
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,590
no.

49
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,870
It's like life is a problem.

50
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:35,070
Make no mistake about it.

51
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,750
And that,

52
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:37,583
yes,

53
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,080
the purpose of

54
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,460
the purpose of scholarship is in
some sense to solve that problem.

55
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,220
And so for Nicha,

56
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,821
like he said,

57
00:01:54,821 --> 00:01:56,740
all truths are bloody truths to me.

58
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:02,340
And what he meant by that was that if an
idea didn't incarnate itself in you and

59
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:05,740
transform your perceptions
and your actions,

60
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,080
then you were merely
possessed by the idea.

61
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:10,480
You are merely a
spokesperson for the idea.

62
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,820
Or You could say that
the idea possessed you.

63
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,560
You're a puppet for the idea.

64
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,480
It's not you.

65
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,270
It's the idea is in you and it has you.

66
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:23,500
You haven't taken the idea
and incorporated with you
and made it part of your

67
00:02:23,501 --> 00:02:24,334
life.

68
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:27,580
And so there's a romanticism
that's associated with that,

69
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:27,791
right?

70
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:29,290
That's the passionate scholar.

71
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:31,900
The person for whom ideas are not merely,

72
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,761
they're not merely,

73
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:39,761
what would you call abstracted
representations that can
be tossed about as if

74
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:43,070
they're commodities.

75
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,540
They're there,

76
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,620
they're more like per,

77
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:46,850
they're more like personalities.

78
00:02:46,851 --> 00:02:48,830
That might be another
way of thinking about it.

79
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,130
And so if you're,

80
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:52,691
if,

81
00:02:52,691 --> 00:02:54,200
if those ideas are compelling,

82
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,190
then you don't

83
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:59,030
like one thing I learned a long time ago,

84
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,090
and I think this is probably relevant,

85
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
I know when I was a kid I liked to
argue and I like to win arguments or or,

86
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,773
or lose them,

87
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,370
although I like winning them a lot better,

88
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,570
but I didn't really mind so much
what the content of the argument was.

89
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:14,621
You know,

90
00:03:14,621 --> 00:03:19,621
I could engage in it like a sparring match
and it was in some sense to establish

91
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:20,681
dominance,

92
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:20,891
right?

93
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:22,360
To establish intellectual dominance.

94
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:27,540
I quit doing that when I was in my mid
twenties because I thought that that was

95
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:30,690
too shallow and approach to the ideas.

96
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,533
They,

97
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,110
they're not commodities of that sort.

98
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:35,973
They're there,

99
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,550
they have tendrils that
reached down into the living.

100
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:41,050
That's the right way to think about it.

101
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:46,500
And so niche criticism of scholars and
he did this a lot was that they were

102
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:47,464
bloodless.

103
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:47,891
You know,

104
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:48,724
they didn't,

105
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,270
they were full of
performative contradictions.

106
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,560
That's another way of thinking about,

107
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,900
they'd say one thing and do another
because their intellect was completely

108
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:57,190
dissociated from their,

109
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,450
from their actions.

110
00:03:59,230 --> 00:03:59,800
And he,

111
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,310
he,

112
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,560
he thought that was a very bad idea.

113
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,770
And I think that that's a good criticism.

114
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:07,180
I think it is a bad idea.

115
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:10,390
I also think it makes for an
extraordinarily boring lecturer,

116
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,141
you know,

117
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:13,180
cause you can tell if
you're listening to someone,

118
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,840
whether the idea is that you're hearing
are merely being passed through the

119
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,060
person as if they're being memorized,

120
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:22,900
say or whether they're part of
the dynamic core of the person.

121
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,170
And if they're part of the
dynamic core of the person,

122
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:28,600
then they're almost always
engaging in gripping.

123
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:32,110
And so he wasn't a fan
of bloodless scholars.

124
00:04:32,111 --> 00:04:35,020
And I think that's correct because
one of the things that I see,

125
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:39,250
it's not a good idea to
have ideas possess you

126
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:43,000
unless you know what
the idea is are up to.

127
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:48,001
And lots of people are possessed by ideas
rather than possessing them and not,

128
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:51,760
what that means is they haven't taken
the ideas and integrated them into their

129
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,594
own being.

130
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,033
They haven't,

131
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,350
it's like an incarnation in a sense.

132
00:04:56,351 --> 00:05:01,351
They have an incarnated the ideas in
embodied form and so they're incomplete,

133
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,030
you know,

134
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,960
nature also in thus spake Zarathustra
when Xero Theaster comes down the

135
00:05:07,961 --> 00:05:08,794
mountain,

136
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,220
he sees a bunch of people gathered
around a famous individual,

137
00:05:12,221 --> 00:05:14,230
I think maybe a scholar
but doesn't really matter.

138
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,070
And when Xero Theaster goes
and looks at the person,

139
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,080
only sees his little tiny
midget with the gigantic ear.

140
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,390
And so he's a hyper specialist,

141
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:22,960
right?

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,520
And so he has a pretty impressive year,

143
00:05:24,521 --> 00:05:26,260
but he's only this big.

144
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,730
And that was niches,

145
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,301
images,

146
00:05:28,301 --> 00:05:32,680
stick commentary on the danger of hyper
specialization and also on the danger of

147
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,870
adulation for hyper specialization.

148
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,320
And cause he thought about
it as a kind of deformity.

149
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:39,371
Now,

150
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:40,660
nature was a pretty harsh guy,

151
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,470
but,

152
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:42,303
um,

153
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:49,090
but he did address the issue
of the relationship between
intellectual knowledge

154
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:51,580
and an action because for nature,

155
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,940
those things are not to be
separated in some sense.

156
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,320
So yeah.

157
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,100
So maybe,

158
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,933
I don't know why,

159
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,620
maybe it bothered you,

160
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,440
like it's hard to say why it bothered you.

161
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:07,730
It might have bothered you because it
sort of undermine the idea of scholar.

162
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,020
But the other possibility,

163
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,990
and this isn't an accusation because
obviously I don't know anything about you,

164
00:06:11,991 --> 00:06:14,840
but it might also be
that it struck a chord,

165
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:15,674
you know,

166
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:20,830
and that maybe you were doubtful or
questioning how tightly associated your

167
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,360
intellectual endeavor was with your
actual character and your practice.

168
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,700
So that's another possibility.

169
00:06:31,701 --> 00:06:31,881
I mean,

170
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:34,520
that's a really good thing to think
about because generally speaking,

171
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,800
that integration has,

172
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,160
is very much lacking.

173
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:42,350
People are a lot smarter and fluid with
their ideas than they are ethical and

174
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,130
consistent and characterized by integrity.
