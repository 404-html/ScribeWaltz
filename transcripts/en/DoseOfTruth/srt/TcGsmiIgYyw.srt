1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:02,580
I was trying to figure out

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:06,660
who I was and how that could be fixed.

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,710
Something like that.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:12,060
I started to pay very careful
attention to what I was saying.

5
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,300
I don't know if that happened
voluntarily or involuntarily,

6
00:00:15,301 --> 00:00:19,290
but I could feel it sort of split
developing in my psyche and the split.

7
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:23,190
And I've actually had students tell me
the same thing has happened to them after

8
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:27,780
they've listened to some of the material
that that I've been describing to all

9
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:28,614
of you,

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,970
but split into two let's say.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,080
And one part was the,

12
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,340
let's say the old me that was talking
a lot and that liked to argue and that

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,420
liked ideas.

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:45,540
And there was another part
that was watching that part,

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,800
like just with it's eyes
open and neutrally judging.

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,360
And the part that was neutrally judging
was watching the part that was talking

17
00:00:54,361 --> 00:00:55,194
and going,

18
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,790
that isn't your idea.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,220
You don't really believe that.

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,530
You don't really know
what you're talking about.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,150
That isn't true.

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,470
And I thought,

23
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:04,770
hmm,

24
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:05,730
that's really interesting.

25
00:01:05,731 --> 00:01:06,220
So now I've,

26
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,850
and that was happening to
like 95% of what I was saying.

27
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,500
And so then I didn't
really know what to do.

28
00:01:10,501 --> 00:01:10,831
I thought,

29
00:01:10,831 --> 00:01:11,161
okay,

30
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:11,911
this is strange,

31
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:12,970
so maybe I've,

32
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,660
I've fragmented and that's
just not a good thing at all.

33
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:16,470
I mean,

34
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,780
it wasn't like it was hearing
voices or anything like that.

35
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:19,170
I mean,

36
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,100
it wasn't like that.

37
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:21,661
It was,

38
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:22,494
it was,

39
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:22,711
well,

40
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:24,810
people have multiple parts.

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,450
So then I had this weird conundrum.

42
00:01:27,451 --> 00:01:28,284
It's like,

43
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:28,531
well,

44
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:30,390
which of this two things are me?

45
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,240
Is it the part that's
listening and saying,

46
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:33,990
no,

47
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,220
that's rubbish.

48
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,240
That's a lie.

49
00:01:36,241 --> 00:01:39,000
That's you're doing
that to impress people.

50
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,410
You're just trying to win the argument,

51
00:01:40,411 --> 00:01:41,244
you know,

52
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,750
was that me or was the part that was
going about my normal verbal business?

53
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,460
Me and I didn't know,

54
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,540
but I decided I would go with the
critic and then what I tried to do,

55
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:52,440
what I learned to do,

56
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:56,520
I think was to stop saying
things that made me weak.

57
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,800
And now that,

58
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,131
I mean,

59
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:03,300
I'm still trying to do that because
I'm always feeling when I talk,

60
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,190
whether or not the words that I'm saying
are either making me align or making me

61
00:02:08,191 --> 00:02:09,024
come apart.

62
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,860
And I think the alignment,

63
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:12,720
I really do think the alignment is,

64
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,060
I think alignment is the right
way of conceptualizing it.

65
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:18,510
Because I think if you say
things that are as true is,

66
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:19,350
you can say them.

67
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:20,184
Let's say.

68
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,590
Then they come up,

69
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:26,610
they come out of the depths inside of
you because we don't know where thoughts

70
00:02:26,611 --> 00:02:27,240
come from.

71
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,110
We don't know how far down
into your substructure,

72
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,020
the thoughts emerge.

73
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:35,400
We don't know what processes
of physiological alignment
are necessary for you to

74
00:02:35,401 --> 00:02:37,440
speak from the core of your being.

75
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,790
We don't understand any of that.

76
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,110
We don't even conceptualize that.

77
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,520
But I believe that you can feel that.

78
00:02:41,521 --> 00:02:43,680
And I learned some of that
from reading Carl Rogers,

79
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:44,071
by the way,

80
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:45,150
who's a great clinician,

81
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:45,840
uh,

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,820
because he talked about mental health
in part as a coherence between the,

83
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,610
the,

84
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,260
the spiritual or the,

85
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:55,380
or the abstract and the physical
that the two things were aligned.

86
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,010
And there's a lot of idea of alignment
in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking.

87
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,361
But anyways,

88
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:04,450
I decided that I would start practicing,

89
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,970
not saying things that would make me weak.

90
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,380
And what happened was that I had to
stop saying almost everything that I was

91
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,214
saying.

92
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,820
I would say 95% of it as a
hell of a shock to wake up.

93
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,770
And I mean this was over a few months,

94
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:22,540
but it's a hell of a shark to wake up
and realize that you're mostly dead wood.

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,670
It's a shock,

96
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:25,391
you know?

97
00:03:25,391 --> 00:03:26,021
And you might think,

98
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:26,171
well,

99
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:27,850
do you really want all
of that to burn off?

100
00:03:27,851 --> 00:03:28,211
It's like,

101
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:28,301
well,

102
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:30,850
there's nothing left but
a little hosp 5% of you.

103
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:31,211
It's like,

104
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:31,660
well,

105
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,870
if that 5% is solid,

106
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,020
then maybe that's exactly
what you want to have happen.

107
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:40,170
Well,

108
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,060
so I told you that story is
an elaboration of this line,

109
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:45,910
and God saw that the wickedness of man
was great in the earth and that every

110
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,270
imagine have the imagination of the
thoughts of his heart was only evil

111
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:51,820
continually to question worth asking.

112
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,300
Just exactly what are your motives?

113
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,380
Well,

114
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:56,800
you know,

115
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,800
maybe they're purer than mine
were and it's certainly possible.

116
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,190
I don't think that I'm naturally
a particularly good person.

117
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,900
I think I have to work at it very,

118
00:04:04,901 --> 00:04:05,740
very hard.

119
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,800
And I don't necessarily think
that everyone is like that,

120
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,670
but some people are worse than that and
everyone's like that to some degree.

121
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:21,610
So it's worth thinking about just how
much trouble are you trying to cause,

122
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:22,841
you know,

123
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:25,270
and the other thing you might think about
is that if you're not doing something

124
00:04:25,271 --> 00:04:28,000
important with your life
by your own definition,

125
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,800
because that's the game
that we're playing.

126
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:31,120
You get to define the terms,

127
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,290
at least initially,

128
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:36,010
maybe you're prone to cause trouble just
because you don't have anything better

129
00:04:36,011 --> 00:04:40,390
to do because at least it's trouble
is more interesting than boring.

130
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,111
You know,

131
00:04:41,111 --> 00:04:41,980
that's something you learn.

132
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:45,280
If you read Dostoyevsky Dusty Husky
knew that extraordinarily well.

133
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,050
And so if you're not doing something,

134
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:49,660
if you're not pushing yourself
to the limit of your capacity,

135
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,790
then you have plenty of leftover.

136
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:52,983
Um,

137
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,210
what would you say will power,

138
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,020
energy and resources to devote
to causing interesting trouble?

139
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,183
And so,

140
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:01,331
well,

141
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,910
so I would say this is also
an archetypal scenario.

142
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,240
God saw that the wickedness of man
was great in the earth and that every

143
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:10,360
imagination of the thoughts of his
heart was only evil continually.

144
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:12,880
That's something to meditate on

145
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,100
and it's not self destructive
because what it is is an attempt to,

146
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,080
it's like the diagnosis of an illness.

147
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:22,570
It's like if that does happen
to be the case for you,

148
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,590
or to some degree,

149
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,390
maybe it's only 10% of you or something,

150
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,860
or maybe it's 90% well then coming to
terms with that is excellent because then

151
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,150
maybe you can stop doing it.

152
00:05:31,151 --> 00:05:34,150
And what would be the downside to that?

153
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,700
You'd have to give up your resentment,

154
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:38,380
obviously in your hatred and all of that.

155
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,840
And that's really annoying
because those emotions are very,

156
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,520
they're easy to engage in in there and
they're engaging and they have this

157
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:49,330
feeling of self righteousness with
them and that goes along with them.

158
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,253
But

159
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,320
you're not doing this in
order to put yourself down.

160
00:05:53,321 --> 00:05:57,340
You're doing this in order to separate
the wheat from the chaff and to leave

161
00:05:57,341 --> 00:05:59,680
everything that you
don't have to be behind.
