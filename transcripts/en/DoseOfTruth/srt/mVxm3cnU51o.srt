1
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,430
I would like to ask you about this as
well,

2
00:00:08,431 --> 00:00:12,760
because as a,
as a man would go yuck pain in a country

3
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:14,260
like Sweden,
you have to,

4
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:19,700
I would say that I think a lot of boys
at least,

5
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:22,640
or I'm confused what it means to be a
man.

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,700
And then you have these public figures,
adult males admitting to collective

7
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:33,520
guilt and trying to be sort of the new
new mail,

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,070
uh,
which admits to gill feminist,

9
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,460
the good man.
And if you are

10
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,370
fat Tomcat of a man resting on top of
the warm TV,

11
00:00:44,371 --> 00:00:45,580
who's,
who's,

12
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,090
who's,
what would you say moral virtue consists

13
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:50,490
in his harmlessness exactly.

14
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:54,760
What,
what's,

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:58,040
I mean how,
what's the advice to give to,

16
00:00:58,070 --> 00:01:00,890
because what I find,
I see a lot of men trying to find their

17
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:04,850
way and
find out what it means to be a man.

18
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:09,820
And I think that's a lot of them turns
to you and a,

19
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,640
or a person like Jocko Willink and let,
let interviewed you.

20
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:15,320
And because you're,
you're,

21
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:18,150
uh,
and why do you think that it's,

22
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:22,660
I mean,
is it the because it doesn't seem so

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:26,130
you,
you're not sugarcoating life that you're

24
00:01:26,131 --> 00:01:26,964
not giving them

25
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,600
no.
Well,

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,050
the funny thing about,
well there's a couple of things that I'm

27
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:32,310
doing that are different from what
people usually do.

28
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:34,680
You know,
so in the last 20 years,

29
00:01:34,681 --> 00:01:38,760
the constant message to young people is
self esteem,

30
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:40,920
self esteem,
feel good about yourself.

31
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:42,180
It's like,
I don't buy that.

32
00:01:42,181 --> 00:01:44,880
I think that you look at yourself in the
mirror and you think,

33
00:01:44,881 --> 00:01:47,130
Jesus Christ,
I could be a hell of a lot better than I

34
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:49,080
am.
And so,

35
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:52,680
and the thing is there's nothing more
complimentary to tell a young person

36
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:53,910
than that.
So like,

37
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,820
look at you,
you're a wreck.

38
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,920
Grow the hell up.
There's so much more to you than your

39
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:01,930
manifesting.
Then you can hardly imagine it.

40
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:02,830
It's like,
well,

41
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,570
you think that's a criticism?
It's like,

42
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,711
no,
it's not.

43
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:07,390
It's a great compliment.
It's like,

44
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,580
look at how much more you could bring
out into the world.

45
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,090
Get your aggression under control,
strengthen yourself.

46
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:18,900
Like take on some responsibilities.
See if you have enough bloody courage to

47
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:21,510
tell the truth.
Put your life together.

48
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,030
Stop whining.
Hmm.

49
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,900
The man eat that up because no one's
ever told them that.

50
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:30,970
Which just makes breaks my heart.
Yeah,

51
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,110
it's so bad.
And you know,

52
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:37,170
the boys are pulling out of everything.
They're pulling out a university,

53
00:02:37,171 --> 00:02:40,500
they're pulling out of life,
they're pulling out of marriage,

54
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,260
and,
and because of that,

55
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:47,190
they're more awkward and unsophisticated
than they would otherwise be in much

56
00:02:47,191 --> 00:02:50,670
more prone to make sexual errors,
some of which are,

57
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,570
you know,
predatory malevolence in a small

58
00:02:54,571 --> 00:02:55,830
proportion of cases.

59
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:57,450
But it's another one of those
situations,

60
00:02:57,451 --> 00:02:59,710
you know,
like imagine that one in a hundred men

61
00:02:59,711 --> 00:03:01,940
are sexual predators.
Yeah,

62
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,700
probably.
Maybe it's one in 50 but let's go with

63
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:06,380
one in a hundred.
Well,

64
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:11,650
they,
that small proportion commit all of this

65
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:14,770
sexual predation.
Like if you look at criminals,

66
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,510
it's a parade.
Oh,

67
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:17,590
distribution.
Again,

68
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:21,630
5% of the criminals produce something
like,

69
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,260
well,
the overwhelming majority of the crimes,

70
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,930
right?
It's a small coterie of specialized

71
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:30,510
people who are responsible for all the
criminality.

72
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,930
Lots of people are in prison because
they did one highness thing,

73
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:37,260
you know,
like they got enraged or drunk and did

74
00:03:37,261 --> 00:03:40,980
something violent.
But there's the serial criminal types

75
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,930
and they're the ones that are,
they do all,

76
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:45,750
they,
they like we had one guy in Toronto for

77
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:48,330
example,
who ran a bike theft ring and they

78
00:03:48,331 --> 00:03:52,540
finally nailed him.
And like there weren't any bikes stolen

79
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,620
in Toronto after that.
It was just him and his little coterie

80
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:57,101
of,
you know,

81
00:03:57,101 --> 00:04:01,150
organized bike thieves and these guys
that are being outed,

82
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,710
the serial predators,
they are responsible like one,

83
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:10,060
one spread predatory guy can prey on who
knows,

84
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:13,270
500 females,
thousand females in the lifetime,

85
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,740
you know.
So

86
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,390
it's almost seems like,
I mean this is

87
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,780
a lot of guys,
I was one of these guys who sort of turn

88
00:04:24,781 --> 00:04:26,750
away from society for,
for awhile,

89
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,360
like into computer games,
like the slacker identity where,

90
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:37,530
which is sort of,
I guess it's always been there like you

91
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,690
turned to a like away from all
responsibilities,

92
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:47,220
but the opportunities to do this,
it's so much Florida now,

93
00:04:47,221 --> 00:04:47,420
right?

94
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:47,751
Yeah.
Well,

95
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,100
it's,
it's the lost boys,

96
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:53,060
like in Peter Pan Right there,
it never land and they never grow up.

97
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,360
And Peter Pan is their leader.
That's,

98
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,810
that's the story.
And it's not surprising because it's

99
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:03,260
easier to do.
It's easier to occupy yourself trivially

100
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:07,640
than it is to do something difficult.
So like there's a big tendency in that

101
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:11,120
direction to begin with because it's
easier to do nothing than to take

102
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:14,480
responsibility.
It's easier to play games than to plan

103
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:18,230
for the future.
It's easier to be resentful and angry

104
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:20,510
than it is to be,
you know,

105
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,520
to shoulder you're vulnerability
properly.

106
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:27,110
And then when you add on to that,
the idea that if you go out into the

107
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:31,430
world and try to strive forward,
that you're nothing but a predatory

108
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,210
patriarch,
then well,

109
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,440
it's just one more.
It's just the icing on the cake.

110
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,720
You know,
I had a friend who was like that he

111
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,390
pulled back from the world,
um,

112
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:50,290
and bill because he believed that active
masculinity was a pathological force.

113
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,590
And um,
he poisoned himself terribly because of

114
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:56,750
that.
And he committed suicide when he was 40.

115
00:05:56,751 --> 00:05:59,340
He hooked an exhaust,
you know,

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,440
up hose onto his exhaust pipe and gassed
himself up in the mountains in Alberta.

117
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:08,360
And that was the logical consequence of,
of his self hatred.

118
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,860
It's like,
well,

119
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:13,070
if you're so pathological,
why don't you just do it yourself in and

120
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:14,990
hiding like that is,
you know,

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,300
it's not,
that's obviously not the full fledged

122
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:18,890
manifestation of that,
but,

123
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,250
but it's,
it's,

124
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:23,150
believe me,
it's on the road.

125
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,680
So,
and so,

126
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:26,450
yeah,
I've been talking to all these young

127
00:06:26,451 --> 00:06:28,280
guys,
they come to my biblical lectures for

128
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:30,320
example,
and the message is always the same.

129
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:33,590
It's like stand the hell up.
Get the hell out there in the world.

130
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:39,640
Take local responsibility,
put yourself together because there's

131
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:44,120
nothing more dangerous than a weak man.
And the problem is,

132
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:49,040
is that we're encouraging men to be weak
because we have this pathological idea

133
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:52,880
that there's that strength and tyranny
or the same thing.

134
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,480
And that's that Animus I was talking
about earlier though women,

135
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,690
it's not only women,
but the feminist types,

136
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:03,260
let's say,
who insist upon the pathology of the

137
00:07:03,261 --> 00:07:07,880
Patriarchy cannot distinguish between
competence and power.

138
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:14,200
They see everything because they have
this vague and undifferentiated sense of

139
00:07:14,571 --> 00:07:17,930
masculinity.
They say they see everything that is

140
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:22,370
associated with authority as equivalent
to tyranny.
