1
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:13,260
What moment triggered your obsession
with the topics outlined in the biblical

2
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,610
series and maps?

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:16,583
Well,

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,090
that's a good question.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:21,150
I actually don't know the answer
that I wouldn't say it was a moment.

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,370
I know that from the time I was
about 16 till the time that I was 24,

7
00:00:26,371 --> 00:00:29,370
so I had recurrent
nightmares about nuclear war.

8
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:31,620
And so that was certainly part of it.

9
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:34,170
And they were very vivid
and very realistic.

10
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,513
And so,

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,930
and certainly my reading
especially about the Holocaust,

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:40,860
um,

13
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,860
also and then later Solzhenitsyn's
accounts of the Gulag archipelago for

14
00:00:46,561 --> 00:00:47,060
example,

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,850
the horrors there that was
also a major contributor.

16
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,290
Um,

17
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,060
it was my concern about the Cold War.

18
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:57,960
I would say that was really the
trigger in general because I wanted to

19
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:58,561
understand,

20
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:58,691
I,

21
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:01,680
I took a political science degree
first and looked at it from a political

22
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:02,311
perspective.

23
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:06,420
But most of my professors by the time
I was in my third or fourth year,

24
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,090
insisted that the reason
that people fought,

25
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,770
the reasons that people
thought were economics.

26
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,980
And I never did believe that because,

27
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,000
well,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,950
people fight about the things they value,

29
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:22,110
but it isn't obvious like why
people value the things they value,

30
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,681
you know,

31
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:27,000
so it's a psychological issue as far
as I'm concerned with and know on an

32
00:01:27,001 --> 00:01:28,020
economic issue.

33
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:31,860
And so it was my discomfort,

34
00:01:31,861 --> 00:01:35,530
dissatisfaction with the
standard political science
viewpoint directed omic team

35
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:39,150
point combined with this strange
obsession I had about the Cold War.

36
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,810
Maybe that's associated to some degree
with my proclivity to depression.

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,441
I mean,

38
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:44,041
who knows?

39
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:44,874
You know,

40
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,510
I don't know.

41
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,260
Um,

42
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,820
I was obsessed with it and I,

43
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:51,360
it isn't obvious why things grip
you and shake you like a rat,

44
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:52,194
you know?

45
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:52,770
Um,

46
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,490
I guess there's something about that
that seems to be associated with what

47
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,900
people used to call destiny.

48
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,213
So,

49
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,433
mmm.

50
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,720
But it certainly wasn't an obsession when
I was 23 or 24 when I started writing

51
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:06,554
maps of meaning.

52
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:09,120
I was thinking about it 16 hours a day,

53
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,220
like top speed,

54
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,270
just nonstop.

55
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:13,550
And the only relief I could get from it,

56
00:02:13,551 --> 00:02:13,791
Ruby,

57
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,980
was to go work out with weights,

58
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:17,510
which I did for quite a long time.

59
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,400
And gained about 35 pounds in about a
year and a half working out with weights.

60
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,570
I had to quit because
I was eating so much.

61
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,280
It was taking up like half my life.

62
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,114
So,

63
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,133
um,

64
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:27,800
anyways,

65
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,820
I don't know what it was,

66
00:02:28,821 --> 00:02:29,654
you know,

67
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:31,971
who knows,

68
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:32,804
who knows what,

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,450
what darkness lurks in
the bottom of a soul.

70
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:36,051
No one,

71
00:02:36,051 --> 00:02:36,950
why it's there.

72
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,463
Um,

73
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:42,410
maybe it was also the fact that I could
see in myself the tendencies that might

74
00:02:42,411 --> 00:02:44,090
lead people to do terrible things.

75
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:45,410
Um,

76
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,550
and I was also very,

77
00:02:46,551 --> 00:02:47,780
very curious about that.

78
00:02:47,781 --> 00:02:51,380
So maybe that was an encounter with the
union shadow or something like that.

79
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,150
Jeremy Whole Shelf says,

80
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:54,530
will you lecture in the Netherlands?

81
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:54,891
Yes.

82
00:02:54,891 --> 00:02:55,701
As a matter of fact,

83
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:59,120
I'm coming to the Netherlands
in January to lecture there.

84
00:02:59,150 --> 00:02:59,750
Um,

85
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,440
I'll put the link to that up on my website
at some point in the relatively near

86
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:04,274
future.

87
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:04,850
So.
