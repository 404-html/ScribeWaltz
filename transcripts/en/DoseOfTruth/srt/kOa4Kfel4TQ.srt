1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,240
Especially among the enthusiastic,

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:12,921
and you might,

3
00:00:12,921 --> 00:00:13,371
you might say,

4
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:13,521
well,

5
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:14,720
you should be enthusiastic.

6
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:15,590
Well,

7
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:18,920
you should be enthusiastic when
the probability reward is high,

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:21,050
probably as you can't tell now,

9
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:25,160
if everybody's running around doing the
probability of reward is high and you're

10
00:00:25,161 --> 00:00:25,881
enthusiastic,

11
00:00:25,881 --> 00:00:28,580
you're going to get caught up in that
and then everybody's going to get caught

12
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:28,911
up in it.

13
00:00:28,911 --> 00:00:33,740
And then the probability of reward is
going to be high for a while until you run

14
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,250
out of enthusiastic people and then bang,

15
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,473
game over.

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:40,453
So

17
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,900
why are people like that?

18
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:46,880
While we're great mimics and the fact
that we get enthusiastic and imitate each

19
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:47,091
other,

20
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:48,500
it makes us able to cooperate.

21
00:00:48,501 --> 00:00:50,120
Because like if say you're a leader,

22
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:54,260
you want it filled me with enthusiasm so
I can go off and do impossible things.

23
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:55,820
And that happens sometimes.

24
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:56,031
You know,

25
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:58,140
you can come up with some hair brained,

26
00:00:58,550 --> 00:00:59,150
you know,

27
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,190
absurdly optimistic scheme.

28
00:01:01,191 --> 00:01:04,700
Like we'll go to the moon in five
years and which is impossible,

29
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:05,091
of course.

30
00:01:05,091 --> 00:01:05,810
And then everybody thinks,

31
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:05,961
oh,

32
00:01:05,961 --> 00:01:06,771
that would be great.

33
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:08,600
And there's a huge movement and Poof,

34
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:09,800
you're on loan in five years.

35
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,300
And it was impossible.

36
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,853
Well,

37
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,390
you could say Kennedy was a
self deceiver when he said it.

38
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,260
You could say that,

39
00:01:18,261 --> 00:01:19,610
except in retrospect,

40
00:01:19,611 --> 00:01:20,720
he wasn't cause it worked.

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,790
And that was all enthusiasm too,

42
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,170
and a bubble in a sense

43
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:26,103
that worked.

44
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,830
So there's no simple
way out of these things.

45
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,970
It's disruptive.

46
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:33,190
And you know what happens to,

47
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,500
if you let your kids
have fun out of control,

48
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:36,820
sooner or later,

49
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:40,570
one of them bangs their head on a
table or falls down the stairs or gives

50
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:41,830
another kid at poker,

51
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:42,191
you know,

52
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:45,610
like it will or break
something or you know,

53
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,970
it isn't just that it bothers people.

54
00:01:48,971 --> 00:01:51,190
It's that it's the Dionysian,

55
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,110
it's Dionysian danger.

56
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,220
It's orgastic danger and get
too enthusiastic about things.

57
00:01:57,221 --> 00:01:58,090
You get into trouble.

58
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,630
It's not negative emotion
that drives teenage pregnancy.

59
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,171
It's impulsive,

60
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:05,040
positive emotion.

61
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,360
Right.
