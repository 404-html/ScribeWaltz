1
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:12,660
So there is the church and the
church is underneath the cross,

2
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,350
right?

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:16,080
So that St Peter's Basilica.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,640
And so there's the cross on the
globe on top of the basilica,

5
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,930
and then there's the cross on the uh,

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,650
obelisk as well.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,620
And so what that means is that,

8
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:31,470
and this is where things
get insanely complicated,

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:36,930
is that the center is defined by
whatever the cross represents.

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,140
Now the cross represents a crossing point.

11
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:40,921
Geographically,

12
00:00:40,921 --> 00:00:41,191
it's,

13
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:45,300
it's certainly that the cross probably
represents the body to some degree,

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,070
but then the cross also represents
the place of suffering obviously.

15
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,630
And more importantly it,

16
00:00:51,631 --> 00:00:54,330
it represents the place
of voluntary suffering.

17
00:00:54,331 --> 00:00:55,440
Transcended.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:57,570
I'm speaking psychologically,

19
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,170
right?

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,340
Not Theologically.

21
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,870
That's what it represents.

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,340
And so you might say,

23
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:07,320
so here's the idea behind putting down
the obelisk with the cross and saying

24
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,370
that that's the center.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,890
So that's the thing that
everyone's aiming at.

26
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,580
And so the I,

27
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,600
the idea would be,

28
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:12,811
well,

29
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:16,290
if you're going to be a member of
the group defined by this obelisk,

30
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:21,291
then what you do is accept your position
at the center of suffering voluntarily

31
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:23,930
and therefore transcend it.

32
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,230
That's the idea.

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:27,630
And that is one hell of an idea.

34
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,650
It really is,

35
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:28,921
man,

36
00:01:28,921 --> 00:01:32,580
that is a killer idea because
it's actually a signal.

37
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,490
It's a really clear signal
of psychological health.

38
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,181
You know,

39
00:01:36,181 --> 00:01:39,360
because one of the things you do if
you're a clinical psychologist and someone

40
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,040
is paralyzed by fear is what you do
is you break their fears down into

41
00:01:44,041 --> 00:01:46,230
relatively manageable bits,

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,040
and then you have the
voluntarily confront their fears.

43
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,340
And it might also be things that
they're disgusted by it say if they have

44
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:54,750
obsessive compulsive disorder,

45
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:57,210
but it produces very
strong negative emotion,

46
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,044
whatever it is.

47
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:02,010
And then you have them voluntarily
confront whatever it is that produces that

48
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:05,910
overwhelming negative emotion
and that makes them stronger.

49
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
That's what happens.

50
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,450
It doesn't make them less afraid.

51
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,780
It makes them more
courageous and stronger.

52
00:02:12,781 --> 00:02:14,040
And that is not the same thing.

53
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:15,000
It's seriously not.

54
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,740
It doesn't decrease the fear.

55
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,600
It increases the courage.

56
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,340
And so that's a mind boggling
idea and it's deeper.

57
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:23,970
You know,

58
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,090
one of the things that's
really interesting about
these archetypal ideas is

59
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:27,500
that,

60
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,540
and maybe it's partly because of
the hyperlink nature of the Bible,

61
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:31,291
that's part of it,

62
00:02:31,291 --> 00:02:32,250
but it's not,

63
00:02:32,251 --> 00:02:34,830
the whole thing is that no matter
how deep you dig into them,

64
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,420
you'll never get to the bottom.

65
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,051
You know,

66
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:37,890
you hit a bottom,

67
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,251
you think,

68
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:38,611
God,

69
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:40,470
that's so unbelievably profound.

70
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,690
And then if you excavate
a little underneath that,

71
00:02:42,691 --> 00:02:45,240
you find something else that's
even more profound and you think,

72
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:45,631
wow,

73
00:02:45,631 --> 00:02:46,830
that's gotta be the bottom.

74
00:02:46,831 --> 00:02:48,090
And then you dig under that.

75
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:49,650
It's like there's no bottom.

76
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,410
You can just keep digging down
while as far as I can tell,

77
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:54,660
you can keep digging
down layer after layer.

78
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,730
And we'll talk a little bit about more,

79
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,880
a little more about what the
cross signifies as the center,

80
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:05,800
because you see what people were trying
to figure out is what is it that we need

81
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:07,240
to unite under,

82
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:07,541
right?

83
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:09,580
What's the proper thing to unite under?

84
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,990
I can give you another example.

85
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,360
So in the Mesopotamian societies,

86
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,040
the emperor

87
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:19,480
who was more or less
than an absolute monarch,

88
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,050
he lived inside what was
essentially a walled city.

89
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:27,190
And the god of the
Mesopotamians was Martik.

90
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:31,360
And martech was the figure who had
eyes all the way around his head.

91
00:03:31,361 --> 00:03:32,470
And he spoke magic words.

92
00:03:32,471 --> 00:03:34,540
So it was very attentive
and very articulate,

93
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:39,010
and it was mark who went out and
confronted the goddess of chaos,

94
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,370
the dragon of chaos and cutter
into pieces and made up the world.

95
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:42,881
Okay?

96
00:03:42,881 --> 00:03:44,920
So you can kind of
understand what that means.

97
00:03:44,921 --> 00:03:49,921
So Marta goes beyond the frontier
into the place of predatory chaos and

98
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:56,470
encounters the thing that's terrifying
and then make something productive out of

99
00:03:56,471 --> 00:03:56,950
it.

100
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,030
So it's a hero myth.

101
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,930
And,

102
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:02,770
and Martech is elected to the position
of preeminent God by all the other

103
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:05,050
Mesopotamian gods because he manages that.

104
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,850
So the,

105
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,680
the Martech idea emerges up the holy

106
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,100
dominance hierarchy and hits the Pinnacle
and God only knows how long that took.

107
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,530
It would be the
amalgamation of many tribes.

108
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:18,603
And then the,

109
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,470
the what?

110
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:21,304
The,

111
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:27,080
the distillation of all the tribal myths
to produce this emergent story of what

112
00:04:27,191 --> 00:04:28,750
constitutes top God.

113
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,870
And then the job of the
emperor was to act out Marduk.

114
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,730
That's what gave him sovereignty.

115
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:38,170
So the reason that he was the center
around which people organize themselves

116
00:04:38,171 --> 00:04:41,170
wasn't because he was when he
was being a proper emperor,

117
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:43,840
it wasn't because there was
something super special about him,

118
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,450
like the power didn't
exactly reside in him,

119
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,790
which is a really useful
thing to separate.

120
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:48,971
Right?

121
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:50,020
You want the power,

122
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,680
which is why it's kind of Nice
to have a symbolic monarch.

123
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:57,730
You get the symbolic power separated
from the personality power,

124
00:04:57,731 --> 00:04:57,941
right?

125
00:04:57,941 --> 00:04:59,440
Cause otherwise they get conflated.

126
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:00,760
That's what happened in Rome.

127
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:01,511
It's a very,

128
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:01,790
and it,

129
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:05,350
and you can see it tending to happen
now and then in the u s like with the

130
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:07,240
Kennedy dynasties and that sort of thing.

131
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:12,720
So the idea was the emperor
had sovereignty as long
as he was acting out Marta

132
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:17,590
properly and going out into the chaos
and cutting it into pieces and making

133
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:18,220
order.

134
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,090
That was his job they used to take
about outside the city on the New Year's

135
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:27,091
festival and strip him of all his emperor
garments and humiliate them and then

136
00:05:27,611 --> 00:05:28,630
force him to,

137
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:34,770
to confess all the ways that year
he hadn't been a good Martech,

138
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:37,180
so he wasn't a good ruler.

139
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,820
And so that was supposed to
clue him in and wake him up.

140
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:40,510
Right?

141
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,510
And then they would ritually reenact the
battle of Martech against tie timeout

142
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,640
out the chaos monster using statues.

143
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,040
And then if that all went well,

144
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:55,240
then the emperor would go back in and
the city would be renewed for another

145
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,241
year.

146
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:57,950
And we still have echoes of that
in our New Year's celebration.

147
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,290
Writes the same idea that's
echoed down all those,

148
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,910
all those centuries,

149
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,990
thousands of years.

150
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,230
So it says such a
staggeringly brilliant idea,

151
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:06,441
right?

152
00:06:06,441 --> 00:06:10,250
Because so part of the idea is
that the thing that sovereign,

153
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,170
so that's the pillar at the center that,

154
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,090
that everyone gathers around is at least
in part the thing that courageously

155
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:21,920
goes out into the unknown
and make something useful
out of it for the community.

156
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,593
So

157
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,481
that's very,

158
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:27,314
very smart.

159
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,520
It's very smart.

160
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,850
So this is another example of a center.

161
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:32,361
So these,

162
00:06:32,361 --> 00:06:33,260
this is the flag,

163
00:06:33,261 --> 00:06:34,460
this is the Union Jack.

164
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:37,310
And so it's made up of a bunch of crosses,

165
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:37,791
right?

166
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,080
And so the first cross,

167
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,550
the English cross,

168
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,990
that's the flag of Saint George.

169
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,010
That's the flag of England.

170
00:06:43,011 --> 00:06:43,430
And say,

171
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,610
what does Saint George do?

172
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,300
Slays the Dragon.

173
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:47,841
Exactly.

174
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,621
Same idea,

175
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:48,891
right?

176
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:49,850
So St George,

177
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,480
patron saint of England goes out and slays
the dragon and freeze the virgin from

178
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:54,620
the grip of the Dragon.

179
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:55,850
Same idea,

180
00:06:55,851 --> 00:06:56,061
right?

181
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,140
So that's the center.

182
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,880
And then the second cross is called,

183
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,640
uh,

184
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,540
a Saltier,

185
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,190
but it's another crucifix.

186
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:07,520
So it's the cross on which
Saint Andrew was crucified.

187
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,290
So it's the same idea.

188
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:14,291
It's that the center is the center of
suffering voluntarily undertaken because

189
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:15,710
Saint Andrew was a martyr.

190
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,470
And then Saint Patrick is the third cross.

191
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,390
And what did Saint Patrick do in Ireland?

192
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,330
Chased out all the snakes,

193
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:24,201
right?

194
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:25,790
So it's the same thing,

195
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,420
right?

196
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,590
And so the flag of Great Britain is
the combination of all of these three

197
00:07:30,591 --> 00:07:32,540
crosses that defines the center.

198
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,040
And that's what the flag is.

199
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,260
So that symbolizes all of that.

200
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,720
So that's,

201
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,260
you know,

202
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,520
completely mind boggling.

203
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,450
So when there's more
about Saint Patrick too,

204
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:47,450
so he banishes the snakes
after a 40 day fast.

205
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:51,950
And so that's an illusion to the 40
years that Moses spends in the desert.

206
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:56,951
And also the 40 days that Christ fast in
the New Testament and his walking stick

207
00:07:57,171 --> 00:07:59,240
when he plants it grows into a tree.

208
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,530
So that echos all of the ideas about
the center that we just described.

209
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,280
And he also speaks with the
ancient Irish ancestors,

210
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,630
which if you remember,

211
00:08:08,631 --> 00:08:13,631
is a characteristic of the shamanic
rituals where we're so in the typical

212
00:08:14,391 --> 00:08:15,320
shamonic ritual,

213
00:08:15,321 --> 00:08:20,321
which seems to be elicited
by psychedelic use,

214
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:25,660
the Sharman dissolve down past their
bones and then they go up into heaven and

215
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:27,830
speak with the ancestors,

216
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:32,831
and then they're introduced into the
heavenly kingdom and then the flash is put

217
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:36,470
back on their bones and they come
back and tell everybody what happened.

218
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,590
And that's a repeatable experience,

219
00:08:39,591 --> 00:08:39,861
right?

220
00:08:39,861 --> 00:08:43,580
The shamanic tradition is
unbelievably widespread.

221
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,070
So all over Europe,

222
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,390
ancient Europe and Asia,

223
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,850
and perhaps as far down as South America,

224
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:50,151
right?

225
00:08:50,151 --> 00:08:51,710
It's highly conserved.

226
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,030
And it's out of that tradition in all
likelihood that our religious idiation

227
00:08:56,031 --> 00:08:56,864
emerged.

228
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:57,681
So,

229
00:08:57,681 --> 00:08:59,570
and you can see echoes of that here.
