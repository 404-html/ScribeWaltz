1
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,100
This is one of the great
stories of Ma'am timed and it's,

2
00:00:10,101 --> 00:00:10,934
it's not,

3
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,240
this isn't the only variant of this story.

4
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:15,250
There's many variants of it,

5
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,143
but,

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,480
but this variant is useful for,

7
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:20,770
for our purposes.

8
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:24,790
That's a story I stumbled
across a long time ago.

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,210
Yeah.

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,120
I'm going to tell you the second story
first because I don't have the energy to

11
00:00:30,121 --> 00:00:31,170
tell you the first story.

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:36,260
So this is a story that the ancient
Egyptians predicated their society on.

13
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:38,910
And to understand this story,

14
00:00:38,911 --> 00:00:41,250
the first thing you have to know
is what the characters were in.

15
00:00:41,251 --> 00:00:42,540
These characters were gods.

16
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:43,973
There's four of them.

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,980
Although the Egyptians had
far more than four gods.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,320
You might think of these
as the central gods.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,121
And you might think,

20
00:00:51,121 --> 00:00:52,530
what is the central God?

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,490
And then you might think,

22
00:00:53,491 --> 00:00:53,671
well,

23
00:00:53,671 --> 00:00:57,690
imagine that the gods compete for
dominance across time and people's

24
00:00:57,691 --> 00:01:00,690
imaginations and some gods win.

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,070
And they occupied the primary position
of dominance in the hierarchy,

26
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:07,020
in the dominance hierarchy of gods.

27
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,440
And those are ideals and ideals compete
across time for dominance and their

28
00:01:12,721 --> 00:01:13,554
embodied.

29
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,310
And so when diverse tribal
people come together,

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,840
they throw all their gods into the ring
and they fight across time and something

31
00:01:21,841 --> 00:01:23,130
emerges as a victor,

32
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:27,450
and that's the emergence of
monotheism out of polytheism and it,

33
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,630
it parallels the development
of our unified morality
in within each of us as we

34
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:35,940
develop across time

35
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,550
and the,

36
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:45,550
the god that emerges as dominant across
time bears a substantial represent a

37
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:47,140
substantial

38
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,450
resemblance.

39
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,990
Imagine you have a set of gods in this
locale that are competing across time and

40
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:54,400
something emerges as dominant.

41
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:58,060
And then over here you have another set
of gods that compete across time for

42
00:01:58,061 --> 00:01:59,410
dominance and something emerges.

43
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,520
You'll see major commonalities
across the two things that emerge.

44
00:02:03,521 --> 00:02:05,920
And the reason for that
is because the emergent,

45
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,460
the process of emergence that gives
rise to both of them is similar in both

46
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:10,294
situations.

47
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:15,450
And that's part of what accounts for the
cross cultural similarity of high order

48
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:17,950
religious ideas.

49
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:18,880
All right?

50
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,400
Anyways,

51
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,740
you need to know the characters.

52
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:21,731
Oh,

53
00:02:21,731 --> 00:02:26,530
Cyrus Cyrus is the old king.

54
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,031
He's Dumbledore.

55
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:29,260
For all intents and purposes,

56
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:30,160
he's the old king.

57
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,443
He's the,

58
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,313
he's the,

59
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,320
the spirit that established
the Egyptian state.

60
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:35,981
When he was young,

61
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:36,880
he was a great hero.

62
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:39,280
But now he's old and he's Wilf,

63
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,560
he's archaic and he's willfully blind.

64
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,250
That's,

65
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,083
oh Cyrus.

66
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,501
He has a brother,

67
00:02:44,501 --> 00:02:45,334
Seth.

68
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:50,910
Seth is set and set is Satan because the
word Satan comes from the word Seth and

69
00:02:51,971 --> 00:02:54,520
set via the Coptic Christians.

70
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,360
So,

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,110
so,

72
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:58,960
so he's a precursor to the western idea.

73
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,913
Satan,

74
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,420
you have isis.

75
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,870
Isis is queen of the underworld and
Isis was the goddess of a religious

76
00:03:07,450 --> 00:03:08,350
structure that

77
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:09,820
okay

78
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,580
prevailed across thousands
and thousands of years.

79
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,280
Isis and you have Horace.

80
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,450
Horace is a Falcon and the Egyptian I,

81
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,260
everyone's knows that I write
the eye with the open pupil.

82
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,183
That's Horace.

83
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,820
And Horace is a fall can because
falcons can see way better.

84
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,810
They can see better than us.

85
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,540
They can see better than anything
else except for perhaps eagles.

86
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:35,350
And they fly above everything
is a zoo in the lion.

87
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:36,460
King is Horace,

88
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,390
right.

89
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,280
And Move Fossa is,

90
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:39,581
oh,

91
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:42,760
Cyrus and scar is Seth

92
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,210
and there's no specific
representation of Isis.

93
00:03:49,211 --> 00:03:53,770
But the closest there is in that story
is probably the queen of the hyenas.

94
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,470
That's played by a WHO's the actress?

95
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,780
Um hmm.

96
00:03:59,650 --> 00:03:59,981
Yes.

97
00:03:59,981 --> 00:04:00,814
Whoopi Goldberg.

98
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,331
That's right.

99
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:01,781
That's right.

100
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:02,290
Because she,

101
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,280
they inhabit,

102
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,080
she's like the queen of the underworld,

103
00:04:05,081 --> 00:04:05,350
right?

104
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,770
She's the queen of the hyenas
that live out among the death.

105
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,611
But okay.

106
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,260
Anyways,

107
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,093
Seth.

108
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,321
Oh,

109
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:13,154
Cyrus.

110
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,013
Seth,

111
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,101
are you,

112
00:04:16,101 --> 00:04:17,090
so send Horace,

113
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,740
here's how the story goes.

114
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:20,451
Well,

115
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:21,650
serious is a great king.

116
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,210
He established the Egyptian state.

117
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:25,880
You could think about him
as the embodiment of the,

118
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,710
of Egyptian custom and tradition.

119
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,310
You could think about him as the
thing that the pyramid represents.

120
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,240
All right?

121
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,100
But he was great when he was young,

122
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:35,210
but he's not young anymore.

123
00:04:35,211 --> 00:04:37,760
He's old and he's willfully blind.

124
00:04:37,761 --> 00:04:40,460
And what that means is that he
doesn't see what he could see.

125
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:42,260
He refuses to see what he could see.

126
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,720
Why is ocirus old and willfully blind?

127
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,550
Because that's what culture is.

128
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,060
It's a paternal spirit that's
old and willfully blind.

129
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,380
And it's always that way,

130
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:52,310
always that way.

131
00:04:52,311 --> 00:04:55,070
And the reason for that is because
it's a construction of the dad.

132
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,720
The Dad aren't alive.

133
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,230
They can't,

134
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,640
so they're out of date and they can't
update themselves anymore and you inhabit

135
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:02,474
their corpse.

136
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,720
And that's actually what happens in an
earlier story that I'll tell you next

137
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,270
week.

138
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,640
[inaudible] early Mesopotamian gods
inhabited the corpse of their father,

139
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,620
roughly speaking anyway,

140
00:05:12,621 --> 00:05:13,310
so,

141
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,461
oh,

142
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:15,920
Cyrus was great and when he was young,

143
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:16,940
but he hasn't young anymore.

144
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,530
He's old and he's willfully blind.

145
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:20,480
He won't look where he
knows he should look.

146
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:22,960
He doesn't have the energy or
maybe he doesn't have the spirit.

147
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,960
His brother Seth is
not a good guy and was,

148
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:27,771
Cyrus knows it,

149
00:05:27,771 --> 00:05:32,300
but he underestimates his malevolence
and power and so Seth wants to rule the

150
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:33,134
kingdom.

151
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,220
So what does that mean?

152
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,150
It's easy.

153
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,860
Every stable society is,

154
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:41,690
is threatened by willful
blindness and malevolence always.

155
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,930
Every bureaucracy has that proclivity
to stagnate and to become blind.

156
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,010
That's why corporations die all the time.

157
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:52,790
That's why a fortune 500
company only lasts 30 years.

158
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,680
It's why we have to have elections.

159
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,580
It's to stop the Dad from
staying control for too long.

160
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,430
Seth,

161
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:00,561
oh,

162
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,330
Cyrus turns a blind eye to Seth.

163
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:03,380
Seth is happy about that.

164
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,820
Same thing happens in the lion king,

165
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:05,660
roughly speaking.

166
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,680
Seth one day waits for a Cyrus
to make a mistake and to be weak,

167
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,820
and he attacks him and he chops them
up into pieces and he distributes the

168
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:16,430
pieces across the entire Egyptian state.

169
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,001
In fact,

170
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:20,240
the Egyptians regarded their
provinces as pieces of,

171
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:20,331
oh,

172
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,350
Cyrus's body.

173
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,521
Okay,

174
00:06:22,521 --> 00:06:26,090
so now you can't kill our
Cyrus because he's a god.

175
00:06:26,091 --> 00:06:27,650
And why is he god a God?

176
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,510
Because he represents the spirit of
structure and there's always structure.

177
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:33,770
It can't be destroyed.

178
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:35,510
It always reconstitutes itself.

179
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,270
It can be hurt and broken into pieces,

180
00:06:38,271 --> 00:06:39,980
which is exactly what happens to a Cyrus.

181
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,390
Things fall apart.

182
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,583
Why?

183
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:46,250
Because they get old and because
malevolence undermines them.

184
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,740
That's what the Egyptians
were trying to sort it out.

185
00:06:48,770 --> 00:06:49,071
Okay.

186
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:51,690
So Seth distributors though,

187
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,910
Cyrus all over Egypt,

188
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,550
so he can't get himself back together.

189
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,720
Right?

190
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,300
Things fall apart and they
can't be brought back together.

191
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,281
But the spirit of,

192
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:00,530
Oh,

193
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,880
Sarah's still lives in the pieces.

194
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,260
So what happens?

195
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,880
Orders demolished.

196
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,990
What would you expect?

197
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,400
Chaos emerges.

198
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,293
That's isis.

199
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,670
Isis as queen of the underworld.

200
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,690
She's well Cyrus's wife order and chaos.

201
00:07:14,691 --> 00:07:17,930
Just like the Yin and
the Yang order collapses.

202
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:19,730
Up comes the queen of the underworld.

203
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,290
She's looking for order.

204
00:07:21,291 --> 00:07:22,880
Chaos cries out for order.

205
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,930
She's looking for order.

206
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,920
She goes all around
Egypt trying to put ice.

207
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,400
So Cyrus back together.

208
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,200
It's a state of chaos.

209
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,760
She finds this Fellas,

210
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,560
she makes herself pregnant with it.

211
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,850
And what does that mean?

212
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,601
Well,

213
00:07:35,601 --> 00:07:38,290
it means it's like it's like Japan.

214
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:38,440
No,

215
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,560
in the belly of the whale.

216
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,220
That thing has the
potential to reemerge this,

217
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,830
the thing that collapses into its pieces,

218
00:07:45,831 --> 00:07:46,850
it's still alive.

219
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:47,540
It,

220
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,050
it can unite with the chaos
and produce something new.

221
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,860
That's the story of the dissolution
of structure into chaos.

222
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,120
And then it's reverification.

223
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,240
Isis makes herself pregnant.

224
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:00,620
She goes back down to the underworld.

225
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:02,060
She gives birth to Horace.

226
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,430
Horace is the Egyptian I,

227
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,580
he's the son of the great
father and the great mother.

228
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,240
He's a,

229
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,800
he's a messianic figure.

230
00:08:09,801 --> 00:08:10,634
And in fact,

231
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,670
much of the mythology that described
Horace was extracted without much

232
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:19,790
modification and then attributed
to Christ very much maybe.

233
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:20,191
And you,

234
00:08:20,191 --> 00:08:21,550
you can read about the parallels.

235
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,150
You can read about it online if you want.

236
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,070
There's any number of parallels.

237
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:28,700
And of course there is a methodology
that the Jews came out of Egypt and of

238
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,500
course the Christians
emerged from the juice.

239
00:08:30,501 --> 00:08:34,670
And so there was a tremendous influence
of Egyptian thinking on the development

240
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:35,780
of these later ideas.

241
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:41,050
And you see pictures of Isis with Horace
on her lap that are virtually identical

242
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:45,110
in content and form to the later pictures
of Mary with the Intranet Christ.

243
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:48,080
But that's the holy mother
of God and the hero.

244
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:48,340
It's,

245
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,970
it's not a Christian motif.

246
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,040
It's far deeper than a Christian motif.

247
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:53,240
It's a human motif.

248
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,501
So Isis,

249
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:59,501
queen of the gives birth to Horace and
Horace grows up outside the kingdom.

250
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,623
Why?

251
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,613
In underworld?

252
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,300
Because that's what human beings do.

253
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,940
You're alienated from your culture always.

254
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,540
Why?

255
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,570
It's old and dead and corrupt.

256
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,150
And so that leaves you
growing up in chaos.

257
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,020
Uh,

258
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,810
what would you call alienated
from your fundamental culture?

259
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:18,060
That's the story of adolescence.

260
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,920
Horace grows up,

261
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:23,490
he can see that's what
differentiates them from old Cyrus.

262
00:09:23,491 --> 00:09:24,570
That's why he's a falcon.

263
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,790
He goes and has a fight with Seth.

264
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:30,480
And now the difference between those
Cyrusone and Horace is that horse does not

265
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:31,770
or underestimates Seth.

266
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,920
He knows exactly what he's up against and
he goes and has a terrible battle with

267
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,840
him trying to get his kingdom back.

268
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,240
Something else that's echoed in
the lion king story and well,

269
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,620
Horace An and,

270
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,041
oh,

271
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:42,630
sorry,

272
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,720
Seth are fighting Seth
terrorists out one of his eyes.

273
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:46,681
Now,

274
00:09:46,681 --> 00:09:47,514
why?

275
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:52,050
Because Seth is the
embodiment of destruction and
malevolence and no matter how

276
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,250
conscious you are,

277
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,710
if you encounter that even voluntarily,

278
00:09:55,711 --> 00:10:00,150
the probability that it's going to damage
your consciousness is extraordinarily

279
00:10:00,151 --> 00:10:00,720
high.

280
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,150
That's why people don't do it,

281
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,640
so the eyes torn out,

282
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,760
but Seth is defeated and Horace banishes
him to the nether regions of the

283
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:11,490
kingdom.

284
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:12,360
You can't kill him.

285
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,470
Why?

286
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,640
Because the malevolent,

287
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,730
destructive force,

288
00:10:15,731 --> 00:10:17,700
the threatened states never dies.

289
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,200
It's always there.

290
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,650
You can only remove it temporarily.

291
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,830
Now Horace is King Pharaoh,

292
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,910
King God,

293
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,100
he's got his eye and so you think,

294
00:10:29,101 --> 00:10:29,281
well,

295
00:10:29,281 --> 00:10:32,580
he's going to just pop that back in his
hand and then he's going to be able to

296
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:33,414
lead.

297
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,290
He's going to be able to take his
place at the upper most pantheon,

298
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,990
pantheon of gods properly.

299
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,820
But that isn't what he does.

300
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:45,420
He takes his eye and he
goes back to the underworld,

301
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,830
just like Pinocchio,

302
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,090
going into the depths to rescue,

303
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:48,750
to pedal.

304
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,880
And down there is the spirit of all Cyrus,

305
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:51,480
who's,

306
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,660
who's extent as a kind of half dad ghost

307
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,760
and it gives us,

308
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:57,860
oh,

309
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,810
Cyrus's I

310
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:00,591
now,

311
00:11:00,591 --> 00:11:00,711
we'll,

312
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:00,971
sorry,

313
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:01,804
Russ can see.

314
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,320
So what does that mean?

315
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,090
You go down into the chaotic
when threatened by malevolence,

316
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,500
even to the point of damage
to your consciousness.

317
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,900
You go down into the chaos and you find
the dead spirit of your tradition and

318
00:11:18,901 --> 00:11:23,901
you give it vision and so provided
with vision or Cyrus regenerates.

319
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,300
And then it was Cyrus
and Horace go back up to,

320
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,990
to,

321
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:32,430
to the world linked
together and rule jointly.

322
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:38,390
And the Egyptians believed that the
Pharaoh who had an immortal spirit was the

323
00:11:39,121 --> 00:11:42,600
embodiment of the conjunction
of Horace and or Cyrus.

324
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,670
And that's what gave him sovereignty.

325
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,430
And so you think about
how brilliant that is.

326
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:50,490
The Egyptians are trying to
puzzle out who should lead,

327
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,140
who should be feral and
what do you have to be?

328
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:54,130
If you're going to be pharaoh,

329
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,570
in order for things to work,

330
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,980
you have to be awake to malevolence
and chaos and you have to embody your

331
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:08,461
tradition and that puts you at the highest
pinnacle of the dominant structure.

332
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,640
It's,

333
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,930
and that's the same as,

334
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,700
it's the same thing.

335
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:17,970
It's the same thing as the battle between
the gods across centuries or Ian's and

336
00:12:18,731 --> 00:12:23,731
the emergence of the highest possible
moral virtue as a consequence of that

337
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,873
competition.

338
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,270
It's the eye on the top of the pyramid,

339
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:28,960
right?

340
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,680
It's,

341
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,021
you know,

342
00:12:30,021 --> 00:12:33,280
on the Washington monument there's
a cap on the Washington monument.

343
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,040
The top of the Washington
monument is a pyramid.

344
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,630
At the top of the pyramid is a cap.

345
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,860
It's made out of aluminum.

346
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,010
And the reason it's made out of
aluminum is because when they made the

347
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:42,940
Washington monument,

348
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:45,160
it was the most valuable metal known.

349
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:46,450
And so what does it mean?

350
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,720
It means there's a pyramid and
there's something up the top of it.

351
00:12:49,721 --> 00:12:53,500
But the thing that's a tall at the top
of the pyramid isn't the same as the rest

352
00:12:53,501 --> 00:12:54,334
of the pyramid.

353
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,690
That's the thing.

354
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,220
The pyramid exists.

355
00:12:57,221 --> 00:12:58,330
There's a dominance hierarchy.

356
00:12:58,331 --> 00:12:59,830
Something climbs up to the top,

357
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:02,590
but it's not just at
the top of one pyramid.

358
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:04,570
It's at the top of all of them.

359
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,680
The thing that rises to the top at any
given pyramid is the same thing that can

360
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,120
dominate all pyramids.

361
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:15,430
It isn't good enough to be the
best at a dominance hierarchy.

362
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,600
What do you want to be is the best
at the set of all possible dominance

363
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:20,434
hierarchies,

364
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,330
right?

365
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:24,910
And that's the thing that's
gold at the top of the pyramid.

366
00:13:24,911 --> 00:13:25,960
And that's the eye.

367
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:27,640
That's what the Egyptians figured out.

368
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:28,570
And what does that mean?

369
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,310
It means the thing that puts
you at the top is attention,

370
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,050
pay attention,

371
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,370
keep your eyes open.

372
00:13:36,371 --> 00:13:37,840
It's not the same as thinking.

373
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,970
It's not the same thing.

374
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,920
It's like watching.

375
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:45,490
And the thing about human
beings is we can see,

376
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:50,530
we can see better than any other
creature except birds of prey.

377
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,750
And so our capacity to see is in
fact what we use in the world.

378
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,970
Our brains are actually
organized around vision.

379
00:13:57,971 --> 00:13:59,050
Unlike most animals,

380
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:00,640
their brains are organized around smell,

381
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,593
not us.

382
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,530
We can see we stand up,

383
00:14:03,531 --> 00:14:03,761
right?

384
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:08,020
So we can see a long distance and in
our ability to see is what saves us and

385
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,310
what saves our communities.

386
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:12,910
And that's what these stories
are trying to portray.

387
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:14,100
Hey,

388
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,621
you might say,

389
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:14,771
well,

390
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,480
why didn't people just say so?

391
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,090
And the answer to that is
because they didn't know

392
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,840
it took a long time to
figure it out forever.

393
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,270
It's taken forever to figure it out.

394
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,120
It's,

395
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,710
it's part of what I hoped
when I wrote this book.

396
00:14:32,711 --> 00:14:33,230
And,

397
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:36,880
and part of the reason that I'm teaching
it is because it seems to me that it

398
00:14:36,881 --> 00:14:41,320
would be useful for everyone to actually
understand this instead of just having

399
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:42,610
it told as a story.

400
00:14:42,611 --> 00:14:42,911
It's like,

401
00:14:42,911 --> 00:14:43,541
that's great,

402
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:43,870
man.

403
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,380
Yes,

404
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,280
you need the story,

405
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,980
but why not also just understand it.

406
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,673
So

407
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,280
muscle,

408
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,330
that's what we're trying to do.

409
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:55,950
We're trying to understand this

410
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:57,870
so.
