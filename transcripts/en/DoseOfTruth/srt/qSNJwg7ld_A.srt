1
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:08,420
I'm managing the homelessness.

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,310
Homeless people have schizophrenia.

3
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:17,630
Schizophrenia is a genetic disorder.

4
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:21,920
Nobody knows what the
Jews are or how they work,

5
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:24,470
but it's pretty clear
there's a genetic component.

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,990
If you can find the g,

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,030
figure out what they do and come
up with real good treatments.

8
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:37,031
If black shores for schizophrenia and
possibly preventions for schizophrenia,

9
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,970
that indirectly is going to help
alleviate the homeless problem.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:41,720
Right.

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:43,820
So I don't know what to
do about the homeless,

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:47,450
but if you can figure out what
to do about schizophrenia,

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,210
that's going to have some impact on that.

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:50,811
Yes.

15
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:51,591
It's basically,

16
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:51,831
yeah,

17
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:56,540
we'll use your claim to some degree is
that these more complex social problems

18
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:01,150
should be decomposed into isolatable
micro problems and its specific solutions

19
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:02,240
should be sought for them.

20
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:06,380
And now that's certainly strikes me as
an appropriate approach because everybody

21
00:01:06,381 --> 00:01:06,921
is different.

22
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:09,110
Not everyone is the same reason.

23
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:09,680
No,

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:09,891
no.

25
00:01:09,891 --> 00:01:10,730
Well that's for sure.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,820
That's for sure won't be on everyone's
port for the same route for the same

27
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,710
reason that any stretch
of the imagination.

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:16,971
That's right.

29
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:17,691
Poverty is,

30
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:18,650
doesn't have one,

31
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,240
because you know what,

32
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,143
these,

33
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:24,860
and it's not nearly caused
by lack of money either,

34
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:27,290
because that would be a much
easier problem to solve,

35
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:27,921
unfortunately.

36
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,970
It's not so simple.

37
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,760
So the one thing that we're
probably getting toward the end,

38
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:36,080
the one thing I would like to leave
your listeners with is really optimism.

39
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:41,260
These are not dismal problems in
perpetuity because the genetic approach,

40
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:43,363
I think,

41
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:43,921
and I,

42
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:45,020
I'm kinda out,

43
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:45,561
you know,

44
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm kind of out there on this.

45
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:48,590
This is not a mainstream view,

46
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,750
but I think the more something is generic,

47
00:01:50,751 --> 00:01:53,270
the more likely it is we
can change it for the good.

48
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,800
And that's why we just should
study the genetics of intelligence.

49
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:01,390
That's why I hope genes
have more to do with it.

50
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,450
That environment.
