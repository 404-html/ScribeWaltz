1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,900
You can tell me what you think about this,

2
00:00:07,901 --> 00:00:11,380
but this is a statistic that just
absolutely shocked and staggered me when I

3
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,300
went through the Intel
intelligence literature.

4
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:14,290
So you know,

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,760
it is illegal in the United States to
induct anybody who has an Iq of less than

6
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:23,440
83 and the reason for that is you know
that the American armed forces have been

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,680
conducting intelligence research
for like more than a hundred years.

8
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:30,310
And that was partly because they needed
a way of sorting people rapidly during

9
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:33,100
times of military
expansion during war time.

10
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:35,140
But it was also because I,

11
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:37,810
qts and especially in the
early part of the 20th century,

12
00:00:37,811 --> 00:00:39,210
were used to identify,

13
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:42,910
let's say the deserving poor who
could really benefit from additional

14
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:47,170
educational attainment and advancement
and the unit and the military was hoping

15
00:00:47,171 --> 00:00:52,171
to identify people from nor class strata
that could be a streamed into say,

16
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,530
officer training programs and so forth or,

17
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,330
or even skills training programs to,

18
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,650
to move people from the underclass into
at least the working class and may be

19
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:02,980
above.

20
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,080
So they had a bloody stake in this man.

21
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,210
They wanted to find people,

22
00:01:07,211 --> 00:01:11,110
they want it to sort them properly and
they wanted to do social good when they

23
00:01:11,111 --> 00:01:12,390
weren't just trying to win a war,

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,761
let's say,

25
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:15,250
which often also is a social good.

26
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,140
But what happened was that by,

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,390
I don't remember when this
legislation was introduced,

28
00:01:19,391 --> 00:01:19,901
but it wasn't,

29
00:01:19,901 --> 00:01:21,790
it was in the later part
of the 20th century,

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:27,360
but their basic finding was that by say
the 1980s they had determined that if

31
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,630
you had an Iq of less than 83 there was
not a damn thing that the unit that the

32
00:01:31,631 --> 00:01:32,291
army could do,

33
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:37,270
the armed forces could do to transform
you into someone who could do something

34
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:40,100
that was more productive
than non productive.

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,690
And at the thera terrible thing about
that is that it's about 10% of the

36
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:44,524
population.

37
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,010
And so you look at a statistic
like that and you think,

38
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,851
oh my God,

39
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:52,870
you've got this is this is enterprise,

40
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:55,780
this massive enterprise that's
chronically hungry for people.

41
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,351
It's right.

42
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:57,010
It's always,

43
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,270
they're always looking for people.

44
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,020
They're really oriented towards taking
people from the underclass and lower

45
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,730
working class and pushing them up.

46
00:02:03,731 --> 00:02:06,440
The societal strata and during wartime,

47
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:08,500
they're actually desperate
to bring in recruits,

48
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:09,250
period.

49
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,750
And their conclusion is that 10% of
the population can't be trained to do

50
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:14,584
anything,

51
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,790
anything sufficiently useful to
make them militarily operable.

52
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,110
It's just,

53
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:20,950
I just read out,

54
00:02:20,951 --> 00:02:22,000
my jaw just dropped.
