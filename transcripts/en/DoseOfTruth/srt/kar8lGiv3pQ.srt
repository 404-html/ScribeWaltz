1
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,690
When I just mentioned things like,

2
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,110
you know,

3
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:21,480
the greatest advancements in medicine,

4
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:22,261
technology,

5
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:23,094
science,

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,420
um,

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,860
basically human civilization has
complimented particularly white men.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:29,670
Uh,

9
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,580
I'm actually called a bigot and
a Nazi and all sorts of things.

10
00:00:32,581 --> 00:00:35,430
So I wonder if these
words now outright this,

11
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:40,431
that have no power and they're just
used against anyone who doesn't tow the

12
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,191
party line.

13
00:00:41,191 --> 00:00:41,440
Yeah,

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,310
well they're definitely,

15
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:44,220
while in the thing
about a thing about the,

16
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:44,910
the,

17
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:45,743
the,

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,020
let's say the disproportionate
contribution of European,

19
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,220
a small number of European
men over the last 600 years,

20
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:55,054
something like that.

21
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,390
Maybe you could go all the way back to
the Greeks if you're willing to call them

22
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:58,991
European,

23
00:00:58,991 --> 00:00:59,510
which,

24
00:00:59,510 --> 00:00:59,890
you know,

25
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:01,150
perhaps you could get away with.

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,410
Um,

27
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:02,890
it's a,

28
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,860
it's a drop in the ocean
by historical standards.

29
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:10,720
And of course now that the entire
world is linked together by,

30
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:15,340
by electronic communication and education
is available to far more people,

31
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:16,174
you see that,

32
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,303
um,

33
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,580
contributions to the world's knowledge
are being made at an incredible rate by

34
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,750
people all over the world.

35
00:01:22,751 --> 00:01:23,690
And so now again,

36
00:01:23,691 --> 00:01:25,960
it's a historical accident in some ways,

37
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,060
not precisely an accident,

38
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:30,670
but as historical accident.

39
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:35,910
Let's use that term that some of these
technologies for learning and discovery

40
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:38,770
happened to be established in Europe and,

41
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,420
and that gave Europeans of technological
advantage and also the opportunity to

42
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:46,360
contribute in a major
way to new disciplines.

43
00:01:46,361 --> 00:01:48,040
But that's being distributed.

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,041
Yeah.

45
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,540
Especially if you think origins,

46
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,340
like we have to give
credit where credit's due,

47
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:53,870
like the Aba Aviation,

48
00:01:53,871 --> 00:01:54,740
automobile,

49
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,933
uh,

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,170
many of the diseases cures like the origin
really did come from Mensa matter how

51
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:01,610
much feminist rant and rave.

52
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:04,040
There is just no denying this,

53
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:09,041
that human societies have
advanced tremendously because
of these achievements.

54
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,350
Yeah,

55
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:11,580
there is no doubt about that.

56
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:11,940
And then it's,

57
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,250
yeah.

58
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,230
And that it's a relatively small number
of people who've contributed immensely.

59
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:16,381
Well,

60
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:20,880
you see the same thing now you see the
same thing now that there's a handful of

61
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:23,400
remarkable inventors that,

62
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,850
that are literally changing
the world in front of our eyes.

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,120
And it is the case that it's often a very
small number of people who change the

64
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:33,690
world in that manner.

65
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,030
So

66
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:36,140
look at Mark Zuckerberg.

67
00:02:36,141 --> 00:02:36,411
I mean,

68
00:02:36,411 --> 00:02:39,440
I was reading like Facebook
is used by a billion people,

69
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:39,790
uh,

70
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,611
like a day,

71
00:02:40,611 --> 00:02:41,880
or I don't know if it was a day or,

72
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,180
it's crazy number of people.

73
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,100
Astonishing.

74
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:44,190
Yeah.
