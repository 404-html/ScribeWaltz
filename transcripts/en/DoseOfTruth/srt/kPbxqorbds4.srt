1
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,340
So,

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,701
okay,

3
00:00:07,701 --> 00:00:10,970
so about two months ago made these videos.

4
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:11,630
Um,

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:14,990
I did it because I was trying
to articulate my concerns.

6
00:00:14,991 --> 00:00:15,320
Um,

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:15,621
you know,

8
00:00:15,621 --> 00:00:18,830
sometimes when you're having a debate
or discussion with someone that you love

9
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:21,980
and you're having a little argument
about something like who's gonna do the

10
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,300
dishes or something like that.

11
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:23,690
Her,

12
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:26,480
especially if you haven't been getting
along very well with that person,

13
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:30,440
you know how the discussion starts with
something specific and then you start

14
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:34,220
trading all the things that it might
be about until you're arguing about,

15
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:34,551
you know,

16
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:37,370
the way that you behaved
on your third date,

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:37,671
you know,

18
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,510
10 years ago.

19
00:00:38,511 --> 00:00:43,511
And the whole underlying unresolved chaos
of your relationship emerges through

20
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:46,520
the little portal that was
defined by the argument,

21
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:46,960
you know,

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,091
well,

23
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:48,200
that's what this is about.

24
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,251
And when you talk,

25
00:00:49,251 --> 00:00:50,270
it doesn't mean you're right.

26
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,320
It doesn't mean you're correct,

27
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:51,500
right?

28
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,350
It means you're trying to articulate and
formulate your thoughts like the bone

29
00:00:54,351 --> 00:00:55,220
headed more on net.

30
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,030
You are,

31
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,420
and you're going to stumble around
idiotically because what the hell do you

32
00:00:59,421 --> 00:00:59,690
know?

33
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,840
You're full of biases and you're
ignorant and he can't speak very well and

34
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:06,500
you're over emotional and you know you've
got just problems that you can hardly

35
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:10,220
even imagine that are interfering with
your ability to state something clear.

36
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:14,060
And so what you do is you do your best
to say what you mean and then you listen

37
00:01:14,061 --> 00:01:16,670
to other people tell you why
you're a blithering idiot.

38
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:20,210
And hopefully you can correct yourself
to some degree as a consequence of

39
00:01:20,211 --> 00:01:20,871
listening to them.

40
00:01:20,871 --> 00:01:23,030
And you see that's what
free speech is about.

41
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:27,140
It isn't just that people can organize
themselves and their societies by

42
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:29,420
thinking you can't do that
because there's only one of you.

43
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,720
What do you have to do is you have to
articulate your thoughts in a public forum

44
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,200
so that other people can attack you
and hopefully in a corrective manner.

45
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,250
And then you want to,

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:37,821
you know,

47
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,140
step back a little bit and think,

48
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:39,471
okay,

49
00:01:39,471 --> 00:01:39,681
well,

50
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:39,981
you know,

51
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:42,500
I was a little arrogant there and I
was a little over emotional there and I

52
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:43,640
didn't get that quite right.

53
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:46,370
And maybe I'm outright
biased on that front.

54
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:47,050
And you,

55
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,570
you want to correct what you say because
then you correct how you are and then

56
00:01:50,571 --> 00:01:53,710
you correct how you act in life
and then you correct your society.

57
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:57,140
And to the degree that we limit
free freedom of expression,

58
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:58,400
we put all of that at risk.

59
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:01,280
And that's partly why I don't believe
that freedom of speech is just another

60
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:01,641
value.

61
00:02:01,641 --> 00:02:02,960
I think that's preposterous.

62
00:02:02,961 --> 00:02:04,250
I think that if you claim that,

63
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:08,150
then you know nothing about Western
civilization and history is freedom of

64
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:09,980
speech is not just another principle.

65
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:14,270
It's the mechanism by which we keep our
psyches and our society's organized and

66
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:19,250
we have to be unbelievably careful about
in infringing upon that because we're

67
00:02:19,251 --> 00:02:23,870
infringing upon the process by which
we keep chaos and order balanced.

68
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:29,200
The proper citizen is the person who
embodies truth in speech and attempts to

69
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:31,551
act it out.

70
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:35,000
And that also includes listening because
listening is part of communicative

71
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:35,834
intent.

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,030
And I think at the moment that we're in,

73
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,870
we're embroiled in a war on every single
one of those dimensions and several

74
00:02:41,871 --> 00:02:44,150
others that I haven't had time to list.

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,740
And the evidence that we're in that sort
of war is precisely the fact that this

76
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:50,300
has attracted so much attention.

77
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:50,511
I mean,

78
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:54,920
I just sat my bloody office at home and
threw up a couple of amateurish videos,

79
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,581
more or less,

80
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:59,320
attempting to articulate my feelings
about a couple of policies and it's all

81
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:01,060
hell broke loose and why?

82
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:01,661
Well,

83
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:04,960
because that hell is right
underneath the surface.

84
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,770
So I'm going to read you something that
a graduate students sent me from the

85
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,381
University of Toronto the other day.

86
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:16,381
And I can also tell you that I've received
hundreds of letters like this today.

87
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,040
I had a tutorial at the University of
Toronto where I talked about Jordan

88
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,290
Peterson and issues of personal identity,

89
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,600
legally sanctioned identity categories,

90
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:26,410
et cetera.

91
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,390
I brought up a video of a tall white man
in his thirties who asked students out

92
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,490
of university how they'd
react if he told them.

93
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,260
He identified as a woman,

94
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,423
as black,

95
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,580
as short and is five years old.

96
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,440
Spoiler alert.

97
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,400
Students in the video resists some
of the later categories a bit better,

98
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:46,450
mostly accepting.

99
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,920
Still students were not
engaging in discussion.

100
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,520
I asked them why one said it was because
she was worried to share her opinion

101
00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,460
for fear of being singled out
or saying something offensive.

102
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,970
I asked who else was not
speaking for that reason?

103
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:08,090
The whole class put their hands up.

104
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,820
No participation.

105
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,703
Why

106
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,020
they weren't uninterested.

107
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,170
They were afraid to speak their minds.

108
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,680
The PC police are in your heads.

109
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,470
I'll start with lawyer one who was the
counsel to several prime ministers.

110
00:04:27,471 --> 00:04:30,320
He talked to me about the human rights
tribunals cause I went and saw him two

111
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:31,700
weeks after this all started.

112
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:35,990
Human rights tribunals is a
kangaroo court in my opinion,

113
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,210
and it should be abolished
as fast as possible.

114
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,720
It's one of the many institutions in
Canada that pose a threat to your,

115
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,440
to your freedom that is almost
unimaginable proportions.

116
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:48,200
Here's what this top lawyer told me.

117
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:54,230
If I'm taking it in front of the human
rights tribunal and will cost me $250,000

118
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,800
I will pay the legal costs for
my opponents and I will lose.

119
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,571
He said,

120
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:02,870
go back to your safe little
life and shut your mouth.

121
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:04,920
Okay.

122
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:09,300
Second lawyer told me my critique of the
Ontario Human Rights Commission is spot

123
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:12,780
on and absent the charter
of rights and freedoms,

124
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,170
which has these contradictions built
into it that you just heard described.

125
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Much of what I was saying was illegal
and has been illegal since 2012 lawyer

126
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:25,470
three told me that if I
breached a tribunal order,

127
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:28,740
so imagine I was taken in front of the
human rights tribunal and I was fine and

128
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:30,600
then I refused to pay the fine,

129
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,220
which I've stated that I would do.

130
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,830
That equals contempt of court,

131
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:37,800
which inevitably means jail
until the contempt is purged.

132
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,420
The social justice tribunals and the SJWs
social justice warriors who staff them

133
00:05:42,421 --> 00:05:43,590
have a robe nature.

134
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,750
They can search your
house without a warrant.

135
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,730
They can use secret hearings.

136
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:50,820
There are no rules of evidence
and the judges are unaccountable,

137
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,650
but those are legal opinions.

138
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:52,891
Let's,

139
00:05:52,891 --> 00:05:54,210
let's look at a real world case.

140
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,190
Let's look at what happened
when I made my videos.

141
00:05:56,191 --> 00:06:00,110
Let's look at how the responded
because I can tell you in the video,

142
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:00,590
I said,

143
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:00,861
look,

144
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,960
what I'm doing is probably
illegal and worse.

145
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,050
My employer is legally responsible
for it because that's built in,

146
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,490
that's built into the codes as well.

147
00:06:07,491 --> 00:06:08,061
So by the way,

148
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:08,781
if you're an employer,

149
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:13,420
you're responsible for everything that
your employees say and everything that in

150
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,280
anybody interprets what
they said as being,

151
00:06:16,281 --> 00:06:18,740
whether it's unintentional or intentional,

152
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:20,690
whether or not a complaint has been made.

153
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,370
So just think about that.

154
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,181
Anyways,

155
00:06:23,181 --> 00:06:26,570
October 3rd the university said like
all members of the university community,

156
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:31,190
I have an obligation to comply with
the law including the provisions of the

157
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,760
Ontario Human Rights Code,

158
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,040
their policy with regards
to workplace harassment,

159
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:37,490
which the university implied that I
was engaging in engaging in a course of

160
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:42,020
vexatious comment or conduct where the
course of comment or conduct is known or

161
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,510
reasonably be known to be unwelcome.

162
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,170
The university reviewed my videos and
they decided that what I said was true.

163
00:06:48,171 --> 00:06:51,320
They decided that the video I made was
probably illegal and that they were

164
00:06:51,321 --> 00:06:52,250
responsible for it.

165
00:06:52,251 --> 00:06:56,420
And so in an attempt to
distance themselves from
me under counsel from their

166
00:06:56,421 --> 00:06:57,350
legal people,

167
00:06:57,351 --> 00:06:58,011
and believe me,

168
00:06:58,011 --> 00:06:59,840
the university has good legal people.

169
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,250
They sent me a warning,

170
00:07:01,251 --> 00:07:04,880
and this is what happens if you want
to discipline a recalcitrant employee.

171
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:05,571
Essentially what?

172
00:07:05,571 --> 00:07:08,540
So that you don't have to bear
legal responsibility for their acts.

173
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,600
So on October 18th the
university mentioned to me in
another warning letter that

174
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,550
if personal pronouns are being used,

175
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,950
the refusal to use the personal pronoun,

176
00:07:18,951 --> 00:07:22,010
that is an expression of the person's
gender identity can constitute

177
00:07:22,011 --> 00:07:22,880
discrimination.

178
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:27,330
So now you see what's happened is that
I haven't refused to use someone's

179
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,070
gender,

180
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:31,370
a gender neutral pronouns
I said that I would refuse.

181
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,910
So it's not even the refusal itself
that's producing the letters.

182
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,360
It's my declared intent
to engage in the refusal.

183
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,740
And as far as I was concerned,

184
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:43,010
what I was essentially doing
was criticizing a piece of
legislation that had not

185
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:43,910
yet been passed,

186
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:48,260
but the university's legal department
decided that all that was sufficient for

187
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:52,700
them to distance themselves from me
and to engage in disciplinary activity.

188
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:57,440
I would say a a legal
doctrine is something like
a virus and it has a life if

189
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,480
you output,

190
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,870
we think if you,

191
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,430
if you let it go into a living system
that it propagates and it has effects and

192
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:07,760
the effects are a consequence of the
philosophy that's embedded inside the law.

193
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,530
And if you really want to know about this,

194
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:12,680
you should read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
school leg archipelago because what he

195
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:16,730
does in that book is tell you how the
hypothetically humane doctrines that were

196
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:20,810
embedded in radical Marxism at the end
of the 18 hundreds unfolded into Soviet

197
00:08:20,811 --> 00:08:22,040
society and demolished it.

198
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,740
But I want to tell you a little
bit about what the law does.

199
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:28,490
And this is with regards to its
interpretation from the policy guidelines.

200
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:32,690
It instantiates social
constructionism into our legal system.

201
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,180
You have to understand what that means.

202
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,360
There's a huge debate about
how human identity is,

203
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,140
is,

204
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,471
is,

205
00:08:39,471 --> 00:08:40,060
um,

206
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,300
uh,

207
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,800
upon what grounds human
identity is predicated.

208
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,210
Now the radical social constructionists
basically say that identity is nothing

209
00:08:47,211 --> 00:08:50,600
but a social construction and not that's
in keeping with their philosophical

210
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:51,111
doctrines,

211
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:52,490
partly Marxist and Parsley,

212
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:53,600
partly postmodern.

213
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:54,823
But that isn't,

214
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,440
and that was what I was objecting to with
regards to bill [inaudible] because it

215
00:08:58,441 --> 00:08:59,310
insists,

216
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,480
do you understand this?

217
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:04,920
It makes this legal doctrine
that biological sex,

218
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,480
gender identity,

219
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:11,690
gender expression and sexual orientation
very independently and they don't.

220
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,570
Now the reason they don't
is because 98% of people,

221
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,640
it's 99.7% of people,

222
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,031
by the way,

223
00:09:21,031 --> 00:09:24,600
at least with regards to the most credible
statistics have a gender identity.

224
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:29,250
This essentially identical with their
biological sex and almost everybody who is

225
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:33,750
male and female by biological sex
and gender identity dresses that way.

226
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:36,120
And that's what it gender
expression essentially is.

227
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:39,480
And then if you stack those three
things on top of each other,

228
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,590
they're basically isomorphic.

229
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:45,360
You can add sexual orientation to that
and 98% of people are heterosexual.

230
00:09:45,361 --> 00:09:50,361
So the idea that those things very
independently is absolutely preposterous,

231
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,470
but it's written into the law and
that has terrible consequences.

232
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,430
You see,

233
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,241
I don't know,

234
00:09:57,241 --> 00:09:57,961
for example,

235
00:09:57,961 --> 00:09:59,580
now to what degree,

236
00:09:59,581 --> 00:10:03,030
any discussion in universities of the
biological differences between men and

237
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:04,830
women are legal and you think,

238
00:10:04,831 --> 00:10:04,951
oh,

239
00:10:04,951 --> 00:10:06,300
well that's an exaggeration.

240
00:10:06,301 --> 00:10:06,780
It's like,

241
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,320
well,

242
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:07,830
the,

243
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,690
I debated Nicholas Matte,

244
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,070
I believe that was his name of professor
at the University of Toronto on TV owes

245
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,913
the agenda.

246
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,420
And he said,

247
00:10:15,421 --> 00:10:19,800
write out for everyone to hear that the
scientific consensus is that there's no

248
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,900
biological differences
between men and women.

249
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,520
And I've received letters from people
who've told me that now the social justice

250
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,850
activist types are complaining about
the fact that the biologists assign

251
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:34,050
biological sex to animals because it's
only a social construct that we're

252
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,610
projecting onto their being.

253
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,900
And um,

254
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:37,171
you know,

255
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,700
we just heard that the co,

256
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,670
the chromosomal level
of analysis is complex.

257
00:10:41,671 --> 00:10:42,840
It's not that complex.

258
00:10:42,841 --> 00:10:47,841
What we have is a bi modal distribution
with a tiny number of exceptions in that

259
00:10:47,851 --> 00:10:48,301
by the way,

260
00:10:48,301 --> 00:10:49,560
is not a spectrum.

261
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:53,040
And one of the things that builds in for
example is the claim that identity is

262
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,780
only subjectively defined.

263
00:10:54,781 --> 00:10:55,830
And that's built right in.

264
00:10:55,831 --> 00:10:58,800
It says that your identity
is whatever you think it is.

265
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,071
Well,

266
00:10:59,071 --> 00:10:59,910
let me tell you,

267
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:01,440
as a practicing psychologist,

268
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,420
that's absolute rubbish.

269
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,120
Your identity to look when,

270
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,700
when children are two years old,

271
00:11:08,701 --> 00:11:09,870
that's what they think.

272
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,560
They think that their subjective reality
is everything and what you do is you

273
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:18,561
socialize them between the ages of two
and four to adopt an identity that's part

274
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,310
of a cultural negotiation.

275
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,860
It's like your identity as
part of a cultural negotiation.

276
00:11:22,861 --> 00:11:24,300
It's partly the game you play in.

277
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:28,560
Partly the game that I play with you and
I have to be a voluntary participant in

278
00:11:28,561 --> 00:11:29,880
that and not only,

279
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:32,400
not only is it not subjectively defined,

280
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,840
which detaches it entirely,

281
00:11:33,841 --> 00:11:34,291
by the way,

282
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:37,710
from the underlying biological and
the underlying objective reality,

283
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,820
making any claim you want for
your subjective identity valid.

284
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,440
The other thing it does,

285
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,810
it completely oblivious.

286
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:50,760
Hates the idea that identity is actually
a Prac pragmatic entity for God's sake.

287
00:11:50,761 --> 00:11:52,950
It's like if you're a lawyer
or a father or mother,

288
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,570
like an identity that
has some solidity to it,

289
00:11:56,380 --> 00:12:00,040
your identity is also a vehicle within
which you traveled through life,

290
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:00,221
right?

291
00:12:00,221 --> 00:12:01,240
It's a set of tools,

292
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,750
a set of pragmatic tools that you use
to interact with the social and the

293
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:05,620
natural world.

294
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:07,930
It's not only your subjective whim.

295
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,360
The idea of gender identity,

296
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,400
which is only defined subjectively in,

297
00:12:12,401 --> 00:12:12,671
in the,

298
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,150
in the relevant law has been studied
intensively by personality psychologist

299
00:12:16,151 --> 00:12:16,901
such as myself.

300
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:17,261
In fact,

301
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,370
my lab has done some of the,

302
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,740
I wouldn't say the most
fundamental research on it,

303
00:12:20,741 --> 00:12:21,221
but you know,

304
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,750
we're in the boat and
we're in the ballpark.

305
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,130
Here's a little story.

306
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,701
Okay.

307
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,870
So the,

308
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,200
the differences between personality
between men and women are basically what

309
00:12:29,201 --> 00:12:30,700
constitutes gender identity.

310
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,680
And in so far as it's
not merely subjective.

311
00:12:32,681 --> 00:12:36,190
And one of the things that's happened is
that as the Scandinavian countries have

312
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,610
equalize their political
and sociological landscape,

313
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:44,080
the differences in identity between
men and women have got larger,

314
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,100
not smaller.

315
00:12:45,101 --> 00:12:46,150
Do you understand that?

316
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:50,050
That's a refutation of the
social constructionist claim.

317
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,420
So what happens is,

318
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:54,370
is that if you flatten out the
landscape so that there are very few

319
00:12:54,371 --> 00:12:56,590
socioeconomic differences say,

320
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,440
or sociological differences in the
treatment between men and women,

321
00:12:59,441 --> 00:13:02,980
what happens is the biological
difference maximizes,

322
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,330
it maximizes you understand that means
men and women get more different,

323
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:08,200
not more the same.

324
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:10,240
And the thing about women in the audience,

325
00:13:10,241 --> 00:13:10,961
bloody hell,

326
00:13:10,961 --> 00:13:14,200
you should think about this because
don't you want to pursue the things that

327
00:13:14,201 --> 00:13:15,130
you're interested in?

328
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,250
And if you pursue the things that you're
interested in because you're interested

329
00:13:18,251 --> 00:13:19,480
in different things than men,

330
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,161
I'm telling you.

331
00:13:20,161 --> 00:13:21,760
And if you look at the interest,

332
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:24,010
if you look at the interest variation,

333
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,660
this has been established technically.

334
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:27,220
If you look at the interest variation,

335
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:29,350
there's almost no overlap
between men and women.

336
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:31,360
If you sum up the differences in interest,

337
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,440
interest in temperament.

338
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:34,773
Okay?

339
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:39,903
Okay.

340
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,980
Professor Peterson.

341
00:13:40,981 --> 00:13:41,910
Let's start with you.

342
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,151
Uh,

343
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,470
so this question says,

344
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,750
you present your issue with bill.

345
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:50,610
See 16 to be that the infringement of
freedom of expression regarding gender

346
00:13:50,611 --> 00:13:51,960
pronouns is the problem.

347
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:56,400
Do you hold the same stance with other
discriminatory language and the human

348
00:13:56,401 --> 00:14:00,980
rights code such as being
able to use racist terms,

349
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,230
uh,

350
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,760
with regard to students?

351
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:07,470
And if you believe that one of these
things is a violation but not the other

352
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:07,830
one.

353
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,490
Why?

354
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:10,200
I'm not sure I read that at all that well,

355
00:14:10,201 --> 00:14:11,250
but you get the idea.

356
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:11,881
Well,

357
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:12,714
first of all,

358
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,240
I don't think that these
issues are the same.

359
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,520
I don't think they're the same at all.

360
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:19,953
I mean,

361
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,180
I think being thinking
about the pronoun thing,

362
00:14:22,181 --> 00:14:22,451
you know,

363
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:26,140
because one of the things that people
put me back on my heels for a while

364
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:27,790
because the claim was basically,

365
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:30,680
well it's something like why doesn't
the mean professor just play nice and,

366
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,040
and respect people by
using their pronouns?

367
00:14:33,041 --> 00:14:36,790
And it took me like three weeks to unpack
that because who gets questioned about

368
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,481
Pronoun use?

369
00:14:37,481 --> 00:14:39,450
I don't know why the hell
I use the pronouns I use,

370
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,500
I use them because they're
part of the language I use.

371
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:41,921
He and she,

372
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,330
because that's what everyone uses.

373
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,950
And so then I had to think about,

374
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:45,700
well why,

375
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,500
why do we in fact use pronouns?

376
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:50,740
And we use them in part for the same
reason that we use other categories.

377
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,360
And that's to simplify the
world for functional purposes.

378
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:54,200
Roughly speaking.

379
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,670
But then I was thinking,

380
00:14:55,671 --> 00:14:56,060
well,

381
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:58,460
is the use of he and
she a mark of respect?

382
00:14:58,461 --> 00:14:59,690
And the answer to that is,

383
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,381
well no,

384
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:01,850
it's not a mark of respect.

385
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,210
It can't be a mark of risk.

386
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:07,310
What you call 4 billion people
can't be a mark of respect.

387
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,610
Right?

388
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:07,810
It's a,

389
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:11,450
it's a mark of basic categorization
and so then the claim comes up,

390
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:14,150
well if someone wants you
to use a particular Pronoun,

391
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,560
then you're disrespecting them.

392
00:15:15,561 --> 00:15:16,191
If you don't,

393
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:16,670
it's like,

394
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,030
hmm,

395
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,690
okay,

396
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:18,890
let's think that through a bit.

397
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,410
Well that assumes that when
I'm using he or she for,

398
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,580
for people and you know,

399
00:15:22,581 --> 00:15:25,790
in normal parlance that I'm actually
indicating my respect for them.

400
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,990
And that's not true.

401
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:27,651
It's like if,

402
00:15:27,651 --> 00:15:28,461
I don't know you,

403
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:33,350
iCloud is classify you generically and
basically I classify you in terms of how

404
00:15:33,351 --> 00:15:35,030
you present yourself publicly.

405
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:39,080
I suppose that's your gender expression
and then I nail you with whatever

406
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:40,340
pronoun seems to fit.

407
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:41,750
It has nothing to do with respect.

408
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:42,584
And besides that,

409
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,230
you bloody well don't
get to demand my respect.

410
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,340
Why should you?

411
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,121
You know,

412
00:15:47,121 --> 00:15:47,511
I mean,

413
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:49,190
it's not like I respect everyone.

414
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,540
That's a foolish thing to do.

415
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,670
You respect people who are respectable.

416
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,151
You know,

417
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:53,480
you,

418
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,230
you make value distinctions between
people and that doesn't mean you illegally

419
00:15:57,231 --> 00:15:58,580
discriminate against them.

420
00:15:58,581 --> 00:15:59,780
Those aren't the same thing,

421
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,780
but I'm all for value judgements,

422
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:04,970
so don't tell me that I'm not respecting
people and I don't use their gender

423
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:05,361
pronouns.

424
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:09,020
And the other thing is I don't buy
this whole idea that the people who are

425
00:16:09,021 --> 00:16:13,490
putting this legislation forward are
valid representatives of the Trans

426
00:16:13,491 --> 00:16:14,150
community.

427
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,680
That's what they say they are.

428
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,580
We have mechanisms for deciding whether
someone's a valid representative of a

429
00:16:19,581 --> 00:16:22,100
community and that generally
involves democratic voting.

430
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,810
I've received at least 20 letters from
transsexual people who are on my side and

431
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:27,261
by the way,

432
00:16:27,261 --> 00:16:28,580
zero from others,

433
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:29,420
believe it or not,

434
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,900
who are perfectly happy with
the idea of gendered pronouns.

435
00:16:32,901 --> 00:16:34,580
It's just they want to be the other one.

436
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,940
Now you can have a discussion about that
and there's lots of things to be said

437
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:38,301
about it,

438
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:41,930
but the idea that this community that's
coming out in these demanding these

439
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:46,190
rights is somehow representative of this
homogenous oppressed minority I think

440
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:48,660
is rubbish is professor Peterson,

441
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:49,320
sorry.

442
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,460
As a clinical psychologist refusing
to acknowledge how damaging it could

443
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:57,120
potentially be to an individual
to disregard their identity.

444
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:02,280
It's a very difficult question to even
engage with because I don't understand

445
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:02,880
it's,

446
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,960
I don't understand it.

447
00:17:03,961 --> 00:17:07,200
It makes things so simple that
you can discuss them properly.

448
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,400
All I do in my clinical practice and I
have about 20,000 hours of experience

449
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:15,360
with clinical in my clinical practice
and I've dealt with all sorts of people,

450
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:19,590
far more variation in people than the
typical person ever encounters and I think

451
00:17:19,591 --> 00:17:22,290
I've done it at least
reasonably competently.

452
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:26,190
All my discussions with people in my
clinical practice or about their identity

453
00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:29,040
given the definition of
identity that I brought forth,

454
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:30,420
how they feel about themselves,

455
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:33,000
how they conceptualize themselves
cause those are two different things.

456
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:36,570
How that plays out in their interactions
with other people and what the

457
00:17:36,571 --> 00:17:38,940
functional significance
of that is and I'm,

458
00:17:38,941 --> 00:17:40,470
I'm going to save forthrightly.

459
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,251
Well two things.

460
00:17:41,251 --> 00:17:45,390
One is that I don't believe that any of
my clients have had cause to worry about

461
00:17:45,391 --> 00:17:46,890
my interpretation of their identity.

462
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:50,070
Because what I do in my practice
is help them what that is.

463
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:50,790
I'm really,

464
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:55,140
I'm seriously not interested in imposing
any ideas of identity on to someone.

465
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,880
It's because I don't,

466
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,871
I can't do that.

467
00:17:57,871 --> 00:18:01,650
I don't know what the right vehicle
is for you to travel through life.

468
00:18:01,651 --> 00:18:03,720
What I can help you do is
articulate your concerns.

469
00:18:03,721 --> 00:18:06,440
I can ask you questions where I
see contradictions in yourself.

470
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:07,373
Articulation.

471
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,480
I can help you make plans for the future.

472
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,510
And I've helped thousands and thousands
and thousands of people by the way,

473
00:18:12,511 --> 00:18:14,940
make plans for the future with
the stuff that I do online.

474
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,940
And so I'm helping people
build a genuine identity.

475
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,033
Um,

476
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,321
well,

477
00:18:19,321 --> 00:18:20,190
and that's what I do.

478
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,830
So that's the answer to that question.

479
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:23,110
And,

480
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,150
and I think I do it well.

481
00:18:24,151 --> 00:18:24,730
I mean in,

482
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,810
in stuff we've done from a research
perspective with the future authoring

483
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:28,201
program,

484
00:18:28,201 --> 00:18:32,340
which I offered to people free a week and
a half ago to help them catalyze their

485
00:18:32,341 --> 00:18:33,174
identities.

486
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:38,330
We've helped 5,000 university students
increase their grade point average 20%

487
00:18:38,641 --> 00:18:40,830
and decrease their dropout by the same.

488
00:18:40,831 --> 00:18:43,290
And the biggest effect
has been with men and,

489
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:48,180
and on Western ethnic minority students
who've accelerated their performance up

490
00:18:48,181 --> 00:18:50,160
beyond the range of the normal for the,

491
00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:51,240
for the dominant culture,

492
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,130
a pure psychological intervention,

493
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:53,611
I might say,

494
00:18:53,611 --> 00:18:55,200
a not a sociological intervention.

495
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,940
So I'm perfectly willing to stack my
record on identity formulation up against

496
00:18:59,941 --> 00:19:00,331
anyone.

497
00:19:00,331 --> 00:19:01,350
So and so,

498
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:04,830
and I should also point out that I
think where I'm most vulnerable in this

499
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,560
entire debate and I expect
this will happen and you know,

500
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,710
there's already been noise about it on
the Ontario Psychological Association

501
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:11,430
website.

502
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:14,640
I think that they'll probably
come after my clinical license,

503
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:15,801
so that,

504
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:16,440
that'd be my,

505
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,340
that'd be my guess.

506
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,360
So.

507
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,050
So I think we might be straying a
little away from your question now.

508
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,710
So,

509
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:22,891
uh,

510
00:19:22,891 --> 00:19:23,430
just,

511
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,730
uh,

512
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,300
thank you.

513
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,080
Um,

514
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:25,690
so

515
00:19:25,690 --> 00:19:26,261
I don't know.

516
00:19:26,261 --> 00:19:28,510
We're doing because that's that question

517
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:31,120
question involved my clinical practice.

518
00:19:31,121 --> 00:19:35,260
I'm not straying a bit that involved my
clinical practice and there was a reason

519
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:38,000
that the question was
posed so I'm not straying.

520
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:39,963
Thank you.

521
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:43,570
Why

522
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:47,770
do you feel that someone's personal gender
identity and pronouns infringes your

523
00:19:47,771 --> 00:19:48,730
free speech?

524
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:53,800
Can one not also argue based on your
interpretation that professors can use

525
00:19:53,801 --> 00:19:55,780
racial slurs in their classroom,

526
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,260
um,

527
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,093
and the,

528
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,300
that the inability to do so would
violate their freedom of speech?

529
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:01,961
Well,

530
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:03,550
that's pretty much the same question.

531
00:20:03,551 --> 00:20:04,384
I think.

532
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,583
Um,

533
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,040
I think that we're crossing a dangerous
line and the line is the requirement

534
00:20:11,201 --> 00:20:15,610
that's being put upon people by government
agencies with the full force of the

535
00:20:15,611 --> 00:20:20,611
law behind them to decide what language
categories you're going to use.

536
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,450
When I opened this debate,

537
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,793
this forum,

538
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,713
um,

539
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:27,940
I tried to explain what this is about and
I couldn't explain everything and that

540
00:20:27,941 --> 00:20:28,331
it's about,

541
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:29,710
because it's about too many things.

542
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,460
But one of the things it's about is it
theology and the distinction between the

543
00:20:36,371 --> 00:20:38,020
left and the right and let's say no.

544
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:42,910
I truly believe that
these made up pronouns,

545
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:46,480
of which there are many dozens in fact,

546
00:20:46,481 --> 00:20:47,890
and there's no on them.

547
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:48,100
Yeah.

548
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,000
With just going to ask,

549
00:20:49,001 --> 00:20:54,001
if you could go back to the point about
the analogy between the racial slur and

550
00:20:54,641 --> 00:20:55,340
the take.

551
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,770
There's any analogy at all,

552
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,880
but that's just what difference here
I'm talking about compelled speech.

553
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,840
There's a difference between saying
that there's something you can't say and

554
00:21:04,841 --> 00:21:07,570
seeing that there are
things that you have to say,

555
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,180
and I regard these made up pronouns,

556
00:21:10,181 --> 00:21:15,181
all of them as the neologisms
of a radical PC authoritarians.

557
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,800
Do you understand that?

558
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:18,580
And I don't,

559
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,920
I'm not a fan of that sort of person.

560
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,730
And the reason I'm not a fan of that
sort of person is because I've done my

561
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:25,564
homework.

562
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:29,290
I've read everything I can get my hands
on in the development of authoritarian

563
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,340
political systems,

564
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:33,220
and I know the literature
inside out and backwards.

565
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:38,550
And I am not going to be a mouthpiece
for language that I detest.

566
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:40,260
Okay.

567
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:44,670
And that's [inaudible].
