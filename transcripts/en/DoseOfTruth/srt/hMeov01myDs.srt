1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,520
What do we do with our ego is helped us
climb the dominance hierarchy is secure

2
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:12,354
a mate.

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,840
Why then should we keep looking for a
mate and how to curtail that instinct?

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:17,281
Well,

5
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:20,970
I think part of the way that you curtail
that inks in state is that you have,

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,940
you have this sort of life that
you would have with a mate.

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,690
The question is what's the
purpose of pair bonding?

8
00:00:27,691 --> 00:00:31,410
And one of the fundamental purposes of
pair bonding while there's a couple one,

9
00:00:31,411 --> 00:00:36,060
is that it solves the sexual access
problem so that you don't have to continue

10
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:39,700
to obsess about who you're
going to be within and,

11
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:40,230
and,

12
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:40,800
and,

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,360
and where and how.

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,910
And so you can get on with
other elements of your life.

15
00:00:44,911 --> 00:00:46,150
But I mean with,

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,890
with your mate,

17
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:47,730
you have to decide,

18
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:47,940
well,

19
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,650
what does it mean that
you're now together?

20
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:50,671
You know,

21
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:50,971
you're there,

22
00:00:50,971 --> 00:00:52,500
there's companionship obviously,

23
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,930
and friendship and their shared interests.

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,280
You have to decide what they are.

25
00:00:56,281 --> 00:01:01,050
And I would say that you should continue
dating your partner at least once a

26
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:04,350
week or perhaps twice a week because
otherwise the romance goes out of your

27
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:05,070
life.

28
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:09,270
But then also you have to decide
about children and eventually about

29
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:12,990
grandchildren because you know you're
going to get old and you're going to get

30
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:17,370
older and more mature and children are
a huge part of life and they get a bad

31
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:17,760
rap,

32
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,190
which is really unfortunate
because you know,

33
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:21,203
maybe I'm,

34
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,770
I'm different in this regard.

35
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,210
Perhaps I am to some degree,

36
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:29,130
but I never regretted having kids for
even one second because there are so mean.

37
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,750
All of a sudden you have an intimate
relationship with new people that is as

38
00:01:33,751 --> 00:01:36,030
close as any relationship
that you've ever had.

39
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,350
You have the opportunity to make that
relationship as pristine as you possibly

40
00:01:40,351 --> 00:01:41,040
can.

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,231
I mean,

42
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:43,350
there can be a lot of
catastrophe involved in it,

43
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,190
but it's a great opportunity and there's
just nothing wrong with having some

44
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,690
additional people that love you,

45
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:49,500
you know?

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,500
And so what you do is you turn your
attention to the issues of maturity and

47
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:58,800
you're tuning your attention away
from the issues of being a juvenile.

48
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,760
And you do that partly by knowing
that it's actually better to do.

49
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,450
So.

50
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:03,661
You know,

51
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:06,750
there's nothing more absurd than
the 40 year old 20 year old.

52
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,990
It gets ugly and there's something like,

53
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:11,880
there's something like
spoiled milk about it.

54
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:16,881
It goes off and you have to gracefully
accept the challenges of each stage of

55
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:21,510
life and things work a lot
better when you do that much,

56
00:02:21,511 --> 00:02:22,021
much better.

57
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:23,100
And you also have to,

58
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,293
I would say,

59
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,040
work on and perfect your sex life with
your partner and express what you need

60
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:33,120
and want and teach each other what's
necessary to keep things exciting and,

61
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,050
and,

62
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:34,883
and new.

63
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:36,960
It's not an easy thing to do,

64
00:02:36,961 --> 00:02:40,980
but it's very much worthwhile because
then you can combine sexual excitement

65
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:44,580
with intimacy and there's no
better combination than that.

66
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,970
So I'd love that can all be a
nested up inside love and inside,

67
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:49,530
uh,

68
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:49,741
you know,

69
00:02:49,741 --> 00:02:53,490
a destiny that's intertwined together
and that's the best you've got man.

70
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:54,180
That that's,

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:54,720
that's,

72
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
that's what life has to offer.

73
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,743
And so,

74
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:58,863
um,

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,150
that's what you do is you accept the
responsibility of the next stage of life

76
00:03:03,151 --> 00:03:04,950
and you don't mourn the past.

77
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,530
I suppose that also means
that when you're young,

78
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:10,410
you do what young people do and so
that you don't want to do it again.
