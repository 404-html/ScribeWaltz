1
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,000
We are expecting our first eight,

2
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:09,631
Evan says,

3
00:00:09,631 --> 00:00:12,570
we are expecting our first
child in May a daughter.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:14,250
Any specific,

5
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,590
any advice specific to raising daughters?

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:17,371
Well,

7
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:18,600
congratulations first,

8
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,620
so that's great.

9
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:20,803
Um,

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:27,543
okay.

11
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:29,241
Let's see.

12
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:31,880
I'm just thinking about my
daughter and specific advice.

13
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,300
I would say don't be afraid to support
her masculine and feminine sides,

14
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,321
you know,

15
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:46,080
and so the feminine side is
you'll find little girls.

16
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:46,360
Now,

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,720
not all little girls because some
are more masculine than others,

18
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,640
but let's say you have a
more feminine little girl.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,550
She's going to like to dress up and
she's going to like to put on jewelry.

20
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,450
It's amazing how much of that stuff
seems to be implicit or a Nate,

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:57,991
you know,

22
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:59,400
and that can be really supported.

23
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,050
But then by the same token,

24
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:04,620
it's nice to wrestle with your little
girl kids and little kids really like

25
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,900
rough and tumble play into and to,

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:07,771
you know,

27
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:11,010
encourage her to be
courageous and forthright.

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,420
And so if you're lucky you can,

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,570
you can support her in both elements
of her personality and that would be a

30
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:16,530
really good thing to do.

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,723
So

32
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:20,681
don't let her wrap.

33
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,340
Are you around her little finger either?

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,520
That's another thing too.
