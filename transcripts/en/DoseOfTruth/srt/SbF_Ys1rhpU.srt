1
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,690
Do you have any guidance around
taking notes from books and lectures?

2
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:11,931
Yeah,

3
00:00:11,931 --> 00:00:12,141
yeah.

4
00:00:12,141 --> 00:00:12,974
No problem.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,910
Like don't be taking
notes during the lecture.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,773
Exactly.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,120
Because then you're not
listening to the lecture.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,900
It's like listen to the lecture
and then take notes afterwards.

9
00:00:23,901 --> 00:00:25,490
Now that doesn't work
for every discipline,

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:28,500
but it certainly works
for disciplines like it.

11
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,200
Students in my lectures,

12
00:00:30,201 --> 00:00:30,891
I always tell them,

13
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:33,650
don't take notes during the lecture.

14
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,270
Listen to the damn lecture.

15
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:39,320
You can take notes afterwards because
what that does is force you to practice

16
00:00:39,321 --> 00:00:42,680
remembering and then
with regards to books,

17
00:00:42,681 --> 00:00:43,730
it's like read,

18
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,370
don't highlight,

19
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,170
don't underline like that.

20
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,640
I think that that's just rubbish.

21
00:00:49,641 --> 00:00:50,900
I think it's pseudo work.

22
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:53,770
Read a couple of paragraphs
or maybe an essay,

23
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:54,621
something like that.

24
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:56,150
Depending on the density of the book.

25
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,350
Close the book.

26
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:58,333
Think about it.

27
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:00,140
Write down what you're thinking.

28
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:01,790
Write down what you remember but,

29
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:02,540
but,

30
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:07,460
but in the context of what you're thinking
about because that instantiates it

31
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:09,890
into your memory and
give and puts it at hand.

32
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,870
Like people ask me for example,

33
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,410
how it is that I can remember all the
things that I talk about extemporaneously

34
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:16,191
when I'm lecturing.

35
00:01:16,191 --> 00:01:20,000
And the reason for that is
because I've thought them through.

36
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:20,901
You know,

37
00:01:20,901 --> 00:01:21,980
I read them and I think,

38
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:22,221
oh,

39
00:01:22,221 --> 00:01:22,551
okay,

40
00:01:22,551 --> 00:01:24,260
well that's an interesting idea.

41
00:01:25,490 --> 00:01:27,950
How does it relate to all
these other ideas that I know?

42
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,730
Like what is it significance for this
idea and what's its significance for this

43
00:01:31,731 --> 00:01:34,370
idea and do I believe it
and how my dad criticize it.

44
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
So it's Kinda like I'm,

45
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,770
I'm attaching little
memory hooks to it in,

46
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,130
in five different ways.

47
00:01:40,131 --> 00:01:41,030
And then I've got it.

48
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:41,361
It's,

49
00:01:41,361 --> 00:01:45,950
it's part of me and that seems
to be part of recall rather than,

50
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:51,250
so rather than recognition and recall
is the spontaneous act of remembering

51
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,630
something complex.

52
00:01:53,631 --> 00:01:55,100
And when you recall something,

53
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:58,910
you're actually practicing remembering
it and that's what you need to do if you

54
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,140
want that to be part of you.

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,560
So I would say separate out the
function of reading and note taking.

56
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,980
So read,

57
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:07,993
think,

58
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,430
write or read,

59
00:02:10,431 --> 00:02:10,791
write,

60
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:11,480
think.

61
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:11,750
Nope.

62
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,550
Because the last two
things are quite similar,

63
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,990
but don't like read the book and then
read a sentence and then write down that

64
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:18,501
sentence.

65
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,550
That's not helpful.

66
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,560
You could read the sentence,

67
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,371
close the book,

68
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:25,310
and then reformulate the sentence
so that now it's your sentence,

69
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:25,581
man.

70
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:26,480
Then you'll remember it.

71
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:27,470
Then you'll understand it.

72
00:02:27,471 --> 00:02:28,460
That works really well.
