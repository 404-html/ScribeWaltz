1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,760
You once mentioned you were planning on
making an Iq test available alongside

2
00:00:10,761 --> 00:00:12,380
the big five aspects scale.
One,

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,180
is that in the works?
Yes,

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:18,140
we have an Iq test that we use for
business testing.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:20,930
Um,
although we haven't made it available

6
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:24,020
publicly yet.
It is in the works but not for a while

7
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:29,150
what we're doing instead.
And that's because it has to be while

8
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:33,430
there's a bunch of work we still have to
do on it to generate the report so that

9
00:00:33,431 --> 00:00:35,420
they're going to be truly usable to
people.

10
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:37,400
Now that I would say is about three or
four months.

11
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:39,920
Work is necessary to do that.
Um,

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,640
what we are doing right now with the big
five aspect scale though.

13
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:48,641
So that's how understand myself.com is
producing a dyad version.

14
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,920
And so we're working on the boyfriend
girlfriend version right now.

15
00:00:51,921 --> 00:00:55,910
So what that'll mean is that when you go
there and you do your personality test

16
00:00:55,911 --> 00:00:59,180
and your girlfriend say,
does her personality test that you'll

17
00:00:59,181 --> 00:01:04,181
both be able to generate a dual report
that describes the similarities and

18
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:08,960
differences between you and your partner
and where you're likely to see eye to

19
00:01:08,961 --> 00:01:12,290
eye on things where you're likely to
defer and what that's going to mean and

20
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:13,730
what you might want to do about it.

21
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,980
If you know what you might be able to do
about it.

22
00:01:15,981 --> 00:01:20,030
And this we're hoping this will be
really useful because temperamental

23
00:01:20,031 --> 00:01:23,630
differences are a lot of the reason that
people have a hard time getting along

24
00:01:23,631 --> 00:01:28,631
that and complete inability whatsoever
to state what they actually want and to

25
00:01:28,911 --> 00:01:30,830
negotiate.
Which is a completely different issue.

26
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,640
I want to build a program to help people
negotiate to at some point in the

27
00:01:34,641 --> 00:01:36,380
future.
That's part of our future plan,

28
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,230
but the next development plan is to.
Well,

29
00:01:39,231 --> 00:01:43,430
there's two of them is to get the high
school version of the cell phone program

30
00:01:43,431 --> 00:01:48,431
up and running and that my program or
keeps promising it in two weeks and I.

31
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,720
These things always take longer than
expected,

32
00:01:50,721 --> 00:01:55,430
but I'm sure we'll get it out in the
first quarter of 2018 and then also the

33
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,050
dyad version of the big five aspects
scale that should be out in the first

34
00:02:00,051 --> 00:02:01,850
quarter of 2018 as well.

35
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,630
And then I'm not sure if the Iq test
will be next on the development track.

36
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:08,630
See,
one of the things we'd like to do with

37
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:13,631
understand myself is to expand it out
into a career I'm planning process

38
00:02:16,971 --> 00:02:21,140
because look at it this way.
You know if you have an Iq of 100,

39
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:25,310
which is the average Iq,
so that would place you sort of in the

40
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,640
middle of the average high school class.
Being a lawyer is probably not a great

41
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:32,420
career choice for you unless you're
unbelievably conscientious because

42
00:02:32,421 --> 00:02:36,500
you're going to be competing with people
who have a verbal facility say and a

43
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,260
problem solving capacity that far
exceeds yours.

44
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,530
And you're going to have to work like
mad to just be reasonably competent.

45
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,620
And so what seems to be more logical is
to take a good look at your intellectual

46
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:57,221
prowess as given because it's very
powerfully biologically influenced and

47
00:02:57,771 --> 00:03:02,771
to pick a domain of,
of career that you could excel in

48
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:06,910
because why not pick a domain that you
can excel and there's lots of different

49
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:08,020
things that you can be.

50
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,990
And so you want to consult your
temperament.

51
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:13,120
So if you're agreeable,
then you probably want to work with

52
00:03:13,121 --> 00:03:14,440
people.
And if you're disagreeable,

53
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:16,750
you probably want to work with things.
And if you're extroverted,

54
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:19,900
you want to have a job that involves
sales and social activity.

55
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:21,700
And if you're introverted,
you want to work alone.

56
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,860
And if you're open,
you need to do something creative and

57
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:26,890
entrepreneurial and so on.
So you have to consult your temperament

58
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,980
to see where you would be properly
slotted.

59
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,790
And then you have to consider your
intelligence so that you can find a

60
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,870
niche where you're most likely to excel.
And those niches exists.

61
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:42,400
So we'd like to combine the Iq test with
the big five aspects scale.

62
00:03:42,401 --> 00:03:45,130
So that we can give people reasonable
career advice.

63
00:03:45,131 --> 00:03:49,750
It's been a longterm goal and so those
are all on the table and I have good

64
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,930
program team working on them,
but they're very complicated things and

65
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:55,870
they take a lot of time and we don't
want to make a mistake and all of that.

66
00:03:55,871 --> 00:03:58,510
So.
But maybe the couples version and the

67
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:02,190
high school version of the couple's
version of the personality test and the

68
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:05,980
high school version of the self
authoring in this quarter and maybe

69
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,460
maybe the career counseling version of
the big five aspects scale in the next

70
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,120
year.
That would be lovely.

71
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,300
That's probably overly optimistic for
the second part,

72
00:04:16,301 --> 00:04:16,510
but.
