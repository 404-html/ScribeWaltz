1
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,600
I have trouble regulating my emotions.

2
00:00:09,601 --> 00:00:13,830
I have a suspicion it's to do with the
fact that I'm 90 percentile and openness,

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,870
conscientiousness and neuroticism and
second percentile in agreeableness and

4
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:19,704
extroversion.

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,660
Any tips on dealing with that?

6
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:22,471
Yeah.

7
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:23,304
Well

8
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:28,230
if you're really high in openness and
you're really high in neuroticism,

9
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:29,790
that can be a rough combination.

10
00:00:29,791 --> 00:00:31,940
The conscientiousness should
actually help without,

11
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,110
although it might make
you a bit perfectionistic.

12
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,370
Um,

13
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,290
the problem with being high in openness,

14
00:00:37,291 --> 00:00:40,830
which is creativity and interest
in ideas and high in neuroticism,

15
00:00:40,831 --> 00:00:45,660
which is tendency towards anxiety and
emotional pain is that like open people

16
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:47,430
like to break open boxes,

17
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,000
conceptual boxes and see what's
inside like Pandora's box.

18
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:53,220
But people are high in neuroticism are,

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:58,370
are more likely to respond negatively
to complexity and uncertainty.

20
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:01,630
And if you're an open person and you're
always thinking up new things you,

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,550
you tend to

22
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,850
saw off the branch that you're sitting
on on a regular basis and that can be

23
00:01:08,851 --> 00:01:10,170
pretty destabilizing.

24
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,420
Any tips on dealing with that?

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:13,200
Well,

26
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,060
I would repeat what I said earlier.

27
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:20,120
I think that one of the things that
you do if you're high in anxiety is to

28
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,830
stabilize your sleep wake cycles.

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,840
So get up at the same time,

30
00:01:24,841 --> 00:01:27,030
go to bed at the same time
and eat at the same time.

31
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,650
Make sure that you eat breakfast and a
big breakfast too that's heavy on fat and

32
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:36,651
protein because if you're hungry
and then you stress yourself,

33
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,580
especially if you're high in neuroticism,

34
00:01:38,581 --> 00:01:40,470
you destabilize your,

35
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,250
your insulin production system and it
won't restabilize till you go to sleep

36
00:01:44,251 --> 00:01:44,551
again.

37
00:01:44,551 --> 00:01:47,220
So I would say like two things.

38
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:52,080
One is have a big breakfast and then
also if you're feeling particularly

39
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:52,501
anxious,

40
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,850
try eating something,

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,330
not carbohydrates and see
if that helps because you,

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:02,420
you might be somewhat
permanently dysregulated in
your insulin stress related

43
00:02:03,901 --> 00:02:04,860
insulin production.

44
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,150
That would be worth trying.

45
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:11,280
I would also say that you should shield
yourself to some degree from new sources

46
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:11,630
and,

47
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,470
and sources of bad news,

48
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,333
especially,

49
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,010
um,

50
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,480
cutout catastrophic news
because most of it isn't news.

51
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:21,360
It's the repetition of things
that we already know for well,

52
00:02:21,361 --> 00:02:24,360
and there's reason to
protect yourself from,

53
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,930
uh,

54
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,180
an onslaught of negative information,

55
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,340
especially when it's not
really necessary for you.

56
00:02:29,341 --> 00:02:29,760
I mean,

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,740
I don't think you should
bury your head in the sand,

58
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:35,310
but constant exposure to the
catastrophes of the world,

59
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:36,733
um,

60
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:41,670
especially when there's nothing that
you can do about those catastrophes even

61
00:02:41,671 --> 00:02:42,510
hypothetically,

62
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,060
is something that can
really destabilize people.

63
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:47,430
I often tell people in
my clinical practice,

64
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,210
um,

65
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,160
which isn't operating
right now by the way,

66
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,330
um,

67
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,350
to shield themselves from news
reports because it's just too much.

68
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:56,910
If you're depressed and anxious,

69
00:02:56,911 --> 00:02:58,560
it's just not something that you need.

70
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,680
It's not helpful to you.

71
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,460
Second percentile in
agreeableness and extroversion.

72
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,893
Well,

73
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,243
you know,

74
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:09,940
one of the things that you can do
if you're that low in agreeableness,

75
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,830
that shouldn't dysregulate your emotions,

76
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:14,470
but it might interfere with your
relationships with other people,

77
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:14,741
you know,

78
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:18,310
because you might be a
little bit harder to,

79
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:23,740
you might take other people's feelings
into consideration less than might be

80
00:03:23,741 --> 00:03:24,574
good for you.

81
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:28,600
One of the things that people who are
low in agreeableness can do is to try to

82
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:32,560
think of things they could do for other
people and make that a practice you

83
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:33,010
don't like.

84
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:38,010
Maybe once a week you could consciously
do someone a favor or give someone a

85
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:39,581
gift,

86
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,510
something like that.

87
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,800
And practice being,

88
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,143
um,

89
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,463
what would you call it?

90
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,000
Compassionate and polite,

91
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,163
you know,

92
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,260
that'll expand your personality
rather than transforming it.

93
00:03:50,261 --> 00:03:53,050
So then maybe you could have the
advantages of being disagreeable,

94
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,410
which means you're tough minded
and skeptical and competitive and,

95
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,280
and,

96
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,650
and those can all be really good things,

97
00:03:59,651 --> 00:04:02,410
but it would be nice to be able to
leave him out a little bit with some,

98
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,490
with the ability to take other people's
perspectives a bit more and to take them

99
00:04:06,491 --> 00:04:07,324
into account.

100
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:07,781
And then,

101
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:08,021
you know,

102
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:09,550
if your relationships improve,

103
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,010
that can also improve
your emotional stability.

104
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,450
Because one of the ways that people
regulate their anxiety is by having people

105
00:04:16,451 --> 00:04:17,920
around them that they get along with.

106
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:18,580
Because,

107
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:18,911
you know,

108
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:19,450
if you're,

109
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:20,530
if you upset people,

110
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:21,760
then they upset you.

111
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,950
And especially if you're
high in neuroticism and,

112
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,060
um,

113
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,700
that can increase your
anxiety and your pain.
