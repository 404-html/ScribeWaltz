1
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:09,460
I see.

2
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:13,280
Let's take a couple of questions from
the live chat zooming along here.

3
00:00:13,281 --> 00:00:14,114
So,

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,433
um,

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:21,450
how should one deal with recurring
self pity and why is it so gripping?

6
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:23,303
Well,

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,530
it can be gripping for
a variety of reasons.

8
00:00:25,531 --> 00:00:28,050
It can be gripping because you are,

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,920
let's see,

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,260
because you are high in neuroticism.

11
00:00:31,261 --> 00:00:32,340
That's a possibility.

12
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,623
And A,

13
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,110
and why is it so gripping?

14
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:38,251
Well,

15
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:39,610
that's another potential reason.

16
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,080
It's hard for me to say.

17
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,243
Um,

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,383
let's see.

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:44,223
I have a,

20
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,060
another chapter like that.

21
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,170
What's it called there?

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,153
Um,

23
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:52,711
yeah,

24
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:53,011
it again,

25
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:56,100
it's rural to treat yourself like
someone you were responsible for helping.

26
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:56,431
Well,

27
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,990
why the hell wouldn't you pity yourself?

28
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:58,261
I mean,

29
00:00:58,261 --> 00:00:59,094
people are,

30
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,150
life is tragic.

31
00:01:00,151 --> 00:01:01,350
Everything ends in death.

32
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:03,600
Everything that you have
will be taken away from you.

33
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,190
You're weak and breakable and prone to
fits of impulsivity and malevolence.

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,900
How could you not have self pity?

35
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:10,381
Well,

36
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:11,400
that's really the answer,

37
00:01:11,401 --> 00:01:11,940
but,

38
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,990
but the next answer is,

39
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:13,201
yeah,

40
00:01:13,201 --> 00:01:13,351
well,

41
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:14,011
despite that,

42
00:01:14,011 --> 00:01:14,910
it's not good enough.

43
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,960
You have to rise above all that even
though you have every reason for it.

44
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:22,830
That's the thing that's so paradoxical
is you have to rise above it even though

45
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:24,090
you have every reason for it.

46
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,210
And part of the reason you have to
rise above it is because if you don't,

47
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,440
it makes everything worse.

48
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:31,470
You and everything else and being itself.

49
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,310
And so it's gripping because well,

50
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,330
it does grip you,

51
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,253
you know,

52
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,230
malevolence and tragedy
and vulnerability and,

53
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,190
and mortality.

54
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,150
They're gripping.

55
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,261
And I would say,

56
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:43,441
well,

57
00:01:43,441 --> 00:01:45,900
you have to find something that's
even more gripping than that.

58
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:47,340
And I would say the most,

59
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:48,780
the thing that's most gripping,

60
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
the only thing that's more gripping
than that in true and truth,

61
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,970
is to live a good life,

62
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,610
to live the best life you possibly can,

63
00:01:56,611 --> 00:02:00,390
to live a life that's so noble that
all of those things are justifiable.

64
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:01,831
Yuri,

65
00:02:01,831 --> 00:02:03,270
l three 33 he says,

66
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,490
JP thinks he is a monster.

67
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,330
L U.

68
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,520
L I didn't know what l u l means,

69
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,590
but I don't actually think I'm a monster.

70
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,650
There's a difference between thinking
you're a monster and knowing you're a

71
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:14,220
monster.
