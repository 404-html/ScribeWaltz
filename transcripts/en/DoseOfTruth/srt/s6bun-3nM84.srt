1
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,640
A bunch of pensioners

2
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,190
anyways,

3
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:02,460
it's nice to be here and
thank you all for coming.

4
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:04,710
I guess there's lots of people out there.

5
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,270
Yeah,

6
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:06,500
there is.

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,020
It's very nice to be here.

8
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,750
Be the down south here
in Texas and Arizona.

9
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:14,090
That's.

10
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,000
It's been really good.

11
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,510
Very welcoming,

12
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,733
very friendly.

13
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,951
Nice hot.

14
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:19,784
The

15
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:24,910
water is liquid.

16
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:25,930
We're not comfortable.

17
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:30,730
Alright,

18
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,980
so I'm going to talk to you.

19
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:35,130
I think you broke the rules tonight.

20
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,450
Maybe get to more.

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:38,100
I want to concentrate on to.

22
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:43,101
I'm going to concentrate first
of all on rule 10 rules for cise

23
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:53,020
and I want to use that rule to develop,

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,733
I guess

25
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,420
as the centerpiece of a meditation on
the world because we don't perceive the

26
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:06,780
world the way we think
the proceeds the world.

27
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:11,830
It's a studied perception for a long
time from a biological perspective and if

28
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:18,900
you studied phenomenon from a biological
perspective and you have any sense,

29
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:22,140
you also studied them from
a philosophical perspective.

30
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,690
Philosophical perspective is what enables
you to develop the ideas that you've

31
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,190
tested if you're a scientist.

32
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:30,623
And so,

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,530
and I've learned all sorts of things
about the way that we perceive the world

34
00:02:34,531 --> 00:02:35,700
that I think are really useful.

35
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:36,534
They're reading,

36
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,340
they're really useful to know.

37
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,370
So I'm telling you a bunch of those
things tonight because I think it'll help

38
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:44,240
you understand well how you,

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,580
what your life and why you're like that.

40
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,130
It's a terrible thing to understand,

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:48,993
of course,

42
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,670
but I want to aim at something else too.

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,760
I want to craft the discussion so that
we can deeply investigate the answer to

44
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:02,864
the question,

45
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,810
what should you aim at?

46
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,300
Because you have to aim at something.

47
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,310
We're aiming creatures knots.

48
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,770
That's like rule number one of perception.

49
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:16,300
So I'm going to tell you the story
first about a very famous psychology

50
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:17,134
experiment,

51
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,020
which you can see online.

52
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,180
It was an experiment done

53
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,810
by Harvard psychologist who
was interested in perception.

54
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:32,290
He's interested in something
called changed blindness.

55
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:35,620
And here's how they experiment with.

56
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm sure many of you have seen it.

57
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:42,850
He videotape a group of six people,

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,190
three dressed in black and
three dressed in white,

59
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,250
videotape them in front of an elevator,

60
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,840
which wasn't really relevant,

61
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:54,310
but I'm just setting the stage for you
and the team dressed in black had a

62
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:59,020
basketball and the team dressed
in white out of basketball,

63
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,550
and they were playing a game.

64
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,300
The game was throw past the basketball,

65
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:08,950
not a very sophisticated game and the
black team would pass the basketball to

66
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:13,780
the to the teammates dressed in black
and the white team with trip pass the

67
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:15,370
basketball to their teammates,

68
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:16,601
trusted white,

69
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:21,601
and they would mill around in front of
the elevator and they filled the whole

70
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:22,240
frame.

71
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,590
They weren't distant.

72
00:04:23,591 --> 00:04:24,311
They weren't tiny.

73
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:27,210
Little people know a half
a football field away,

74
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:30,430
but they filled the whole frame so you
could see their facial features and

75
00:04:30,431 --> 00:04:33,250
everything and so your job,

76
00:04:33,251 --> 00:04:35,470
you'd come into Dan
Simons lab because the.

77
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,910
His name was Dan Simon.

78
00:04:36,911 --> 00:04:41,911
You come into Dan Simons lab and he'd
sit you down and you'd sit down and you

79
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:47,390
listen to him because that's
what we do in a psychology lab.

80
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:48,790
That's where thinking about too.

81
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,650
I'm just like,

82
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:51,760
when you come into the theater,

83
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:53,060
you point forward and the arts,

84
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,690
the stage you do with the room tells
you can do with the experimenter,

85
00:04:56,710 --> 00:04:57,543
tells you.

86
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,460
That's part of establishing your aim.

87
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,410
He said to the his experimental,

88
00:05:03,411 --> 00:05:06,820
participate participants
watch the white team.

89
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,010
They're going to throw a
basketball back and forth.

90
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:10,930
It's going to take about three minutes.

91
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,461
Oh yeah.

92
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:16,461
Africans count the number of times they
throw the basketball and so you think I

93
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:18,700
can do that,

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and you watch and you're
watching the basketball.

95
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,110
You're counting very carefully.

96
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:29,710
You're concentrating on the task of him
because you've been instructed to do

97
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:34,711
that and the video videotape runs until
the end and dance as how many times did

98
00:05:39,611 --> 00:05:41,890
the white team past the
basketball and you'd say,

99
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:43,150
16.

100
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:45,140
Dan says your excellent right?

101
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,140
When you think you're pretty damn smart.

102
00:05:47,141 --> 00:05:50,990
You went into a psychology lab that
you participate in the experiment,

103
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,480
counter the basketballs properly.

104
00:05:52,481 --> 00:05:54,310
It's like you're a credible human being.

105
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,850
No pointed,

106
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
and then Dan says,

107
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,281
what did you see?

108
00:06:01,281 --> 00:06:04,100
Anything out of the ordinary?

109
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,593
And you say,

110
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,081
well,

111
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:06,471
no.

112
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:07,011
What do you mean?

113
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:07,280
He said,

114
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,240
what did you see the
gorilla and you think,

115
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,321
what do you mean?

116
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:12,890
Did I?

117
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,570
Of course what gorilla?

118
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,690
Like if there was a gorilla gorilla,

119
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,120
I didn't see any damn gorilla,

120
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,430
and so Dan rewinds the tape and he says,

121
00:06:22,431 --> 00:06:22,641
look,

122
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:24,410
don't count the damn basketball system.

123
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,130
He didn't say that.

124
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,401
He said,

125
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:25,940
don't do that.

126
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,773
Awesome.

127
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,730
Don't count the basketball this time.

128
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:32,070
Just watched the film.

129
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,500
So you watch it and sure enough
like minute into the film,

130
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:38,640
this guy comes out.

131
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,070
It's not a real gorilla
that's close enough.

132
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,690
He's like six foot four.

133
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,560
He's got a gorilla suit on.

134
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:49,610
It's the full thing and he stands right
in the middle of the video and pounds

135
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:55,221
his chest for like five seconds and then
Saundra's off about 50 percent of the

136
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:57,960
people who saw the video.

137
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,870
Sixty percent of the people
didn't see the gorilla.

138
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,653
You think,

139
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,181
no,

140
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:04,110
I'd see the gorilla.

141
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,441
It's like,

142
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:04,651
no,

143
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:05,190
you wouldn't.

144
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,150
Not necessarily.

145
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:07,170
I'm a graduate student.

146
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:11,680
I showed that video to and then I showed
it to him a year later he missed the

147
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,170
damn grill and the second time

148
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,640
really?

149
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,300
And so and so,

150
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,290
and you think,

151
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:20,680
no,

152
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,820
there's no way on that one.

153
00:07:21,821 --> 00:07:22,121
It's like,

154
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:22,954
yes you are.

155
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,920
You're so blind.

156
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,600
You cannot in bloody will imagine.

157
00:07:25,601 --> 00:07:30,601
It is absolute miracle that you just
don't wash my face first in the walls all

158
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:31,684
the time.

159
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,950
Actually you do.

160
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,220
Life hurts because you do,

161
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,090
you don't see very well and you do walk
face first into things all the time.

162
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:42,280
Maybe not literal walls,

163
00:07:42,281 --> 00:07:45,940
but certainly metaphorical ones and that's
often because you don't see what's in

164
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:49,180
front of you and it's because
you're looking at the wrong thing.

165
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,220
And so what was so cool about that?

166
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:56,221
Experiments that insanely
cool psychologists up to
that point thought that while

167
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,170
we thought a lot of things and a lot,

168
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,730
not just psychologists on two,

169
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:01,390
we saw,

170
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:05,260
we thought it was easy to see the world
that was kind of disproved back in the

171
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:10,240
early sixties when people were trying to
build machines that can operate in the

172
00:08:10,241 --> 00:08:12,930
world like people knew
trying to solve the problem.

173
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Machine perception.

174
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:14,700
You know,

175
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,391
we just thought,

176
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:15,821
well look,

177
00:08:15,821 --> 00:08:17,380
there's objects right there.

178
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:18,460
It's pretty self evident.

179
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,630
You just see it.

180
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:19,721
Well,

181
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:20,680
you know how it easy it is.

182
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:23,290
All you have to do to see
that object is look at it.

183
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,340
There it is.

184
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,290
It's not a problem.

185
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,070
It's.

186
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,240
There's nothing magical about it.

187
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:28,571
It's like,

188
00:08:28,571 --> 00:08:28,721
yeah,

189
00:08:28,721 --> 00:08:30,160
you turned to build a machine that did.

190
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:35,161
Does that you find out that perceiving
separate law objects is so difficult that

191
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,180
it actually looks impossible.

192
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:39,040
It isn't obvious at all how we do it,

193
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:43,090
not in the least and that's why it's
so difficult to to build machines.

194
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:45,130
That's why we don't
have ambulatory robots.

195
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:46,000
Busing tables,

196
00:08:46,001 --> 00:08:46,834
for example.

197
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,870
It's very hard to to see the world and
so and then psychologists will even when

198
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:55,440
they figured out that it
was hard to see world,

199
00:08:55,441 --> 00:09:00,441
they still thought that you would perceive
abnormals abnormalities in the world

200
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:01,740
that you would perceive the normally.

201
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,030
So if something strange happened,

202
00:09:03,031 --> 00:09:05,010
you'd focus your attention
on it right away.

203
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,780
It turns out that's not true.

204
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,260
No,

205
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:11,460
you can watch a video of six people
throwing the basketball back and forth to

206
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:16,110
teams of three and a gorilla could come
out right in the middle of that and you

207
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:17,010
will notice it.

208
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:17,700
It's like,

209
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:17,791
well,

210
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,080
what is going on there?

211
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:20,190
Why won't you notice that?

212
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,461
What?

213
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,000
Why?

214
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,730
Why did you see that and
what did he answered?

215
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,720
One of the answers is because you were
looking at something else and so then the

216
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,650
question arises.

217
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:28,980
It's like,

218
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,070
what are you missing when you're looking
at what you think is important because

219
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,310
you come into the lounge
and the psychologist says,

220
00:09:35,311 --> 00:09:35,491
well,

221
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,970
the important thing to do here is to
count the basketballs and you just fall

222
00:09:38,971 --> 00:09:41,640
into that because while you're
there to participate era,

223
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:42,720
cooperative personnel,

224
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,750
that you swallow the story immediately
and what's so interesting about the fact

225
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,330
that you sold the story is that
as soon as you swallow the story,

226
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,650
you listened to the experiment,

227
00:09:52,651 --> 00:09:54,030
but you play out the game.

228
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,630
Then you immediately know adopting
a particular cognitive perception,

229
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,840
not thought it's below thought.

230
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,490
It's actually what you see.

231
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:07,550
You adopt this particular
sort of perception and then
the world manifests itself

232
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:09,810
to you in one way and not another,

233
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:14,250
and it isn't necessarily the way that
you would think and it makes this

234
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:14,731
question.

235
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:15,564
It's like,

236
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:18,600
what are you missing when you're
aiming at what you're aiming at,

237
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,940
and that's what that is.

238
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,680
You might be missing almost everything.

239
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,300
That's what it looks like.

240
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,060
So Simon did another experiment.

241
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,100
This was even more amazing experiments.

242
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,970
He did this in Harvard Yard and there's
lots of tourists in Harvard Yard.

243
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:33,990
It's a place where people go.

244
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:35,460
It's a very cool place actually.

245
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:37,910
And,

246
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,700
and there's undergraduate smelly all
around him in Harvard Yard with the

247
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:43,920
tourists because it's a university.

248
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,580
And so what Simon did
was he was wondering,

249
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:47,701
well,

250
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:49,220
just how blind people are,

251
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,460
how blind people.

252
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,950
They won't see a gorilla when
it's right in front of them.

253
00:10:52,951 --> 00:10:53,790
That's pretty blind.

254
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,390
Let's try another trigger.

255
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:01,550
So what he did was he sent
out undergraduates to ask
tourists for directions

256
00:11:01,591 --> 00:11:02,580
with a map.

257
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,670
So imagine tourists to standing here.

258
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,590
Undergraduate is standing here,

259
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,420
undergraduate has map asks tourist where,

260
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,180
where,

261
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,920
where things are in the article.

262
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:14,641
Okay,

263
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,950
so person standing here versus down here.

264
00:11:16,951 --> 00:11:17,620
Now some work.

265
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:22,620
We would come by two of them and
they're carrying that door like this.

266
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,040
And they hear the door and they routinely
walk right between the tourist and the

267
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:29,400
undergraduate,

268
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,480
walk right between them.

269
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,430
And then as the undergraduate
is blocked from the tour view,

270
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,200
the undergraduate grabs,

271
00:11:37,201 --> 00:11:38,040
the door,

272
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,600
keeps on walking,

273
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:45,020
and one of the people that was holding
the door grabs it and starts talking to

274
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,290
the tourists.

275
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:51,830
So Dan figured out how to swap the person
and about 60 percent of the people who

276
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,300
were giving you extra stuff.

277
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:59,300
The undergraduate didn't notice that
they were talking to a different person.

278
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:00,020
It's like,

279
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,970
so what does that imply?

280
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:03,820
It implies that like you're out there in
the world talking to people and they're

281
00:12:03,821 --> 00:12:07,360
just shifting into different people right
in front of you you don't even notice.

282
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:12,310
And then he did it in a
like a convenience store.

283
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:16,480
And so he would have people come in
and interact with the convenience store

284
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:20,110
owner and the convenience store owner
were ducked down behind the counter to

285
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,750
grab something and then a
different person would pop up.

286
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,303
Again.

287
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,810
More than half of the people didn't
notice that it was a different person.

288
00:12:28,811 --> 00:12:33,370
That was even if they were wearing
different colored clothing and you think,

289
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:33,521
well,

290
00:12:33,521 --> 00:12:34,450
what does this mean?

291
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,470
What does this,

292
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,820
what does this mean?

293
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,730
It means that you don't
see any more of the world.

294
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:42,970
Then you need to see in order
to get what you're aiming at.

295
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,100
That's what it means.

296
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,690
It really,

297
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,740
really literally means that
you actually don't see it.

298
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,200
It's not that you don't remember it.

299
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,950
It's not that you don't think about it.

300
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:58,110
It's that you're physically
incapable of seeing,

301
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,140
and this experiment has
been replicated in many,

302
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:02,974
many ways.

303
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,390
If I took you out of the room one by one
out of the room that you're sitting in

304
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:07,781
and I said,

305
00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:07,871
well,

306
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,070
what color was the floor?

307
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,930
Because can't tell right
now because it's dark,

308
00:13:10,931 --> 00:13:11,591
but it wasn't dark.

309
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:12,670
When you came in here,

310
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,570
you wouldn't remember what color the
Flores and the reason for that is,

311
00:13:16,571 --> 00:13:18,130
you actually don't care.

312
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,640
What do you care about
with regards to a floor?

313
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:22,790
Well,

314
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,700
mostly you care that it doesn't move.

315
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:27,070
You don't want the floor to move.

316
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,960
That's a bad thing and so
as long as it doesn't move,

317
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:36,310
you don't have to perceive it
and that's sort of the rule.

318
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:38,710
And why don't you want the Florida move?

319
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,053
Well,

320
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,820
what does it signify if the floor moves?

321
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:47,020
Well probably signifies that maybe there's
an earthquake and that's a bad thing.

322
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,160
That's a seriously bad thing.

323
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,220
I was in a hotel once
and I was looking at.

324
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:53,380
This was a scientific convention.

325
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:54,520
I was looking at this.

326
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,100
It's kind of like an advertisement
for a scientific paper.

327
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:58,120
They're called posters.

328
00:13:58,530 --> 00:13:59,630
They're little advert there.

329
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:04,480
Advertisements for scientific papers
and you put yours up on this like wall

330
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,730
board room divider.

331
00:14:06,731 --> 00:14:11,731
Basically dependent upon people come by
and ask questions about your experiment

332
00:14:12,341 --> 00:14:14,560
and all of a sudden I fell over.

333
00:14:14,561 --> 00:14:18,450
I was knocked off balance and the reason
I was balances because the wall beside

334
00:14:18,451 --> 00:14:18,881
me moved.

335
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:21,250
It was a big hotel and the wool move.

336
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,130
You do not expect that.

337
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,930
Do not expect that a move toward a bath.

338
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:26,381
Well,

339
00:14:26,381 --> 00:14:30,010
it turned out that they
have movable wall who knew?

340
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:30,551
Right.

341
00:14:30,551 --> 00:14:33,100
But it was one of these
dividable rooms and so.

342
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,880
But it took me off guard so badly
that it just about knocked me over,

343
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,290
but normally I wouldn't even.

344
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:39,910
I was already at myself in the room.

345
00:14:39,911 --> 00:14:40,810
Normally I wouldn't even.

346
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,040
I wouldn't even pay attention.

347
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,710
You don't pay attention to anything
that doesn't get in your way.

348
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,590
Now that's an interesting thing.

349
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:52,770
That's an interesting thing because you
see the question is what do you see when

350
00:14:53,181 --> 00:14:53,921
you look at the world?

351
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:54,754
Right?

352
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,813
Okay,

353
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,750
now we're going to take this apart
because it's unbelievably important this.

354
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,143
So

355
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,370
when you're watching the basketballs,

356
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,500
you use the central point of your
vision to process the visual field.

357
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,300
Now you can.

358
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,670
You can kind of detect this yourself.

359
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:22,671
Like if I look at this gentleman in the
front row and I looked at his eyes and I

360
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:25,390
can see his eyes and I
can see his face in it,

361
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:27,060
quite high resolution,

362
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,920
but if I look at him and I pay attention
to the people to assign from looking at

363
00:15:31,921 --> 00:15:32,550
them,

364
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,450
what I notice is that the farther out
of the center of my seal division,

365
00:15:36,451 --> 00:15:37,320
those people become,

366
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:38,520
the less I can really see them.

367
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:40,860
Like I'm pointing at a woman,

368
00:15:40,861 --> 00:15:41,640
I think here,

369
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,190
I can't tell because I'm looking
at the guy right in front of me.

370
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,930
I think she's dressed in red,

371
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,690
but I can't see you there.

372
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:49,830
I know you're a human being,

373
00:15:49,831 --> 00:15:54,831
but I can't see your face and you people
over there basically just blurs and I

374
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:56,070
know that you're there,

375
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,520
but of course when I point I want
to look because then I can see you,

376
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,140
but looking at you and you,

377
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,370
you guys are low resolution.

378
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,390
You're like simpsons characters except
you're in the black and white and I can't

379
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:07,224
even tell that.

380
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,370
It's just so.

381
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,350
Even in the periphery of your vision,

382
00:16:10,351 --> 00:16:11,280
things are black and white.

383
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,750
You can't tell that,

384
00:16:12,751 --> 00:16:17,160
but that's the case and mostly over in
the periphery you don't see things unless

385
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:17,850
they move.

386
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:21,410
You know how in Jurassic Park dinosaurs
didn't see anything and listen,

387
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:22,231
well,

388
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,110
that's what your vision is like in the
periphery because you don't have much

389
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:26,100
brain power over there.

390
00:16:26,101 --> 00:16:26,731
In the periphery,

391
00:16:26,731 --> 00:16:27,310
you can.

392
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,530
You're not that up and so the way
that your brain is that essentially

393
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,680
compensates for your lack of visual Cortex
is by only allowing you to see things

394
00:16:36,841 --> 00:16:37,620
that move,

395
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,341
something moves in,

396
00:16:38,341 --> 00:16:40,320
periphery Gloria towards
it and look at it,

397
00:16:40,321 --> 00:16:40,861
and then you think,

398
00:16:40,861 --> 00:16:41,011
well,

399
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:41,980
I saw that all along.

400
00:16:41,981 --> 00:16:42,970
It's he did.

401
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,610
You saw a brief flash of movement.

402
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,370
You actually use different
parts of your brain process,

403
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:48,780
different parts of your visual field.

404
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,453
So anyways,

405
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:51,631
when you're.

406
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:52,770
When you're looking at the basketball,

407
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,613
I think,

408
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:53,821
okay,

409
00:16:53,821 --> 00:16:54,720
what is it exactly?

410
00:16:54,721 --> 00:16:58,650
What exactly is going on when you're
looking at that basketball and that

411
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,430
experimenter?

412
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:00,450
Well first of all,

413
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:04,020
you're playing the role
because the role is experiment,

414
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:09,050
experiment the subject and it's a
little drama and the drama and the

415
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,340
experimenter to when the experimenter is
basically the costs where you treat him

416
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,990
or her like a higher status private.

417
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:22,460
Your job is to listen to them and to take
instructions and that's essentially to

418
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:23,010
a dog.

419
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:27,300
The story were the role that they tell
you to play and you'll do that because

420
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,890
when you volunteered for the experiment,

421
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:30,990
you're already in for that experience.

422
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,400
Just exactly as I said,

423
00:17:32,401 --> 00:17:36,180
just as all of you in some
sense volunteered to come
here and you do what the

424
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,450
route tells you.

425
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:41,490
The room is set up so that the seats
face this way and so you come in here and

426
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:42,600
you obey the room.

427
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,890
You see this way and it was a focal point
and the focal point is this stage and

428
00:17:46,891 --> 00:17:51,891
then room implies that what's is going
to take place on the stage and you're

429
00:17:52,171 --> 00:17:53,190
here for that experience,

430
00:17:53,191 --> 00:17:58,191
so you focus on me at the moment and
hopefully the deal is that I tell you

431
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,350
things that are interesting because
that's what the room is set up to allow to

432
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,130
happen and so all of that shapes
your perceptions in a very,

433
00:18:06,131 --> 00:18:06,964
very direct way.

434
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:10,800
And when you go into this lab and Dan
tells you to sit down and count the

435
00:18:10,801 --> 00:18:11,700
basketballs,

436
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,860
your experimental subject,

437
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:15,570
you're civilized human being.

438
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,070
You're obedient person.

439
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,660
You're a good sport.

440
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,550
He's the authority figure.

441
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,630
The context of the university is
set up to sort of hammer that home.

442
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,020
You're not going to tell them to go to
hell and when he asks you to watch the

443
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,100
basketball,

444
00:18:29,101 --> 00:18:31,050
unless you're unbelievably antisocial,

445
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:32,370
you're not going to do that.

446
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:37,550
So it's a drama that you're undertaking
and he offers you a value system.

447
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:41,520
And the value system is something
like if you're a good person,

448
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,300
you follow instructions when the system
is set up so that following instructions

449
00:18:47,581 --> 00:18:51,840
is the civilized thing to do
and to act out that stability.

450
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:56,870
You sit in that chair and I give you a
set of stage instructions about how you

451
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:02,820
should act and then you act them
out and you agree to do that.

452
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,380
And then that establishes your
perceptual set and that determines what's

453
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,340
important in the world and that determines
what manifests itself in the world.

454
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,320
And so then you count the
basketballs even though,

455
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:15,210
why the hell are you counting basketballs?

456
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,150
There's no particular reason
except we want to do a good job.

457
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,500
And because of that you miss what's vital.

458
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,050
So that's the extended version of the,

459
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,070
of the,

460
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,910
of the narrative.

461
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:33,510
So now if the griller would've jumped
up and swipe the ball and you were

462
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,344
counting it,

463
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,030
you would have seen it.

464
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,150
If things get in your
way that you see them.

465
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,000
So then let's figure out what you see.

466
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,970
So when I look at someone,

467
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:46,830
again personal in the front row,

468
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,480
I generally look at their face and we
generally look at other people's spaces

469
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:52,320
when we talked to them.

470
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,170
And we're very good at facial
recognition by the way.

471
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,720
You have specialized brain areas for,

472
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,730
for recognizing faces and faces,

473
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,760
broadcast emotion and intent and like
your face is like a video screen important

474
00:20:05,131 --> 00:20:09,210
which emotions play and you want to
pay attention to someone's emotions and

475
00:20:09,211 --> 00:20:12,750
motivational states and you can see them
broadcast them on their face because

476
00:20:12,751 --> 00:20:15,750
then you know what they're up to and you
want to know what they're up to because

477
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:20,490
God only knows what they're up to and you
want to make sure that what they're up

478
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:23,490
to is something that you would want
them to be up to when you're around.

479
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,420
So you're watching their face and
what you really want is their eyes.

480
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,060
And here's something really
cool about human eyes.

481
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,770
So you know,

482
00:20:31,771 --> 00:20:34,620
we have whites around our hooks,

483
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:35,010
right?

484
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,750
And the whites are white,

485
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,580
hence their name,

486
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,930
the whites of the eyes,

487
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:44,250
but like lots of the animals that were
closely related to don't have lights like

488
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:45,084
that.

489
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,800
So gorillas don't for example,

490
00:20:46,801 --> 00:20:51,310
but beings really do like our iris
is really stand out against the white

491
00:20:51,311 --> 00:20:53,650
background and there's a reason for that.

492
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:57,400
And the reason for that is what we really
want to see when we look at someone

493
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,240
else's,

494
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,020
what the hell are they
pointing their eyes out?

495
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:02,650
And so there's a famous
social psychology experiment,

496
00:21:02,651 --> 00:21:06,940
which is really a comical one where
someone stands on the corner of a street,

497
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,230
just looks up like this and if you just,

498
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,021
you can do this,

499
00:21:11,021 --> 00:21:11,500
you can be.

500
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:16,390
The scientist is go out on the street
going the corner and just look up and soon

501
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:19,950
someone will come by and they'll look
at you and you will look at them.

502
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:21,940
That's part of the trick.

503
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,260
You won't look at them and they'll say,

504
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:25,390
well,

505
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,510
I'm pretty important and
that person is looking at me.

506
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,591
And so whatever.

507
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:32,140
What that means is that whatever
they're looking at must be important,

508
00:21:32,141 --> 00:21:33,550
more important than me,

509
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,440
and that must mean it's pretty important,

510
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:36,960
so I better look Joe,

511
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:41,020
so then someone will join
you and look up as well,

512
00:21:41,021 --> 00:21:43,180
and they were trying to figure
out what you're looking at,

513
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:47,110
but then of course there's two of you
looking out there and that's kind of

514
00:21:47,111 --> 00:21:50,800
abnormal behavior on the street and so
then the third person comes along and

515
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,700
there's two people standing on the street
looking so you better know and so then

516
00:21:54,701 --> 00:21:57,730
there's three p and you can soon you
can get a crowd of people looking,

517
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,900
which is actually a good thing
to do in a metaphysical sense.

518
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,770
This crowd of people.

519
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,660
So that's what we're doing tonight.

520
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,780
Crowd of people to look up.

521
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,280
That's really what we're doing tonight,

522
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,480
but that anyways.

523
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,480
Well,

524
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:15,691
you know,

525
00:22:15,691 --> 00:22:18,310
the reason that you look at people's
eyes is because you want to see what

526
00:22:18,311 --> 00:22:19,144
they're looking at.

527
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,490
Because if you can see
what they're looking at,

528
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,700
then you know what they think is important
because it was looking at what they

529
00:22:24,701 --> 00:22:25,481
think is important.

530
00:22:25,481 --> 00:22:27,730
Because why else would you look at
something if you didn't think it was

531
00:22:27,731 --> 00:22:28,300
important?

532
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:29,230
So that's the thing.

533
00:22:29,231 --> 00:22:31,630
You look at things that
you think are important.

534
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,161
So that's very,

535
00:22:33,161 --> 00:22:34,330
very interesting now.

536
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,430
And so the biological upshot of that is,

537
00:22:36,431 --> 00:22:41,060
is that it's so important for human
beings to see where other human beings are

538
00:22:41,061 --> 00:22:43,690
appointing their eyes
that all of our ancestors,

539
00:22:43,691 --> 00:22:47,320
they didn't have sharply defined
irises against the white background,

540
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,660
either got killed or didn't reproduce.

541
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,460
I get seriously important and so I
contact is unbelievably important and our

542
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:58,990
visual systems are specialized
so that we can detect tiny,

543
00:22:58,991 --> 00:23:03,550
tiny deviations in someone else's glass
like you would been know from across the

544
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:04,270
room.

545
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,740
When someone is looking at you,

546
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:06,531
you look at them,

547
00:23:06,531 --> 00:23:08,650
you think you catch each other's eyes.

548
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,420
And,

549
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,480
and you know that,

550
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,230
that there's,

551
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:11,970
there's interest.

552
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:12,500
That's,

553
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,960
that's what I contact signifies.

554
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,123
And you know,

555
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,180
there've been SMRI studies.

556
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,790
So FM arise at technology that allows
you to scan the brain as it's operating.

557
00:23:20,791 --> 00:23:22,060
Then if you,

558
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:22,790
if you,

559
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:23,170
uh,

560
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,310
if you show men,

561
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,600
this is mostly been done with men,

562
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:28,550
but not only if you show men mentioned,

563
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,090
you show me a picture,

564
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,270
the same woman,

565
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:31,521
okay.

566
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:35,230
In one picture the woman is looking
off to the left or to the right,

567
00:23:35,231 --> 00:23:36,130
doesn't matter.

568
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,500
And in the other picture
she's looking directly out.

569
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,270
So she's making eye contact,

570
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,660
at least in principle with the map.

571
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,310
If the woman,

572
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,880
this is generally an attractive
woman in these experiments,

573
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,740
if the woman is making
eye contact with Amanda,

574
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,660
then the gays will
activate part of his brain.

575
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,720
It's associated with
moving towards things,

576
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:00,920
right?

577
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:05,150
And so that's why I contact
his pickup maneuver in a bar.

578
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,270
So because you latch onto someone,

579
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:09,800
you know and the timing has to be right,

580
00:24:09,801 --> 00:24:12,320
but if you latch onto someone visually,

581
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,140
then that can be interpreted as a,

582
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,080
as interest in that can be
interpreted as an invitation.

583
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,261
Well,

584
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:19,011
everyone knows that.

585
00:24:19,011 --> 00:24:19,430
Maybe not.

586
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,720
Sometimes it's not an invitation.

587
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:24,920
Maybe you're just thinking that guy has
the ugliest tie I've ever seen in my

588
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,640
life.

589
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:25,881
Right?

590
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,530
And then of course he comes
over and talks to you,

591
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,280
that's just not good because you don't
want to talk to someone with the ugliest

592
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:32,360
tie that you've ever seen.

593
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,080
So.

594
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,490
But in any case,

595
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,830
it's an invitation.

596
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,100
You can see the strange manifestations
of that and all sorts of places you

597
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:41,630
wouldn't necessarily expect it.

598
00:24:41,631 --> 00:24:42,321
So for example,

599
00:24:42,321 --> 00:24:45,080
one of the things that
has always fascinated me,

600
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,680
wow,

601
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,513
that's not true.

602
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:51,670
Some fascinates me from time to time I
go into say into a drug store and you see

603
00:24:52,131 --> 00:24:57,131
all the magazines in a raid there and
what's the most common picture on the

604
00:24:57,741 --> 00:24:59,090
cover of a magazine?

605
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,980
It's an attractive woman.

606
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,080
It's almost always doesn't matter.

607
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:05,780
It's a women's magazine or man's magazine
and she's looking directly at you.

608
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,860
And the reason for that is that if a
magazine has that image on the cover,

609
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,510
then people will go over to it,

610
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,680
approach it,

611
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,640
which is what you want.

612
00:25:13,641 --> 00:25:14,451
If you're a magazine,

613
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:14,680
right?

614
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,550
We want people to approach you because
then they pick you up and they buy you.

615
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:24,970
And so magazines evolve in some sense to
have the maximally attractive figure on

616
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:27,771
the cover.

617
00:25:27,771 --> 00:25:32,360
Because all the magazines that don't
have that die and so that's why the

618
00:25:32,361 --> 00:25:33,590
magazines ended up that way,

619
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,740
and so the part of the brain
that is activated by that
direct eye gaze is called

620
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:44,291
the nucleus accumbens and it's a brain
area that is integrally involved in the

621
00:25:48,411 --> 00:25:50,130
neuro neuro chemicals.

622
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:55,600
What it's part of the material substrate
of the neurochemical system that uses

623
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,990
the neurochemical,

624
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:00,920
dopamine and dope mean
mediates approach behavior,

625
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,220
but also importantly,

626
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:07,230
the open meeting is also the chemical
that's who's released is facilitated by

627
00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:11,980
drugs like cocaine or methamphetamine,

628
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,561
which are very,

629
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:13,670
very addictive.

630
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,420
And the thing that's so interesting about
that is that those sorts of addictive

631
00:26:17,421 --> 00:26:21,140
drugs make you feel like you're
approaching worthwhile things.

632
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,520
That's why they're so addictive.

633
00:26:22,521 --> 00:26:25,400
So if your life is meaningless
and you take cocaine,

634
00:26:25,430 --> 00:26:29,930
then it feels like you're imbued with
a sense of purpose and that that can be

635
00:26:29,931 --> 00:26:30,764
addictive.

636
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:31,521
And in fact,

637
00:26:31,521 --> 00:26:33,620
that's the definition of
addictive in some sense.

638
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,860
And so for a neuro chemical
substance to be addictive,

639
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,220
it has to give you the sense that
you're pursuing something of value.

640
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:43,430
And so then if you show people stimuli,

641
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,960
that's a phenomena that
make them want to approach,

642
00:26:45,961 --> 00:26:47,610
then you activate that part of the brain.

643
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:48,953
And so,

644
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:53,640
so now if if I'm watching someone and
I can see what they're looking at,

645
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,560
and then I can look at it too,

646
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,570
then I know what they think is important
and if I can infer what they're,

647
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,230
what they're,

648
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:02,610
what they think is important,

649
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,710
then I can embody who they are in my
body and that's how I understand that.

650
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:11,640
So if I can see what you
think is important because
you're looking at it and I

651
00:27:11,641 --> 00:27:12,480
can look at it,

652
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:17,010
then I can adopt that frame of reference
and then I can read off my body what

653
00:27:17,011 --> 00:27:17,760
you're feeling.

654
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,590
And that's how I feel what you feel.

655
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:21,120
That's how we understand each other.

656
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,470
So when you know this,

657
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:23,304
because look,

658
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,180
you go to a movie,

659
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,400
let's say what are you doing in a movie?

660
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,230
While you're watching
the hero or the villain,

661
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:30,781
it doesn't matter.

662
00:27:30,781 --> 00:27:35,040
You're watching a character and
you see what the characters up to.

663
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:35,940
That's the plot.

664
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,541
Essentially.

665
00:27:36,541 --> 00:27:37,850
You see what the character is up to.

666
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:41,670
And then you adopt that frame of reference
and you sit there even though you're

667
00:27:41,671 --> 00:27:45,720
sitting there and all of what's happening
in that frame of reference is playing

668
00:27:45,721 --> 00:27:50,100
out in your body and your emotions and
your motivations and it's all happening

669
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:54,600
inside you like a simulation and so
you get to live the curiously as a

670
00:27:54,601 --> 00:27:56,610
consequence of adopting
the frame of reference.

671
00:27:56,611 --> 00:28:00,420
If the person that's in the fictional
landscape and that's why you like fiction

672
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,490
because you can go and watch a fictional
representation or you can read a novel.

673
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,370
It doesn't matter,

674
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,050
whatever the.

675
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:11,050
Wherever you can find a story and then
you can pick up the reference frame of

676
00:28:11,641 --> 00:28:15,420
the character in the story and
then you can have the story.

677
00:28:15,421 --> 00:28:19,560
You can sit there and learn everything
there is to learn about that story just

678
00:28:19,561 --> 00:28:24,561
by being passive and so smart because if
the hero does something stupid and ends

679
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:26,190
up dead,

680
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:30,180
then you could think while I think
if you adopt that frame of reference,

681
00:28:30,181 --> 00:28:33,750
then you do something stupid and you
end up debt and then if you're smart,

682
00:28:33,751 --> 00:28:36,200
you don't do it because
you'll end up dead.

683
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,100
Why bother with that?

684
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,390
Because you don't have to,

685
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,920
and so it's like thinking,

686
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:41,340
right?

687
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,170
Because here's a way of
thinking about thinking.

688
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,820
Alfred North Whitehead said,

689
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:50,280
we think so that our thoughts
can die instead of us,

690
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,070
which is so smart.

691
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,220
It's like when animals try to adapt to
the world the way they do it because they

692
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:03,291
can't really think like weekend what
an animal does to adapt to the world.

693
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,740
He's made a whole bunch more animals.

694
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:05,850
That's production,

695
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:06,061
right?

696
00:29:06,061 --> 00:29:08,130
So the mosquito wants
to adapt to the world.

697
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,020
It has like 10,000 mosquito offspring
and they all definitely a little bit

698
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,033
randomly.

699
00:29:14,090 --> 00:29:17,010
That's random variation and
most of them aren't successful.

700
00:29:17,011 --> 00:29:18,180
They just die.

701
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,130
But it doesn't matter
because if you're a mosquito,

702
00:29:20,131 --> 00:29:23,550
you only need to produce one mosquito
in your lifetime to keep the whole

703
00:29:23,551 --> 00:29:24,660
mosquito thing going.

704
00:29:24,661 --> 00:29:26,580
And if it costs you 9,000,

705
00:29:26,581 --> 00:29:28,650
999 dead mosquitoes,

706
00:29:28,651 --> 00:29:31,180
it doesn't matter and it's
better for the rest of us too.

707
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:31,621
So,

708
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:32,910
but so.

709
00:29:32,911 --> 00:29:37,320
So for a mosquito's idea of an idea
is to have a bunch of mosquitoes,

710
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,710
but your idea of an idea as to have a
bunch of avatars of and to lay them out in

711
00:29:43,481 --> 00:29:47,860
the fiction world until they had all
the ones that don't do very well die and

712
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,800
then to imitate the ones that survive.

713
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:53,900
And that's part of the reason that we
like stories because stories are part of

714
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:56,130
the way we think they're way we,

715
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,750
we there the way that we produce
artificial variants of ourself,

716
00:29:59,790 --> 00:29:59,970
you know,

717
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,970
hypothetical space so that the Darwinian
process can occur in abstraction before

718
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:05,964
we embody it.

719
00:30:06,330 --> 00:30:09,630
So it's super important and that's
part of the reason that we really,

720
00:30:09,631 --> 00:30:10,171
really,

721
00:30:10,171 --> 00:30:14,400
really liked stories because stories are
how we live and die without having to

722
00:30:14,401 --> 00:30:15,234
live the dye.

723
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,730
So that's that set.

724
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,410
Without having to take the
risks of real life and death.

725
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,830
We can choose what we're going to embody
and we're doing that all the time and

726
00:30:24,831 --> 00:30:25,611
we're sizing up.

727
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:28,670
Other people are seeing what they're
looking at to see what their frames of

728
00:30:28,671 --> 00:30:29,504
reference are,

729
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,720
to see if we should adopt
them for our own too.

730
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:35,810
We want to know what they're up to and
we see that people would admire and maybe

731
00:30:35,811 --> 00:30:38,960
we adopt their frame of reference because
that's pushing them ahead in the world

732
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:42,620
property and we see people
we have contempt for and
move away from their frame

733
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:45,950
of reference because that's not
a good way to act in the world.

734
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,010
And then we tell stories to each other
all the time trying to figure out what

735
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:50,900
frames of reference we should adopted,

736
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,860
which ones we should move away from it.

737
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,750
That's how we advance for roads.

738
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,191
It's very,

739
00:30:55,191 --> 00:30:56,390
very sophisticated.

740
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,741
So okay,

741
00:30:57,741 --> 00:30:58,574
so

742
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:03,990
back to back to how you frame the world.

743
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,330
So

744
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:09,800
let's say this will tell you about your
emotions because it's good to know about

745
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,150
your emotional to what they are.

746
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:14,660
So let's say I'm over
here and I want to walk.

747
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,580
I decided that I would rather be.

748
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,860
I'm like the chicken who's
going to cross the road.

749
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:21,740
I decided that it's better on the other
side of the road because that's why the

750
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:25,580
chicken crossed the road in case you in
case you're wondering because everyone

751
00:31:25,581 --> 00:31:26,201
wonders that,

752
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:26,390
right?

753
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,890
Why did the chicken cross the road?

754
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,000
Because the chicken thinks it's better
on the other side of the road because

755
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:33,210
otherwise why would he want other options?

756
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,320
It's a grass is greener on
the other side of the fence,

757
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,780
so it's a stupid window.

758
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:38,890
So you just stopped telling you.

759
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:48,270
So let's say I decide I'm going to
walk to the other side of the stage,

760
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,720
so now this reality has transformed itself
into a stage for me to undertake that

761
00:31:55,771 --> 00:31:59,010
action and so now I'm
looking at your all blurring.

762
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,581
Like I said,

763
00:31:59,581 --> 00:32:01,170
like black and white simpsons characters.

764
00:32:01,171 --> 00:32:01,801
I know you're there,

765
00:32:01,801 --> 00:32:03,210
but I can ignore you because.

766
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:06,390
And that's one of you comes
up and gets in my way.

767
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:10,590
Then I don't have to pay attention to the
fact that you exist in order to do the

768
00:32:10,591 --> 00:32:14,790
thing I'm going to do next and so I
don't and I literally don't see you.

769
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,860
You're going just like the people outside.

770
00:32:16,861 --> 00:32:18,120
The people out there in the city,

771
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:18,811
they exist,

772
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:21,450
but I can't see them because
they're not hearing the way.

773
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:26,820
And so then I look across here and I
think I evaluate the landscape and I mean

774
00:32:26,961 --> 00:32:30,540
that technically as soon as I make a goal,

775
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:33,720
the landscape changes
into a place of value.

776
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:34,740
And so.

777
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,910
And what are the values?

778
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,330
Well,

779
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:40,160
the values first of all
are what's your relevance

780
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:42,693
in

781
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,353
the world?

782
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,100
It's unbelievable.

783
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,223
It's just

784
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,100
not the most important thing.

785
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:01,760
I should act like it's
just too complicated.

786
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:04,400
So that's mostly what you do.

787
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:07,540
You just ignore every.

788
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,760
You just ignore absolutely everything
except this tiny fraction of the world

789
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:17,000
that you need to pay attention to in
order to get to where you're going.

790
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,140
And so that's another thing.

791
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,640
You don't really see

792
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,063
it,

793
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:26,540
but not really.

794
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:31,250
What you see when you look at the world
is a map of how to get from place a to

795
00:33:31,251 --> 00:33:35,680
place b and place b is better
than placing because point eight,

796
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:38,150
let's say point B is
better than a because,

797
00:33:38,410 --> 00:33:38,740
well,

798
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,500
while it isn't why we wouldn't get it.

799
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,760
So not only do you see the point,

800
00:33:43,761 --> 00:33:45,230
you're going to point b,

801
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:49,040
you contrast that with point a and you
make the presupposition that what you're

802
00:33:49,041 --> 00:33:50,500
aiming at is better than what we have.

803
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:50,941
In fact,

804
00:33:50,941 --> 00:33:53,570
that's actually the definition
of better in some sense,

805
00:33:53,571 --> 00:33:54,210
right?

806
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,720
Better is what you're
aiming at because while,

807
00:33:56,721 --> 00:33:58,670
unless there's something
gone seriously wrong,

808
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:01,610
sometimes that happens,

809
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,270
but we're not going to talk about
that under normal circumstances.

810
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,360
The mere fact that you're intending to
do something means that you value and so

811
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,100
it's a definition of value.

812
00:34:13,101 --> 00:34:14,000
So anyways,

813
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:19,001
I'm deciding that I want to get to the
other side of the steak and so now I look

814
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:24,431
at the stage and this is all irrelevant
and this is all irrelevant and the floor

815
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:25,990
is Kinda gray enough,

816
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,870
doesn't matter.

817
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,420
It could be replaced with whatever color,

818
00:34:29,450 --> 00:34:30,470
whatever resolution.

819
00:34:30,471 --> 00:34:32,180
It's irrelevant as long
as it doesn't move.

820
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:35,370
And I'm really irritated
by that little chair,

821
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,070
a little stool in the middle because it's
in my way and things are in your way.

822
00:34:40,071 --> 00:34:42,440
Maybe you feel negative emotion.

823
00:34:43,430 --> 00:34:45,410
So obstacles make you feel negative.

824
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,390
Emotion and clear pathways.

825
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:51,260
They make you feel positive emotions
and that's part of the mapping function,

826
00:34:51,261 --> 00:34:55,580
so one of the things that
I've become known for,

827
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,340
let's say is this weird

828
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,600
shape that you should clean your room,

829
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:05,660
but you know it's not
a cliche and here's why

830
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,520
you think that your room is room,

831
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:14,840
but it's not your room
is there is the room,

832
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,180
the independent material
room and that and that's.

833
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,990
That's not the relevant irrelevant
room is the room that you inhabit.

834
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:28,880
It's part of your conceptual
system and your value system.

835
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,890
If you spend two hours a day in a room,

836
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,310
we'd give them room and
that room isn't the room.

837
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,010
That room is you for two hours a day.

838
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,960
It's an extension of you.

839
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:42,660
And if the room is health,

840
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,410
well that's you.

841
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,300
That's not helpful.

842
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,471
So you think,

843
00:35:52,471 --> 00:35:53,130
well,

844
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,850
you have a room that's
maybe not a good thing.

845
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,081
What?

846
00:35:55,081 --> 00:35:56,070
Maybe it's not very fancy,

847
00:35:56,071 --> 00:36:00,420
but there it is right in front of you
and you can sort it out and set it up.

848
00:36:00,421 --> 00:36:01,254
You can.

849
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:05,550
You can make it function
as part of what you value,

850
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,780
which is what it means to clean it up.

851
00:36:07,781 --> 00:36:08,400
And it's like,

852
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,780
what are you doing in that room?

853
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,640
It's a place to wake up.

854
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:13,530
It's a place to go to sleep.

855
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,510
It's a place to get ready for the day.

856
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,400
What are you going to do during the day?

857
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,140
We're going to get dressed or what are
you going to wear and why are you going

858
00:36:21,141 --> 00:36:23,580
to wear and how are you
going to take care of it?

859
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,230
And it's a costume for you,

860
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:30,090
a dramatic costume to go out into the
world in and to manifest your role.

861
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,620
You want to get up and have
to sort through of horrible
heat of disorder before

862
00:36:34,621 --> 00:36:37,830
you can do whatever use was thing
you're planning to inflict on the world.

863
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,100
That's a hell of a way to start your day.

864
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,510
It's like it's not
obvious that you're ab up.

865
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,330
It's not right that you stop that.

866
00:36:45,331 --> 00:36:48,960
You've got your rope construed property
and just like what sort of person do you

867
00:36:48,961 --> 00:36:51,160
want to be exactly on.

868
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:56,410
Maybe you set the room up as the stage
on which the person that you want to be

869
00:36:56,701 --> 00:36:58,140
can enter the world.

870
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:58,621
That isn't.

871
00:36:58,621 --> 00:36:59,580
If you do,

872
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,620
if you have any sense,

873
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,500
and so to clean up your room is,

874
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
is all that,

875
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:08,610
it's to set the stage for the
person that you want to be,

876
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:13,200
is to set the stage for the
value structure that you're
going to bring him to me

877
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,210
and it's going to how the
world manifests itself to you.

878
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,370
That's the thing.

879
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:25,320
Your values structure determines how
the world manifests itself to you and

880
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:27,330
that's actually the case.

881
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,460
It's not just metaphorical.

882
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,070
Now you know there's limits to that.

883
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,300
You can fail.

884
00:37:33,301 --> 00:37:36,530
You going across the street
and step up carelessly.

885
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,000
You can get wiped out by a semi trailer
and you know there's a certain arbitrary

886
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:44,940
this to the world and the mere fact that
you're laying a value structure on it

887
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,300
doesn't transform its nature entirely,

888
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,970
but it transformative nature a lot,

889
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,410
a lot more than you think.

890
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,131
So anyways,

891
00:37:53,131 --> 00:37:58,131
we go back to my desire to walk across
the stake and so I'm not happy that that

892
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:00,390
obstacle is in my way.

893
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:04,190
And so you can imagine that this might
be my bedroom and it's just littered with

894
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,370
mes.

895
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,720
And so when I look at that,

896
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:11,721
all I see is a maze of confusion impeding
me in the smallest of tasks and that

897
00:38:14,671 --> 00:38:16,260
will make my heart sink,

898
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:21,360
will make me anxious and disgusted
and angry and unmotivated,

899
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,520
especially if it's something
that I've created around myself.

900
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:31,410
It's not helpful so that even the smallest
steps that I want to take forward are

901
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:34,470
complicated by unnecessary obstacles.

902
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,520
You've got to asked her.

903
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:36,990
So I had a client once,

904
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,230
so interesting.

905
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,700
He had this dream,

906
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,320
he had a new chart.

907
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:46,360
He was 30 something he'd never grown up
and he knew and he had this child and he

908
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:47,051
thought,

909
00:38:47,051 --> 00:38:47,321
Jeez,

910
00:38:47,321 --> 00:38:48,880
I better get my act together because,

911
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,810
you know,

912
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:50,830
before it was just me.

913
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:54,790
But now I've got this baby and probably
I shouldn't be an immature more on

914
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:58,750
anymore because we're probably
going to be good for the baby.

915
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:02,950
And so then he had this dream that I
lightening bolt came into his bedroom,

916
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:04,060
his bedroom,

917
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,440
all lightning.

918
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,290
It was bombed.

919
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,340
And so he told me the dream and I said,

920
00:39:09,341 --> 00:39:09,970
well,

921
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:10,181
you know,

922
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,450
you just had this baby and
the baby is a potential,

923
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:17,500
is absolutely potential for,

924
00:39:17,530 --> 00:39:17,890
for,

925
00:39:17,890 --> 00:39:19,480
for good and for evil,

926
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,730
for the whole span of human ability.

927
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,860
Now you have this responsibility.

928
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,120
That's what the dream is showing.

929
00:39:25,121 --> 00:39:30,121
This is incredibly charged things enter
your life and it can bounce around and

930
00:39:30,371 --> 00:39:31,450
do all sorts of damage.

931
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:34,930
You better straighten yourself up so
that you can have them as property.

932
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,960
So we decided that he would start
by cleaning his room was a mess.

933
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,161
Complete mess.

934
00:39:41,161 --> 00:39:43,680
It's like he's 30 something
and getting it clean his room.

935
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:44,060
It's like,

936
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,150
how pathetic is that?

937
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:46,901
What is it?

938
00:39:46,901 --> 00:39:47,530
Inability.

939
00:39:47,530 --> 00:39:48,850
You don't know how to do it.

940
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,450
Well,

941
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,500
that's pathetic.

942
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,760
And if it isn't inability,

943
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,121
it's like,

944
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:53,580
well you not willing to.

945
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,290
Well that's pathetic too.

946
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,030
So either way it's pathetic.

947
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,620
Or maybe you're too bitter
about the structure.

948
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:03,940
Braille and clean your room.

949
00:40:03,941 --> 00:40:04,960
And that's like your,

950
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:09,310
your protest all show God and reality.

951
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,090
What I think I'll just leave
this room a maintenance room,

952
00:40:13,091 --> 00:40:13,990
a catastrophe,

953
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,250
be my protests.

954
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:19,570
Yeah.

955
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:20,920
Do People Laugh about that?

956
00:40:20,921 --> 00:40:21,450
But that's the,

957
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:25,900
that's one of the truth than in just not
knowing how to do it or being lazy or

958
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:30,010
any of that as a form of vengeance
to form a vengeance against reality.

959
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,330
So,

960
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:36,640
so we made a plan to clean his room and
one of the things he thought he would do

961
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:37,630
is vacuum,

962
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,770
which wasn't a genius level hypothesis.

963
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:48,730
And so he came back a week later,

964
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:49,823
you said,

965
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,970
I tried to get back to my room,

966
00:40:51,971 --> 00:40:52,271
but you know,

967
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:52,811
what happened?

968
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:53,081
He said,

969
00:40:53,081 --> 00:40:56,590
I put the vacuum in the
doorway of my bedroom.

970
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,100
So matching.

971
00:40:58,101 --> 00:40:59,620
It was one of those push back humans,

972
00:40:59,621 --> 00:41:00,430
you know,

973
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:04,270
so the head of it was laying against
one side of the door Jamb and then the

974
00:41:04,271 --> 00:41:06,400
handwritten was leaning
against the other men.

975
00:41:06,410 --> 00:41:11,410
He said for a whole week I walked over
that vacuum to get into my room and I

976
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:13,930
thought,

977
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,820
that's a microcosm of your life.

978
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,370
I'm dead serious about that.

979
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,230
You can interpret that just like a dream.

980
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:22,300
It was absolutely a
microcosm with his life.

981
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:23,493
Was like,

982
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:23,741
well,

983
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:25,420
why can't I get anywhere?

984
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:25,960
Well,

985
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,970
there's these damn they're
obstacles everywhere.

986
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:31,690
The look was a vacuum
cleaner right in my door.

987
00:41:31,691 --> 00:41:32,710
How can I do anything?

988
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,340
You're in my door.

989
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,933
It's like,

990
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,093
well,

991
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:38,220
you put it there.

992
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,690
It sounded like he didn't notice.

993
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:42,890
He wasn't stupid.

994
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:46,370
He noticed he did it and we
have a discussion about that.

995
00:41:46,371 --> 00:41:46,700
It's like,

996
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,533
well,

997
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,950
why is your life so difficult?

998
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,860
Because he put up obstacles in your path.

999
00:41:52,490 --> 00:41:54,060
All you just do not,

1000
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:57,180
but you could just walk there and no.

1001
00:41:57,470 --> 00:41:59,090
Put it back in cleaner in
front and then you think,

1002
00:41:59,091 --> 00:41:59,631
Oh God,

1003
00:41:59,631 --> 00:42:00,500
that's so much trouble.

1004
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,393
Just go like,

1005
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:02,393
I don't know.

1006
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,773
What do I do?

1007
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,250
I do play a video game.

1008
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,570
I won't go to where I'm going
because of all these damn dogs.

1009
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:17,310
So what are the things you
might ask yourself like you
had to ask himself is how

1010
00:42:17,311 --> 00:42:19,890
many of the obstacles that get
in your way that make you bitter?

1011
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:22,140
It makes your world.

1012
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:28,530
God only knows the answer to that and
maybe here's something else that's even a

1013
00:42:28,531 --> 00:42:33,060
deeper question is maybe you put those
obstacles there on purpose just so that

1014
00:42:33,061 --> 00:42:35,340
you have a reason so
that you can be useless,

1015
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,110
which is exactly what he was doing.

1016
00:42:37,111 --> 00:42:38,030
And he knew that he,

1017
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:39,840
he came in and told me that he did,

1018
00:42:39,841 --> 00:42:40,290
that.

1019
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,290
He was kind of laughing.

1020
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,350
It wasn't that funny because he did
it actually unbelievably screamingly

1021
00:42:46,351 --> 00:42:49,650
hilarious to tell you
the truth was so absurd,

1022
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,210
but,

1023
00:42:50,210 --> 00:42:54,300
but there was a terrible tragic element
to the tube because he basically just

1024
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,990
revealed to me and himself
the whole essence of his life.

1025
00:42:58,410 --> 00:42:59,243
It's like,

1026
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,480
so back to this,

1027
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,490
back to the stool here.

1028
00:43:04,491 --> 00:43:04,791
Okay.

1029
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:05,830
So you know,

1030
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:10,010
one of the things I can do to decrease
the negative consequences of having that

1031
00:43:10,011 --> 00:43:12,320
stool in front of me is just go like this.

1032
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:13,191
That'd be nice.

1033
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,610
I could just circumvent
the obstacle attire.

1034
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:16,513
So anyways,

1035
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:21,680
if I lay out this landscape so that
there are clear pathways to my goals and

1036
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:23,570
when I looked at them landscape,

1037
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,680
I'm happy.

1038
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,210
And the reason I'm happy is because
this is the definition of happy.

1039
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:32,330
So here's how it is that
you're happy when you are,

1040
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,360
you have a goal,

1041
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,570
it's a good goal

1042
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:41,720
and things are set up so
that you can move towards it.

1043
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,520
And so then you think,

1044
00:43:43,521 --> 00:43:45,290
well that's very interesting because,

1045
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:45,891
well,

1046
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:46,560
first of all,

1047
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,550
need goal two means you
need a value structure.

1048
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,350
And second it means that maybe
there's a hierarchy of goals,

1049
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:54,711
right?

1050
00:43:54,711 --> 00:43:58,430
Because some goals might be like the
chickens goal just to get across the road,

1051
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:00,380
but maybe there are higher order goals.

1052
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:00,831
You might say,

1053
00:44:00,831 --> 00:44:01,550
well,

1054
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:06,170
if you need a goal to orient
yourself properly in the world,

1055
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,060
what's the basketball to aim at?

1056
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,520
Because if you're going to
orient yourself to the world,

1057
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,750
you've got a problem with having a goal
and maybe you should have a basketball

1058
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:18,130
because why not?

1059
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:18,460
Why?

1060
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:23,260
Why settle for something second rate
and so and then the next thing is once

1061
00:44:23,261 --> 00:44:24,640
you've established the goal,

1062
00:44:24,641 --> 00:44:26,140
the goal that is good,

1063
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:31,200
then why not clean up the pathways to
it so that you have the road in front of

1064
00:44:32,311 --> 00:44:37,311
you so that you can walk towards your
noble goal and then maybe maybe not

1065
00:44:39,091 --> 00:44:42,610
allowed some positive meaning to your
life and there's no maybe about it.

1066
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,220
That is exactly how it works.

1067
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:48,300
And so one of the things you might ask
yourself is it really there isn't any

1068
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:49,650
positive meaning in your life.

1069
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:51,720
Maybe you're aiming at the wrong thing.

1070
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:55,800
And I tell you that you can think
about that for about 15 years.

1071
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:59,180
Like every day for eight
hours you can take,

1072
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,990
maybe I'm even at the wrong thing.

1073
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:04,740
Maybe my life isn't playing itself out
the way it should because I'm aiming at

1074
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:05,640
the wrong thing.

1075
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:06,923
It's like,

1076
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,840
where's my error?

1077
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,420
What should I be aiming at?

1078
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:11,920
Well,

1079
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,170
these are very good questions.

1080
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:14,630
Very good questions.

1081
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:14,950
Indeed.

1082
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,290
They're the ultimate questions.

1083
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,124
In fact,

1084
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,310
what should you be aiming at?

1085
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,920
There's a scene in Pinocchio
to the movie I quite like.

1086
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,453
Um,

1087
00:45:26,510 --> 00:45:27,600
so it's a,

1088
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:28,830
it's a work of genius,

1089
00:45:28,831 --> 00:45:29,664
of course,

1090
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:30,310
anatomy,

1091
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,160
the work of Jesus.

1092
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:32,880
It took people a long
time to make that move.

1093
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:37,680
They had to draw a lot of drugs and they
were very high quality automators and

1094
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:38,461
they have the sequence,

1095
00:45:38,461 --> 00:45:41,940
all those drawings and they had to come
to a collective decision about what they

1096
00:45:41,941 --> 00:45:44,460
were going to draw and it had
to decide to let the plot.

1097
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:46,530
Every single bit of that movie,

1098
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:51,590
every single tiny bit was the consequence
of deep thought and collected and done

1099
00:45:53,221 --> 00:45:55,230
by a team of visionary genius.

1100
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:57,030
And so it's worth thinking about,

1101
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:57,301
you know,

1102
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:59,100
even though it's for kids,

1103
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:00,023
let's say,

1104
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:00,900
um,

1105
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,380
there's a great scene
in there where Japan,

1106
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:03,550
Oh,

1107
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,360
makes Pinocchio would,

1108
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,220
wouldn't edit puppet marionette.

1109
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:10,230
So someone else's pulling his strings,

1110
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:10,441
right?

1111
00:46:10,441 --> 00:46:13,860
Someone else is deciding what
his values are going to be.

1112
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:15,120
That's the Marionette.

1113
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:17,040
He's not an autonomous being.

1114
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,870
And Japan who's a great craftsmen and
the positive father and someone who cares

1115
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:26,810
for his child decides that it would
be better if he was an antonymous and

1116
00:46:26,811 --> 00:46:27,870
complete being.

1117
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,040
That's his wish.

1118
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:29,911
That's a good wish.

1119
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:30,990
If you're a father,

1120
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,570
what the hell else are
you going to wish for?

1121
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,790
You want your son to remain a Marionette?

1122
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:38,670
Is that the idea so that you can pull the
strings are so that something else can

1123
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,180
or do you want the strings to disappear
and have the thing that's not fully

1124
00:46:42,181 --> 00:46:46,140
formed yet taken place in the
world and Japan is a good,

1125
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,210
is an archetype of the good father,

1126
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:48,940
um,

1127
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:49,371
as a,

1128
00:46:49,371 --> 00:46:53,930
as a craftsman and as a craftsman who
cares about children and makes toys and

1129
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:59,030
hasn't warmed Harlem as a safe place to
be a place where kids can play and he

1130
00:46:59,101 --> 00:47:02,040
wants his child to expand
completely into the world.

1131
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,310
And so what he does is,

1132
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,040
what does he do?

1133
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:07,080
He wishes upon a star.

1134
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:08,041
You think,

1135
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:08,580
well,

1136
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:08,821
you know,

1137
00:47:08,821 --> 00:47:09,481
we do that.

1138
00:47:09,481 --> 00:47:10,710
Maybe do that with your kids.

1139
00:47:10,711 --> 00:47:12,480
You tell them that you
could wish on a star,

1140
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:16,020
you wish on a falling star and
everyone kind of knows what that means,

1141
00:47:16,021 --> 00:47:16,920
but not really.

1142
00:47:17,430 --> 00:47:17,820
You think,

1143
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:17,911
well,

1144
00:47:17,911 --> 00:47:19,650
what does it mean to wish on a star?

1145
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:20,011
And you think,

1146
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:20,131
well,

1147
00:47:20,131 --> 00:47:21,150
what's The star?

1148
00:47:21,151 --> 00:47:21,984
Exactly?

1149
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,350
And I don't mean
materialistically speaking,

1150
00:47:25,351 --> 00:47:27,930
I know it is damn this point.

1151
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:28,870
There's the star.

1152
00:47:28,871 --> 00:47:31,060
That's the material launching
and there's the star.

1153
00:47:31,061 --> 00:47:32,650
That's the element of perception.

1154
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,100
The same thing,

1155
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:38,740
even though they're related upon one
another star as a Hollywood star,

1156
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:41,080
why is a Hollywood star a star?

1157
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:44,170
No one ever asks that really well.

1158
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:48,430
Star is something that you look up
to star as something to emulate.

1159
00:47:48,431 --> 00:47:49,990
That's Hollywood star.

1160
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,100
That's why people.

1161
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,200
That's why people are star struck.

1162
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,480
It's because in these people who are
stars play these larger than life rules on

1163
00:47:58,481 --> 00:48:01,330
the screen and those are
ritual models for emulation.

1164
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:04,750
So a scar is something that you look
up to so that you can emulate it,

1165
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,160
and Japan all looks up to the stars and
that also means that he lifts his eyes

1166
00:48:09,161 --> 00:48:11,530
above the mundane landscape,

1167
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:11,891
right?

1168
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:15,430
He's not trying to get from this side
of the stage to that side of the stage.

1169
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,001
He's thinking,

1170
00:48:16,001 --> 00:48:18,730
what's the highest possible
thing I could aim at?

1171
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:22,030
An answer that is the light
that glistens in the darkness.

1172
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:25,960
I can lift my eyes up to that and
I can orient myself towards that.

1173
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:28,060
The highest possible good,

1174
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,860
and that's the wish,

1175
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:32,440
and here's the upshot of that.

1176
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,850
If you aim,

1177
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:36,730
that determines how
you perceive the world,

1178
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:41,790
then the highest possible aim that you
can aim at lays out the best possible

1179
00:48:42,041 --> 00:48:43,840
world that you can live in,

1180
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,180
and that's actually the truth.

1181
00:48:46,270 --> 00:48:48,910
It's the hard core,

1182
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,000
solid scientific truth that that's the
case and so what happens with Japan knows

1183
00:48:55,721 --> 00:49:00,490
because he's a good man and he's put
in the thousands of hours of discipline

1184
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:05,760
necessary to be a careful disciplined
crossman because he actually loves his son

1185
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:07,780
and wants the best for him.

1186
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:12,810
He looks up as high as he can possibly
look and makes his wish and his wishes.

1187
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:14,980
I wish that my son could be real.

1188
00:49:15,070 --> 00:49:16,090
It could be a real boy,

1189
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:22,600
wouldn't headed puppet whose
strings are being pulled by fate,

1190
00:49:22,601 --> 00:49:24,890
by forces behind the scenes,

1191
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:28,690
and that's what that see
me and it's absolutely.

1192
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:32,350
It's absolutely brilliant and it
catalyzes a kind of development,

1193
00:49:32,351 --> 00:49:32,591
right?

1194
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:37,591
Because what happens is Japan makes his
wish and then he falls asleep and then

1195
00:49:37,601 --> 00:49:38,710
the blue fairy shows up.

1196
00:49:38,711 --> 00:49:40,120
That's mother nature.

1197
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:43,940
Mother Nature shows up
and confers upon Japan.

1198
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:44,280
No,

1199
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:45,070
a gift,

1200
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:48,250
and that's the gift of the beginning of
autonomy and what that means is this,

1201
00:49:48,670 --> 00:49:51,250
if you're a good father and
you have a son with you,

1202
00:49:51,251 --> 00:49:54,880
have a daughter for that matter and you
wish above all that they will become

1203
00:49:54,881 --> 00:49:55,400
real.

1204
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:00,400
The nature will step in and give them
a hand and that's exactly how it works.

1205
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:01,631
Right,

1206
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:02,510
and then the child,

1207
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:07,300
the child himself or herself has to
undertake their adventure in the world.

1208
00:50:07,301 --> 00:50:08,920
They have to make their
own moral decisions.

1209
00:50:08,921 --> 00:50:09,640
You're not.

1210
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,230
You're not the owner of your child,

1211
00:50:11,231 --> 00:50:12,940
even though you might be their guide,

1212
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:16,510
you might be the person who sets up the
structure within which they can flourish

1213
00:50:16,511 --> 00:50:17,290
or not.

1214
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:21,370
The child has to play his or her role
and that's also brilliantly detailed in

1215
00:50:21,371 --> 00:50:25,170
the movie to deal with temptation seemed
to decide whether to tell the truth or

1216
00:50:25,171 --> 00:50:29,840
to lie and all and to decide
to be neurotic and to be
a victim because of course

1217
00:50:29,841 --> 00:50:31,430
that's part of the Pinocchio Story.

1218
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,600
He's a tracker.

1219
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:37,930
He's tempted by criminals into v
into adopting the stance of a victim.

1220
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,861
So that's.

1221
00:50:38,861 --> 00:50:42,710
That's something we can all meditate
on for a certain amount of time,

1222
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:46,220
so you want to aim as
high as you possibly can,

1223
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:49,910
and then the right thing to appear to
you in the world as obstacles and the

1224
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:54,911
right things appear to you in the world
as pathways to move forward and those

1225
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,260
pathways to move forward
towards the highest goal.

1226
00:50:57,260 --> 00:51:00,940
Fill your soul with a kind of contentment
that allows you to withstand the

1227
00:51:00,941 --> 00:51:04,190
suffering that characterized as
being without becoming bitter.

1228
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,690
It's important.

1229
00:51:05,870 --> 00:51:07,460
It keeps you away from Hell.

1230
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,550
It helps you orient yourself
towards the highest possible

1231
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:15,350
and then the world plays itself
out in the proper manner.

1232
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:16,950
Qualify suffering.

1233
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,530
Things aren't good for me.

1234
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,940
If life is unbearable,

1235
00:51:19,941 --> 00:51:23,810
then maybe I'm not aiming in the right
place and that's something that's

1236
00:51:23,870 --> 00:51:27,500
endlessly we're thinking about
and I think that it's correct,

1237
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,150
so then you might think,

1238
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:33,890
well have accepted that
as a potential reality.

1239
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:39,370
How can you characterize what it
is that you might a map and so

1240
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:45,430
and this I think is the answer in some
sense to this postmodern conundrum that

1241
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:47,270
we've been faced with,

1242
00:51:47,271 --> 00:51:52,250
which is partly a puzzle that's emerged
as we've figured out that the world is a

1243
00:51:52,251 --> 00:51:54,080
very difficult place to interpret.

1244
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,820
The world is very complicated.

1245
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,950
There are many maybe ways to interpret it.

1246
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,510
How do you know which of those?

1247
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,910
How can you rank order those weights?

1248
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:04,190
The postmodern claim,

1249
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:06,610
and this is what's being
taught in the universities.

1250
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:11,420
I would say the postmodern
claim is there's no way of
ranking rank ordering the

1251
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,820
multitude of ways that you
can interpret the world.

1252
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:19,220
You can't make a final decision
about route a or route b.

1253
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:26,310
it's a chaotic tumbled of unconstrained
possibility and it's demolished say

1254
00:52:30,201 --> 00:52:34,760
literary criticism because for a long
time people would try to understand what

1255
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:37,970
the book men but the
postmodernist so well.

1256
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:41,060
The book means an infinite
number of things and there's
no way that you can rank

1257
00:52:41,061 --> 00:52:45,470
order your interpretations because of
that infinite complexity and there's a

1258
00:52:45,471 --> 00:52:48,530
manner in which that's true because
the world is very complicated.

1259
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,570
Any given text is complicated,

1260
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,710
how many ways can you interpret the
Bible and endless number of ways because

1261
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:56,120
it's such a complicated text.

1262
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:57,890
It's tied into everything.

1263
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,240
Depends on where you look.

1264
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:04,070
It depends on how you look because of
course how things manifest themselves to

1265
00:53:04,071 --> 00:53:04,161
you.

1266
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:09,161
It depends on how you look and so it's a
powerful critique except for one thing.

1267
00:53:10,510 --> 00:53:13,370
There is a very large number
of ways looking at the world,

1268
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,290
but there aren't a very
large number of ways,

1269
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,150
a viable ways of looking at the world.

1270
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,640
That's a whole different story.

1271
00:53:20,540 --> 00:53:25,220
You know that because if you
look at the edge of a cliff,

1272
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:30,690
like it's a solid place to walk and you
act that out and you end up a crumpled

1273
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,780
pile of bleeding bones at the bottom of
the cliff and that seems to be evidence

1274
00:53:36,571 --> 00:53:41,520
that that particular interpretation of
that particular phenomena wasn't in your

1275
00:53:41,521 --> 00:53:42,900
best interests.

1276
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,130
And so there's a very limited number of
ways of looking at the world that you

1277
00:53:47,131 --> 00:53:49,110
might say are in your best interest.

1278
00:53:49,470 --> 00:53:53,340
And so that takes that terrible complexity
that the postmodernist some sort of

1279
00:53:53,341 --> 00:53:54,151
put in front of us.

1280
00:53:54,151 --> 00:53:57,630
And organizes it and you
can think this through,

1281
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,570
and this is part of the way that you
think through what it is that you should.

1282
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,130
Amen and so,

1283
00:54:02,131 --> 00:54:05,790
and this is the evolution of morality as
far as I'm concerned and I think that's

1284
00:54:05,791 --> 00:54:07,020
the right way to think about it.

1285
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:10,650
Think about it metaphysically
or theologically or biblically,

1286
00:54:10,651 --> 00:54:11,850
ear or ethically,

1287
00:54:11,851 --> 00:54:12,571
all those ways,

1288
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:17,571
but it's easier in some sense and it's
easier and and more in keeping with the

1289
00:54:18,211 --> 00:54:21,780
full body of our knowledge to think
about it as something that's emerged from

1290
00:54:21,781 --> 00:54:22,650
the bottom up.

1291
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:23,490
It's like,

1292
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:24,930
here's the constraints.

1293
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:30,270
Why not just do what's
impulsively pleasurable?

1294
00:54:30,870 --> 00:54:33,450
I talk about that in rule seven.

1295
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:35,130
Do what is meaningful,

1296
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,870
not once speed.

1297
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:39,780
Speeding is momentary pleasure.

1298
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:42,240
It's cocaine is expedient,

1299
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:42,990
right?

1300
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,000
Promiscuity is expedient.

1301
00:54:45,270 --> 00:54:48,240
Gluttony is expedient of violence,

1302
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:49,530
can be expedient,

1303
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:51,630
victory can be expedient,

1304
00:54:51,810 --> 00:54:54,840
and something that works
now and you might think,

1305
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:55,441
well,

1306
00:54:55,441 --> 00:54:57,510
why not just do what works now?

1307
00:54:57,870 --> 00:54:59,220
And that's who that is,

1308
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:02,310
because you're not just here now.

1309
00:55:03,060 --> 00:55:08,060
You're here now and you're here
now and you're here now and there.

1310
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:10,590
You are repeating away during time.

1311
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,071
Right?

1312
00:55:11,071 --> 00:55:12,960
So there's the you
that's sitting here now,

1313
00:55:12,961 --> 00:55:15,870
but there's the you that's gonna wake
up tomorrow and there's the you that's

1314
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,640
going to wake up in a month and in the
year God willing five years in 10 years

1315
00:55:20,641 --> 00:55:25,110
and 20 years and so you can just
take care of who you are now,

1316
00:55:25,170 --> 00:55:29,610
right this second in the most expedient
possible way because the you that you're

1317
00:55:29,611 --> 00:55:34,320
going to me has to put up with the
consequences of the you that you are now.

1318
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,620
There's a funny scene
in a simpsons cartoon.

1319
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:42,710
So I think it's extraordinarily funny
where homer is mixing up a quart of

1320
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,073
oil

1321
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,730
and a mark says,

1322
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,340
well that's,

1323
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,140
that's,

1324
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,760
you should think twice
about doing that in.

1325
00:55:53,761 --> 00:55:54,594
Homer says,

1326
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,780
well that's a problem for future homework.

1327
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:57,301
I'm sure.

1328
00:55:57,301 --> 00:55:58,680
Glad I'm not that guy.

1329
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:02,311
So anyways,

1330
00:56:02,311 --> 00:56:03,390
I think that's very funny,

1331
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,660
but that's exactly it.

1332
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:08,140
Like you're all future homer's man.

1333
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:09,520
And so

1334
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:15,120
a little bit of impulsive
expediency goes a very long way.

1335
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:19,700
And so you have to think about your
life as it iterating gay rights.

1336
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,450
You have to play the game right now.

1337
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:23,560
You have completed the right there.

1338
00:56:23,590 --> 00:56:27,310
On the way that doesn't compromise the
way you play it tomorrow and it doesn't

1339
00:56:27,311 --> 00:56:29,160
compromise the way you play it next week,

1340
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:29,920
next month,

1341
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,621
next year,

1342
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:31,630
and five years from now,

1343
00:56:31,631 --> 00:56:32,464
10 years from now,

1344
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,860
and maybe the constraint is
even more severe than that.

1345
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,310
Maybe you want to play the game right
now so that the game you played,

1346
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:42,220
Mauro is slightly better in the game he
played two years from now is even better

1347
00:56:42,221 --> 00:56:42,701
than that,

1348
00:56:42,701 --> 00:56:46,210
so you don't want to just play a
game that you can repeat without.

1349
00:56:46,690 --> 00:56:50,290
You don't want to play a game that you
can repeat at a plateau and you don't

1350
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:53,170
want to play a game that you
can repeat that deteriorates.

1351
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:54,730
That's definitely a bad game.

1352
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,190
Things are going from bad to worse.

1353
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,420
Who wants to play that?

1354
00:56:58,480 --> 00:56:58,601
Well,

1355
00:56:58,601 --> 00:57:02,230
maybe if you're a marketer you can do
that and you'll meet people like that,

1356
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,800
but maybe one play a game that was
like this one that's oriented towards

1357
00:57:05,801 --> 00:57:09,520
whatever that star is and so that's a
tight constraint man and everybody knows

1358
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:11,260
that that's the straight and narrow.

1359
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:15,720
That's a tough one and then it's worse
than that because it isn't just used it

1360
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:18,850
at stake here and the iterated future use.

1361
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,830
You're also embedded in the world.

1362
00:57:20,831 --> 00:57:21,500
It's like,

1363
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,091
well there's you,

1364
00:57:22,091 --> 00:57:23,620
but then there's the person you're with,

1365
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,670
your intimate partner,

1366
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:25,560
maybe your father,

1367
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,340
your mother,

1368
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:31,000
your siblings or your children and
they're just as much you as you are.

1369
00:57:31,001 --> 00:57:31,930
Maybe even more.

1370
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:32,150
You know,

1371
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,000
people will die for their children,

1372
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:37,380
so maybe they're more of their
children than they are themselves now.

1373
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:42,270
You look at it so you have to propagate
itself through time in a matter of

1374
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:43,900
seconds,

1375
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:48,460
but at the same time makes
your children's life parents,

1376
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:49,840
your siblings,

1377
00:57:51,420 --> 00:57:52,253
friends.

1378
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:53,710
Same problem.

1379
00:57:53,711 --> 00:57:57,970
And then there's the broader community
and so you actually have to organize all

1380
00:57:57,971 --> 00:58:02,971
your aims and stack them all
up so that at the same time,

1381
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,470
and there's not an infinite number of
ways of doing that is a finite number of

1382
00:58:08,471 --> 00:58:09,550
ways of doing that.

1383
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,510
And the final way is the way that
you do things when you do them right.

1384
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,490
And everyone knows that.

1385
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:20,080
And that seems to be aligned
with something like with
something like telling the

1386
00:58:20,081 --> 00:58:23,640
truth or just rule eight in my book,

1387
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,431
tell the truth,

1388
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:25,450
or at least don't lie.
