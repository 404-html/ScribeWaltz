1
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:10,960
I don't know if you've seen the sort of
ridiculous a animation to be used

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:15,190
animated drawings like the ginger,
the genderbread person or the gender

3
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:16,024
Unicorn.

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:18,190
Yeah,
yeah,

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,493
yeah.
I have.

6
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,290
Yeah,
and so those are being pushed forward

7
00:00:22,291 --> 00:00:24,930
very hard in institutions all across
Canada,

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,060
elementary schools,
junior high schools,

9
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,530
the military,
the police,

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,170
you name it,
where there's this tremendous emphasis

11
00:00:31,171 --> 00:00:34,800
on the social construction of identity
and it's as if the social

12
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:39,801
constructionists have taken to the law
to enforce what they cannot prove

13
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:43,980
scientifically what they failed to prove
scientifically or what's even being

14
00:00:43,981 --> 00:00:46,710
disproved scientifically,
which would be more accurate way of

15
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:49,380
thinking about it.
Then the fact that there was an all out

16
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:53,100
assault on,
on biology by the left is unbelievably.

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,650
I'm ominous in my estimation.

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,570
Yeah,
I agree.

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,960
Just two things on that.
We've got an article coming out on

20
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,560
written by two evolutionary
psychologists on the false dichotomy

21
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,430
between sex and gender and they give it
some historical context.

22
00:01:14,071 --> 00:01:17,640
So the fault.
That false dichotomy I think started

23
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,200
with Moonee.
Yes,

24
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,260
exactly.
And it's.

25
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:26,380
And then it was weaponized by feminists
to deny biology entered denied sex

26
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:29,790
differences.
Basically.

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,640
So that's it.

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:37,070
Very strange thing for feminists to do.
One of the things that James Demore has

29
00:01:38,231 --> 00:01:41,020
just pointed out lately,
he's the guy that wrote that memo for

30
00:01:41,021 --> 00:01:42,850
Google,
is that

31
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,280
the problem with denying the sex
differences is that you automatically

32
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:51,370
make the argument that if there are sex
differences,

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,150
essentially they're making the argument
that the female differences or something

34
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:59,530
like inferior because why would you
object to their existence otherwise?

35
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,190
And memo was actually quite careful
because he said,

36
00:02:03,191 --> 00:02:06,400
well we should take a look at these
differences and if we want to maximize

37
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:10,090
the economic utility of women,
which seems to be a reasonable thing to

38
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,370
do,
then we should actually have a serious

39
00:02:12,371 --> 00:02:15,220
discussion about what the differences
are and see if we could set up our

40
00:02:15,221 --> 00:02:18,890
institution so that we can take
advantage of the,

41
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,970
of the difference in perspective and
orientation.

42
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:24,310
But the two sexes might bring to bear on
the,

43
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,460
on the workplace and on economic issues
in general.

44
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,620
And you don't use that happening because
people are starting to sort themselves

45
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:36,640
out into occupations bisects
essentially.

46
00:02:36,641 --> 00:02:39,940
And you know,
the longterm social consequences of that

47
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:42,520
aren't obvious.
And we don't know how to balance that,

48
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:43,690
but it's,
it doesn't,

49
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:46,450
it isn't necessarily the case that it's
a bad thing.

50
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,490
No.
Yeah.

51
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:53,510
And my position has always been that
women have probably more to lose when

52
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:59,301
sex differences are denied.
I think because of women's biological

53
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:05,130
clock and the,
the fact that we bear much more of a

54
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:09,160
burden when it comes to child bearing
and child weary.

55
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:14,520
If you denied that
women pay a huge price,

56
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,010
if,
if you denied the fact that what women

57
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:21,550
go through that to bear children.
Firstly,

58
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:25,300
I think we need to separate mothers out
from women.

59
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,590
There's this sort of a conflation when
we talk about things like the gender gap

60
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,170
where there's a lot of the rhetoric
implies that all women are discriminated

61
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:39,350
against the women who pay a penalty,
our mothers and we,

62
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,440
we need to talk about that more and we,
we shouldn't minimize the,

63
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,900
the work and the sacrifice and,
and all of the,

64
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,271
the,
the,

65
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:55,271
the costs and the energy that we've been
pouring into that.

66
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,060
And I think when we do ny sex
differences,

67
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,120
we sort of,
um,

68
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,770
we,
we do,

69
00:04:02,771 --> 00:04:04,380
we minimize and we,
um,

70
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:10,140
sort of dismiss everything that women do
that is female normally receive,

71
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,780
such as caring and,
and,

72
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:18,840
and working for others and sacrificing
pay for their children.

73
00:04:18,851 --> 00:04:20,560
And you know,
all of these things.

74
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:23,060
Right.
Well,

75
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,000
no,
I agree with you.

76
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,010
Maybe a month ago we were talking to her
last night.

77
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,910
She's trying to finish up her degree.
She's also had some health problems that

78
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:34,420
have interfered with that.
You know,

79
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,740
she was talking to us last night about
that.

80
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,640
She looked tired.
She had bags under her eyes.

81
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,760
I mean she's very happy to have the baby
and it's going very well and all of

82
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:44,100
that.
But the first year after you have a

83
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:45,750
baby,
you're basically done.

84
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,600
You don't get it.
You don't get any sleep.

85
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:52,530
You're absolutely overwhelmed,
especially for the first six months with

86
00:04:52,531 --> 00:04:54,960
a new instance,
especially if you're a first time mother

87
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,690
because like,
what the hell do you know about taking

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,850
care of this incredibly complicated
thing.

89
00:04:59,851 --> 00:05:03,960
And it produces all sorts of biochemical
changes and it's really hard on your

90
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:08,520
body and there's a long recovery period
and you're much more dependent on your

91
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:10,960
familial structure than you were before.

92
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,580
And the,
I like,

93
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,490
I like,
I mean,

94
00:05:14,491 --> 00:05:16,920
it's crazy that we even have to have
this conversation,

95
00:05:16,921 --> 00:05:20,400
but I like your distinction between
women and mothers and you know,

96
00:05:20,401 --> 00:05:22,920
there's one of the problems that I've
had with,

97
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,590
with classic feminism,
if you could use that term,

98
00:05:25,591 --> 00:05:29,820
is that there's absolutely no respect
built into it for the maternal role.

99
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:34,020
And I really think that that's,
that's appalling on a variety of levels,

100
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:38,070
including appalling for men because like
one of the things I've experienced is

101
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:42,060
that I've had a pretty intense career.
I would say.

102
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:46,320
I've been very fortunate in that manner.
I've had a lot of familial support and

103
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:48,690
support from my wife for that.
And you know,

104
00:05:48,691 --> 00:05:53,160
we kind of parsed our life up in a
relatively traditional manner because

105
00:05:53,161 --> 00:05:56,430
she was quite interested in having
children by the time we got together.

106
00:05:56,431 --> 00:06:00,440
And um,
I was perfectly willing to go along with

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:05,090
artists if I could also continue what
are my career pursuits,

108
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,820
which were also necessary for our
financial stability.

109
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,380
But for me,
like the domestic realm has been an

110
00:06:11,381 --> 00:06:13,930
incredibly meaningful part of my life.
Like I,

111
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,940
I,
I'm really happy in my marriage and

112
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,940
blast I would say in my marriage.
And I loved having kids and,

113
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,620
and for me,
my home has always been a refuge from,

114
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,740
from the insanity of the world in some
sense.

115
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:32,741
And I think our society is,
it's so crazily skewed towards public

116
00:06:32,991 --> 00:06:36,770
performance,
let's say that we've denied the utility

117
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:41,771
of the domestic sphere and that really
is terrible for women because especially

118
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,050
with regards to kids because that is
their,

119
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,050
that is the role that they dominate,
let's say,

120
00:06:48,051 --> 00:06:51,710
or,
or Dominique did they contribute most

121
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:53,750
mightily to,
let's put it that way.

122
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,510
And it,
it's almost as if our society

123
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,540
regardless,
that is kind of an emphasis on,

124
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,830
you know.
And I think it's crazy.

125
00:07:00,831 --> 00:07:02,480
I think it makes people miserable.

126
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:09,810
And I understand why the early feminists
sort of downplayed the domestic sphere

127
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:16,130
because they,
they were trapped in the domestic sphere

128
00:07:16,131 --> 00:07:21,131
and they wanted opportunities and I'm a,
I'm one of those women who would have

129
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,840
been an early feminist probably because
I crave intellectual stimulation and I

130
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:29,600
would have been,
if I'd never had an opportunity to have

131
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,610
a career,
I would have been bored and that kind of

132
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,640
thing.
But now in 2017 I can go and get a job

133
00:07:37,281 --> 00:07:40,160
as a psychologist that can run a website
and,

134
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:43,760
you know,
I can do everything that a man can,

135
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:48,170
but I'm still biologically a female.
And so when it comes to having kids,

136
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:51,500
a cost is on me and the women in my
life,

137
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:52,720
for example,
um,

138
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,430
my,
my own mother who super maternal and

139
00:07:55,431 --> 00:08:00,230
comes and helps with the children.
I see how we don't keep that status and

140
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:01,980
prestige anymore.
And it's,

141
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:06,530
it's just this a male normative sphere
where

142
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,630
you can monetize something or something,
like you said,

143
00:08:11,631 --> 00:08:13,520
public performance.
We can,

144
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:18,140
we afford that status and prestige.
But this invisible caring work that

145
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:21,980
women are so good at.
And some women are exceptional that it's

146
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,650
supported,
no prestige whatsoever.

147
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,800
There's often not

148
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,680
you know,
or notice for little kids,

149
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:30,740
for example,
even though our little kids were very

150
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,090
well behaved,
that she was treated,

151
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,640
she wasn't treated well in the public
sphere,

152
00:08:35,641 --> 00:08:39,360
she wasn't treated well in restaurants.
I think people were afraid.

153
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,460
I think that was part of it in some
sense.

154
00:08:41,461 --> 00:08:43,080
You know,
they were afraid that if she showed up

155
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:46,290
in a public place with children that
there would be disruption of one form or

156
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,124
another.
So,

157
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:51,330
but it was certainly the case that I
would say she received the opposite of

158
00:08:51,331 --> 00:08:56,331
respect and look deeply into architect
will symbolism and the function that it

159
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,570
plays in.
Of course,

160
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:02,040
one of the divine images that sits at
the bottom of western culture and

161
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,540
Western culture is the image of the
divine mother and the mother of the

162
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,570
savior of humanity,
which is an archetypal idea because

163
00:09:09,571 --> 00:09:13,140
every baby has the possibility of
growing up to be a redemptive figure.

164
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,230
Now that's,
that's the reason that that's an

165
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:20,400
archetypal figures because any society
that doesn't worship but so to speak

166
00:09:20,401 --> 00:09:24,390
doesn't give it a very high value,
will nourish.

167
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:29,250
Now the fact if the declining,
the catastrophic declining birth rate in

168
00:09:29,251 --> 00:09:33,750
the West is a real example of our
willful blindness towards that sacred

169
00:09:33,751 --> 00:09:37,980
image and it's a big problem and it is
the case that I think if,

170
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,400
if the,
if the feminists we're actually working

171
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,630
on behalf of femininity,
which is essentially what they claim,

172
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,320
that they would be working a hell of a
lot harder to elevate the status of

173
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:50,190
mothers.
You know?

174
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,091
Yeah.
Other than women,

175
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,280
I think that's a really good distinction
that you're drawing.

176
00:09:53,281 --> 00:09:55,140
Even though it seems rather self
evident,

177
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,310
it's,
it's not,

178
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,560
and you're not the same.
Once you become a mother,

179
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,180
you're a different sort of person.
And I also think women who don't have

180
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:06,280
children or rather intimidated and
afraid of that,

181
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:10,200
and that's perfectly understandable
because it isn't radical transformation.

182
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,900
But I would also say,
and I've thought this for years,

183
00:10:12,901 --> 00:10:16,770
that you don't actually become mature.
You don't actually become an adult until

184
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:19,470
you have children.
And I know that that's a statement that

185
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:24,090
irritates the hell out of people,
but it's something that I stand by it.

186
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:27,810
You're not an adult until someone else
matters more than you do.

187
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:33,740
And
to make real sacrifices.

188
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,550
Yes,
exactly.

189
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:37,980
Well,
and especially as a mother,

190
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:42,050
you sacrifice yourself as the person of
prime importance and,

191
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:43,710
and,
and you know,

192
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,553
you,
you do it,

193
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,630
I suppose happily in some sense because
generally you fall in love with your

194
00:10:48,631 --> 00:10:52,890
baby relatively rapidly and thank God
for that because their lots of trouble.

195
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,200
Um,
you know,

196
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,500
I was recounting the story of my
daughter and she is trying to.

197
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,650
She was planning to take a course in
biology online this,

198
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,820
this semester in order to move towards
the completion of her degree.

199
00:11:05,821 --> 00:11:08,630
And we told her last,
she said she was overwhelmed when we

200
00:11:08,631 --> 00:11:12,120
went and talked to her last night and we
told her just to leave it be because

201
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:17,350
first year is so intense that you're,
you're completely overwhelmed by it.

202
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:22,830
And it's necessary because you want to
get your baby off to a good start and

203
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:24,900
get that relationship functioning
properly.
