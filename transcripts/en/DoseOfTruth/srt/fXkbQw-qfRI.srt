1
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:20,420
Having your economic needs as being
higher than dealing with this unsettled

2
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,140
scenario.

3
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,820
Yeah.

4
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,150
Like being at work and fulfilling the
needs of the attached to the sides of you

5
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:26,990
by your superior,

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,540
then you still have,

7
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:30,261
you still get to survive.

8
00:00:30,261 --> 00:00:32,210
So get to easily to have
a roof over your head,

9
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,750
but you just have to sort of deal
with the consequences of this.

10
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:36,650
Like Ben settle.

11
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:37,511
Well,

12
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:38,150
I mean,

13
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:38,983
look,

14
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:43,660
I would say sometimes people are put into
positions that unsettled them and they

15
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:44,800
don't know what to do.

16
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,000
You know,

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,833
they're kind of,

18
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,750
they're screwed if they do this and
they're screwed if they do that and that's

19
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:50,381
all they can see,

20
00:00:50,381 --> 00:00:53,380
the dude and people get put
no situations all the time.

21
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:58,810
But I'm not really going to talk about
those except that people really suffer

22
00:00:58,811 --> 00:00:59,210
for that.

23
00:00:59,210 --> 00:00:59,950
You know?

24
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:00,783
Um,

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,410
partly what Rogers is talking about
is a form of optimal organization,

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:09,951
right?

27
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:13,310
So it's to be considered
as the final goal.

28
00:01:13,311 --> 00:01:14,031
In some sense.

29
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:15,380
It's what you're working towards.

30
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,680
I think it's very difficult
to live in a way that you,

31
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,890
so that you never encounter
contradictions as you move forward.

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,730
In fact,

33
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,850
that's precisely what does
happen as you move forward.

34
00:01:25,851 --> 00:01:28,850
And it's up to you on the fly to argue,

35
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:32,960
to organize your response to those
contradictions in a manner that doesn't

36
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,060
destabilize the entire structure.

37
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,021
But you know,

38
00:01:36,021 --> 00:01:38,300
the entire structure is a
strange thing because again,

39
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:41,270
Rogers Rogers has got a psychoanalytic,

40
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:41,901
well,

41
00:01:41,901 --> 00:01:43,100
it's not exactly right.

42
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,570
It's complicated.

43
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:47,960
Okay?

44
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,890
The hierarchy that Roger's describes
this characteristic of the self,

45
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,210
this is something he
doesn't discuss that much.

46
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,590
The hierarchy that you make of yourself
is not independent of the way that you

47
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:02,150
fit into hierarchies in the world.

48
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:06,310
So really by hierarchically re organizing
yourself at the same time you're

49
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,030
hierarchically organizing the world.

50
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:09,500
And so part of the problem is,

51
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,790
is that if you destabilize yourself or
if you've come up with a sub optimal

52
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:14,624
solution,

53
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:15,440
there's a,

54
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,020
there's a twist there that's going to,

55
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,830
it's going to follow you up.

56
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,371
Now,

57
00:02:19,371 --> 00:02:21,020
it may be the best that you've got.

58
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,520
Sometimes that happens,

59
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:23,060
you know,

60
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,930
I'm not saying you can always solve
a problem in an optimal manner,

61
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,090
you know?

62
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,900
Do you remember the movie Sophie's choice?

63
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,911
You can never see that.

64
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:31,744
It's an old movie.

65
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:35,380
MMM Sophie.

66
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,450
It's a movie about that,

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,120
about Germany during the Nazi period,

68
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,520
she had to choose which of her two
children was going to be shocked.

69
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:44,801
Well,

70
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:45,101
you know,

71
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:47,500
it's pretty hard to
come up with an optimal.

72
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,850
So let me shift to that.

73
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:50,690
All right.

74
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,523
So

75
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:58,030
Roger's though didn't really think that
that actual problems in life constituted

76
00:02:58,031 --> 00:02:59,140
psychopathology.

77
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,090
That's sort of more of the existentialist,

78
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,070
although he had an existential quit,

79
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,750
he was thinking more that what constituted
psychopathology per se instead of

80
00:03:07,751 --> 00:03:12,340
just plain ordinary suffering was the
contradictions that arose because people

81
00:03:12,341 --> 00:03:17,341
fail to use their potential for
articulation in a manner that continually

82
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,790
fostered their integration.

83
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:22,571
So he would say,

84
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:25,540
well to the degree that you are
going to use instrumental language,

85
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,740
it's not a term he used,

86
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,000
but it's a good summary of,

87
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,800
of his philosophy that you were
bringing to bear on yourself,

88
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:34,360
unnecessary and others around you.

89
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,250
Unnecessary pain and suffering.

90
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,710
And that was psychopathological.

91
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,280
It's psychopathological because it's
unnecessary because in principle it could

92
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,114
be avoided.

93
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,203
So,

94
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,030
so that's the idea.

95
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,120
And so the idea as well is that the
organizing principle that brings you into

96
00:03:55,191 --> 00:04:00,191
this optimally functioning hierarchy is
your commitment to truth to accurately

97
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:03,620
represent what it is that you experience.

98
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,790
And that's again,

99
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:09,230
you know how Piaget talked about the
fundamental truth as a process rather than

100
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:10,690
as a state or a fact.

101
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,750
It's the case for Rogerian
phenomena phenomenology as well.

102
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:17,480
And you could kind of understand that
because of course therapists are dealing

103
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:18,620
with people,

104
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,170
living people and life is a process,

105
00:04:21,171 --> 00:04:22,010
not a state.

106
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,840
And so Rogers was concentrating
very much on the process,

107
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:31,100
which he regarded as absolutely
crucial and believed that the process,

108
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,300
the process properly implemented
would bring about the best possible

109
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:36,290
organization.

110
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,380
And then we'll update that
organization has necessary too.

111
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,260
So it's a radical idea.

112
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,000
But I would also say that it's
fundamentally rooted in his Protestant

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,880
Christianity because one of the tenants
of Christianity is that the word orders

114
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,723
chaos.

115
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,550
And so that idea was lurking at the
bottom of Roger's conceptual structure and

116
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:57,831
you know,

117
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:02,150
he was intelligent enough to
articulate it fully in a modern way.

118
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,860
That's still where it came from.

119
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:05,650
Okay.

120
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,780
Now it's an older idea of,

121
00:05:06,781 --> 00:05:07,614
of Christianity.

122
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,120
So.
