1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:10,550
Question.
How is capitalism compatible with your

2
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:15,140
definition of good if it requires every
increasing uses of the finite resources

3
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:18,110
of the planet,
where once depleted would mean our end?

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,290
Well,
I would say capitalism isn't compatible

5
00:00:21,291 --> 00:00:25,130
with my definition of good if it
requires every increasing uses of the

6
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:29,360
finite resources of the planet.
But that's by no means self evident even

7
00:00:29,361 --> 00:00:31,640
though the Scuttlebutt,
let's say,

8
00:00:31,641 --> 00:00:36,110
especially among the environmentalist
oriented types who might have some

9
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:37,400
sympathy for,
by the way,

10
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:39,470
especially with regards to ocean
depletion.

11
00:00:39,970 --> 00:00:41,930
Um,
there's a huge argument and there has

12
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:44,420
been for many,
many years between the economists and

13
00:00:44,421 --> 00:00:46,550
the biologists.
And this is a really important thing to

14
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:50,780
know and he economists' point out that
human ingenuity is such that we're

15
00:00:50,781 --> 00:00:55,781
continually able to make more with less.
And certainly over the last well,

16
00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:00,290
500 years that the,
especially in the last 150 years,

17
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,850
that's just absolutely evident.

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,950
You know,
like people say we're going to run out

19
00:01:03,951 --> 00:01:06,410
of energy and I think that's absolutely
preposterous.

20
00:01:06,411 --> 00:01:08,480
It's like this,
it is craziest thinking we're going to

21
00:01:08,481 --> 00:01:10,630
run out of matter.
I mean we're,

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,560
we're going through a bit of a
bottleneck right now because you know,

23
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,820
the population is going to increase to
about 9 billion and then it's going to

24
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:18,350
decrease.
That's,

25
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,760
that's the most reliable projections and
9 billion isn't a lot more than we have

26
00:01:22,761 --> 00:01:24,050
now.
And you know,

27
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,130
there's going to be some environmental
disruption as a consequence of that.

28
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:31,850
But I don't think there's any reason to
assume it all that capitalism

29
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:35,780
necessarily requires ever increasing
uses of the finite resources of the

30
00:01:35,781 --> 00:01:38,330
planet.
It's also not obvious to what degree the

31
00:01:38,331 --> 00:01:43,331
resources of the planet are actually
finite because we can continually think

32
00:01:43,881 --> 00:01:47,660
up new uses for things that nobody
thought had any use at all.

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,410
And so it depends to some degree on
whether or not you're willing to bet on

34
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,650
human imaginativeness or you're going to
be a Malthusian pessimists.

35
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:59,660
And I'm not saying that there aren't
reasons for both.

36
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:03,380
I'm just saying that it is by no means
self evident that things are getting

37
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:04,670
worse.
You know,

38
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:07,250
like I can give you an example.
So,

39
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,020
you know,
in the last,

40
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,790
in the last 15 years,
the millennium goal for the UN was to

41
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,070
have world poverty,
like absolute poverty.

42
00:02:16,071 --> 00:02:19,960
So that's less than a dollar 50 day by
50% within 15 years.

43
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,760
That was actually reached ahead of
schedule.

44
00:02:22,761 --> 00:02:26,390
And we've lifted hundreds of millions of
people into the middle class over the

45
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:29,750
last 30 years.
And so there is an increasing inequality

46
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:34,400
in the west because the working class is
taking the brunt of that say that

47
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:37,460
redistribution to third world countries.
But by the same token,

48
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:39,620
you know,
there's no starvation in the world

49
00:02:39,621 --> 00:02:42,980
anymore except really for reasons of
misdistribution and,

50
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,193
and,
and,

51
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,680
and political purpose.

52
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,280
And people are becoming richer and more
educated all the time.

53
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,240
And,
you know,

54
00:02:50,241 --> 00:02:53,450
when we are waking up to our planet,
your responsibilities,

55
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:57,600
once people stopped starving to death
and having to burn like dirt and,

56
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,030
and eat,
you know,

57
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,780
substandard food that they've scraped
out of the Brown,

58
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,500
they do start to turn their attention to
things that might be more aesthetic.

59
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,340
And so,
look,

60
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:08,500
I don't think there's any reason to be
pessimistic.

61
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:12,850
Not Fundamentally.
And I guess the reason that capitalism

62
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,920
is compatible with my definition of
good,

63
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:18,760
I wouldn't say that exactly.
I would say that I don't see an

64
00:03:18,761 --> 00:03:23,230
alternative that has manifested itself
that doesn't have far more negative

65
00:03:23,231 --> 00:03:24,850
consequences.
You know,

66
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:27,340
it's sort of a minimal pessimism issue.
It's like,

67
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,890
well,
this is the best devil that we have.

68
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,760
And I do believe it is because the,
uh,

69
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,040
the successful societies,
by any stretch of the imagination,

70
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:40,480
by virtually any metric are the
capitalist societies.

71
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,100
It's certainly the case,
for example,

72
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:46,660
that the Soviet Union demolished far
more of its natural resources to far

73
00:03:46,661 --> 00:03:47,910
less,
uh,

74
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,000
productive consequence than the Westin.
There's evidence,

75
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,500
there's suggestions that between 10 and
15% of the total area of the Soviet

76
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:59,140
Union has been rendered more or less
permanently uninhabitable.

77
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,050
So the question is,
compared to what.
