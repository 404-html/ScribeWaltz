1
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,530
Don't do the Marxists,

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,980
have sympathy for the working class.

3
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,350
Okay.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:18,790
George Orwell was interested in this
question and so he wrote this book called

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,410
Wagon Road to Wigan pier,

6
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,480
which I would highly recommend it.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,160
It's on a reading list I made.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,300
It's on my website.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,440
You can check that out.

10
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,960
Those are books that have been
particularly influential to me.

11
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:30,243
And so,

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,610
yeah,

13
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:31,780
well,

14
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,980
it was a socialist.

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,160
He wrote the book for the Left Book Club,

16
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:40,810
which published a kind of a
socialist book once a month or,

17
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:41,021
well,

18
00:00:41,021 --> 00:00:42,250
by the time he wrote this book,

19
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,990
he was already awake.

20
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:45,910
Okay.

21
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:46,200
You know,

22
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,381
by,

23
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,190
in the 1920s after the Russian revolution,

24
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,780
no one really knew what to make of what
was happening in what would become the

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:54,781
Soviet Union.

26
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:55,300
Right.

27
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:55,770
Be,

28
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,190
it was after World War
One planet was in ashes.

29
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,110
For all intents and purposes,

30
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,680
the old aristocratic order was crumbling.

31
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,643
MMM.

32
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,800
It was a horror show.

33
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,460
And these revolutionaries came out with
these new ideas and tried to give the in

34
00:01:14,191 --> 00:01:14,850
principle,

35
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,280
give the working class a break and
everybody watched to see what would happen

36
00:01:18,281 --> 00:01:19,114
then.

37
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,393
MMM.

38
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,570
The honest people and the intellectuals
watched and I separate them for a

39
00:01:25,571 --> 00:01:26,404
reason.

40
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,190
Um,

41
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,590
but by 19 2021,

42
00:01:29,591 --> 00:01:30,071
22,

43
00:01:30,071 --> 00:01:31,150
something like that,

44
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,020
it was obvious already that something
was rotten in the state of Denmark.

45
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,470
Malcolm Muggeridge went over to the
Soviet Union to check out how the

46
00:01:38,471 --> 00:01:42,190
collectivization of the farms was going
and he found out it was actually pretty

47
00:01:42,191 --> 00:01:43,024
murderous,

48
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,381
right?

49
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:45,130
Because what this,

50
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:48,610
what the Communists did was round up
all the successful farmers and rape them

51
00:01:48,611 --> 00:01:51,610
and kill them and steal everything
they had and send them off to Siberia,

52
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,460
which turned out actually
to be a pretty bad idea.

53
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,010
Now you think you think about it,

54
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:00,100
those people were serfs
not very long before,

55
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:01,810
a couple of generations at most.

56
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,940
And they were so not
much more than slaves.

57
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:07,540
And some of them had risen up to the point
where to me it had a nice brick house

58
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:10,210
and a couple of cows and maybe a
person working for them or too,

59
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:15,160
and there was a small proportion of the
agriculturalists in the Soviet Union

60
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,320
that we're producing most of the food.

61
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,520
And that's just how it goes.

62
00:02:18,521 --> 00:02:20,710
Because that's a Prieto
distribution issue.

63
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:24,280
In any field where there's
human productivity,

64
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:27,280
a small proportion of the people
produce almost all of the output.

65
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,910
It's actually the square root of the
number of people in the field produce half

66
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:31,630
the output.

67
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,770
So if you have a hundred farmers,

68
00:02:32,771 --> 00:02:34,270
10 of them produce half the food.

69
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,100
But if you have 10,000
to a hundred of them,

70
00:02:36,101 --> 00:02:37,150
produce half the food.

71
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:38,441
Okay?

72
00:02:38,441 --> 00:02:41,170
So what happens when you
kill all the good farmers,

73
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,180
you starve 6 million Ukrainians
to death in the 1930s.

74
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,321
And you know,

75
00:02:47,321 --> 00:02:49,450
that's not something that's
all that widely known.

76
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,650
But if you want to,

77
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,003
uh,

78
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:55,150
provide some additional
fodder for your nightmares,

79
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:59,080
you could go online and read about what
happened to the Ukrainians in the 1930s

80
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:01,320
so that underneath the,

81
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,670
under the collectivization principles,

82
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,150
so let's say you were a mother and you
were starving to death and so are your

83
00:03:07,151 --> 00:03:07,631
children.

84
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,800
And you know,

85
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:11,890
the communists had come in and
forcibly collectivized you.

86
00:03:11,891 --> 00:03:15,340
And then they took all the grain that
your collective farm had produced and they

87
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,430
shipped it all to the city,

88
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:16,711
say,

89
00:03:16,711 --> 00:03:17,980
and so that's all done.

90
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:18,491
And you think,

91
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:18,911
okay,

92
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:23,911
you know the city's got eat and so then
you go out in the field to pick up the

93
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,800
grains that the harvesters
missed so that you can,

94
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,131
you know,

95
00:03:27,131 --> 00:03:28,780
the ones that they'd been lying there,

96
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:29,770
they're not so good.

97
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,940
There's not that many of them.

98
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,170
You go out and glean,

99
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,570
you pick up the seeds
that weren't picked up.

100
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:35,740
Ah,

101
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,900
so you can feed your
kids so they don't die.

102
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,810
And so what's the
punishment for that death?

103
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,210
Because you were obliged under the
collectivization orders to turn in any

104
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,710
additional grains that you happen to
pick off the ground to the authorities so

105
00:03:50,711 --> 00:03:51,670
that they could be,

106
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,020
well who knows,

107
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,393
but at least so you,

108
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,020
so they could be shipped to the cities,

109
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:56,621
I suppose,

110
00:03:56,621 --> 00:03:59,560
which is of course absurd because
of course that would never happen,

111
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,680
but it was mostly so that
you could just actually die.

112
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:04,271
So,

113
00:04:04,271 --> 00:04:05,104
okay.

114
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,131
Anyways,

115
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,140
back to the road to Wigan pier now.

116
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,520
Okay.

117
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,020
I'm going to read you a little bit about,

118
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,400
about from the book.

119
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:20,430
So or well went out to this mining town
in the northern UK and coal miners.

120
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,780
Orwell had sympathy for the working class.

121
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:29,380
He really worked on that his whole
life cause he was a middle class,

122
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,420
upper middle class,

123
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,640
snobby type Englishman.

124
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:34,480
And he knew it.

125
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:35,800
Um,

126
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,690
and he tried really hard to overcome that.

127
00:04:37,691 --> 00:04:38,160
He,

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,860
he,

129
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:41,050
he served in the Spanish civil war.

130
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,060
He wandered around as a tramp.

131
00:04:43,061 --> 00:04:43,860
He worked in,

132
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,090
in,

133
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,340
in low end restaurant.

134
00:04:45,341 --> 00:04:48,850
He worked as a low end worker in
restaurants in Paris and in London.

135
00:04:48,851 --> 00:04:50,500
He has a very good book,

136
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:54,400
I think it's called down and out in Paris
and London that describes that he was

137
00:04:54,401 --> 00:04:57,460
seriously committed dude
and really a smart guy.

138
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,330
And so he's going up to these terrible
towns in the northern UK where the coal

139
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:06,280
miners worked and have
their families and you know,

140
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,720
they had hard lives.

141
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,190
They had hard lives.

142
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,780
And that's just saying nothing.

143
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:11,770
You know,

144
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,690
the coal miners that he met,

145
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,210
they didn't have any teeth
by the time they were 30.

146
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,440
He said the women he talked to
said teeth or just a misery.

147
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:22,660
It's better to get rid of
them as soon as you can.

148
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,003
Um,

149
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:24,551
and,

150
00:05:24,551 --> 00:05:24,941
and,

151
00:05:24,941 --> 00:05:28,390
and they went and the man went
and mined coal and that was rough.

152
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:28,631
You know,

153
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,630
they all have black lung by the
time they were 40 and they were,

154
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,220
they were done fundamentally.

155
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,200
But here's a,

156
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,000
just a bit,

157
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,990
a bit of a story about
how hard their lives were.

158
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:42,991
So they had to go in the minds during
the day so that they never saw the day.

159
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:44,440
So that's one thing.

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,700
They had to go to the
mines and then they have,

161
00:05:45,701 --> 00:05:48,400
they'd like narc coal off the walls.

162
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,300
That's hard with hammers and picks and
all of that and they had to move it.

163
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,613
But that was,

164
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,670
that was their job.

165
00:05:54,671 --> 00:05:56,170
But there was the commute.

166
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,560
So here was the commute.

167
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,290
So imagine that the typical
tunnel was about that high,

168
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:01,310
something like that.

169
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,710
And the typical coal
miner was about that high.

170
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,970
Lots of problem.

171
00:06:04,971 --> 00:06:05,091
A,

172
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:07,280
because you've got to walk through
those titles to get to work.

173
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,780
So you have to walk like this.

174
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,190
Then the question might be,

175
00:06:10,191 --> 00:06:12,620
well how far do you have to walk to work?

176
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,720
And the answer is three and a half miles.

177
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:19,130
And that's how far you have to walk back
from work after you've put your eight

178
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:23,240
hour shift and at the coal mine and
the you don't get paid for the commute.

179
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:28,570
And so or well said that was more or less
like climbing a small mountain in the

180
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,780
morning before you went to work and then
climbing another one at night before

181
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:33,614
you went home.

182
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,330
And so that was just,

183
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,170
I mean,

184
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:36,801
believe me,

185
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:39,500
I'm telling you very little
about how tough their lives were,

186
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:41,000
but that gives you a little flavor.

187
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,220
I said one day like that
for a modern person,

188
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:46,160
you're just your dad k or you
wish you were dead anyways.

189
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:51,760
And so Orwell talks about going up there
to stay and terrible places he lived in

190
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:55,010
while he was up there and
the terrible food he ate and,

191
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,710
and the miserable and
wretched scenes that he saw.

192
00:06:57,711 --> 00:06:59,870
And here's one of the
miserable wretched scenes.

193
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,140
He's on a train through the neighborhoods.

194
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:03,441
He says,

195
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:07,700
the train bore me away through
the monster scenery of slag heaps,

196
00:07:07,701 --> 00:07:10,490
chimneys piled scrap
iron follow of canals,

197
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:12,110
paths of cindery mud,

198
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,300
criss cross by the Prince of clogs.

199
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,380
This was march,

200
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,140
but the weather had been horribly cold
and everywhere there were mounds of black

201
00:07:20,141 --> 00:07:21,350
and snow.

202
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,170
As we move slowly through
the outskirts of the town,

203
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:29,171
we passed row after row of little gray
slum houses running at right angles to

204
00:07:29,181 --> 00:07:32,590
the embankment at the
back of one of the houses.

205
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,680
A young woman was kneeling on the stones
poking a stick up the lead and waste

206
00:07:36,681 --> 00:07:38,900
pipe which ran from the sink inside,

207
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:40,760
which I suppose was blocked.

208
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,370
I had time to see everything about her.

209
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,610
Her sack apron or clumsy clogs her arms.

210
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:47,960
Reddened by the cold.

211
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,760
She looked up as the train passed and
I was almost near enough to catch your

212
00:07:52,761 --> 00:07:53,594
eye.

213
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,760
She had around Pale face,

214
00:07:55,950 --> 00:08:00,500
the usual exhausted face of the slum
girl who's 25 and looks 40 thanks to

215
00:08:00,501 --> 00:08:05,480
miscarriages and drudgery and at war for
the second in which I sought the most

216
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:06,081
desolate,

217
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:08,330
hopeless expression I've ever seen.

218
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,371
It struck me.

219
00:08:10,371 --> 00:08:13,460
Then we meaning the
middle class at that time,

220
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,041
our mistake,

221
00:08:14,041 --> 00:08:18,510
and when we say that it isn't the same
for them as it would be for us and the

222
00:08:18,511 --> 00:08:22,700
people bread in the slums can imagine
nothing but the slums for what I saw on

223
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:25,850
her face was by no means the
ignorant suffering of an animal.

224
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,160
She knew well enough what
was happening to her,

225
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,110
understood as well as I did,

226
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,810
how dreadful a destiny it was to be
kneeling there in the bitter cold on the

227
00:08:33,811 --> 00:08:38,811
slimy stones of a slum backyard poking
a stick up of followed drain pipe.

228
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,113
All right,

229
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,383
so

230
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:48,950
Orwell rates the first part of the book
and it details the lives of these people

231
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,140
and then he makes an argument,

232
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:51,771
he says like,

233
00:08:51,771 --> 00:08:52,910
how can you read about this?

234
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:56,610
How can you know about this
without having sympathy for

235
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,410
redistribution schemes and
social and socialist ideas?

236
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:05,620
And so he's actually asking
himself this question.

237
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:07,330
It's not just a rhetorical question.

238
00:09:07,331 --> 00:09:08,140
He's,

239
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:08,321
I mean,

240
00:09:08,321 --> 00:09:09,310
he's a serious guy,

241
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:09,551
right?

242
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:09,850
He went,

243
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,810
he goes up there and he tells you a
story that you have to have a heart of

244
00:09:13,811 --> 00:09:14,531
stone.

245
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:14,861
If you,

246
00:09:14,861 --> 00:09:15,401
if you don't,

247
00:09:15,401 --> 00:09:15,971
if you read that,

248
00:09:15,971 --> 00:09:16,541
you don't think,

249
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:16,841
man,

250
00:09:16,841 --> 00:09:18,040
something should be done about this.

251
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,150
It's really awful.

252
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,360
So he set up this situation where your
sympathies are completely with the people

253
00:09:25,991 --> 00:09:27,070
that he's describing.

254
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:32,000
But socialism wasn't all that
popular in Britain at that time.

255
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:32,630
And,

256
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,470
and so,

257
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,040
and socialists weren't all
that popular with Orwell.

258
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,520
He didn't really like them that much
and he was trying to figure out why that

259
00:09:40,521 --> 00:09:41,354
was.

260
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,513
Okay.

261
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:46,760
So this is what he wrote in
the second part of the book.

262
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,361
Now this God,

263
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:48,590
I'm in a lot of trouble.

264
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:52,370
They didn't want to publish this damn
book after we wrote the second part.

265
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,153
Uh,

266
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,690
but he fought with him and he got it
published and it's a classic and people

267
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:02,130
still read it and you should read it
because it's a great book and Orwell's a

268
00:10:02,131 --> 00:10:03,040
great writer.

269
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,540
And we're well as another one of those
people and intellectuals who woke up

270
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,141
pretty early,

271
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:08,471
you know,

272
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:13,471
or well wrote animal farm in 1984 he
wrote in 1984 in 1948 wrote animal farm

273
00:10:15,491 --> 00:10:17,230
approximately around the same time.

274
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:19,720
He knew what was happening under Stalin.

275
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,760
And he wasn't afraid to say it,

276
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:26,140
but it was a message that in
some sense fell on deaf ears,

277
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,270
especially among the intelligentsia.

278
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,160
And there's complicated reasons for that.

279
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:30,821
But,

280
00:10:30,821 --> 00:10:31,654
um,

281
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,230
but it wasn't like the facts weren't there
for people to see them if they wanted

282
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:35,650
to.

283
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:39,070
And has already said Muggeridge Malcolm
Muggeridge had made it pretty clear in

284
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:41,860
the 1920s and that was
widely publicized by the way,

285
00:10:41,861 --> 00:10:42,790
throughout the UK,

286
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:45,670
what was happening during de [inaudible],

287
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:49,540
the kulaks being the farmers
that I talked about earlier,

288
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:50,170
who,

289
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,170
who had committed the unspeakable sin of
crawling out of their surf status over

290
00:10:56,921 --> 00:11:01,921
a couple of generations to the point where
they weren't mirror property and half

291
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:03,010
starved.
