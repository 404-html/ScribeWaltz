1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,540
And I would say that one of the things
that drives the collectivist ethos,

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,560
which is often formulated in terms
of compassion for the oppressed,

3
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:19,050
which is something we'll talk
about a little bit later,

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,370
is actually a deep desire to at all costs,

5
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,800
avoid that responsibility.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,930
And it's no wonder because the
responsibility is overwhelming.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,710
Say The world fundamentally
is a tragic place,

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:35,671
right?

9
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:40,671
It's a place in which each of us is
broken and it's contaminated by the ever

10
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,430
present reality of betrayal
and malevolence and to
shoulder the responsibility

11
00:00:47,731 --> 00:00:50,010
first for even admitting to that.

12
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,670
And second for assuming
that you are duty bound,

13
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:56,844
let's say,

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,620
to do something about that.

15
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,041
Well,

16
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:04,041
that's a task that anyone who has his
or her eyes open should be leery of

17
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,154
accepting.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,210
And I would say,

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,261
well,

20
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:11,820
perhaps there's no credible reason for
accepting it except that every other

21
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,290
alternative is worse.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:14,870
Okay?

23
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,940
And so that's a brutal fact.

24
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,460
So the antidote to
collectivism is individualism,

25
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:27,461
but it's not the individualism of
the privileged person with rights.

26
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:33,550
It's the terrible burden of the individual
who determines that he or she will

27
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:37,280
shoulder their
responsibility to that most.

28
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:43,340
So I developed that
idea in maps of meaning

29
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,590
that,

30
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,990
and I made a lot of
lectures about that book,

31
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,180
many of which are on Youtube,

32
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:54,200
some of which have become widely viewed,

33
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,080
I would say by a hundreds
of thousands of people now.

34
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:02,620
And so that and that course always had
a dramatic effect on my students and

35
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,970
their most typical comment.

36
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:07,430
There's two classes of typical comments.

37
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:08,660
Okay.

38
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,340
That I got from students about
my maps of meaning courses,

39
00:02:11,341 --> 00:02:11,521
isn't it?

40
00:02:11,521 --> 00:02:14,540
It's the same comments that I get from
people now when they come and talk to me

41
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:15,380
about my lectures.

42
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,240
The first comment is,

43
00:02:17,241 --> 00:02:19,760
and this is about maybe
a quarter of the people,

44
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:20,923
is that

45
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:25,230
watching the lectures
are taking the course,

46
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:28,500
enabled them to put words
to things they knew,

47
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,450
they knew but didn't know how to say.

48
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,011
And so,

49
00:02:32,011 --> 00:02:35,820
and that's fine because that was an ex
that was actually an explicit purpose of

50
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,870
the writing and the course.

51
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,110
And the second is that it helped
people straightened out their lives.

52
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:45,240
And that's also not that surprising to
me because a lot of what I integrated

53
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:50,241
into that book and the lectures and then
the lectures were also associated with

54
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:55,371
my personality course were ideas from
the great clinical psychologists and

55
00:02:55,561 --> 00:02:57,690
psychiatrists of the 20th century.

56
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,440
It was a dozen of them or so,

57
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,950
or maybe 20 who were all
outstanding geniuses,

58
00:03:02,951 --> 00:03:07,951
have slightly different types who learned
all sorts of things about how people

59
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,650
could put them self together
properly as individuals.

60
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,390
And if you learn about those things,

61
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,100
they're actually really helpful.

62
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,900
That's not surprising because they
sit at the core of an entire domain of

63
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,820
science and art,

64
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:22,301
let's say,

65
00:03:22,301 --> 00:03:24,820
devoted to improving
people's individual lives.

66
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:31,740
I wove the responsibility idea into 12
rules cause that's really what it is.

67
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,351
In some sense.

68
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:40,351
It's a call to the voluntary adoption
of maximal individual responsibility and

69
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:44,710
it's a psychological work,

70
00:03:44,711 --> 00:03:45,790
not a political work.

71
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:50,820
Now I think the reason that it's
attracted so much political attention,

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,020
let's say some of which gun lager
referred to in the introduction is,

73
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,041
well,

74
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,761
there's two reasons.

75
00:03:57,761 --> 00:04:01,750
One is because I took what might be
regarded as a political stance about some

76
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:04,330
compelled speech legislation in Canada.

77
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:08,950
I never regarded that as a political
move because I regarded the legislation

78
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:11,560
itself as something that
wasn't a political move.

79
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,350
I regarded it as an attempt
by the politicians to jump
outside their domain of

80
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:22,180
acceptable conduct into the philosophical
or even the theological realm because

81
00:04:22,181 --> 00:04:27,181
you don't mess with the idea of
free speech in a Western country.

82
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:30,370
And there's very sophisticated
reasons for that.

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,640
And it doesn't matter what
your reasons for doing it are.

84
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,860
You don't go there.

85
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,880
And so,

86
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,770
but it happened to be the more radical
leftists that were pushing this forward.

87
00:04:41,771 --> 00:04:43,180
And because I objected to it,

88
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:47,920
then it was in their interest to assume
that I must be the worst sort of right

89
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:48,720
wing.

90
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,350
Um,

91
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,040
die hard I suppose,

92
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:55,810
because otherwise they'd have to
contend with my actual arguments.

93
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,550
And so it's simpler just to shoot the
messenger than to contend with the

94
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:01,384
arguments.

95
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:01,901
And you know,

96
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:06,670
if you stand up and say there's something
wrong in a place like Canada where

97
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,930
most things aren't wrong,

98
00:05:07,931 --> 00:05:11,350
then it's reasonable also for people
to assume there must be something wrong

99
00:05:11,351 --> 00:05:14,650
with you because most of the time there
isn't anything wrong with the country

100
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,970
and so a certain amount of testing is
a reasonable thing for people to do.

101
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,410
I guess the other element of this
that's political in some sense though,

102
00:05:25,411 --> 00:05:28,110
is that within the collectivist viewpoint,

103
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,170
this is something that's very
interesting with regard to free speech.

104
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,600
I didn't really figure this out
until a couple of weeks ago.

105
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:36,030
Although the radical leftists,

106
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,340
and you see this particularly
in the United States now,

107
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:42,360
although the Americans have a very
strong tradition of free speech,

108
00:05:42,361 --> 00:05:46,200
the radical leftists are
opposed to freedom of speech,

109
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,550
but that's not really right.

110
00:05:47,551 --> 00:05:48,570
It's not the way to think about it.

111
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,470
In the radical leftist
collectivist view of the world,

112
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,110
there's actually no such
thing as free speech.

113
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,770
It said worst then,

114
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
then opposing it because the collectivists
believe that you're nothing but an

115
00:06:03,381 --> 00:06:04,790
Avatar of your group.

116
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,421
First of all,

117
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,470
there is no you.

118
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,750
You're defined by your group membership.

119
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:14,170
And then the world is a landscape of
groups each vying for predominance.

120
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,090
And that's what there is.

121
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,923
And it's,

122
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,410
and so when you say that
you're speaking your mind,

123
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,400
that isn't something that you can
do from the collectivist viewpoint.

124
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,820
What you're doing is acting as an
unconscious Avatar of the power demands of

125
00:06:31,251 --> 00:06:32,084
your group.

126
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,350
There's no you,

127
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,820
there was no free speech.

128
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,230
There's no your opinion.

129
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,210
There's no facts for that matter.

130
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,540
Everything is to be viewed in relationship
to the power struggle between groups

131
00:06:43,941 --> 00:06:46,400
that even in principle cannot communicate.

132
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,060
And so the other reason that I detest,

133
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,270
let's say the collectivist viewpoint is
because I see that it leads nowhere but

134
00:06:56,691 --> 00:06:57,524
to conflict.

135
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:02,890
Because if people cannot speak
as individuals between groups,

136
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:06,980
then all they can do is submit or fight.

137
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,780
Those are the options,

138
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,913
right?

139
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,480
Negotiation,

140
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,420
capitulation or warfare.

141
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,430
Those are the options.

142
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:17,840
And the only

143
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:24,460
process that allows for negotiation in
the absence of capitulation or conflict

144
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,630
is speech.

145
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,310
Because we can talk over our differences
and that discussion is going to be

146
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,730
contentious because we
actually have differences.

147
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:39,470
But compared to the contentiousness
of not talking over the differences,

148
00:07:39,650 --> 00:07:41,180
it's a walk in the park.

149
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,020
You know,

150
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:46,220
I saw something quite remarkable that
when I was in London a month and a half

151
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:46,730
ago,

152
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:50,870
I was on this political show and one of
the things they did in this section that

153
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:55,871
didn't have anything to do with me
was to show a bunch of clips from the,

154
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,110
the,

155
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:57,710
the,

156
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,570
there's a question period that the British
have evolved where the opposition can

157
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:04,100
go after the prime minister.

158
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:08,750
And the woman that was appearing with
me on the show had written a book about

159
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:10,520
that called Punch and Judy,

160
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,050
if I remember correctly,

161
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:17,290
and they showed a bunch of
clips of English mps attacking
the prime minister and

162
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,050
the prime minister's response all
the way from Thatcher forward.

163
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,380
It was absolutely vicious in the way that,

164
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,780
well educated British
people can be vicious,

165
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:29,300
which is very impressive
form of viciousness.

166
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,150
Um,

167
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:30,450
Eh,

168
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,740
it was no holds barred verbal combat.

169
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,761
And you might think,

170
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,540
well,

171
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:36,680
isn't that horrible?

172
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,330
Because it's certainly rife,

173
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:40,400
let's say with micro aggressions,

174
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,080
but it's not horrible because none of
them had their hands around each other's

175
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:45,914
necks,

176
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:46,820
right?

177
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,080
It was all civilized.

178
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:51,110
It was everyone was standing where they
were supposed to stand and they were

179
00:08:51,111 --> 00:08:55,770
hurling invective and making criticisms
and making accusations and defending

180
00:08:55,771 --> 00:08:56,880
themselves and all of that.

181
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:02,150
But it was all contained within
the peaceful confines of this,

182
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,230
of the house of parliament.

183
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,970
And that's our miracle,

184
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:06,990
really.

185
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,920
It's a miracle.

186
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:10,380
And the British are
particularly good at that.

187
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,690
And so you leave free speech alone
because the alternative to free speeches,

188
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,150
capitulation or conflict,

189
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,970
and unless you want one of those or both,

190
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,350
and you might,

191
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,090
then you don't interfere with the
mechanism that enables people's people to

192
00:09:27,390 --> 00:09:31,530
state the nature of their reality and
to clarify that and to negotiate with

193
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:32,070
others,

194
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:35,400
even though that negotiation is
painful and emotionally demanding and

195
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:40,401
threatening and anxiety provoking and
aggression instigating and all of those

196
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:42,000
things,

197
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,920
because the alternative is far worse.
