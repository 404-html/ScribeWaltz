1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:10,020
Thought I'd start by just letting you
know why I was objecting specifically to

2
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:12,390
build see 16.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,020
Um,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,020
I made three videos in
late September and uh,

5
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:24,020
one of them criticized [inaudible] 16
and one of them criticize the University

6
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:25,871
of Toronto Administrations,

7
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:30,871
the human resources peoples decision
to make so called anti unconscious anti

8
00:00:33,271 --> 00:00:37,200
bias training mandatory
for their HR staff,

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:40,200
which I thought was and still
think was reprehensible.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,353
And uh,

11
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:47,430
I don't even remember what
the other one was about,

12
00:00:47,431 --> 00:00:48,390
but it doesn't really matter.

13
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:49,000
Those were,

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,920
that was the first one.

15
00:00:49,921 --> 00:00:53,940
The one on bill see 16 that caused
most of the fewer surprisingly enough.

16
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:57,870
And I said I wouldn't use the made up.

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,250
What I consider neologisms that
purport to describe the status,

18
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,930
the status of people whose sexual identity
is ambiguous because that isn't how

19
00:01:13,771 --> 00:01:14,311
it looked to me.

20
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:19,311
It looked to me like these words
like z and Zurr and so forth were the

21
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:25,041
linguistic vanguard of a intellectual
movement that I would say detest is

22
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:26,960
probably the right

23
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:29,310
description.

24
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,310
And that's this strange
blend of postmodernism and
Marxism that has emerged to

25
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:38,190
occupy the bulk of the humanities.

26
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:40,030
And a good chunk of the social sciences.

27
00:01:40,031 --> 00:01:45,030
And so that was the first thing
is that I'm not using those words.

28
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,740
That was the first
thing that was personal,

29
00:01:46,741 --> 00:01:47,041
right?

30
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,760
Is that that's not a form of linguistic
game that I'm willing to play.

31
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,280
And I have my reasons for that.

32
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,790
The second was I regard the ledge.

33
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:01,820
Any legislation that compels people to
use a certain kind of language as a very

34
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:03,384
dangerous,

35
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:03,871
first of all,

36
00:02:03,871 --> 00:02:05,970
dangerous piece of legislation directly,

37
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:08,340
but also a very dangerous precedent.

38
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,840
I mean,

39
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,190
there are limits on free speech that are
already reasonably well instantiated in

40
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:14,850
the law.

41
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,530
You can't incite a crime,

42
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:20,190
you can't threaten someone
bodily in a believable manner.

43
00:02:20,191 --> 00:02:25,191
You can't libel someone we already
have reasonable restrictions on,

44
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:28,710
on what you can't say.

45
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:33,180
But we've never had legislation that
required you to use a certain language

46
00:02:33,181 --> 00:02:35,480
except in certain commercial applications.

47
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,301
So for example,

48
00:02:36,301 --> 00:02:37,290
if you sell tobacco,

49
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,550
you have to put a warning on it.

50
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,240
But the United States
Supreme Court decided,

51
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:46,170
I believe it was in the 1940s that
similar attempts to compel speech,

52
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,160
uh,

53
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,910
on the part of individuals
in noncommercial settings
was unconstitutional.

54
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:51,310
And,

55
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,110
and uh,

56
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,380
I know that that doesn't have any direct
bearing on Canadian law but certainly

57
00:02:55,381 --> 00:02:56,310
the principal does.

58
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:02,030
And then I was also very see one of the
problems with a piece of legislation,

59
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:02,591
and this is,

60
00:03:02,591 --> 00:03:06,670
I suppose the problem with interpreting
a text as the postmodernists would say,

61
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:09,370
is that it's not easy to get the
level of interpretation right?

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:09,671
Right.

63
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:11,410
Cause if you're interpreting a text,

64
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:12,244
you can look at them,

65
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:15,760
you can look at the letters that
happens with biblical interpretation.

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,770
Very often you'd look
at the individual words,

67
00:03:17,771 --> 00:03:18,790
you can look at the phrases,

68
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,200
you're going to get the sentences,

69
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:21,370
you can look at the paragraphs,

70
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,530
you could look at the work as a whole.

71
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:27,160
And then you also have to look at the
context within which the work is being

72
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:30,790
interpreted in order to come up with
an interpretation of anything that's

73
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:31,451
complex.

74
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:33,310
And so when you see a
piece of legislation,

75
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:38,940
it isn't obvious what the legislation
is actually intended to do despite what

76
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:41,290
it's purported to do.

77
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,950
And it isn't obvious what level of
analysis to pick when you're going to

78
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:45,701
criticize it.

79
00:03:45,701 --> 00:03:47,980
And in some ways bill see 16,

80
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:52,240
you could regard it as innocuous just
as an extension of rights that have

81
00:03:52,241 --> 00:03:53,980
already been granted to certain,

82
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,420
let's say protected groups.

83
00:03:55,421 --> 00:03:58,990
Although I'm not so thrilled about the
whole notion of ascribing rights to

84
00:03:58,991 --> 00:04:00,010
groups to begin with.

85
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,630
We're already far down that path.

86
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,620
But,

87
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,453
um,

88
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,151
and you know,

89
00:04:04,151 --> 00:04:06,600
I've been accused of making a
mountain out of a mole hill,

90
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,230
but happily enough,

91
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,640
the University of Toronto,

92
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,930
after I made the videos,

93
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:15,931
immediately produced two letters that
were informed by their legal departments

94
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:18,723
wisdom,

95
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,960
um,

96
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,960
stating that what I had done with the
video was perhaps in conflict with the

97
00:04:25,151 --> 00:04:27,340
university ethical guidelines.

98
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:30,880
If you forget the ones that had to do
with freedom of expression and that they

99
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:31,450
might,

100
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:35,290
that my actions and even in making
the video might have violated that the

101
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:40,030
tenants of the Ontario Human Rights
Act as its or the at least as it's

102
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:42,080
interpreted by the Ontario
Human Rights Commission.

103
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:47,081
And so that helped put to
rest any suggestion that I
was actually scaremongering

104
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,000
because as soon as I,

105
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,640
as soon as I made the videos,

106
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,270
the legal department at the UFT
immediately validated my fears.

107
00:04:55,271 --> 00:04:56,410
And so that was a perverse,

108
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,210
was a perverse effect of their,

109
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,530
of the letters they sent to me.

110
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,113
So,

111
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,380
um,

112
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,640
the other thing that I,

113
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,600
there was other elements
of the legislation that I
object to and objected to and

114
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:09,191
still do.

115
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:14,191
And if you read the policies within which
the legislation will be interpreted as

116
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,310
the federal justice,

117
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,120
uh,

118
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,080
website indicated that it
would be interpreted in
within the policies that the

119
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,210
Ontario Human Rights Commission
has already established.

120
00:05:22,211 --> 00:05:25,960
Of course there's close cross talk
between Ontario and the federal government

121
00:05:25,961 --> 00:05:27,700
because the liberals are in power in both.

122
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,510
And the radical end of the liberal
party's in power in both situations.

123
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:37,200
And know it turns out that it's illegal
for like a year liable as an employer.

124
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:38,974
For example,

125
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,670
if any of your employees say anything
that can be construed as harassment,

126
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:45,190
say on the grounds of sexual,

127
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:45,930
uh,

128
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,763
uh,

129
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,220
or gender identity,

130
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:52,870
even if what they say has
unintended consequences.

131
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,420
And even if you don't
know that they said it.

132
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,630
And so that kind of legislation I just
think is just absolutely reprehensible.

133
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,280
And then because it's designed to cast
the broadest possible net to catch the

134
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:05,091
most fish,

135
00:06:05,091 --> 00:06:06,290
and it's clearly,

136
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:06,890
uh,

137
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,030
being implemented by people who
are not precisely pro employer,

138
00:06:11,031 --> 00:06:12,110
let's put it that way.

139
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,360
And then there's another little ugly
secret hidden underneath the policies.

140
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:22,361
And that's manifest most clearly in the
form of what's come to be known as the

141
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:23,031
Gender Unicorn,

142
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:24,920
which I would recommend that you look up,

143
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:30,190
which is an animated character designed
to indoctrinate small children into the

144
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,940
social constructionist worldview,

145
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,310
which claims that biological sex,

146
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,360
gender identity,

147
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:42,320
gender expression and sexual
proclivity very independently,

148
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,530
which they most certainly do not now.

149
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:46,850
And that's what I said in the video.

150
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,620
That's partly why I've
been accused of say,

151
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:49,730
being a transphobic.

152
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,600
I also complained that the university
was taking policy advice from,

153
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,590
uh,

154
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,750
the people who started black lives matter.

155
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,540
And I don't have anything against
black lives matter particularly,

156
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,310
but the two people who started it are,

157
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,030
are not,

158
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:02,863
uh,

159
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:03,380
uh,

160
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,620
the sorts of individuals let's say that
the university should be basing its

161
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:08,180
policy decisions,

162
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,930
the advice they shouldn't be taking
advice from those people with regards to

163
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:12,500
their policy.

164
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,150
And apparently that makes me a racist.

165
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,170
So,

166
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:15,500
um,

167
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,220
the first part of the argument about
what happened with my videos was actually

168
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:22,220
whether or not I was racist and
Trans phobic and all of that.

169
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:27,380
But the point that I was
making the technical specific
technical point was that

170
00:07:27,381 --> 00:07:28,820
the claim that,

171
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,050
uh,

172
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:34,700
those four phenomena very
independently was just patently false.

173
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,120
And it is by any reasonable
definition of false.

174
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:43,630
And I know that it's part
of a much broader propaganda
exercise as evidenced by

175
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:45,320
the Gender Unicorn for example,

176
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:50,321
which gets children to indicate on four
sliders their sex assigned at birth,

177
00:07:51,051 --> 00:07:52,190
their gender identity,

178
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:54,770
their gender expression and
their sexual proclivity.

179
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,570
And you can look at the animation or
at the at the cartoon and decide for

180
00:07:59,571 --> 00:08:03,810
yourself by its graphic style
what people it's aimed at.

181
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,143
So,

182
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,143
um,

183
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:11,620
is this a bill to protect transsexual
rights or is it a bill to further a

184
00:08:13,191 --> 00:08:15,410
postmodern neo Marxist agenda?

185
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,360
Well God only knows but as far as I'm
concerned having analyze the context

186
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:25,040
within which this bill arose and
within which it will be interpreted,

187
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:30,250
I'm going to go for the furthering the
postmodern Neil Marxist agenda until I'm,

188
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,540
until that's thoroughly disproved.

189
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:36,710
I would also like to inform you that I've
had plenty of letters from transgender

190
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:37,544
people,

191
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:42,490
at least 30 and only one of
them was critical of what
I'm doing because they had

192
00:08:42,491 --> 00:08:43,370
claim and as,

193
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,820
as have many of the people I've talked
to that the idea that a group of

194
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:54,821
activists self can self nominate as
the representatives of a given group.

195
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:01,671
And then speak for them as if they have
a homogenous voice is absolutely absurd.

196
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:02,820
And it is.

197
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,500
It is completely ridiculous.

198
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,540
And most of the transsexual people that
have been contacting me have said the

199
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:10,141
same thing,

200
00:09:10,141 --> 00:09:12,570
which is these people don't speak for me.

201
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,400
I wish they'd shut up cause they're doing
a lot more harm than good and I don't

202
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,620
buy what they're doing anyways.

203
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:20,603
So,

204
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,743
you know,

205
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:27,090
I think that the claim of the activist
types to speak on behalf of the groups

206
00:09:27,091 --> 00:09:29,610
that they purport to
represent is weak at best.

207
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,480
And I don't know why we ever assume that,

208
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,900
that their representation is valid,

209
00:09:33,901 --> 00:09:37,650
except that we're afraid to criticize
that particular presupposition.

210
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,221
You know,

211
00:09:38,221 --> 00:09:38,461
I mean,

212
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:42,510
there's nothing more ridiculous
than assuming that someone
is because someone is

213
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:44,610
black that they speak for black people.

214
00:09:44,611 --> 00:09:45,420
I mean,

215
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:45,840
I think,

216
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,010
I can't think of anything that's more
particularly indicative of a fundamentally

217
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:51,690
racist attitude than that.

218
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,051
You know?

219
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:52,980
Well those people,

220
00:09:52,981 --> 00:09:54,120
they're all the same.

221
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:54,571
It's like,

222
00:09:54,571 --> 00:09:54,841
yeah,

223
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:55,230
well,

224
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,063
sorry,

225
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,360
it doesn't work out that way.

226
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,260
So I wanted to clarify
all that so that you know,

227
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,960
you have a little bit clearer idea about
why I was doing what I was doing and

228
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:08,190
people have asked so to speak,

229
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,830
why I chose to die on
that particular hale.

230
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,810
And the answer is every,

231
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,320
every massive conflict of ideas let's
say manifests itself in the minute.

232
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:24,270
And that's why it's often difficult to
gain any headway because no matter where

233
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:25,260
you draw the line,

234
00:10:25,261 --> 00:10:26,330
it's arbitrary and,

235
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,260
and subject to criticism.

236
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:28,801
And you know,

237
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:33,801
the fact that this happens to be about
gender neutral pronouns regarding

238
00:10:33,871 --> 00:10:37,230
transgender people to me is
just more or less an accident.

239
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,760
It could have been about almost
any number of other things and,

240
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:44,070
but I would also like to suggest that
what should have happened with what I did

241
00:10:44,071 --> 00:10:44,940
was nothing.

242
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,510
Right?

243
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:50,510
I made some videos that were relatively
obscure academic and I made some videos

244
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,610
in my private time that were,

245
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:53,940
you know,

246
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,460
pretty badly produced
because they're just amateur.

247
00:10:56,461 --> 00:11:00,180
And I was trying to straighten out
my thinking about a couple of issues,

248
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,310
the anti unconscious bias training,

249
00:11:02,311 --> 00:11:03,144
for example,

250
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,880
and also this legislative mass.

251
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:09,210
And obviously it struck a major chord.

252
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:14,390
And that to me is indication that my
original supposition was correct and that

253
00:11:14,791 --> 00:11:18,450
there was far more going on under the
surface than there was at the surface.

254
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:18,990
I mean,

255
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:19,680
you know,

256
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,191
like I said,

257
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,620
it's very difficult to pick
the proper level of analysis,

258
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:28,020
but one of the ways you justify your
choices by observing the impact of your

259
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:30,480
choice of level of analysis
and seeing if it's,

260
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,590
if the consequences are commensurate
with your original hypothesis.

261
00:11:34,591 --> 00:11:35,161
And I thought,

262
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:35,994
well,

263
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:41,070
just because people say they're doing
one thing with a piece of legislation

264
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:43,260
doesn't mean that that's
what they're doing.

265
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:44,094
And of course,

266
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,470
I led piece of legislation is a hydra.

267
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,670
In any case,

268
00:11:47,671 --> 00:11:50,370
it does all sorts of things that
people don't intend it to do.

269
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:55,950
So that's a little background and
I'll leave the background at that.
