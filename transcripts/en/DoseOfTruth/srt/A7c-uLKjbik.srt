1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,990
It seems we you're bound to repeat history
and what his old becomes new again.

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:14,440
Why is it that we can't seem to
find equilibrium within a society?

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,780
Ideas begin with good intentions,

4
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:18,220
but lead towards the extreme.

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,061
Yeah.

6
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:19,630
Well,

7
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:23,440
the reason that we can't find equilibrium
is because the environment that we

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,000
live in isn't an equilibrium.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,193
And so I,

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,790
I kind of imagine it this way.

11
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:28,870
It's like we're,

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,390
we're traversing the back of a giant,

13
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:34,930
this is obviously a symbolic reference
of the giant serpent and it's,

14
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:39,400
and it weaves back and forth and you
don't know at any moment which way it's

15
00:00:39,401 --> 00:00:40,690
going to curve and turn.

16
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:44,470
And so sometimes it turns to the right
and sometimes it turns to the left.

17
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:47,770
And what that means politically is that
sometime we have to turn to the right

18
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:49,600
and sometimes we have to turn to the left.

19
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,840
And we don't know exactly when those,

20
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,950
um,

21
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:54,783
what new call,

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,190
we don't know exactly how to time that.

23
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,790
And so what we all have to do is keep
our eyes open and tell the truth and

24
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:02,190
discuss things with each other that are,

25
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:05,410
especially with people who have political
beliefs that are different than us,

26
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:09,820
so that we can ensure that we haven't
tilted too far one way or the other.

27
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,380
And that's why I'm an advocate of free
speech or one of the many reasons I'm an

28
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:18,910
advocate of free speech is because it's
the continual dialogue between people of

29
00:01:18,911 --> 00:01:23,230
different temperamental types that keeps
us oriented as close as we can come to

30
00:01:23,231 --> 00:01:25,180
the center of the serpents back.

31
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,490
And so there is no permanent equilibrium.

32
00:01:27,491 --> 00:01:31,450
There's only the equilibrium that's
produced by continual negotiation and a

33
00:01:31,451 --> 00:01:34,270
democracy is a formalized negotiation.

34
00:01:34,271 --> 00:01:35,104
And so,

35
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:36,263
um,

36
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:36,840
and,

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,081
and,

38
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:39,610
and it's free speech that
keeps it healthy and alive.

39
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,473
So,

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,350
um,

41
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:44,920
there's no permanent equivalent
equilibrium state except death,

42
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:45,341
you know,

43
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:45,580
and,

44
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,730
and it's always negotiation
in relationships too.

45
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:52,600
Like if you have an intimate relationship
or a familial relationship or even a

46
00:01:52,601 --> 00:01:53,434
friendship,

47
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:55,240
there's no final equilibrium state.

48
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:57,280
You have to communicate
with each other honestly,

49
00:01:57,281 --> 00:01:58,114
all the time,

50
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,800
and keep the relationship moving to adjust
the environment that the relationship

51
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:03,730
is operating in.

52
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:05,410
That's how it stays alive.

53
00:02:05,411 --> 00:02:06,520
And in an intimate,

54
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:07,000
longterm,

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,020
intimate relationship,

56
00:02:08,021 --> 00:02:08,711
like a marriage,

57
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:09,850
it's a continual,

58
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:10,600
uh,

59
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,190
it takes continual effort.

60
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:12,580
Uh,

61
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:12,791
I mean,

62
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,020
it's worthwhile effort and,

63
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:14,501
and that,

64
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:18,280
but you have to be conscious and awake
to keep your relationship alive and you

65
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,930
have to be communicating all the time.

66
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:20,651
Well,

67
00:02:20,651 --> 00:02:23,440
maybe not all the time because
you can over communicate to,

68
00:02:23,441 --> 00:02:24,274
but,

69
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,263
um,

70
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:26,853
so,

71
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,820
well,

72
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,660
so that's why we can't reach a
state of permanent equilibrium.
