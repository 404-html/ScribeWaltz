1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,930
Would you consider having a discussion
with Thomas Soul that Sam Dugan Dougan

2
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:13,531
deal getting?

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:14,580
Probably a,

4
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:14,911
yeah,

5
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:15,870
I definitely considered,

6
00:00:15,871 --> 00:00:16,090
I,

7
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,930
I'm thinking hard about
reaching out to them.

8
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:18,360
I,

9
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:21,330
I have some discussions coming up
that you might be interested in.

10
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:22,530
So,

11
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:23,363
um,

12
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,730
I'm going to talk on Jocko Willink,

13
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:26,491
his podcast,

14
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:31,491
and he was the leader of the Navy seals
team in Ramadan and he's quite the tough

15
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,640
character and met him down
in San Diego a while back,

16
00:00:35,641 --> 00:00:36,630
a month ago or so.

17
00:00:36,631 --> 00:00:38,100
And that was very interesting.

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,220
I have a video already prepared.

19
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,790
That's an interview with
[inaudible] out in Herzliya Lee.

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,953
Um,

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:49,680
it was done by Skype and need some
editing and so that's been a bit delayed.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,080
I interviewed or discussed,

23
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:54,870
I had a discussion with Nina
Paley who was a great animator.

24
00:00:54,871 --> 00:00:55,950
You guys should look her up.

25
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,900
That's Nina Paley.

26
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,260
She animated a lot of the Old Testament
and set it to music and I think her

27
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:07,680
animations are unbelievably beautiful
and she has great musical tastes.

28
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:09,090
They're illegal videos.

29
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:09,691
Basically.

30
00:01:09,691 --> 00:01:11,220
She's making a knee legal movie.

31
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,270
Um,

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,920
but anyways,

33
00:01:13,921 --> 00:01:15,250
I really liked your stuff.

34
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:15,660
Um,

35
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,310
I also had a discussion with Claire
Lehmann who runs [inaudible],

36
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,960
which is a new news magazine online,

37
00:01:21,961 --> 00:01:24,870
which I think has got real promise
and we had a good discussion.

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,130
And,

39
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:26,963
um,

40
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:27,391
let's see,

41
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:28,090
is that a to habitat?

42
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,010
I think that's the how to,

43
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,260
and you probably know or maybe you don't.

44
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,563
Um,

45
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,900
I just finished a discussion with
Camille Paglia and we went down there.

46
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,030
I took a film crew down
there to Philadelphia and
met her at her university.

47
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,391
And,

48
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:42,960
uh,

49
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,450
we talked for a couple of hours
and that was really interesting.

50
00:01:45,451 --> 00:01:46,650
She's quite the fireball,

51
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:51,210
that woman and unbelievably
verbally fluent and sharp.

52
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:55,240
And so I finally met someone
who can talk more than me and,

53
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:56,413
and uh,

54
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,360
that's probably good.

55
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,111
So,

56
00:01:58,111 --> 00:02:01,380
but I really enjoyed speaking with her
and I think about a hundred thousand

57
00:02:01,381 --> 00:02:03,030
people have watched that now in a day.

58
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:03,990
So that's pretty good.

59
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,431
So,

60
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:04,860
uh,

61
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:08,790
we talked about postmodernism and
the malaise that confronts the modern

62
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:11,310
university and all of
those sorts of things.

63
00:02:11,311 --> 00:02:13,530
So Robin Dion says,

64
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,670
do you ever Miss Montreal?

65
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:14,851
Hey,

66
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:16,050
I was just in Montreal.

67
00:02:16,051 --> 00:02:17,060
I went there to sub,

68
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:19,050
saw a band called half moon run,

69
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:19,950
which are bound.

70
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:23,040
I would highly recommend they were playing
with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra

71
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:27,900
and I got invited to meet one of
the singers and also going out and,

72
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,380
uh,

73
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,310
see the concert,

74
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:30,061
which was excellent.

75
00:02:30,061 --> 00:02:30,391
And Yeah,

76
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,201
I'd Miss Montreal.

77
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,610
Montreal is a great city for you.

78
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,550
Americans who are listening
should go visit Montreal.

79
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:35,791
Man,

80
00:02:35,791 --> 00:02:36,750
it's a cool place.

81
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,550
And spend a week there in the summer.

82
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,270
It's,

83
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,660
it's a really good city in,

84
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,513
in every way.

85
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:42,240
So.
