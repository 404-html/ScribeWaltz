1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:01,380
More lights,

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,760
flash photography isn't prohibited and
there was a zero tolerance policy for any

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,670
delay or disruption.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,770
Rubin

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,453
report,

6
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,403
Internet

7
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:54,823
credible

8
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,490
Jordan shoes is backstage.

9
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,111
You're warming up.

10
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:02,460
Are you guys right now?

11
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:08,130
He is wrestling the 800 pound lobster.

12
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,660
The shit out of that thing
in preparation for you guys.

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,330
I'm very excited to be here.

14
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:18,001
San Francisco.

15
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,430
I was actually here a couple of weeks ago.

16
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,360
I was in San Francisco.

17
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:22,380
I spoke at Berkeley.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,353
Real

19
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,041
higher one.

20
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,060
I have no idea.

21
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,430
I spoke at Berkeley and then I came to
San Francisco for dinner and some of you

22
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:37,020
probably saw this on twitter.

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:42,090
Our car got broken into while we were
here and I tweeted out a picture of the

24
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:45,180
broken glass by our car and
literally putting it into.

25
00:01:45,181 --> 00:01:47,520
People were telling me all fucking idiot.

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:50,550
You don't leave a car out on
the street in San Francisco.

27
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:52,940
Excuse.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,990
It's a progressive

29
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,600
value.

30
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,460
Then of course people
were telling me that,

31
00:02:02,461 --> 00:02:02,760
uh,

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,590
you got to watch out for the,

33
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:04,741
uh,

34
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:06,950
the human food that you know about this.

35
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,660
You guys have the accurate.

36
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,690
There's actually an act.

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,350
And I don't want to tell you who,

38
00:02:13,351 --> 00:02:17,340
but somebody under your chair right
now to be watching out for something.

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,610
Uh,

40
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,520
this is very exciting.

41
00:02:20,521 --> 00:02:22,110
We've been doing this for a,

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,670
this is probably our eighth or ninth show
and it's just an unbelievable seeing.

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,880
See if you guys.

44
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:31,590
I do prepare you though that I was
actually not Jordan's first choice to open

45
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,693
the tour.

46
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:35,430
That was Kathy Newman

47
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,881
for Kathy.

48
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,990
I don't want to make it about people.

49
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:46,830
It's about ideas.

50
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,970
It's about ideas.

51
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:48,720
Naturally.

52
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,320
Jordan,

53
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,610
I email her.

54
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,560
I emailed her and said,

55
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:51,681
hey,

56
00:02:51,681 --> 00:02:52,001
Kathy.

57
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:54,410
And Angst of going out on
tour 12 rules for life.

58
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,420
Very excited to be like to
open for me on the tour.

59
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,411
Money's pretty good.

60
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:02,080
If you want to join me on a tour
at Cathy wrote back and said,

61
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,820
so you're saying you
want to sleep with him?

62
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,070
There is something really cool going on.

63
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:17,490
A Nice reminder right before we started.

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,630
So did you guys see the uh,

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,293
yesterday?

66
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:30,020
That's really awesome that we're here
tonight because you wouldn't actually born

67
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,840
right here in the masonic
about six months ago.

68
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:39,110
Sam Harris is here and
we're here hearing arrogant,

69
00:03:39,471 --> 00:03:43,660
one who came up with the phrase
on this very stage and this thing,

70
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:48,540
read this thing that you guys are a
part of it that the world is now finally

71
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:53,541
catching up on that it is real and
it's hearing this diversity of people.

72
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:56,210
We all know there's the
diversity that the left glove,

73
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,200
your coloring or gender,

74
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,260
your sensuality and all that nonsense,

75
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:01,650
and then there's real diversity,

76
00:04:01,651 --> 00:04:05,130
so we've got Sam on the left and on the
right and now we have our new leader.

77
00:04:05,131 --> 00:04:06,120
Kanye West.

78
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,203
Are you guys,

79
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,360
biologists and neuroscientists and all
these people that have been working on

80
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:30,760
this stuff like taking this shit.

81
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,510
It's pretty awesome.

82
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:36,930
Yeah.

83
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,210
There really is some sort of revolution

84
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,530
and the beauty of this revolution,

85
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,780
that's how it happen.

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,433
That's okay

87
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,500
in this area.

88
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,250
It's just unbelievable
what's going on here.

89
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,840
All of these people coming together.

90
00:05:08,841 --> 00:05:10,440
There's a couple of weeks ago I had A.

91
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,490
I had John Casick.

92
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,870
I might see that

93
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,380
it was raining in La.

94
00:05:20,381 --> 00:05:24,350
It never rains in la and I told them
dirty clothes from Ohio farmland down

95
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,223
there.

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,740
I've got chickens in my backyard
and I do a little chicken coop

97
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,980
in the back of my house because it was
raining and couldn't see the cool from

98
00:05:35,981 --> 00:05:37,050
the back window,

99
00:05:37,051 --> 00:05:39,220
so he just decides to walk
right into my bedroom.

100
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,010
Empty.

101
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,190
You spend a certain amount of time
with Jordan leaders in your bedroom?

102
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:45,024
Pretty clean.

103
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,883
Okay.

104
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,920
Constantly at the hotel today.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,370
I

106
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,590
cleaned her room.

107
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,800
We had just come back from
my room was a disaster.

108
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:03,520
I just don't my bag out
there was stuff everywhere.

109
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,070
PC literally jumps over all
my crap all over the floor.

110
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,810
He's staring out the window looking at
my dad and I realize that there's a big

111
00:06:11,811 --> 00:06:12,830
bag of weed on my night.

112
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,420
I thought I was going
to get more bloated or

113
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,093
kinda

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,993
friendly

115
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,380
hanging out with all these fingers.

116
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,570
The last thing I want to do is to

117
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,620
shut my brain off.

118
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:40,454
That would be better.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,110
Are you almost ready for Jordan?

120
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,480
So when we started this tour,

121
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:52,740
we,

122
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,130
I said we'd done about
eight or nine these.

123
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,230
And uh,

124
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:55,630
when we,

125
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,960
when we kicked this off,

126
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:03,040
something really cool guy and I think
I'm going to do this and I think it sums

127
00:07:03,041 --> 00:07:05,050
up exactly what's going on here.

128
00:07:05,051 --> 00:07:06,460
And you guys are absolutely.

129
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,490
You were actually in the part.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,410
So some people by the
name of the measurable Man

131
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,070
Right at the beginning of the show,

132
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:18,110
he took a picture with him and his
girlfriend and he sent his tweet.

133
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:18,401
He said,

134
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:22,990
it's wild to be sitting in a soul down
the with thousands of other people

135
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,560
waiting.

136
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,800
Listen with Jordan Peterson
and went in my daily life.

137
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:32,250
I act like a secret tip toe
around mentioning Jordan Peterson.

138
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,900
You guys look around.

139
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,813
We are doing,

140
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:48,230
we are building this thing.

141
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:52,120
I know you're just beginning yesterday,

142
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,430
there was a lot of rocket
fuel behind this thing with.

143
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,390
How about Special Ed?

144
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:14,470
Ladies and gentlemen in the intellectual
dark web has made town introduce the

145
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,064
musical style.

146
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:20,340
Thanks Jordan Peterson.

147
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,890
Thank

148
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,900
you for

149
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:44,923
them.

150
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,690
Thank

151
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,680
you.

152
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,550
We have the most elaborate costume.

153
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,900
Thank

154
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,080
God.

155
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,080
I can tell you one thing that I do
really like guideline right from the

156
00:11:25,261 --> 00:11:26,160
beginning.

157
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,100
Whatever.

158
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,740
There's been something humorous associated
with what I've been doing online and

159
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:35,950
that's a really good thing.

160
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:40,800
This is comedy that goes along with this
because for them to be a comic on your

161
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,600
toe to anything beats that it's gone.

162
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,280
At least some degree health,

163
00:11:44,281 --> 00:11:44,880
you know,

164
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,770
it's not taking itself too seriously.

165
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,440
The see people who've gone
through courbet shirts on steam

166
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,540
and vertebrates

167
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,380
the intellectual level of discourse.

168
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:02,950
So I have a little story to tell you.

169
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,630
Something kind of Nice to be today.

170
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:07,030
It's probably more relevant
to me because I'm a Canadian,

171
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,100
but there's a magazine in Canada
called Maclean's and they ran a club,

172
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:13,360
a hit piece on it about three months ago.

173
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,090
A woman named Tabitha Southey wrote,

174
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:16,720
attend.

175
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,410
She's got quite an ambitious
woman and she can coin a phrase.

176
00:12:20,411 --> 00:12:22,150
I think he called me the stupid person,

177
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:27,151
smart person that has been better than
the stupid person's stupid person I

178
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:28,914
suppose.

179
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:33,640
But that phrase has been bandied around
on the internet sort of Ad Nauseum in

180
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:34,910
subsets in the system.

181
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:35,950
But today,

182
00:12:35,951 --> 00:12:36,550
and this was.

183
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,550
This was what was cool because
there's been an attempt I would say,

184
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:46,970
by the people who aren't very fun to me
too is to attempt to politicize what I

185
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:54,340
attempted to do some justification for
that I suppose because I have been going

186
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:59,320
after the radical leftists
with a fair bit of seriousness,

187
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:04,530
but I think because they jumped the
political but they started to tread in

188
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:05,584
water.

189
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,440
It started to trend the territory that
had no business being politicized with

190
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,340
restrictions on free speech in particular,

191
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:18,180
but I don't regard what I'm trying to
do is particularly political and I think

192
00:13:18,371 --> 00:13:22,390
that's partly because I've known
fundamentally a political figure.

193
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,860
I'm fundamentally a clinical psychologist
with a secondary identity as a

194
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:30,310
university professor or perhaps
those identities convenient flight.

195
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,430
It doesn't really matter.

196
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,150
It's part and parcel of the same
thing as far as I'm concerned.

197
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:40,020
What I've been focused on in my private
practice as an educator is trying to

198
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:47,580
disseminate psychological information
of the highest caliber to individuals

199
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,140
because that's where
clinical psychologists do.

200
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:54,150
We work with individuals
because I think the individuals,

201
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,480
the right level of analysis,

202
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:55,960
you know,

203
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,240
when I come out and see a crowd like this,

204
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,850
I don't see the crowd,

205
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,500
which is partly why I'm actually not
afraid of the crowd because I see a bunch

206
00:14:05,501 --> 00:14:08,710
of individuals and you're sitting
here and when I talked to the crowd,

207
00:14:08,711 --> 00:14:09,670
I don't talk to the crowd,

208
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:09,940
either,

209
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,590
won't talk to people in the crowd.

210
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,520
And so Mcclain's,

211
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,160
which is the magazine
that published this piece,

212
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,410
satirical piece on me a few months ago,

213
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:25,780
we actually took the time to send a
reporter out to a group that had been

214
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,490
established in Toronto,

215
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,230
which was a Jordan Peterson meetup group.

216
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:30,730
I guess.

217
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:34,100
Essentially it's about 50 people
or so it would meet up regularly.

218
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:37,920
They actually sent a reporter out to find
out what these reprobates interruptive

219
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:40,610
and um,

220
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,290
you know,

221
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:47,290
if you paid attention to the
corner of the journalism world,

222
00:14:47,411 --> 00:14:50,690
that is not very happy with my existence.

223
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,920
You would assume that
it would be an asset of,

224
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:54,754
all right.

225
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,730
Essentially all male,

226
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:03,160
all angry old white because of course
that's how the radical left characterized

227
00:15:03,161 --> 00:15:03,771
as people,

228
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:04,041
right?

229
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:07,700
They characterize them by gender and race
into everything becomes politicized in

230
00:15:07,701 --> 00:15:08,534
that map,

231
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,820
which I think is absolutely contemptible,

232
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,470
but it turned out that 40 percent of
the people who came to this meeting,

233
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:18,290
we're women and then a very large

234
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,190
are you all feeling and you know

235
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:35,930
a large number of them were were children
are first generation immigrants who

236
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,390
weren't by any stretch of the imagination,

237
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,290
mainstream Protestant,

238
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,030
Caucasians,

239
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:45,790
and so the first part of the narrative
fell apart and then the second part in

240
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:48,500
the air and it fell apart because it
turns out that these people were getting

241
00:15:48,501 --> 00:15:52,760
together to see if figuring out how they
could get the damn lights together and

242
00:15:52,761 --> 00:15:56,150
they're serious about it and they
weren't getting their life together in a

243
00:15:56,151 --> 00:16:01,151
manner that was designed to propel
them in some sense to a power position.

244
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,020
In an arbitrary dominance hierarchy.

245
00:16:03,021 --> 00:16:05,930
They were trying to get their lives
together so that they can be better as

246
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:08,450
individuals so that they can
be better for their families.

247
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:09,770
So they could be better.

248
00:16:09,771 --> 00:16:14,150
For their communities and they were
actually serious about it and in an age

249
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:16,880
where everyone is
cynical about everything,

250
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:22,130
it's really something to know that there
are people who are not cynical about

251
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:26,180
things that are that important and so
it was a pleasant surprise to see this

252
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,540
article published in the same magazine
that had played tricks with what I had

253
00:16:31,881 --> 00:16:36,470
been doing before and I'm hoping that
that will continue because it would be a

254
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,900
lovely thing if it did.

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I know from talking to people who come
to events like this that know some of you

256
00:16:44,691 --> 00:16:46,820
were here primarily for political reasons,

257
00:16:46,821 --> 00:16:47,240
but.

258
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,010
And that's fine because there's a.

259
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,550
it's not like the political
realm is irrelevant instance.

260
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,870
It's by no means irrelevant,

261
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:59,230
but I know that most of the people who
come to these talks comp because because

262
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,880
we're trying to do something about putting
our individual lives together and so

263
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:08,410
and that's the right thing to do as far
as I'm concerned is the right level.

264
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:13,510
Thank.

265
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,760
Thanks.

266
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:22,420
So I'm going to talk to you about my 12
rules for life is about but more about

267
00:17:23,811 --> 00:17:24,680
the ideas in the book.

268
00:17:24,681 --> 00:17:25,700
Then the book itself,

269
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:30,140
and I'm always working on the ideas and
so I use these talks as an opportunity

270
00:17:30,141 --> 00:17:35,080
to further my thinking along the different
lines that I'm attempting to thinking

271
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:39,620
to make the story that I'm telling more
and more coherent and more communicable

272
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,170
and so I'll start with that.

273
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,730
I'll start with rule one.

274
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:44,881
Rule One,

275
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:47,930
his stand up straight with your
shoulders back and it contains the,

276
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:49,063
I suppose,

277
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:54,230
infamous commentary on crustaceans and
trying to make a point and I should point

278
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:59,880
out because I was making a point that
should actually be of great interest to

279
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:03,690
people on the left and the people on the
left are of course concerned with the

280
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:07,470
distance house and that's why you need a
left wing into your political structure

281
00:18:07,471 --> 00:18:09,860
because someone needs to be
concerned with his house.

282
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,780
But what point did I was trying
to make in the first chapter was

283
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:20,830
hierarchies are inevitable and the fact
that they're inevitability is evidence

284
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,360
in the existence of
hierarchies in domains of life.

285
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:29,640
Far outside of the human domain.

286
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,820
The hierarchies have been around for $30
billion a year and there are permanent

287
00:18:35,821 --> 00:18:37,560
structural elements of existence.

288
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,320
That doesn't mean I was justifying.

289
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:41,590
We get something that exists.

290
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,360
It's not going to justify it.

291
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,660
You took point on fit.

292
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:49,661
It exists now where the hierarchies is
it completely separate issue in public

293
00:18:50,351 --> 00:18:52,350
dressed very briefly in a moment,

294
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,023
but

295
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,660
there's a moral,

296
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,860
there's a lesson to be derived from the
fact that hierarchies are ancient and

297
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:06,861
that is if you're a critic of hierarchies
and there are negative consequences,

298
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,720
you cannot lay here existence at the feet
of western civilization or capitalism

299
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,020
or the free market or the patriarchy
because it's western civilization.

300
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,770
Capitalism,

301
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,720
the free market and the patriarchy,

302
00:19:24,721 --> 00:19:26,350
which is a word by the way,

303
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,010
didn't give rise to hire a consultant.

304
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,790
And you could tell that
because monsters have,

305
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,210
right?

306
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,560
So there's a third of a billion years
of social labs organization into

307
00:19:37,561 --> 00:19:40,680
hierarchies and you can
put that at the feet of,

308
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:40,791
um,

309
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:43,320
political economic system period.

310
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,850
And so it's for that reason,

311
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:45,750
among many,

312
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,290
many,

313
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:47,300
many other reasons.

314
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,940
The says are wrong.

315
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,353
You're not wrong.

316
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:05,410
They're wrong in a way that it's going
to make it impossible for well oriented

317
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,590
business who were actually
concerned about the desert is acid,

318
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:13,970
let's say the struggling working class
to actually make more headway in their

319
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:17,900
attempts to deal with the
district capacity because
their underlying theory is

320
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:21,420
wrong and it's wrong
because it's not serious.

321
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:22,840
You know,

322
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,810
like I don't talk to you a slave.

323
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:29,660
The reason for hierarchies
isn't a negative consequences,

324
00:20:29,661 --> 00:20:31,850
so we'll go through this quite quickly.

325
00:20:31,851 --> 00:20:33,890
So here's a truism.

326
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,270
Need something to do with your life.

327
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,113
It's worthwhile.

328
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,230
You need something to
email and it's a deep true.

329
00:20:42,231 --> 00:20:47,210
Is it because the creatures of it
couldn't move roughly speaking,

330
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,130
need something Neymat.

331
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,040
Every creature that moves in the
world that isn't statically place,

332
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:00,080
like a plant has to aim for something and
generally they infer an improvement in

333
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:02,741
their condition.

334
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:07,741
So every living creature that moves lived
in a value lives in a value structure

335
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:11,560
and the value structure or something like
where they are isn't as good as where

336
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,394
they're going to.

337
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,620
And so there's a Knoxville good.

338
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,980
That's where you are and there's a
bedroom which is where you're heading,

339
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,040
that's a value structure and you look
at the world through value structure.

340
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:22,180
You would happen to value structure,

341
00:21:22,181 --> 00:21:26,350
but assuming that you're actually going
to move in the world and you need to

342
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,780
move into the world and the reason you
need to move in the world is because if

343
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:31,360
you just stay in one place
that you've died terribly,

344
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,470
so it's not optional to
move forward in the world.

345
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,090
It's.

346
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,160
It's necessary.

347
00:21:36,161 --> 00:21:40,480
It's necessary psychophysiologic lane and
it's necessary psychologically as well

348
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:43,810
because it turns out that the way that
people derive most of their positive

349
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:44,290
emotion,

350
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,100
which is the antidote to the
suffering that's it taken to life,

351
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,590
is by naming something worth attaining.

352
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,090
That's where the meaning comes from.

353
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:53,770
Now,

354
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,000
the problem with naming and
something worth updating,

355
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,030
especially if you do that
in a social environment,

356
00:21:58,031 --> 00:22:02,120
is that you immediately set up a
competitive under corporate plans.

357
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,180
We'll call it the competitive
landscape for them,

358
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,171
for the time being.

359
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,780
Because no matter what it is
that you're aiming at doing,

360
00:22:07,810 --> 00:22:09,400
if you're going to do
it with other people,

361
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:12,610
some people are going to be better at
it than other people and it doesn't

362
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:12,941
matter.

363
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:14,560
It can be something as benign.

364
00:22:14,561 --> 00:22:16,420
Let's say it's going to have a massage.

365
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:22,030
Massage is something that you think is
good and then that's a service that's

366
00:22:22,031 --> 00:22:23,350
offered in your city.

367
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,790
Then there's going to be a hierarchical
rank ordering of people who are good at

368
00:22:27,791 --> 00:22:31,690
being massage therapists and running
their businesses and it's not because

369
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:35,710
they're more powerful or because
they're oppressing the other massage

370
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,553
therapists.

371
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,910
It isn't that even though some of them
might be somewhat crooked in their

372
00:22:39,911 --> 00:22:42,340
business events and maybe
somewhat underhanded,

373
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:42,490
no,

374
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,880
it's something that's massage
therapists are generally known for.

375
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,790
When you take the critique of
capitalism and you make it,

376
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,650
make it specific in that matter,

377
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:57,910
you start to see how absurd it is to
assume that the only reason that people

378
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,590
attain prominence in the discipline
is because of a tyrannical power and

379
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:03,130
oppression.

380
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:03,700
It's like,

381
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:03,851
yeah,

382
00:23:03,851 --> 00:23:06,280
that's part of it because
every system is imperfect,

383
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,330
but mostly it's a matter of the mere
fact that once you caught them that

384
00:23:10,331 --> 00:23:11,200
something's worth doing,

385
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,780
you immediately produced a hierarchy.

386
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,490
Now what generally
happens is the right way,

387
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,810
roughly speaking,

388
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,970
supports and promotes the
structure of the hierarchy.

389
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,700
He says that's a good
thing and the lab says,

390
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,610
wait a second.

391
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,820
As soon as you make a hierarchy,

392
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,280
people stack up at the
bottom and that's not good.

393
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:31,750
You have to do something
about that and fair enough.

394
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,730
You do have to do something about that,

395
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,620
but that doesn't mean that you get to
put the reason for the hierarchy at the

396
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,300
fee up,

397
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:42,240
the social structure
that you have to happen.

398
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:43,390
Now,

399
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:47,420
the other proposition
I lean forward in one,

400
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,400
which has also been subject to,

401
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,880
I would say ill informed critique is the
idea that there's a hierarchy and then

402
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:00,060
what you do is make yourself
powerful so you can find a heart,

403
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:01,760
but that's what I said.

404
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:02,960
It's not what I meant.

405
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,110
You will be thinking about if you think
that the only reason for hierarchies is

406
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,220
brute force,

407
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,930
because if the only
reason for hierarchies,

408
00:24:08,931 --> 00:24:12,410
brute force and obviously what you
need to be is more of a decline in the

409
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,240
hierarchy,

410
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,750
but that is the case because
well structured hierarchies
aren't based on power.

411
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:18,681
Tyrannical,

412
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:22,970
pathological hierarchies are based on
power and not only in the human world,

413
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,220
but also in the animal world.

414
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,810
So this is another truth that transcends
the mere merely socio-cultural.

415
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,230
What I've been suggesting to rule one
was the most effective way of orienting

416
00:24:35,751 --> 00:24:38,540
yourself within a hierarchy isn't power.

417
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:42,350
It's competence and its competence
of a very peculiar short.

418
00:24:42,351 --> 00:24:43,041
So he might say,

419
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:44,210
well no,

420
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,590
there isn't just managing.

421
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,860
You're about to be born and you didn't
know where you were going to be born and

422
00:24:48,861 --> 00:24:51,440
you want it to have the right
characteristics to seek.

423
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:52,860
See wherever you landed.

424
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:53,511
And so you could say,

425
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:53,631
well,

426
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:57,710
there's a very large set of possible
hierarchies that you could end up in and

427
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:02,390
you want to be armed with the right
properties to navigate them on average,

428
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,860
the most effective way.

429
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:08,460
And I think that our religious
stories have evolved,

430
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:13,190
the some of our stories have evolved to
provide guidelines about how you would

431
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:17,330
act if you were trying to optimize their
performance across the seven possible

432
00:25:17,331 --> 00:25:18,164
hierarchies.

433
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:20,300
And it isn't exactly what you'd expect.

434
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:21,620
It's not brute force.

435
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,491
It's something like,

436
00:25:22,491 --> 00:25:22,701
well,

437
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,580
I said it's something like stand up
straight with your shoulders back at

438
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,920
something like an attitude
towards the world.

439
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,000
And that attitude towards the world is
one of courageous confrontation of what

440
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,290
is coming at you.

441
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:36,440
And the posture is part of that
because this is a defensive crouch,

442
00:25:36,441 --> 00:25:36,950
right?

443
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:41,390
This is a defeated posture and that's
not an effective way of negotiating

444
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:43,290
hierarchies parked because it's,

445
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:43,750
it's,

446
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,330
it's,

447
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:44,770
it's,

448
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,520
it's a shying away from the world.

449
00:25:46,521 --> 00:25:49,400
And I understand that people have
reason to shut away from the world.

450
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,020
I'm perfectly aware of that,

451
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,340
but that's not the point.

452
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,290
The point is is that if you,

453
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,940
if you want to optimize the probability
that your life will turn out well,

454
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,690
you,

455
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:04,690
you absorber the catastrophe and you
stand up straight and you make yourself

456
00:26:05,661 --> 00:26:08,210
vulnerable because that's part of what
you do when you stand up straight because

457
00:26:08,211 --> 00:26:12,950
you're exposing yourself to the world
and you take on the catastrophe and the

458
00:26:12,951 --> 00:26:16,340
responsibility that goes along with
it and that's by no means the same as

459
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:20,630
becoming the most powerful person you
can so you can thrash the competition and

460
00:26:20,631 --> 00:26:21,050
struggle.

461
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,150
You're waiting to talk
in a power oriented,

462
00:26:23,151 --> 00:26:23,551
dominant,

463
00:26:23,551 --> 00:26:26,000
tired that's not on the same story,

464
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:31,450
but the people who are reading that who
are attempting to criticize me only see

465
00:26:31,551 --> 00:26:36,380
the world through that lens and so
when they read something about about

466
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,990
alternative pathways to success,

467
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:42,230
which would be accepting responsibility
and also accepting your own

468
00:26:42,231 --> 00:26:45,190
vulnerability and also accepting
the catastrophe of tragedy.

469
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,280
You've lightened again,

470
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,570
read it any other way that well,

471
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,400
he must be trying to
train many targets like,

472
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:50,611
no,

473
00:26:50,611 --> 00:26:51,540
that's just not right.

474
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,680
It's thing isn't even close to what I,

475
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,440
what I wrote or what have you been
attempting to communicate with people.

476
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,490
So that's one.

477
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,830
So rule two and three I'm going to talk
about at the same time to rule two is

478
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:08,040
treat yourself like you're someone
you're responsible for helping.

479
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:12,390
And rule three is make friends with
the people who want the best for you.

480
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:14,520
And those kind of make a set.

481
00:27:14,521 --> 00:27:15,480
I would say,

482
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:16,523
you know,

483
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:20,880
the other comment that people who've
been credit structuring my writing say

484
00:27:20,881 --> 00:27:21,420
have,

485
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:22,620
have put forward,

486
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,790
I'm not complaining about this,

487
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,200
I'm merely observing it,

488
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:28,230
is that the rules are self
evident and it's like,

489
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:28,800
well,

490
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,510
it's not like I didn't
know that when I wrote

491
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,850
my point point,

492
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:38,930
my whole point was to take things that
were true is in the sand and think about

493
00:27:39,151 --> 00:27:42,000
truisms is that they're actually true.

494
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,990
That's the thing,

495
00:27:42,991 --> 00:27:43,410
you know,

496
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,850
they're universally accepted.

497
00:27:44,851 --> 00:27:45,930
Their proverbial let's say,

498
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:50,220
but that doesn't mean we don't forget
why they're true or the or the now and

499
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:51,120
then because they're true,

500
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:55,500
they fallen on deaf ears and you need
to go reinvestigate the structures

501
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:56,131
underneath that.

502
00:27:56,131 --> 00:27:59,910
Make them true so that you can understand
that so that you can see them with new

503
00:27:59,911 --> 00:28:02,970
eyes and so that's what I
was trying to do and say,

504
00:28:02,971 --> 00:28:04,500
look what these things are.

505
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:09,420
The reasons that these things happened
to be the case to to treat yourself like

506
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:11,400
you have someone responsible for helping,

507
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,450
you know,

508
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:17,450
that's actually not a simple thing
because it isn't exactly self evident that

509
00:28:18,961 --> 00:28:20,220
people liked themselves.

510
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,060
No,

511
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,520
I mean there's some people you like
and something that you disliked.

512
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,910
That's generally the case and some
people just like almost everyone and some

513
00:28:26,911 --> 00:28:28,210
people like mobiles never went.

514
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,700
It's a temperamental issue,

515
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,010
but as you might think,

516
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:35,010
well people are basically narcissistic
and they liked themselves better than

517
00:28:35,011 --> 00:28:37,680
they like anyone else and I
don't think that's the case.

518
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:38,191
It's not been.

519
00:28:38,191 --> 00:28:41,180
My experience with people certainly
hasn't been my clinical experiences.

520
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:45,240
My experience has been that because
people are more aware because individuals

521
00:28:45,241 --> 00:28:47,070
are more aware of their own flaws,

522
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,350
that then they are aware of the flaws of
anyone else excluding the narcissists.

523
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,750
They actually tend to be
pretty damn hard on themselves.

524
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,400
I opened chapter two by describing
the fact that the typical person,

525
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,210
if a typical person takes their dog
to a vet and the vet prescribes the

526
00:29:03,211 --> 00:29:04,044
medication,

527
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:07,260
the typical person will give
their dog of the medication,

528
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,260
but if they go to a doctor
and get a medication,

529
00:29:10,261 --> 00:29:13,620
then the third of them won't fill the
prescription and half of the remaining

530
00:29:13,621 --> 00:29:16,750
third won't take your
prescription and you might think,

531
00:29:16,751 --> 00:29:17,970
well that's just carelessness.

532
00:29:17,971 --> 00:29:18,301
It's like,

533
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:18,511
well,

534
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:18,691
no,

535
00:29:18,691 --> 00:29:19,590
it's not because you,

536
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:19,960
you,

537
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,310
you're,

538
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:22,470
you won't do that for your dog.

539
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:26,440
And then one of the conclusions you can
draw from that and said people actually

540
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:28,290
like their dog more than
they like themselves.

541
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,510
And I actually think
that's generally true.

542
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:30,931
You know,

543
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:34,730
people are pretty wholeheartedly
affectionate white would they have a dog

544
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,191
otherwise?

545
00:29:35,191 --> 00:29:35,371
Right?

546
00:29:35,371 --> 00:29:37,590
But their whole heartedly
affectionate with the dog.

547
00:29:37,591 --> 00:29:38,970
It's just a damn dog.

548
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:41,230
And if there's anything wrong with dogs,

549
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:48,270
that doesn't mean they would
extend the season itself.

550
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:51,780
And I think what you're
producing is it is a,

551
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,070
an explanation of why that's a bad idea.

552
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:57,220
It's a bad idea not to
treat yourself property.

553
00:29:57,230 --> 00:30:01,990
And so the idea is that perhaps you have
a moral obligation to treat yourself

554
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,670
properly as if you or someone
you were responsible for helping,

555
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,281
you might take more.

556
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:09,070
What's the right frame of mind for that?

557
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:09,611
That I can say,

558
00:30:09,611 --> 00:30:09,791
well,

559
00:30:09,791 --> 00:30:12,700
imagine if you have a
child who's wellbeing,

560
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:14,410
you are actually responsible for it.

561
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:19,180
It's not that hard to imagine now in and
then you're the appropriate thing for

562
00:30:19,181 --> 00:30:23,320
you to do as a civilized and responsible
human being is to do everything you can

563
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:26,400
to help that child to encourage
the child because that's.

564
00:30:26,430 --> 00:30:27,700
That's the right phrase.

565
00:30:27,701 --> 00:30:32,701
If you had to boil down what you
should do with the child into one word

566
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,040
encourages a really good work and to
encourage the child is to instill in them

567
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:40,820
that sense that they're fundamentally.

568
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:44,470
It's a fundamentally worthwhile endeavor
for them to take their proper place in

569
00:30:44,471 --> 00:30:49,471
the world and also to recognize both
implicitly and explicitly that there is

570
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:53,920
something that the child brings to the
world that only that child and bring into

571
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,260
the world would be a
lesser place without it.

572
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,540
And that's really what it
means to have faith in someone.

573
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,830
And it's necessary to have that
sort of faith in yourself and,

574
00:31:01,831 --> 00:31:04,040
and I need an ID detached way.

575
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,160
It's in the same way that
maybe the presumption of
innocence would apply to you,

576
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:12,340
which is a good thing to know
innocent before proven guilty.

577
00:31:12,341 --> 00:31:17,341
It's a lovely rule of thumb and the
idea that because human beings have

578
00:31:18,071 --> 00:31:19,210
intrinsic value,

579
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:22,240
which is the cornerstone of
our entire social system,

580
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,290
our legal system,

581
00:31:23,291 --> 00:31:24,190
our economic system,

582
00:31:24,191 --> 00:31:27,340
it's the fundamental cornerstone
that the same thing applies to you.

583
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,070
It doesn't really matter whether
you lightened yourself or not.

584
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,000
That's not the point.

585
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:34,840
The point is that independent of
your knowledge of your own flaws,

586
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,790
which are no don't matter for you,

587
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:40,720
have a responsibility to do everything
you can so that the basket you can

588
00:31:40,721 --> 00:31:43,000
flourish in the best
possible way in the world.

589
00:31:43,390 --> 00:31:47,620
And so that's what chapter two is about
in chapter three is an extension of that

590
00:31:47,621 --> 00:31:48,880
to the social world.

591
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,170
I could've written it.

592
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,010
See,

593
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:55,360
there's this psychologist named Carl
Rogers who I really like and Rogers has

594
00:31:55,361 --> 00:31:58,600
written some great things
which I'll refer to later on,

595
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:00,000
listening to really,

596
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:03,250
really practical advice
and practical advice.

597
00:32:03,251 --> 00:32:06,610
It's hard to become point right because
most things are so abstracted life that

598
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,400
you can't just can't and you
like a guidebook and say,

599
00:32:09,401 --> 00:32:09,580
well,

600
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,960
follow this and it's gonna work out,

601
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,980
but Rogers has done a nice job with that
with regards to listening and I'll tell

602
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:16,000
you about that later,

603
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:20,200
but Roger said that you should have
unconditional positive regard for your

604
00:32:20,201 --> 00:32:21,970
clients if you're a therapist.

605
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,620
I never really liked that.

606
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:28,180
I always thought there was and behavioral
analysis of Carl Rogers interactions

607
00:32:28,181 --> 00:32:32,380
with his clients indicated
that he did follow that dictate

608
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:40,430
or Oregon or that it was an insufficiently
sophisticated articulation of what he

609
00:32:40,971 --> 00:32:41,781
was actually doing.

610
00:32:41,781 --> 00:32:45,320
Which is a better way of thinking
about when clients come to see me.

611
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:49,700
What I think is I'm on the side of the
part of you that wants the best for you

612
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,180
and I have not at all on the
side of you that wants death,

613
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,430
destruction and or.

614
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:57,260
And there's definitely a part of you
and that leads in that direction,

615
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,560
and sometimes the snowbird,

616
00:32:58,590 --> 00:32:58,781
well,

617
00:32:58,781 --> 00:32:59,450
we parked.

618
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,120
That's the part that these you
to do sell both destructive,

619
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,381
despicable,

620
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:06,650
reprehensible things or at
least to contemplate doing that,

621
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,240
but also to do the like,

622
00:33:08,241 --> 00:33:09,950
let's make no mistake about that.

623
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:15,020
And so I would say that you want to make
friends and this is a moral obligation.

624
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,830
Again,

625
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,470
it goes along with the idea that
there's something about you that's

626
00:33:18,471 --> 00:33:19,790
intrinsically valuable,

627
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:22,530
that you have a responsibility
to act property to,

628
00:33:22,531 --> 00:33:25,370
towards independently of
your feelings about yourself.

629
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,750
It's the same.

630
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,350
The same thing occurs when it comes to
surrounding yourself with people in your

631
00:33:30,351 --> 00:33:31,184
life.

632
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,023
You should be.

633
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,620
You should take to yourself the right
to choose the people around you,

634
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,191
your friends,

635
00:33:37,191 --> 00:33:39,830
let's say who are happy,

636
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,470
when good things have happened to you,

637
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:47,300
genuinely happy and unhappy with bad
things happen to you who are actually on

638
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:48,410
your side.

639
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,250
And if you have people around
you that aren't like that,

640
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:57,470
then you should seriously
consider stepping away from
them because you putting

641
00:33:57,471 --> 00:34:01,700
up with the fact that they're not like
that is not in their best interests

642
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,330
either.

643
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:04,070
All you're doing is facilitating.

644
00:34:04,071 --> 00:34:05,680
They're acting in the world.

645
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,410
Have an attitude that's not good for
them and not good for you and you might

646
00:34:09,411 --> 00:34:09,730
drink well.

647
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:13,070
That's kind of harsh to walk away from
people just because they don't treat you

648
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:13,700
well.

649
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:14,181
I would say,

650
00:34:14,181 --> 00:34:16,160
well not the first time.

651
00:34:16,161 --> 00:34:18,230
They don't treat you well or not.

652
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,670
When it's when it's you know,

653
00:34:19,671 --> 00:34:20,750
no one's perfect.

654
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:25,400
There's going to be bumps and hills
and dips and every relationship.

655
00:34:25,401 --> 00:34:26,390
That's not my point,

656
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:30,440
but you know perfectly well the difference
between someone who's actually on

657
00:34:30,441 --> 00:34:35,441
your site despite their faults and
someone who who really isn't in that,

658
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:40,340
in that latter category with people
would be people who are pretty happy when

659
00:34:40,341 --> 00:34:45,270
you fail or don't even try because
they're failing and not trying at.

660
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,610
If you're doing it too,

661
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:51,110
it's a hell of a lot easier on them and
that's not a helpful situation and it's

662
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:53,150
an extraordinarily common situation.

663
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:55,040
It's even common within families.

664
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:55,211
You know,

665
00:34:55,211 --> 00:35:00,211
I've seen plenty of situations where
someone within a very dysfunctional family

666
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,500
starts to try to put together,

667
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:03,801
you know,

668
00:35:03,801 --> 00:35:08,060
in the small ways that they initially
started at all they face from their family

669
00:35:08,061 --> 00:35:09,830
members is unbelievable.

670
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,830
Bitter opposition to any viewed as
arrogant attempt on the part of the person

671
00:35:16,431 --> 00:35:19,380
who's suffering to try
to make things well.

672
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,960
The little of that goes an
awful long way and so well,

673
00:35:23,961 --> 00:35:24,590
so itself.

674
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:29,590
Those two rules are are a a philosophical
and psychological meditation on the

675
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,920
the ethical obligation you have,

676
00:35:33,921 --> 00:35:38,921
not only to treat yourself as if you
were somewhat intrinsic value and then

677
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:40,860
we'll get into what that means later,

678
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,920
but also to associate with people about
who you feel the same way and feel and

679
00:35:46,261 --> 00:35:48,600
act out the same thing
in relationship to you.

680
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:53,520
It's the minimum that you should require
of the people that you allow into your

681
00:35:53,521 --> 00:35:55,790
life and so that's cool.

682
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,470
Thanks.

683
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,100
Aggressiveness is because

684
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:07,580
some of you,

685
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,560
some of you won't be able to lead this
because you've been fortunate and I don't

686
00:36:12,561 --> 00:36:13,394
mean privileged,

687
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:14,320
mean fortunate,

688
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,700
you know,

689
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,190
certain certainly terrible things happen,

690
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:16,940
have you,

691
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,660
but you have no idea how many people
there are in the world who have never

692
00:36:20,661 --> 00:36:25,661
contemplated the idea that they might
reasonably be able to make a choice about

693
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:29,390
who they associate with in relationship
to how they're being treated.

694
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:33,710
They just never figured out without
some okay thing for someone to do.

695
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,633
You know what it's like.

696
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,640
I'll give you a parallel example.

697
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,820
Most people in my experience,

698
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,270
and this is people including my
students at the University of Toronto,

699
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:46,220
are pretty high functioning kids.

700
00:36:46,221 --> 00:36:47,180
All things considered,

701
00:36:47,181 --> 00:36:48,650
they've been academically successful.

702
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:49,910
Most of them are quite hard to repeat.

703
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,960
The vast majority of them are children
of first generation immigrants and they

704
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:54,860
have that,

705
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,191
you know,

706
00:36:55,191 --> 00:36:56,720
that drive to succeed.

707
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:00,450
That comes along with having parents who
sacrificed a hell of a lot to get you a

708
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:03,500
university and they're hoping for
good things for you and all of that.

709
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:04,850
And you know,

710
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,720
one of the things I found with them
is that despite them being in that

711
00:37:08,721 --> 00:37:09,554
situation,

712
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,640
very few of them,

713
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:15,670
by the time they were 21 or 22 had add
ever formulated anything approximating a

714
00:37:15,681 --> 00:37:19,880
conscious life plan associated say with
the development of their own character,

715
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:24,100
which points to a staggering
shortcoming in an educational system of,

716
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:27,890
of a magnitude that absolutely
can comprehensible once
you start to think about

717
00:37:27,891 --> 00:37:28,310
it,

718
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:29,330
but by the same token,

719
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:33,980
so they've never thought about the fact
that they could craft their life in some

720
00:37:33,981 --> 00:37:34,814
sense.

721
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:35,241
You know,

722
00:37:35,241 --> 00:37:38,120
that they can think about
their friendships and their
intimate relationships in

723
00:37:38,121 --> 00:37:40,420
their use of time outside of work and and,

724
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,170
and their,

725
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,170
their reactors,

726
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,690
the reaction temptation
and how they would treat,

727
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,060
how they would take care of
themselves mentally and physically.

728
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:48,380
There's never been a conscious.

729
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,090
Things are just happening to them
instead of the crafting up a plan and a

730
00:37:53,091 --> 00:37:54,230
strategy for their life.

731
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,730
And by the same token,

732
00:37:56,390 --> 00:38:00,410
they have thought consciously about
a strategy for their social being.

733
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,300
It's just never come up as an issue,

734
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,620
but it can come up.

735
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:07,370
And why would you not surrounding
yourself with people who actually want the

736
00:38:07,371 --> 00:38:08,210
best for you?

737
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:08,721
Well,

738
00:38:08,721 --> 00:38:09,830
I can tell you one reason.

739
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:15,680
What

740
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,620
reason would you don't want to
birth yourself the responsibility.

741
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,870
That's the underground reasons to say,

742
00:38:20,871 --> 00:38:23,860
well why would he put up with people
who don't want the best for you is,

743
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:23,981
well,

744
00:38:23,981 --> 00:38:25,640
they don't make much of a demand on you.

745
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,271
Right?

746
00:38:26,271 --> 00:38:29,870
So if you're just like limping along
through life bitter and resentful and

747
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:32,540
you're not putting your best
foot forward so to speak,

748
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,070
they'll forgive you for that.

749
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:37,660
But I wouldn't really that
as an indication of the
fact that they care for you.

750
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:40,600
I would regard that as an indication
of the fact that they're looking for an

751
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:44,400
excuse to continue doing exactly the
same things itself and none of that's

752
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,950
positive and none of it's health clinic.

753
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,780
Every good that has dreadful
medium to longterm consequences.

754
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:51,340
So it's not a recommendation.

755
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,190
It's not a pathway or recommend

756
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,180
rule for comparing yourself to who you
were yesterday instead of to whom someone

757
00:39:02,741 --> 00:39:04,120
else's today.

758
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:04,721
Well,

759
00:39:04,721 --> 00:39:05,554
you know,

760
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:06,980
back to the hierarchy idea.

761
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,770
So we've already decided.

762
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,873
I say,

763
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,410
I think this is a solid proposition
that if you're going to move forward in

764
00:39:14,411 --> 00:39:14,860
life,

765
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:18,550
you're going to be inside of hierarchy
and the hierarchy comes with the risk of

766
00:39:18,551 --> 00:39:19,780
failure and success.

767
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,340
And so what that means is,

768
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,720
and this isn't the eternal truth,

769
00:39:22,721 --> 00:39:23,920
it's a mythological truth,

770
00:39:23,921 --> 00:39:27,280
which is why hierarchies are
represented in mythological stories,

771
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:31,500
often outside tyrants or
canes or some figure of power.

772
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:34,720
You're in a hierarchy and because of
that you're subject to the pressure of

773
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:39,370
success and failure and to some degree
you might succeed it to some degree.

774
00:39:39,371 --> 00:39:40,204
You might fail.

775
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:40,781
You know,

776
00:39:40,781 --> 00:39:44,140
if you compare yourself to other
people out there in the world,

777
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,900
especially in our hyper connected world,

778
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:51,520
it's easy to be bitter about
your relative lack of success.

779
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,200
And I don't care a lot more dimension.

780
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,430
I don't care who you are.

781
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:58,060
There's someone better looking
at you that you know about baby.

782
00:39:58,061 --> 00:39:59,380
That's a celebrity type.

783
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,110
You know,

784
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,960
we might want to compare yourself to and,

785
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:07,100
and maybe like you're doing midland
well on the whole seven dimensions of

786
00:40:07,121 --> 00:40:09,090
comparison to perhaps you know,

787
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:09,570
and,

788
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,850
and it's easy to become better
as a consequence of that.

789
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:17,910
It's an illusion in some sense though
because it truly is an illusion,

790
00:40:18,071 --> 00:40:20,770
like I've had people in
my clinical practice,

791
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:26,050
my breakfast across the entire spectrum
of human ability from people who are

792
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,770
sufficiently intellectually impaired
and socially impaired so that it was

793
00:40:29,771 --> 00:40:33,820
impossible for them to learn how to fold
envelopes in a volunteer position and

794
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:34,654
the charity.

795
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:39,780
So that would be the low functional
end to people who run like unbelievably

796
00:40:40,181 --> 00:40:44,920
successful organizations
under unbelievably difficult
conditions for very long

797
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,540
periods of time in a very honorable man.

798
00:40:46,541 --> 00:40:48,430
And so really the entire spectrum.

799
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:53,140
And one of the things I've learned from
doing that is that people are bloody

800
00:40:53,141 --> 00:40:58,141
complicated and just because just
because they're successful at one on one

801
00:40:58,811 --> 00:41:03,480
dimension doesn't mean that their lives
are all rosy and perfect along every

802
00:41:03,481 --> 00:41:04,060
dimension.

803
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:04,270
No,

804
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:04,750
I mean,

805
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:07,210
what are the most successful
people that I dealt with?

806
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,560
Someone I really admired and respected
who did everything he could during the

807
00:41:11,561 --> 00:41:14,500
time we work together to
get is moderately sized,

808
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,560
successful business running just as
perfectly as it possibly could for his

809
00:41:20,471 --> 00:41:20,891
benefit,

810
00:41:20,891 --> 00:41:25,390
but also to a substantial degree for
the benefit of the people that he was

811
00:41:25,391 --> 00:41:26,080
training.

812
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,310
One of the things that people often
aren't credited with if they're successful

813
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,830
is their desire to help other
people become successful.

814
00:41:32,850 --> 00:41:33,050
You know,

815
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:33,490
if you,

816
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,490
if you listen to the
standard Marxist trope,

817
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,560
you'd assume that everyone who's climbed
to the top about competence hierarchy

818
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:45,120
is has a baseball bat with a
nail in it can anytime everybody,

819
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,110
anybody sticks off an arm
trying to also get get up.

820
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,710
The rung me just nailed them with it and
it's just nothing can be farther from

821
00:41:51,711 --> 00:41:52,131
the truth.

822
00:41:52,131 --> 00:41:52,640
You know,

823
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,970
the people that I've met and been really
successful are so damn happy when they

824
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,770
can find someone else who's young,

825
00:41:57,771 --> 00:41:58,640
who's competent,

826
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:01,610
who wants things to be good that
they can lend to after that,

827
00:42:01,611 --> 00:42:02,444
it's.

828
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:02,811
It isn't.

829
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,670
Even if they're doing it
for altruistic reasons.

830
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,241
Exactly.

831
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:10,241
It's the one of the pleasures of be in
a position of authority when you have

832
00:42:11,301 --> 00:42:16,301
some spare capacity is that you can help
other people build their lives and it's

833
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,510
it's

834
00:42:17,510 --> 00:42:18,343
you

835
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,780
have any sense at all,

836
00:42:27,770 --> 00:42:28,610
really shallow,

837
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,370
quite to a quite psychopathic degree,

838
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:32,870
that it's much more.

839
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,913
That's a,

840
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,840
that's a source of much more deep pleasure
and engagement than the money that

841
00:42:38,841 --> 00:42:39,674
you're making.

842
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:42,320
It's not like there's
anything against money.

843
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,790
Money is extraordinarily useful,

844
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:46,190
but to think of that as the only,

845
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,940
the only motivation for,

846
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:53,390
for successful people's pursuit of their
success and then to assume that that's

847
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,800
the only form of reward that
they get from their success.

848
00:42:55,801 --> 00:43:00,801
It's so bloody narrow minded and
unidimensional that it almost the gardens

849
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,360
belief that people can,

850
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,290
can assume that it's like they never
met anyone who was actually successful.

851
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,350
I certainly haven't met in
a reasonable number of them.

852
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,483
So.

853
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,601
All right,

854
00:43:11,601 --> 00:43:12,340
so,

855
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,790
so we have a problem.

856
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:14,780
There's hierarchies in.

857
00:43:14,781 --> 00:43:18,260
There are people who are more successful
than you on any dimension that you

858
00:43:18,261 --> 00:43:19,520
could manage and you might think,

859
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:19,970
well,

860
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:20,600
how.

861
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,470
The problem with that is it can make
you bitter and it's a real problem.

862
00:43:24,471 --> 00:43:24,741
You think,

863
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:24,861
well,

864
00:43:24,861 --> 00:43:26,210
the world is unfair.

865
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:26,481
It's like,

866
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:27,050
well,

867
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:31,730
if you had a sentence and if you took a
particular successful person and you get

868
00:43:31,731 --> 00:43:34,310
a multidimensional analysis of their life,

869
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:38,060
you find that of the seven
major dimensions of life,

870
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,830
so intimate relationships,

871
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:41,430
family time,

872
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:42,050
use of time,

873
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:43,250
outside of work,

874
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,600
educational status,

875
00:43:44,601 --> 00:43:45,434
health,

876
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:46,100
um,

877
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:50,360
resistance to temptation to say
there might be one or two others,

878
00:43:50,361 --> 00:43:54,560
but you kind of get the idea that those
people who are successful are suffering

879
00:43:54,561 --> 00:43:56,810
pretty dreadfully on at least
one of those dimensions.

880
00:43:56,811 --> 00:43:57,770
And sometimes more,

881
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:58,431
you know,

882
00:43:58,431 --> 00:44:00,220
and maybe they're doing
well in their business,

883
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,290
but they haven't extremely
ill first degree relative.

884
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:07,580
And that means both many people have
an extremely ill first degree relative,

885
00:44:07,581 --> 00:44:07,761
right?

886
00:44:07,761 --> 00:44:11,840
It's part of life or maybe they're married
is shaky or maybe they have a habit

887
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,580
of like a drug or alcohol habit that
they're having a bitch of the time I'm

888
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:17,270
dealing with.

889
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:19,790
Or they had a bad history of
abuse when they were children.

890
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:20,713
There's some,

891
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:23,180
there's at least one or
two things about delight,

892
00:44:23,181 --> 00:44:26,030
ones that are truly tragic
and often far more than one.

893
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,440
So when you meet these people,

894
00:44:27,441 --> 00:44:27,771
you think,

895
00:44:27,771 --> 00:44:28,401
oh my God,

896
00:44:28,401 --> 00:44:33,401
it's absolutely a miracle that you're
successful given you're stumbling forward

897
00:44:33,871 --> 00:44:34,440
with it.

898
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:34,831
Again,

899
00:44:34,831 --> 00:44:35,400
if you.

900
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,940
If you buy into the
critical Marxist approach,

901
00:44:38,941 --> 00:44:39,774
you think that,

902
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,450
well,

903
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:44,070
there was this one percent of the people
who dominate everything that's good in

904
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:46,200
everything about life is absolutely rosy.

905
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:50,160
It's like they live in some sort of glass
bowl paradise that the rest of us are

906
00:44:50,161 --> 00:44:53,400
completely excluded from
because those people exist.

907
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:54,121
It's like,

908
00:44:54,121 --> 00:44:54,271
well,

909
00:44:54,271 --> 00:44:55,770
if you meet people who are successful,

910
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:56,604
you think,

911
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:56,920
well,

912
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,920
that's actually kind of sad in some sense
because what you see is the economic

913
00:45:02,341 --> 00:45:03,174
success.

914
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,230
Although it's nothing to be trivialized
and certainly beats the hell out of the

915
00:45:07,231 --> 00:45:08,070
alternative.

916
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,120
It's.

917
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:13,980
It doesn't relatively feeble job of
protecting you from the fundamental

918
00:45:13,981 --> 00:45:14,980
catastrophes of like,

919
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:19,380
and that's too bad in some sense because
wouldn't it be lovely if you could be

920
00:45:19,381 --> 00:45:23,970
economically successful and then you
were far distant from any sort of

921
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,260
catastrophe or tragedy,

922
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,303
but you're not.

923
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:28,890
Now that doesn't mean you're not from
buffer and thanked me because otherwise,

924
00:45:28,891 --> 00:45:31,110
why the hell would we have
an economic system at all?

925
00:45:31,111 --> 00:45:31,321
Right?

926
00:45:31,321 --> 00:45:35,760
The whole point of the economic system
is to fight for you against catastrophe.

927
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,510
But so,

928
00:45:38,511 --> 00:45:38,900
so it's,

929
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:39,210
it's,

930
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:41,290
it's a mistake to be envious say,

931
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,400
because what it means is that you're,

932
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:46,050
you're looking at someone
through their very narrow lens,

933
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:50,370
you're elevating them above you on that
particular dimension of comparison and

934
00:45:50,371 --> 00:45:51,570
you're demeaning yourself.

935
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,710
And so technically it's a,

936
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:53,600
it's a mistake,

937
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,470
which is why I think
envy is a real mistake.

938
00:45:55,471 --> 00:45:55,711
It's like,

939
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:56,544
what am I helping you know,

940
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:57,420
the person,

941
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,590
unless they have to be very,

942
00:45:58,591 --> 00:45:59,570
very close to you,

943
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,030
you know,

944
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:01,080
what do you know about their life?

945
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:01,411
It's like,

946
00:46:01,411 --> 00:46:01,711
don't,

947
00:46:01,711 --> 00:46:03,540
don't lead to conclusions here.

948
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,840
It isn't obvious to think about you have
a class on every possible dimension.

949
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,360
And even if they do well,

950
00:46:09,361 --> 00:46:11,070
that might mean you
have something to learn.

951
00:46:11,130 --> 00:46:15,600
And it might also mean that they were
the beneficiary of a province and fate.

952
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:15,961
I mean,

953
00:46:15,961 --> 00:46:17,640
there is some element of luck in life,

954
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:17,851
right?

955
00:46:17,851 --> 00:46:18,640
But with 70,

956
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,520
we want everyone to be unlucky.

957
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,420
I don't think so.

958
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,340
That seems like a bad solution.

959
00:46:23,570 --> 00:46:25,670
And so and so and,

960
00:46:25,671 --> 00:46:25,831
and,

961
00:46:25,831 --> 00:46:28,680
and the other thing too is you actually
want there to be people who are better

962
00:46:28,681 --> 00:46:30,950
than you would think because
like what the hell else are you?

963
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,420
What are you gonna do with
their arm or you want some odd,

964
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:34,691
right?

965
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,360
I mean we already discussed that.

966
00:46:36,390 --> 00:46:37,140
It's like you're up,

967
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:39,270
you're up the pedicle
and all seven dimensions.

968
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:39,631
It's like,

969
00:46:39,631 --> 00:46:39,901
well,

970
00:46:39,901 --> 00:46:40,760
is your guns like,

971
00:46:40,870 --> 00:46:41,703
you know,

972
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,070
welcome to the promise land.

973
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:47,760
Like you need people who
are better than you think.

974
00:46:47,761 --> 00:46:48,830
So then you have something to eat.

975
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,610
Now the question is,

976
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:50,791
well,

977
00:46:50,791 --> 00:46:51,390
how do you,

978
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,360
how do you aim and improvement
without calling Craig venter this?

979
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:56,910
And I would say use yourself
as a control subject.

980
00:46:57,210 --> 00:46:59,700
It's sort of an idea I can write from,

981
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,830
from being an experimental psychologist,

982
00:47:01,831 --> 00:47:02,011
you know,

983
00:47:02,011 --> 00:47:02,610
if you,

984
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:03,443
if you,

985
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,720
if you produce two groups and
you and you run an experiment,

986
00:47:06,721 --> 00:47:09,750
I'm going to do the experiment on one
group or use the other group as a control

987
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:09,890
there.

988
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:10,860
The comparison group.

989
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,310
But you need a comparison
group for your own project,

990
00:47:14,730 --> 00:47:17,550
let's say self improvement
and the question is,

991
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:17,701
well,

992
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:21,530
who the hell should you compare yourself
to if you're going to improve and that

993
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,100
you have,

994
00:47:25,190 --> 00:47:29,110
because that's the perfect comparison
that the guy that was due yesterday,

995
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:33,430
exactly like you has all your privileges.

996
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,100
He's the same guy and so I'm so.

997
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,700
Whatever's holding you back,

998
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:40,740
what's holding you back?

999
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:44,350
It's the same thing and
whatever opportunities are
ahead of you were ahead of

1000
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,030
him.

1001
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,581
So you think,

1002
00:47:45,581 --> 00:47:46,414
well,

1003
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,370
I can be a little bit better than he was,

1004
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:53,030
and that's a group game because it
allows you to accomplish because you know

1005
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,240
there's plenty of room
for self improvement,

1006
00:47:55,241 --> 00:47:55,421
right?

1007
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:59,140
You're not going to run out of things
to manage and so you get the comparison.

1008
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:03,190
But it's a realistic control and
this is a very powerful technique.

1009
00:48:03,191 --> 00:48:06,400
I learned this partly because I'm a
behavioral psychologist in particular

1010
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:09,460
behavioral psychologists
do when you go see them,

1011
00:48:09,490 --> 00:48:13,630
it's quite fun to be trained this way
is they take larger problems like I need

1012
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:14,500
to get my life together.

1013
00:48:14,501 --> 00:48:17,080
I'm unhappy and miserable what
I need to get my life together.

1014
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:17,740
It's like,

1015
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:19,270
that's way too big a problem.

1016
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:20,560
You're never going to solve that problem.

1017
00:48:21,030 --> 00:48:21,600
That's just.

1018
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:25,060
It's too big and too many than everyone
else has the same problem and there's no

1019
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:25,894
cure for it.

1020
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,273
So it's

1021
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,640
true to the point of being a true,

1022
00:48:35,641 --> 00:48:36,100
isn't it?

1023
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:36,430
It's like,

1024
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:36,571
no,

1025
00:48:36,571 --> 00:48:36,661
no,

1026
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:36,960
no,

1027
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:37,111
no,

1028
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:37,690
no.

1029
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:38,920
We want to decompose that.

1030
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:40,080
We want to differentiate that.

1031
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:40,930
It's like,

1032
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,880
exactly why are you registered miserable.

1033
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,660
It's like,

1034
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:45,640
let's not have a one phrase description.

1035
00:48:45,641 --> 00:48:47,700
Let's talk about your
fiverr page description.

1036
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:52,890
What the Hell is wrong with you live at
the level of details that might enable

1037
00:48:53,651 --> 00:48:55,600
you to actually do something about it.

1038
00:48:55,690 --> 00:48:56,290
And so,

1039
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:56,471
you know,

1040
00:48:56,471 --> 00:48:58,900
one of the things I do with
my clients is if they're,

1041
00:48:58,901 --> 00:49:00,430
if they're depressed and anxious,

1042
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:02,590
the first thing they ask them,

1043
00:49:02,591 --> 00:49:02,921
it's like,

1044
00:49:02,921 --> 00:49:03,754
Whoa,

1045
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,140
tell me about your sleep schedule.

1046
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:10,000
And a very large proportion of people
depressed and anxious or otherwise,

1047
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,020
unless they're locked into
a fairly rigid schedule,

1048
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:16,420
have a very dysregulated
sleep and wake schedule.

1049
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:17,201
It's very common one,

1050
00:49:17,201 --> 00:49:18,640
university students for example,

1051
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:23,641
so they get up at like 7:00 one day and
2:00 the next day at 3:00 the next day,

1052
00:49:23,910 --> 00:49:24,131
you know,

1053
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:25,030
8:00 the next day,

1054
00:49:25,031 --> 00:49:28,130
although the 8:00 and
6:00 thinks they're rarer,

1055
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,370
but the first thing is like,

1056
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:31,810
why don't you fix that?

1057
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:35,410
You'll pick a god damn
time and get up like,

1058
00:49:35,411 --> 00:49:35,830
like a,

1059
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,060
like a civilized person.

1060
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:41,013
Why?

1061
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,550
One of the things you want to
do if you want to have a child,

1062
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:50,570
like an infant that is
absolutely dreadfully miserable
all the time is stabilize

1063
00:49:51,711 --> 00:49:55,570
the time they go to bed at the time they
wake up and because the child is trying

1064
00:49:55,571 --> 00:49:57,490
to stabilize its nervous system,

1065
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:58,863
right?

1066
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,610
Because life is very chaotic and what
you're trying to do with the child is

1067
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:07,650
provide some islands of stability so that
the child can organize it's competence

1068
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:10,750
around those islands of stability
and you need to do the same thing for

1069
00:50:10,751 --> 00:50:11,320
yourself.

1070
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,010
It's like if,

1071
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:15,430
if things are all over
the place in your life,

1072
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:17,250
then you can start
stabilizing and say like,

1073
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,430
pick a time to get up.

1074
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,563
What time?

1075
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:20,530
Well,

1076
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:22,930
how about a why?

1077
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,550
Because that's what most people get to.

1078
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:25,970
So here's another rule.

1079
00:50:26,050 --> 00:50:27,500
You should do what most people do,

1080
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:30,520
unless they're special

1081
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,760
person can't get up at eight because I'm
a bleeding flaming genius at creating.

1082
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,040
I'm inventing Toronto Equations will
never say you don't have to get up at

1083
00:50:44,811 --> 00:50:45,644
eight,

1084
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,160
but if you're not Michelangelo or or
Einstein was doing what people do because

1085
00:50:53,781 --> 00:50:57,050
they have a reason for doing it and then
you fit in the world a little bit and

1086
00:50:57,051 --> 00:51:00,980
it's also not such a bad thing to fit
in the world a little bit better because

1087
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:06,310
it's just easier for you for everyone
else and so and then you might be okay,

1088
00:51:07,011 --> 00:51:08,040
so then you might take one.

1089
00:51:08,150 --> 00:51:11,030
I can't just all of a sudden
get up at 8:00 in the morning.

1090
00:51:11,210 --> 00:51:12,130
I don't have the discipline.

1091
00:51:12,350 --> 00:51:13,160
It's okay.

1092
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:14,120
No problem.

1093
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:18,500
How about you get up before
10 for like three days?

1094
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,653
It is.

1095
00:51:20,150 --> 00:51:20,871
Seriously.

1096
00:51:20,871 --> 00:51:24,050
It's like an idiot if you have a real
discussion with someone about this.

1097
00:51:24,051 --> 00:51:24,321
You say,

1098
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:24,561
look,

1099
00:51:24,561 --> 00:51:25,394
here's the deal.

1100
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,850
I know it's hard for people
to change the behavior.

1101
00:51:28,910 --> 00:51:29,930
I understand that.

1102
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,030
And what I want you to do,

1103
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,700
we're going to figure out a plan that
will make things better for you with,

1104
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,760
I don't want you to agree with
the plan unless you agree with it,

1105
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,290
because what the hell is that?

1106
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,540
We're going to come up with a
plan and you know perfectly well,

1107
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:44,360
you're not going to implement it and
you're going to tell me it's a good plan

1108
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:47,930
because you're too agreeable and you
want to make me happy or some bad reasons

1109
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:48,800
like that.

1110
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,570
And then we're just wasting our time.

1111
00:51:50,571 --> 00:51:53,750
So why don't we just assume that it's
just as hard for you to change your

1112
00:51:53,751 --> 00:51:56,900
behavior as it is in everyone else and
you're probably not going to do it.

1113
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:58,240
And so don't say yes.

1114
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,320
Anything that you don't
think you would actually do.

1115
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,680
And then that's an exercise
in humility because you know,

1116
00:52:04,681 --> 00:52:07,460
when we tried to go to the gym
three times a week and you fail.

1117
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,460
And so like everyone or almost everyone,

1118
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,710
and no matter how many of those
resolutions you make a new year's,

1119
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,560
you just don't do it.

1120
00:52:15,561 --> 00:52:18,480
You don't stop eating cake and
you don't stop drinking too.

1121
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:18,900
Beer,

1122
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:19,820
fear and all of that.

1123
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,320
You just keep doing so.

1124
00:52:21,321 --> 00:52:21,540
Okay.

1125
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,030
It's hard to change your behavior,

1126
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,540
so I'm going to lay out a plan with you.

1127
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:27,231
We'll discuss it,

1128
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:30,380
and if you think that it's a good
plan that you might do then say Gif,

1129
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:31,240
but otherwise say no,

1130
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:36,200
what will a floor but we want to do
is aim low enough so that you have a

1131
00:52:36,201 --> 00:52:40,940
reasonable probability of success and in
our three constitute some improvement.

1132
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:42,470
Now Carl Jung said,

1133
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,200
modern people don't see God
because they don't look low enough,

1134
00:52:45,650 --> 00:52:47,690
and that's the sort of thing
that he was referring to.

1135
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,410
It's like,

1136
00:52:48,410 --> 00:52:49,820
let's say you want to improve yourself.

1137
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:50,211
It's like,

1138
00:52:50,211 --> 00:52:51,050
well,

1139
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:52,480
how much are you capable of,

1140
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:52,911
you know,

1141
00:52:52,911 --> 00:52:56,120
lead from you to the Messiah one week?

1142
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:56,983
No,

1143
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:58,070
that's not going to happen.

1144
00:52:58,130 --> 00:53:01,060
Like you might be slightly
better than your wretched self,

1145
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,300
one 10th of one percent
or something like that,

1146
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,790
but it doesn't have because of the
trajectory is more important than the

1147
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:15,110
starting place and incremental
improvements are staggeringly worthwhile.

1148
00:53:15,350 --> 00:53:19,460
They pumped up incredibly quickly and
it's part of the reflection of this prieto

1149
00:53:19,461 --> 00:53:23,390
distribution issue or price's law is
when you started improving things,

1150
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:24,740
each time improved something.

1151
00:53:24,741 --> 00:53:28,860
You've the probability that the next
improvement will work and so there will be

1152
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,930
improvement.

1153
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,640
Trajectory isn't linear.

1154
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:37,050
It's like this and so if you
can get the damn thing going,

1155
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:38,580
which is hard,

1156
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:42,300
it's hard to get those initial steps in
place that can really take off if you're

1157
00:53:42,301 --> 00:53:45,120
consistent with it and so what it
might mean the first week is if you're

1158
00:53:45,121 --> 00:53:47,110
sleeping schedule is completely awry.

1159
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:51,960
Then you get up three days this week
before 10:00 and that's like 10 percent

1160
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:53,310
better than the previous week.

1161
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:53,690
It's like,

1162
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:54,523
yes,

1163
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:58,530
you've compared yourself than you
were yesterday and now you're better,

1164
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,080
and then the next thing
I ask people is like,

1165
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,580
what do you do when you get up?

1166
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:03,730
Do you eat now?

1167
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:07,200
I'm not one of those people who have some
breakfast to be wonderful human beings

1168
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:08,310
that need to say,

1169
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:09,400
why do I?

1170
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:09,900
I've never.

1171
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,090
I've never been hungry
in the morning as well.

1172
00:54:12,091 --> 00:54:13,080
That wasn't a question.

1173
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:16,020
It's like I didn't ask you
if you enjoy breakfast,

1174
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,040
that's not the point.

1175
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:22,400
The point is you had to fast for 12
hours or 16 hours and now you have three

1176
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:23,221
cups of coffee,

1177
00:54:23,221 --> 00:54:26,970
which is not a very good idea and then
you load yourself cognitively and you

1178
00:54:26,971 --> 00:54:28,380
just regulate yourself.

1179
00:54:28,381 --> 00:54:29,850
Psychophysiologic Lee,

1180
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,200
because you hyper produce insulin.

1181
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,370
As soon as you stressed yourself,

1182
00:54:32,371 --> 00:54:35,400
you take all the sugar out of your blood
and then you're basically screwed until

1183
00:54:35,401 --> 00:54:36,450
you sleep again that night.

1184
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:41,100
And so if you're anxious more than you
want to be and you don't eat breakfast,

1185
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:45,360
you can probably get rid of 30 to 40
percent of your anxiety just by eating

1186
00:54:45,361 --> 00:54:46,950
breakfast and you think,

1187
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:47,430
you know,

1188
00:54:47,430 --> 00:54:47,770
it's like,

1189
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:48,560
yeah,

1190
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,393
you have

1191
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:51,393
to

1192
00:54:52,170 --> 00:54:52,360
think,

1193
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:52,530
well,

1194
00:54:52,530 --> 00:54:52,910
I read it.

1195
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:53,980
I don't like breakfast.

1196
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:54,780
Like eggs.

1197
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,090
Like who cares what the hell?

1198
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:59,340
Like what kind of experiences

1199
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:08,653
for.

1200
00:55:09,930 --> 00:55:10,763
Right.

1201
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,590
When you probably develop the
habit of not eating breakfast,

1202
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,570
do you haven't revisited it since then?

1203
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:20,370
So eat something that's sort of protein
and fat heavy in the morning and at six

1204
00:55:20,371 --> 00:55:21,780
months you will start through joy it.

1205
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:25,830
I thought that's a whole different issue
and then just do that three days this

1206
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:29,580
week and see if you feel
better and if you don't,

1207
00:55:29,581 --> 00:55:30,030
well that,

1208
00:55:30,030 --> 00:55:32,330
you know I'm wrong and so
much for that stupid theory,

1209
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:33,650
we'll try but.

1210
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:35,160
And we'll try it,

1211
00:55:35,161 --> 00:55:36,240
but people come back.

1212
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:40,290
I had one client who
was actually starving.

1213
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:42,203
I mean she,

1214
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:43,290
this person was,

1215
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,390
was very nicely put together.

1216
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:49,320
Twenty five year old professional woman
and all she ate was like two handfuls of

1217
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:51,030
rice a day and she said,

1218
00:55:51,031 --> 00:55:53,850
I come home and all I can do is
to sort of fall over on the couch.

1219
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,500
And I watched the same movie every night.

1220
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,251
So like,

1221
00:55:56,251 --> 00:55:57,870
I don't know why any energy.

1222
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:02,190
So I did a careful analysis of her
sleep and eating habits and I thought,

1223
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:02,761
Oh,

1224
00:56:02,761 --> 00:56:03,990
well you're actually starving.

1225
00:56:03,991 --> 00:56:04,824
That's your

1226
00:56:07,010 --> 00:56:07,350
things.

1227
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:08,183
I really liked

1228
00:56:16,690 --> 00:56:17,523
that job.

1229
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:22,350
It's a testament to the
lack of utility of envy.

1230
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,273
That's the first.

1231
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:28,650
And it's also our encouragement to be
humble enough to make small improvements

1232
00:56:32,351 --> 00:56:36,610
to who you are in the hopes that that
will catch on and moving forward.

1233
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,940
And I can offer you a sort
of a strategy for that.

1234
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:40,953
This is a nice one.

1235
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:41,621
This actually,

1236
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:45,700
this actually works quite well and I do
lay it over to some degree in the book.

1237
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,230
So.

1238
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:48,520
So the first thing is you
might take stock and think,

1239
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:48,761
okay,

1240
00:56:48,761 --> 00:56:49,900
well what are you doing that you know,

1241
00:56:49,901 --> 00:56:50,810
that stupid.

1242
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,480
It's like you can make a long list here.

1243
00:56:52,481 --> 00:56:53,201
Stupid things.

1244
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:54,011
I know I do that.

1245
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:54,730
I should stop.

1246
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:55,151
It's okay,

1247
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:55,860
great.

1248
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:56,141
Great.

1249
00:56:56,141 --> 00:56:56,860
That's no problem.

1250
00:56:56,860 --> 00:56:58,450
You can ask yourself that question.

1251
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:03,010
What stupid things do I do that make my
life more wretched and few tiles that it

1252
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:04,450
has to be okay?

1253
00:57:04,451 --> 00:57:05,070
And so,

1254
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:05,560
and if you,

1255
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,920
if you do a little meditation around
that and we actually want to know,

1256
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:12,870
you'll come up with a list pretty fast
and it's kind of a humbling exercise,

1257
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:13,120
right?

1258
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:13,960
To do that.

1259
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:14,550
But.

1260
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:17,430
But it's worthwhile because if
your life is more regimented,

1261
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:19,120
few titles that people want to be,

1262
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:23,470
it's possible that the reason it's like
that at least in part is because you're

1263
00:57:23,471 --> 00:57:25,210
doing things to yourself
that are good for you.

1264
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:28,140
And so then there's the question
that derives his therapy,

1265
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:28,960
which would be,

1266
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:29,560
well,

1267
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,730
if your life is the way you want it to
be and you start doing all the stupid

1268
00:57:33,731 --> 00:57:35,440
things you know that you're doing,

1269
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:37,090
then how much better would it be?

1270
00:57:37,290 --> 00:57:39,160
And the answer is you don't know,

1271
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:40,590
maybe it would be way better.

1272
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:43,320
Maybe it would be so much better than
it wouldn't be wretched and futile

1273
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:44,163
anymore.

1274
00:57:44,170 --> 00:57:47,090
And so it might be worth that
might be worth finding out,

1275
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,670
hyperventilate.

1276
00:57:48,750 --> 00:57:48,971
You know,

1277
00:57:48,971 --> 00:57:51,850
if you don't want to just
suck the stupidly it would be,

1278
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:54,970
it wouldn't be worthwhile
making the effort to find out.

1279
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,140
And so

1280
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:09,700
after 20 years of teaching from
my wife to actually drink water,

1281
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:14,403
okay,

1282
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:18,640
so now you make a list of your
faults and then you think,

1283
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:20,520
well I got you're useful
and I'm pretty bad,

1284
00:58:20,521 --> 00:58:21,060
but it's the.

1285
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:25,990
And probably I don't do any of the
things I need to do to fix any of that.

1286
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,830
But maybe there's something on this list
that I could fix that I actually would

1287
00:58:29,831 --> 00:58:30,664
fix.

1288
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,920
And so that's like asking yourself again,

1289
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,240
don't tell yourself.

1290
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:39,070
It's like you're negotiating with someone
who's kind of fake headed and you know

1291
00:58:39,080 --> 00:58:42,640
I'm very well put together and you can
just tell them what to do because they're

1292
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:43,570
not going to do it,

1293
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:48,070
but you might go an ask them if there
was something that they would do,

1294
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:49,660
what it might be,

1295
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,330
and you can do that to yourself
and people have got this list.

1296
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,860
Is there something on this list?

1297
00:58:53,890 --> 00:58:58,270
Is there some step I could take
to address something on this list?

1298
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:00,190
Then I would actually take.

1299
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:04,450
Then I would have answered
that almost invariably.

1300
00:59:04,451 --> 00:59:04,930
Yes.

1301
00:59:04,930 --> 00:59:05,171
I think,

1302
00:59:05,171 --> 00:59:05,740
well,

1303
00:59:05,740 --> 00:59:06,100
you know,

1304
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:06,330
my,

1305
00:59:06,330 --> 00:59:07,450
my closet,

1306
00:59:07,451 --> 00:59:09,250
it's a squall of the alcohol.

1307
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:14,430
I might be willing to take three of the
lowest of all pieces of laundry out and

1308
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,100
contemplate something like that.

1309
00:59:19,410 --> 00:59:24,410
Or maybe I have a stack of papers guess
and this sort of strewn everywhere and I

1310
00:59:25,341 --> 00:59:27,220
don't want to do anything with them,

1311
00:59:27,260 --> 00:59:30,290
but I'll go in like a look at
the top three pieces of paper.

1312
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:32,930
That's a lot harder than you think,

1313
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:33,500
man.

1314
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:34,500
Because you know,

1315
00:59:34,501 --> 00:59:36,830
you create a stack of paper like that.

1316
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:39,110
You walk into the room
where that's Dr Pepper is.

1317
00:59:39,111 --> 00:59:40,850
You won't even look at that ball.

1318
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:45,170
That's because it's full of snakes and
that's how your body's responding to

1319
00:59:45,850 --> 00:59:46,683
snakes,

1320
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:47,643
man.

1321
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:54,050
Technically that is exactly what because
it isn't the predatory detect is the

1322
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:55,830
Predator detection circuit that kicks in,

1323
00:59:55,831 --> 00:59:59,300
that makes you don't look at those faces
and for good reason and so if you go

1324
00:59:59,301 --> 01:00:00,134
there and you just,

1325
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:04,700
you're like 60 percent of the way to
actually doing something about them and so

1326
01:00:04,701 --> 01:00:06,560
you've got to negotiate
with yourself and think,

1327
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:06,861
okay,

1328
01:00:06,861 --> 01:00:11,780
well if I've got to fix myself off
what in my current wretched state,

1329
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,800
what small steps am I actually
willing to take and that works.

1330
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:16,690
It really works.

1331
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,470
And that's where behavioral psychologist,

1332
01:00:18,471 --> 01:00:18,690
no,

1333
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:23,690
it's like break the dam them down until
you're willing to take a step forward on

1334
01:00:25,131 --> 01:00:25,870
that pathway.

1335
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:28,820
If something is completely
intractable that's facing you,

1336
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:29,670
you know,

1337
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:33,620
decomposes and he'll just keep cutting
it into smaller and smaller pieces until

1338
01:00:33,621 --> 01:00:34,460
you finally get a piece.

1339
01:00:34,461 --> 01:00:34,731
You think,

1340
01:00:34,731 --> 01:00:34,881
Hey,

1341
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,050
I can ask you that,

1342
01:00:36,350 --> 01:00:37,760
but that's also still worthwhile.

1343
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:39,440
You can't be so trivial,

1344
01:00:39,441 --> 01:00:41,210
but you don't get any
satisfaction out of it,

1345
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,583
so okay.

1346
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:44,433
That's

1347
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:55,450
basically it says despite your mention
present condition and your relative lack

1348
01:00:56,271 --> 01:00:57,050
of process,

1349
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:01,340
most things you can make it like
simple enough if you think about it,

1350
01:01:01,430 --> 01:01:05,060
so that will probably be able to make
it slightly better and then you can

1351
01:01:05,061 --> 01:01:05,894
iterate them.

1352
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,070
It's like that's believable.

1353
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:11,210
It's not like you're jumping up and down
in some sort of narcissistic way about

1354
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:12,320
how great you are.

1355
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:13,310
It's not that at all.

1356
01:01:13,311 --> 01:01:16,760
It's like you're taking your
limitations and the human limitations,

1357
01:01:16,761 --> 01:01:16,941
right?

1358
01:01:16,941 --> 01:01:21,650
Because everyone's like that into account
and you're actually starting to be

1359
01:01:21,651 --> 01:01:25,480
willing to realistically work with them
and it really does work and accelerate,

1360
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:26,510
so that's a good thing.

1361
01:01:26,870 --> 01:01:27,171
Okay,

1362
01:01:27,171 --> 01:01:28,180
so rural fire,

1363
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:30,380
this is what I thought
would be very contentious,

1364
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,280
but it hasn't been that contentious,

1365
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:35,630
which actually surprises me.

1366
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:39,320
Don't let your children do
anything that makes you just like,

1367
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,453
now

1368
01:01:42,710 --> 01:01:45,680
I'd like to punch of fishes,

1369
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:46,514
twists in it,

1370
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,031
you know,

1371
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:52,031
and one of them is just
propositions nested inside
of one of the children can be

1372
01:01:52,491 --> 01:01:53,580
dislikable.

1373
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:54,290
Okay.

1374
01:01:54,290 --> 01:01:56,210
What will everyone knows that,

1375
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,800
I mean when you were a child,

1376
01:01:57,860 --> 01:01:58,820
there were lots of children.

1377
01:01:58,821 --> 01:01:59,654
You get light,

1378
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,523
right?

1379
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:01,620
When you're an adult,

1380
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:05,300
you have friends and they have
children with and you don't like.

1381
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:10,040
Some of those children is have to do less
likely to invite those adults to your

1382
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:10,371
house.

1383
01:02:10,371 --> 01:02:13,700
You won't say anything
to smile with your mouth,

1384
01:02:13,701 --> 01:02:14,534
but not your eyes.

1385
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:15,473
When the children,

1386
01:02:16,560 --> 01:02:19,020
that's the same style of site uses

1387
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:25,050
what it's like to be a
child and no one likes.

1388
01:02:25,051 --> 01:02:27,480
And then when they go and they see adults,

1389
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,130
the adults smile at them with their mouth.

1390
01:02:29,131 --> 01:02:29,964
But Dr Rice.

1391
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,430
It's like what sort of
world is that for a child?

1392
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,940
It's like they're surrounded
by well meaning cycle house,

1393
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:37,590
right?

1394
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:42,120
And that's what you do to your child if
you allow them to do things that make

1395
01:02:42,121 --> 01:02:43,010
people dislike them.

1396
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:45,720
And so that is not a good
thing to do to your child.

1397
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,060
And so we've been,

1398
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:47,581
first of all,

1399
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:49,160
the children can be just like a whole.

1400
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:53,640
And then we had met that parents can
facilitate the dislike ability of their

1401
01:02:53,641 --> 01:02:57,300
children and we admit third that
parents can dislike their children,

1402
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:59,430
whose parents don't dislike her children.

1403
01:02:59,431 --> 01:02:59,990
It's like,

1404
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:00,090
well,

1405
01:03:00,090 --> 01:03:00,923
first of all,

1406
01:03:00,930 --> 01:03:05,930
there's at least 20 percent of the people
in this audience at least have not had

1407
01:03:06,821 --> 01:03:08,610
a very good relationship
with their parents.

1408
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:09,900
And so,

1409
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:10,350
and you know,

1410
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:12,060
families can be an absolute snake pit.

1411
01:03:12,061 --> 01:03:15,810
You're way more likely to be killed by a
family member that a stranger like way,

1412
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:16,441
way more,

1413
01:03:16,441 --> 01:03:18,030
like way more like,

1414
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:19,590
especially if you drained with them.

1415
01:03:19,830 --> 01:03:21,130
So if you don't want

1416
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:25,440
to be killed and don't
treat them with your family,

1417
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,380
your risk of homicide,

1418
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:32,070
just stay away from your kid falls.

1419
01:03:34,890 --> 01:03:35,191
Okay?

1420
01:03:35,191 --> 01:03:37,290
So now the next

1421
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:39,570
tip,

1422
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:44,570
contentious proposition is that perhaps
you shouldn't dislike your children.

1423
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:45,841
You Think,

1424
01:03:45,841 --> 01:03:46,141
oh no,

1425
01:03:46,141 --> 01:03:50,080
that can't be possibly cute
kids campus like the cat.

1426
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:50,940
You should.

1427
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,990
Here's why.

1428
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:53,550
When you just like your children,

1429
01:03:54,150 --> 01:03:57,150
you should just like your children when
they're doing things that other people

1430
01:03:57,151 --> 01:03:59,040
would dislike them for doing.

1431
01:03:59,430 --> 01:04:02,340
Because if you like the video,

1432
01:04:07,470 --> 01:04:09,600
then they won't learn not to do them.

1433
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,480
And then wherever they go,

1434
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,140
other kids won't like them and play
with them and we'll facilitate their

1435
01:04:16,141 --> 01:04:21,141
development forward because by the time
your child about you have an over most

1436
01:04:21,571 --> 01:04:26,571
of the responsibility for
socialization to other children.

1437
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:30,840
So your job as a parent is to make your
child likable by other children by the

1438
01:04:30,841 --> 01:04:31,780
time they're in fourth.

1439
01:04:31,830 --> 01:04:33,000
And I can tell you this too,

1440
01:04:33,060 --> 01:04:34,770
if you fail at that,

1441
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:38,400
they will never recover
no matter what you do.

1442
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:43,620
And then the experiment with clinical
literature on this is painfully clear.

1443
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:48,660
So kids who are alienated an antisocial
by the time therefore there is no one

1444
01:04:48,661 --> 01:04:49,870
knows what to do about it.

1445
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:53,010
None of the interventions
that have been tried work,

1446
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:53,691
none of them.

1447
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:54,660
And believe me,

1448
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:55,520
psychologist,

1449
01:04:55,520 --> 01:04:59,000
social scientist have been hitting
this problem apart since about 19,

1450
01:04:59,020 --> 01:04:59,853
25.

1451
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,490
And they've done everything
you can possibly think of.

1452
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:07,020
Andy in combination and a bunch of things
you can think of and it hasn't worked.

1453
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:10,950
And so there's a critical
period of development between
about the age of two and

1454
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:15,980
about gauge for where you facilitate the
social acceptability of your children.

1455
01:05:16,170 --> 01:05:17,590
And if you miss that window,

1456
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,040
well then good luck to them.

1457
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,130
So in what seems to happen,

1458
01:05:21,180 --> 01:05:22,130
here's why it happens.

1459
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:27,590
So let's say you have two four year olds
and their size each other up and there

1460
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:30,020
because they're trying to figure
out what is elemental level,

1461
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,970
the wrap and you knew you do that with
adults as you want to be with an adult

1462
01:05:33,971 --> 01:05:37,670
who's kind of at the same level you are
to some degree if their way to hell in

1463
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,150
Bob you with some sphere and you're not
going to relate to them in that sphere

1464
01:05:41,151 --> 01:05:42,820
and if the way below
you will the same thing.

1465
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:46,600
You want someone that you can kind of
contend with and so kids size each other

1466
01:05:46,601 --> 01:05:47,380
up.

1467
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:50,440
If you're a four year old is
still acting like a two year old.

1468
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:54,010
Then the other four year olds
will not play with him or her.

1469
01:05:54,011 --> 01:05:58,450
And then they will mature into five
year olds and then they weren't mature.

1470
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,120
Six year olds and then
they weren't mature.

1471
01:06:00,121 --> 01:06:00,910
It's a seven year olds.

1472
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:05,910
They'll just stay two and two that they
call them the terrible twos for region

1473
01:06:06,641 --> 01:06:11,641
two year olds are relatively egocentric
and so if the two year old you have a

1474
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,020
child who's still to add for that,

1475
01:06:14,021 --> 01:06:17,340
that's that because the other kids
won't scaffold their development,

1476
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:20,950
so it's your job to dislike your
children when they're doing things,

1477
01:06:20,970 --> 01:06:22,090
dislikable things.

1478
01:06:22,240 --> 01:06:26,770
It's your moral obligation and to correct
them so that the reason you do that is

1479
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:29,210
to correct them.

1480
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,360
It's not to answer besides your authority.

1481
01:06:31,550 --> 01:06:36,200
It's not even to instill a
sense of morality and the
Indians some arbitrary and

1482
01:06:36,220 --> 01:06:37,420
technical way.

1483
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,910
It's simple why you do that.

1484
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,780
Here's what you want for your children.

1485
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:46,450
You want them to have other
children line up to play with them.

1486
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:50,500
That's like success map
and so that child is like,

1487
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:55,090
they got the kind of social graces
that allow them to go into an arena of

1488
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:57,370
children they don't know
and make friends quickly.

1489
01:06:57,730 --> 01:06:58,690
It's like victory,

1490
01:06:58,750 --> 01:06:59,320
man.

1491
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:03,490
You've done 90 percent of what you have
to do with imperative to manage that and

1492
01:07:03,491 --> 01:07:04,330
so and then,

1493
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:06,100
but there's more to it to like.

1494
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,480
One of the things I've
moved and I have no kids,

1495
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,210
I lived in a rough area in Montreal.

1496
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:14,470
We have my daughter Mikayla booster board
around this little cheap stroller in

1497
01:07:14,471 --> 01:07:16,180
this working class
neighborhood in Montreal.

1498
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:17,170
There's lots of rough guys,

1499
01:07:17,590 --> 01:07:18,880
rough people in that neighborhood,

1500
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:24,060
but it was such fun to wheel around
because you'd see these like rough looking

1501
01:07:24,251 --> 01:07:24,671
guys,

1502
01:07:24,671 --> 01:07:25,990
lumberjack looking guys,

1503
01:07:25,991 --> 01:07:26,540
you know,

1504
01:07:26,540 --> 01:07:27,760
a working class,

1505
01:07:27,761 --> 01:07:28,860
French Canadian type,

1506
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:31,980
kind of tough to think like Tom Waits,

1507
01:07:32,090 --> 01:07:37,090
gestures walking down the street and
they'd see our girl and they're stronger

1508
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:37,900
and like they,

1509
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,870
they instantly get a goofy
grin like technicolor,

1510
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:41,171
you know,

1511
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:46,171
and it's so cool because what you see
is that you have to be a pretty damned

1512
01:07:46,401 --> 01:07:47,870
good in human being.

1513
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:52,750
Not to draw up your shell and open up
a little bit when you see a young child

1514
01:07:52,751 --> 01:07:54,850
who's kind of open to the world and fresh.

1515
01:07:54,851 --> 01:07:55,530
Right?

1516
01:07:55,530 --> 01:07:59,620
And so you see the best people when
you have kids and if you're fortunate,

1517
01:07:59,830 --> 01:08:02,500
and so see that's when
you want for your kids,

1518
01:08:02,530 --> 01:08:02,861
right?

1519
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:07,810
Is You want them to behave in a way that
brings out the best in adults and so

1520
01:08:07,811 --> 01:08:09,880
when you take them out
in the actual world,

1521
01:08:09,910 --> 01:08:13,840
the adults are happy and
they will be given a chance,

1522
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:14,171
you know,

1523
01:08:14,171 --> 01:08:17,000
because people generally
quite positively to children,

1524
01:08:17,001 --> 01:08:20,330
unless the children are angels
or do something equally,

1525
01:08:20,331 --> 01:08:21,170
reprehensible,

1526
01:08:22,330 --> 01:08:25,480
rolling door and only gets kicked
because only knows this crowd.

1527
01:08:25,690 --> 01:08:29,960
You know that's not a good strategy and
so you want your kids to be eminently

1528
01:08:29,961 --> 01:08:31,610
desirements with other children,

1529
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:37,320
not solving massive problems right there
and then you want them to be attracted

1530
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:38,090
to adults.

1531
01:08:38,090 --> 01:08:43,090
So the bands of the sign with the
adults come forward and welcomes to

1532
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:48,020
continually into the world and you can
actually rely on window you despite your

1533
01:08:48,021 --> 01:08:49,600
child because look,

1534
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,820
we know that you have arbitrary
faults and sometimes you're good.

1535
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:55,310
You're good to irritate you
because you're ignoring everything.

1536
01:08:55,311 --> 01:08:56,930
You should be right in.

1537
01:08:56,931 --> 01:08:59,340
They're getting on your nerves and
it's your plenty trauma problems,

1538
01:09:00,170 --> 01:09:03,890
but what was shooting that you're 60
to 70 percent put together or something

1539
01:09:03,891 --> 01:09:04,640
like that.

1540
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:05,473
Or maybe it's higher,

1541
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:06,533
a little lower,

1542
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:09,860
and maybe we can also assume that you're
fortunate enough to have a partner

1543
01:09:09,861 --> 01:09:14,600
who's also a 60 to 70 percent put together
in a slightly different way than you,

1544
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:19,660
and so the two of you together might make
a person the in the main is 90 percent

1545
01:09:23,060 --> 01:09:27,500
and not person that you made jointly
is a reflection of the social world.

1546
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:29,570
That's what it should be
because that's what a parent is.

1547
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,360
A parent is a reflection
of the real social,

1548
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:35,090
and so if you're going to
do your children to favor,

1549
01:09:35,091 --> 01:09:40,091
then that joint when you and your partner
is reflects the reality of the social

1550
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:41,510
world to the child.

1551
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:44,420
So the child figures out how
to live in this social world.

1552
01:09:44,450 --> 01:09:45,660
You're not their friend.

1553
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:46,960
You know?

1554
01:09:48,260 --> 01:09:49,510
Maybe when you're a doctor,

1555
01:09:49,570 --> 01:09:53,100
you can be friends hopefully you can
be friends with and it's not quite your

1556
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,240
last friend and see him
way more than a friend,

1557
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:55,840
right?

1558
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,840
Way More and the child needs deep
reflection of the social work.

1559
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,470
Tampered with a bit of immersive,

1560
01:10:02,580 --> 01:10:02,910
right?

1561
01:10:02,910 --> 01:10:04,400
Because if you're a parent,

1562
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:06,680
you're going to be more
forgiving of your child,

1563
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:12,100
then the arbitrary social world wellbeing
and that doesn't mean you forgive them

1564
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:12,561
everything.

1565
01:10:12,561 --> 01:10:13,700
It doesn't mean that at all.

1566
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:15,780
It just means that the patients you're,

1567
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,200
you're,

1568
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,060
you're bringing them along.

1569
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:19,010
That's your cool.

1570
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:20,883
That's fine.

1571
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:25,563
Don't

1572
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,350
were able to map.

1573
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:33,060
So you know things that you think,

1574
01:10:33,330 --> 01:10:36,270
oh very happy about that you think,

1575
01:10:36,271 --> 01:10:36,511
okay,

1576
01:10:36,511 --> 01:10:37,620
well maybe I can fix that.

1577
01:10:37,621 --> 01:10:40,050
I can help this child figure
out how to do those things.

1578
01:10:40,051 --> 01:10:40,884
You can have them.

1579
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,710
So my son was an ordinary little

1580
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:46,653
pushing it.

1581
01:10:46,890 --> 01:10:47,221
It's like,

1582
01:10:47,221 --> 01:10:48,054
okay,

1583
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:50,790
this definitely view in
which you didn't like at all.

1584
01:10:50,791 --> 01:10:53,000
He was quite fraternity

1585
01:10:54,940 --> 01:10:55,773
necessity.

1586
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:00,840
Kind of have a little chat with him was
when he was about three and then say,

1587
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:01,081
look,

1588
01:11:01,081 --> 01:11:01,261
you know,

1589
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:05,460
you can't act like that and you can sit
here and think about it and when you're

1590
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:06,900
ready to be a civilized human being,

1591
01:11:06,901 --> 01:11:09,810
you can come and tell me and
then we'll have a good day.

1592
01:11:09,811 --> 01:11:14,020
And so you can sit here and fix things
up and have a good or you can keep doing

1593
01:11:14,030 --> 01:11:14,450
what you're doing.

1594
01:11:14,450 --> 01:11:17,700
Have a wrench in the
day to make choice kid,

1595
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:22,800
so we sit on the stairs or your
bath mat and I drove up to them,

1596
01:11:22,801 --> 01:11:23,250
you know,

1597
01:11:23,250 --> 01:11:24,780
two minutes later and say,

1598
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:25,110
look,

1599
01:11:25,110 --> 01:11:26,720
are you to get off both the stairs?

1600
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:28,293
He,

1601
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:33,630
they was drying bonus might to control
his rage and these little kid and the

1602
01:11:33,700 --> 01:11:35,580
kids fail temper Tantrum,

1603
01:11:35,650 --> 01:11:37,380
so completely consumed by rage.

1604
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,870
It's not easy to bring that under control.

1605
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:43,920
And so he was sitting there like fighting
with his head with his hypothalamus,

1606
01:11:43,921 --> 01:11:44,754
this ancient,

1607
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:47,610
trying to bring it under control and then,

1608
01:11:47,611 --> 01:11:48,180
you know,

1609
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,140
I'd leave him be.

1610
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:51,700
And usually after about five
minutes or so he'd come in.

1611
01:11:51,701 --> 01:11:52,700
He was more contrite.

1612
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:53,331
I mean,

1613
01:11:53,331 --> 01:11:53,670
you know,

1614
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:56,700
the attitude that we would bring to bear
then was something I'd like to right

1615
01:11:56,701 --> 01:11:57,030
away.

1616
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:01,290
It's like he was ready to be a civilized
human being again and now I instantly

1617
01:12:01,291 --> 01:12:03,150
liked him because the rule was

1618
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:07,750
once you get off the spirits and
you've decided to be a civilized,

1619
01:12:07,751 --> 01:12:10,410
he with me then I liked him right away.

1620
01:12:10,420 --> 01:12:11,940
It's like I'm not going to hold a brush.

1621
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:17,150
That's one of the useful things about
using effective disciplinary strategies so

1622
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:18,120
you don't have to hold a grudge.

1623
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:22,260
It's like stuck with because it's
actually done with so he'd come and say,

1624
01:12:22,261 --> 01:12:22,441
well,

1625
01:12:22,441 --> 01:12:27,010
I want to have a good day and then we'd
have a good day and so we'll kind of

1626
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:32,060
consequences of that was that we mostly
have a date and so what a deal is a

1627
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,730
relationship that you have.

1628
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,240
It's probably the only relationship you've
ever had in your whole life where it

1629
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:43,840
can actually be almost all good if
you're careful and then only parts of the

1630
01:12:43,841 --> 01:12:44,250
concert.

1631
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:48,270
The only consequence of that is that
it generalizes for other people,

1632
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,810
so not only doesn't work for you
and hopefully for your partner,

1633
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,150
but I don't feel works for
your child and other people.

1634
01:12:54,151 --> 01:12:54,661
So it's like,

1635
01:12:54,661 --> 01:12:55,260
what the hell?

1636
01:12:55,260 --> 01:12:55,980
That's.

1637
01:12:55,980 --> 01:13:00,980
That's a pretty good deal and all you
have to do is have the fortitude to let

1638
01:13:01,231 --> 01:13:05,190
your child know in the gentlest
way possible but effective manner.

1639
01:13:05,250 --> 01:13:05,491
Right?

1640
01:13:05,491 --> 01:13:08,520
Because you've never used more
discipline than necessary.

1641
01:13:08,521 --> 01:13:12,270
It's just counterproductive how to
conduct themselves in the world so that

1642
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:16,430
everyone is happy with their
rep and there's zero down,

1643
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,790
zero downside to that,

1644
01:13:18,420 --> 01:13:23,130
except that you have to go
off the responsibility of
actually taking a stance in

1645
01:13:23,131 --> 01:13:26,690
relationship to your child's behavior
and people are terrified of their

1646
01:13:26,700 --> 01:13:27,533
children.

1647
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:28,710
Now especially,

1648
01:13:28,890 --> 01:13:33,890
and often we'll do that all they're
willing to risk the hammer that they might

1649
01:13:34,141 --> 01:13:35,510
make in the discipline and there's.

1650
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:36,570
It's not helpful.

1651
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,160
So okay.

1652
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:39,623
Real

1653
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:48,563
Center,

1654
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:51,240
Sarah House in perfect order
before you criticize the world.

1655
01:13:51,250 --> 01:13:54,250
That's how that's the
darkest chapter in the book.

1656
01:13:59,160 --> 01:14:04,160
I actually find it engaging to
tackle dark subjects because

1657
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:10,830
I've found that there's something
believable about darkness.

1658
01:14:11,260 --> 01:14:11,470
You know,

1659
01:14:11,470 --> 01:14:14,290
like if someone is telling
you a bunch of good things,

1660
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:14,801
you think,

1661
01:14:14,801 --> 01:14:14,951
well,

1662
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,400
what the hell do they know?

1663
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:19,480
It's reasonable to ask that question,

1664
01:14:19,481 --> 01:14:22,090
but if they tell you about
the really dark things,

1665
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:26,020
then while you already know
those dark things exist,

1666
01:14:26,021 --> 01:14:30,070
so it's believable and then if
they're willing to sort of confront,

1667
01:14:30,071 --> 01:14:31,170
those are things you think,

1668
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,710
well maybe there's something to this,

1669
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,130
and so what are the other chapter six was,

1670
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,860
I've tried for many decades to put myself
in the shoes of people who have done

1671
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:40,540
terrible things partner.

1672
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,310
I've done that when I've read history,

1673
01:14:42,311 --> 01:14:43,990
which is pretty brutal thing to do,

1674
01:14:44,050 --> 01:14:47,380
but also when I read
about criminal behavior,

1675
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:49,360
especially the brutal criminal behavior,

1676
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:50,270
it's not even criminals.

1677
01:14:50,300 --> 01:14:51,370
The wrong way of thinking about.

1678
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,230
Because you know if a
criminal robs a bank,

1679
01:14:53,231 --> 01:14:53,491
I think,

1680
01:14:53,491 --> 01:14:54,700
well they want the money.

1681
01:14:55,140 --> 01:14:55,960
That's sort of human.

1682
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,250
You can relate to that,

1683
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:01,570
but if someone shoots up a high school
or shoots up in elementary school,

1684
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,820
it's like calling credit
just doesn't work out.

1685
01:15:03,821 --> 01:15:08,550
It's because a criminal once your car you
want your car to so you can understand

1686
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:09,220
what a criminal is.

1687
01:15:09,220 --> 01:15:11,260
Just your approach is different,

1688
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,230
but you don't want to
do something like that.

1689
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,870
Young man did when he showed up at
the sandy hook elementary school,

1690
01:15:19,871 --> 01:15:21,130
that's a whole different issue.

1691
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:24,640
The question is why people do
that and the reason for that,

1692
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:28,930
it's outlined very briefly
in rule six succinctly,

1693
01:15:28,931 --> 01:15:33,931
is that while it has to do with the issue
of failure and the and the tragedy of

1694
01:15:34,151 --> 01:15:39,151
life and rule six is also a discussion
of the attitude that you need to develop

1695
01:15:40,870 --> 01:15:42,700
in the face of the tragedy of life.

1696
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:44,470
So people,

1697
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:48,000
people are bound by their
vulnerability and their.

1698
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:51,970
They're bound by their mortality and
they're liable to be trained in her.

1699
01:15:52,060 --> 01:15:54,880
All of those things are
canonical parts of existence.

1700
01:15:54,881 --> 01:15:56,310
Everyone experiences them.

1701
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,240
Sometimes it's self betrayal.

1702
01:15:58,690 --> 01:15:59,470
It doesn't matter.

1703
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:04,300
It's still a reality of malevolence
among people is a reality of the world as

1704
01:16:04,301 --> 01:16:06,430
this tragedy and that,

1705
01:16:06,820 --> 01:16:08,770
and that's true to some degree.

1706
01:16:08,830 --> 01:16:10,900
Even if you conduct yourself properly,

1707
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:11,830
you know,

1708
01:16:11,830 --> 01:16:13,090
and that's the old mystery.

1709
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:13,610
Why couldn't it?

1710
01:16:13,610 --> 01:16:16,780
Things have to get quite a bad
things happen to good people,

1711
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:18,640
which is a deep question.

1712
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:20,110
Everyone asks themselves that question.

1713
01:16:20,111 --> 01:16:21,370
When things go wrong in their life,

1714
01:16:21,371 --> 01:16:25,120
especially when they've been trying
hard to set a trap and it can turn you

1715
01:16:25,121 --> 01:16:25,954
against life,

1716
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:30,220
and the people who do these
terrible crimes so to speak,

1717
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:35,200
are people who be turned against
you by and in a very deep sense,

1718
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,570
in the deepest of all possible census.

1719
01:16:37,570 --> 01:16:38,690
They're turned against tax.

1720
01:16:38,691 --> 01:16:40,030
We in a religious sense,

1721
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:41,020
and I,

1722
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:42,093
I can't,

1723
01:16:42,250 --> 01:16:46,020
I can't take the time to explain precisely
why that's the proper level analysis,

1724
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:46,580
but,

1725
01:16:46,580 --> 01:16:49,380
but to think about it to,

1726
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:50,223
to,

1727
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:52,030
to answer the question,

1728
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:56,560
why would someone shoot a classroom
full of elementary school kids?

1729
01:16:56,800 --> 01:16:59,200
You have people weighing
me down into things.

1730
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:04,000
You have to go as deep as you possibly
can into the mystery of human motivation

1731
01:17:04,001 --> 01:17:06,820
and the catastrophe of life
way down at that level.

1732
01:17:06,821 --> 01:17:10,190
That's essentially the level that
religious language designed to.

1733
01:17:10,610 --> 01:17:14,960
What would you say to communicate
independently of your belief in a,

1734
01:17:15,170 --> 01:17:15,770
in a,

1735
01:17:15,770 --> 01:17:16,220
in a,

1736
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:16,521
in a,

1737
01:17:16,521 --> 01:17:17,041
in a day,

1738
01:17:17,041 --> 01:17:17,810
and I come,

1739
01:17:17,810 --> 01:17:19,540
I'm making a psychological case here.

1740
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,200
The people who committed these terrible
crimes are embittered by lights and they

1741
01:17:24,201 --> 01:17:28,560
believe that just because up there and
bitter but perhaps just compiled was

1742
01:17:28,561 --> 01:17:31,040
determined to at least to some degree
because there's plenty of things to be

1743
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:35,640
bitter about life that it's okay for them
to act as universal judge would be and

1744
01:17:35,641 --> 01:17:40,641
to take her revenge and that's precisely
what they're doing and I attempted to

1745
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,810
justify that because you cannot understand
something until she could justify it

1746
01:17:46,010 --> 01:17:51,010
and then to produce a counter argument
and the counterargument is yeah,

1747
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:57,110
life extraordinarily difficult and
people are subject to trap the tragedy of

1748
01:17:57,111 --> 01:17:59,870
their lives and to be trail
and malevolence all of that.

1749
01:18:00,020 --> 01:18:00,711
And you might ask,

1750
01:18:00,711 --> 01:18:02,450
well why not be bitter?

1751
01:18:02,990 --> 01:18:06,520
And I think the answer to that is related
to things we've already discussed this

1752
01:18:06,521 --> 01:18:07,354
to some degree.

1753
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,280
What makes you think that you've done
everything you possibly could to put

1754
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:15,710
things right enough so that
you're in a position to judge?

1755
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:20,510
This is naturally an optimistic
question and it relates to,

1756
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:21,271
as I said,

1757
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:22,470
the things that we discussed earlier.

1758
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:23,290
There's,

1759
01:18:23,290 --> 01:18:23,660
there's,

1760
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:24,170
there's,

1761
01:18:24,170 --> 01:18:24,980
there's a,

1762
01:18:24,980 --> 01:18:25,960
there's a building,

1763
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:28,460
there's a catastrophe built
into each of our lives.

1764
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,170
The fact that life is suffering.

1765
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:33,410
The question is what's the appropriate
attitude in the face of that,

1766
01:18:33,620 --> 01:18:38,450
and I would say absolutely everything
you possibly can to fit to set things

1767
01:18:38,451 --> 01:18:43,280
right before you dared to stand up as
the judge of everything that exists as a

1768
01:18:43,281 --> 01:18:46,400
temptation that everyone
falls prey to at our thing,

1769
01:18:46,401 --> 01:18:51,401
to be optimistic and that is things can
be a lot better than they are and your

1770
01:18:51,951 --> 01:18:56,750
capacity to make things a lot better than
they are is far less limited than you

1771
01:18:56,751 --> 01:18:59,750
might fake regardless
of your starting point.

1772
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:03,620
You know when people have been
criticizing me because I don't take

1773
01:19:03,980 --> 01:19:08,980
hypothetically the fact of differential
socioeconomic advantage into account,

1774
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,330
it's like,

1775
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:10,480
well,

1776
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,660
I'm not naive.

1777
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:15,280
I know that some people are born with
advantages that other people aren't.

1778
01:19:15,330 --> 01:19:15,471
Oh,

1779
01:19:15,471 --> 01:19:19,700
it's complicated because advantages are
multidimensional and people generally

1780
01:19:19,701 --> 01:19:21,350
pay a price for their gifts,

1781
01:19:21,351 --> 01:19:22,184
let's say,

1782
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:23,540
so it's complicated,

1783
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:28,220
but it doesn't matter in
some sense because regardless
of the conditions of your

1784
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:28,731
existence,

1785
01:19:28,731 --> 01:19:30,500
arbitrary as they are,

1786
01:19:30,540 --> 01:19:33,830
your best foot forward is to try to set
things right as much as you possibly

1787
01:19:33,831 --> 01:19:34,664
can,

1788
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:35,780
and there's a.

1789
01:19:35,780 --> 01:19:36,310
it's,

1790
01:19:36,310 --> 01:19:37,143
it's and it's.

1791
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:39,340
It's a courageous attitudes.

1792
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:39,900
It's,

1793
01:19:39,900 --> 01:19:41,660
it's your willingness in some sense,

1794
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:44,870
to take responsibility for
the conditions of life,

1795
01:19:44,871 --> 01:19:49,580
for the tragedy of life and for the
malevolence of life to take responsibility

1796
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:49,680
for.

1797
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:54,680
That's unbelievably noble task in
some sense because it's really.

1798
01:19:54,950 --> 01:19:59,650
It's really hard to do that just
because you know that you're bound by

1799
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:01,510
malevolence human level.

1800
01:20:01,511 --> 01:20:04,070
It's in the world and you might think,

1801
01:20:04,071 --> 01:20:04,191
well,

1802
01:20:04,191 --> 01:20:05,650
that's just too terrible to bear.

1803
01:20:05,690 --> 01:20:06,021
It's like,

1804
01:20:06,021 --> 01:20:06,201
well,

1805
01:20:06,201 --> 01:20:06,501
yeah,

1806
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:07,260
that's true.

1807
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,093
It is,

1808
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,240
but that's not the point.

1809
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:10,381
The point is,

1810
01:20:10,381 --> 01:20:15,381
your best strategy is to voluntarily
accepted and again to stand up for your

1811
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,680
shoulders back to Excentra vulnerability
that's associated with your big and to

1812
01:20:21,811 --> 01:20:26,190
do everything you possibly can do transit
to accept it and transcendent and to

1813
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:27,100
work with constraint.

1814
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:28,230
And malevolence in the world

1815
01:20:35,940 --> 01:20:37,630
I know

1816
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:40,440
that might not take you to heaven

1817
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:43,700
and perhaps doesn't exist

1818
01:20:45,870 --> 01:20:47,260
and if you don't think hell exists,

1819
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:48,993
then you have,

1820
01:20:49,660 --> 01:20:54,660
what would I say if you haven't paid
enough attention to the people around you

1821
01:20:55,540 --> 01:21:00,420
be you haven't paid enough attention to
the worst parts of your existence and

1822
01:21:00,490 --> 01:21:02,470
see the BBC,

1823
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,520
you have nearly enough history.

1824
01:21:07,240 --> 01:21:08,510
You ready

1825
01:21:15,110 --> 01:21:19,990
on creativity and so
if you can avoid that,

1826
01:21:20,060 --> 01:21:24,670
something could be something
for you because you don't
need that and it would be

1827
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:27,460
something for everyone else
because we don't need that.

1828
01:21:27,610 --> 01:21:30,620
And I think even if we aren't
capable creative Kevin,

1829
01:21:31,450 --> 01:21:33,140
we might be capable avoiding.

1830
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:38,230
And that would be something that would
be something to take away from the 20th

1831
01:21:38,231 --> 01:21:38,861
century now,

1832
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:39,280
wouldn't it?

1833
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,980
Because we generated plenty of hell during
the 20th century if we want it to be.

1834
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:47,770
We could wake up enough now in the
aftermath of all that and fake.

1835
01:21:47,771 --> 01:21:48,071
Okay.

1836
01:21:48,071 --> 01:21:49,600
How about we don't do that again?

1837
01:21:58,390 --> 01:21:59,920
I don't think it's an economic issue.

1838
01:22:00,730 --> 01:22:02,050
I think it's an ethical issue

1839
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:09,080
of reading the causal pathways that
lead to the horrors of Auschwitz.

1840
01:22:09,581 --> 01:22:14,581
Let's say reprehensible horse of a radical
African places like start with this

1841
01:22:16,420 --> 01:22:17,253
union.

1842
01:22:17,380 --> 01:22:22,380
The reason that those situations became
plausible was because of the failings of

1843
01:22:22,631 --> 01:22:24,400
the individuals who made up the society.

1844
01:22:24,910 --> 01:22:26,380
You can't blame it on the leader.

1845
01:22:26,410 --> 01:22:28,240
You can't blame it on economic conditions.

1846
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:29,253
None of that.

1847
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:34,740
It was that people consistently made the
wrong choice at an individual level and

1848
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:39,390
most profound commentators
on those situations.

1849
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:40,171
Viktor Frankl,

1850
01:22:40,171 --> 01:22:40,900
for example,

1851
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:41,890
how your social,

1852
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:45,280
it's all fake.

1853
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:50,470
It was the willingness of the average
citizen to falsify their own experiences

1854
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,010
in the service of ideological
totalitarianism that
turned into two countries

1855
01:22:54,030 --> 01:22:54,730
into help.

1856
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:59,730
It was the lies that people told that
they were telling me so well that would

1857
01:23:00,791 --> 01:23:02,580
lead us to rule eight.

1858
01:23:02,960 --> 01:23:04,330
I'll skip rule seven for now.

1859
01:23:05,710 --> 01:23:06,580
Tell the truth,

1860
01:23:07,790 --> 01:23:11,000
and I think I'll probably
have with this one.

1861
01:23:13,470 --> 01:23:14,303
I'm

1862
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:20,563
too

1863
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:22,593
old.

1864
01:23:25,220 --> 01:23:27,150
You favorite

1865
01:23:30,460 --> 01:23:31,293
story.

1866
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,293
This is

1867
01:23:36,670 --> 01:23:37,930
the greatest story.

1868
01:23:38,500 --> 01:23:39,333
So,

1869
01:23:39,450 --> 01:23:40,283
um,

1870
01:23:40,630 --> 01:23:41,463
I,

1871
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:47,770
I did a series of lectures last
year on genesis friend and they were

1872
01:23:47,771 --> 01:23:52,030
psychological lectures or psychological
analysis of Genesis says I was trying to

1873
01:23:52,031 --> 01:23:55,270
move into the theological domain content.

1874
01:23:55,330 --> 01:23:55,810
I don't,

1875
01:23:55,810 --> 01:23:59,590
it's not that I don't think that that's
a relevant domain and I'm not trying to

1876
01:23:59,591 --> 01:24:01,570
deny the existence or or,

1877
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:03,910
or speak for the existence
of anything metaphysical.

1878
01:24:05,110 --> 01:24:07,740
I'm not trying to do that
to people who do that.

1879
01:24:07,940 --> 01:24:09,940
It's fine and it maybe
it needs to be done,

1880
01:24:09,970 --> 01:24:11,430
but I'm trying to do that.

1881
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:12,990
I'm trying to make sense out of these.

1882
01:24:13,010 --> 01:24:14,140
Stuart's now.

1883
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:18,610
My sense is that our
deep stories are myth,

1884
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:19,810
which,

1885
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:20,621
which are everywhere.

1886
01:24:20,621 --> 01:24:20,990
By the way,

1887
01:24:20,990 --> 01:24:23,440
that not only encapsulated
the biblical stories.

1888
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:24,750
You guys all go to movies,

1889
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,870
you go watch the marvel superheros.

1890
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:29,260
You don't think that's an anthology.

1891
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,270
It's just because we don't
know anything about mythology.

1892
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:32,440
It's like that's what it is.

1893
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:33,320
You know,

1894
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,840
when you watch Harry Potter,

1895
01:24:34,870 --> 01:24:35,770
here's what you watch.

1896
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:37,413
You Watch,

1897
01:24:38,770 --> 01:24:41,410
you watch a diamond resurrected,

1898
01:24:41,450 --> 01:24:43,570
erode defeated fig figure of evil.

1899
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:45,910
That's the Harry Potter story,

1900
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:51,750
so and it makes sense to you and your
kids read it and it generates millions of

1901
01:24:51,880 --> 01:24:51,881
dollars.

1902
01:24:51,881 --> 01:24:52,270
It's like,

1903
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:52,480
well,

1904
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:53,313
why?

1905
01:24:53,660 --> 01:24:53,800
Well,

1906
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,420
it's because it's true.

1907
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:56,800
Now how it's true,

1908
01:24:56,830 --> 01:24:57,730
that's complicated.

1909
01:24:57,731 --> 01:24:59,590
That's a whole different can of worms,

1910
01:24:59,591 --> 01:25:00,424
let's say,

1911
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:01,300
but,

1912
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,313
but it's,

1913
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,790
you see it as well.

1914
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,490
The director resurrecting hero,

1915
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:09,410
redeemed his father and
becomes the genuine individual.

1916
01:25:09,411 --> 01:25:10,990
When you go watch that with your kids,

1917
01:25:11,030 --> 01:25:11,420
you think,

1918
01:25:11,420 --> 01:25:11,610
well,

1919
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:13,300
that's right and you don't care that,

1920
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:13,510
no,

1921
01:25:13,510 --> 01:25:14,343
it's a puppet.

1922
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:18,430
And then he goes and rescues his father
from a whale and then none of that makes

1923
01:25:18,431 --> 01:25:21,670
sense that there's a blue
farian talked to my cricket.

1924
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:22,870
You don't care about any of that.

1925
01:25:22,990 --> 01:25:23,261
It's like,

1926
01:25:23,261 --> 01:25:23,561
oh yeah,

1927
01:25:23,561 --> 01:25:24,480
that's no problem.

1928
01:25:25,520 --> 01:25:26,830
I can see how that would work

1929
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,570
because you have a mythological
imagination and it's,

1930
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:35,630
it's your thought is embedded inside
that mythological imagination in the data

1931
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,810
and that I think are
essentially crystal clear.

1932
01:25:38,140 --> 01:25:38,501
So.

1933
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:38,711
Okay,

1934
01:25:38,711 --> 01:25:39,820
so let me tell you a story.

1935
01:25:40,060 --> 01:25:44,650
So the fundamental mythological
world is something like this,

1936
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:45,810
something like this,

1937
01:25:45,811 --> 01:25:46,370
and you're,

1938
01:25:46,370 --> 01:25:49,030
you're specialized neurologically
to operate in this world,

1939
01:25:49,031 --> 01:25:51,880
and so part of the
world is chaotic domain.

1940
01:25:52,900 --> 01:25:55,180
That's why I call my book
an antidote to chaos.

1941
01:25:55,300 --> 01:25:58,510
The chaotic moon beam is the place that
you are when you don't know what's going

1942
01:25:58,511 --> 01:25:58,751
on,

1943
01:25:58,751 --> 01:26:00,280
but it's a place of potential.

1944
01:26:00,340 --> 01:26:00,920
It's.

1945
01:26:00,920 --> 01:26:01,860
You can think about it.

1946
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:04,013
Let's see.

1947
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:05,870
It's hard to explain this quickly.

1948
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:11,080
Here's the way you're thinking about
this is this is how I think people work.

1949
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:14,040
This is how I think that
you can understand the role
of consciousness in the

1950
01:26:14,041 --> 01:26:14,220
world,

1951
01:26:14,220 --> 01:26:18,890
so I think that we're not
driven in a deterministic way.

1952
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:23,360
The way that materialistic
entities are hypothetically driven.

1953
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:24,260
Okay.

1954
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,000
I think this is what happens in step.

1955
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:29,120
I think that each of us is
a locus of consciousness.

1956
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:32,360
We started the act like we are in the
treat each other like we are and we assume

1957
01:26:32,361 --> 01:26:35,120
that we are so I'm just going to
assume that that's the case and what

1958
01:26:35,121 --> 01:26:40,121
consciousness does not fall prey to
the deterministic machinations up.

1959
01:26:40,850 --> 01:26:42,200
It's materials don't substrate,

1960
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:43,123
but the face,

1961
01:26:43,250 --> 01:26:44,960
the potential of the future,

1962
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:48,260
and to make decisions about which of
those potentials are going to realize

1963
01:26:48,261 --> 01:26:49,094
themselves.

1964
01:26:49,730 --> 01:26:50,391
So when these make.

1965
01:26:50,391 --> 01:26:52,970
When you think about how
you think you are like,

1966
01:26:53,150 --> 01:26:53,361
well,

1967
01:26:53,361 --> 01:26:57,170
the way you think you are is that you
get up in the morning and there's a bunch

1968
01:26:57,171 --> 01:27:01,000
of potential things that are arrayed
themselves in front of you and then you

1969
01:27:01,020 --> 01:27:04,100
decide which of those makes or you're
going to do and which of those things

1970
01:27:04,101 --> 01:27:08,990
you're going to call them into being an
and you assume that other people do that

1971
01:27:08,991 --> 01:27:09,860
and if they don't do that,

1972
01:27:09,861 --> 01:27:12,980
you actually get angry at
because you'd say to your wife,

1973
01:27:12,981 --> 01:27:13,191
say,

1974
01:27:13,191 --> 01:27:13,461
he said,

1975
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:13,611
well,

1976
01:27:13,611 --> 01:27:16,400
you said you were going
to do such and such,

1977
01:27:16,790 --> 01:27:20,760
which means to manifest a certain kind
of potential and bring them up to a

1978
01:27:20,761 --> 01:27:23,810
certain reality and you
get what's wrong with you.

1979
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:24,531
And she'll say,

1980
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:24,801
well,

1981
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:25,460
you know,

1982
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:27,140
maybe she'll tell you a
reason or maybe she'll say,

1983
01:27:27,141 --> 01:27:27,471
well that.

1984
01:27:27,471 --> 01:27:27,831
Sorry,

1985
01:27:27,831 --> 01:27:29,600
because I know that
you were relying on me.

1986
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:31,460
And so you treat people like that.

1987
01:27:31,461 --> 01:27:35,990
So there's a domain of potential that's
chaos and there's a domain of mortar and

1988
01:27:35,991 --> 01:27:39,770
that's what the chaos is transformed
into when you interact with it.

1989
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:41,060
Okay?

1990
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:42,170
So those are the domains.

1991
01:27:42,171 --> 01:27:42,440
Now,

1992
01:27:42,440 --> 01:27:46,940
here's what happens at the beginning of
genesis in our most fundamental creation

1993
01:27:46,941 --> 01:27:47,181
story,

1994
01:27:47,181 --> 01:27:48,830
the most fundamental
gracious towards the West.

1995
01:27:49,100 --> 01:27:50,660
You have these three domains.

1996
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:51,950
You have the potential.

1997
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:56,870
It's the chaos that goes on two fronts
at the beginning of time and whatever God

1998
01:27:56,871 --> 01:28:00,950
is going to think about him as the
spirit of consciousness for the sake of

1999
01:28:00,951 --> 01:28:01,784
argument,

2000
01:28:01,790 --> 01:28:06,790
he uses logos to interact with potential
and to create a habit in order for.

2001
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:08,950
That's Jeff.

2002
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,160
That's the first part of Genesis,

2003
01:28:10,161 --> 01:28:15,161
and so what happens is God speaks and
potential rearranges itself into order and

2004
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:17,031
then go and says,

2005
01:28:17,031 --> 01:28:17,181
well,

2006
01:28:17,181 --> 01:28:18,014
that order is good.

2007
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:18,711
Okay,

2008
01:28:18,711 --> 01:28:20,990
so there's an ethical
proposition there too.

2009
01:28:21,050 --> 01:28:22,280
It's a very deep proposition,

2010
01:28:22,281 --> 01:28:23,030
and here's,

2011
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:24,140
here's something to think about.

2012
01:28:25,370 --> 01:28:29,660
The proposition is that if you
confront protection with the truth,

2013
01:28:29,661 --> 01:28:31,610
that the order you generate is good.

2014
01:28:32,180 --> 01:28:33,490
It's a proposition.

2015
01:28:33,950 --> 01:28:34,281
You think,

2016
01:28:34,281 --> 01:28:34,400
well,

2017
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:35,810
he's being good.

2018
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:38,860
While it's a hard question because it's
full of tragedy and malevolence like,

2019
01:28:38,861 --> 01:28:39,770
is it good?

2020
01:28:40,650 --> 01:28:42,230
If that's a hard question,

2021
01:28:42,410 --> 01:28:42,591
well,

2022
01:28:42,591 --> 01:28:44,900
without the malevolence
it might be a lot better.

2023
01:28:44,901 --> 01:28:48,290
So that's something and fair bit of
that is generated as a consequence of

2024
01:28:48,620 --> 01:28:49,580
deceit,

2025
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:52,160
as a consequence of
deviation from the truth.

2026
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,180
So you might ask yourself,

2027
01:28:53,181 --> 01:28:53,720
well,

2028
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:58,720
how would things be if people did
nothing but tell the truth and that

2029
01:28:58,851 --> 01:29:00,170
proposition is inhibited.

2030
01:29:00,220 --> 01:29:02,340
Genesis is thing that it would be good.

2031
01:29:02,610 --> 01:29:03,443
And that's,

2032
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:07,530
that's reasonable
hypothesis because you know,

2033
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:09,180
when I've worked with my clients,

2034
01:29:09,181 --> 01:29:09,781
for example,

2035
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:10,830
for all of these steps,

2036
01:29:11,590 --> 01:29:16,380
what I see is it the people that were
hurt the worst aren't hurt because

2037
01:29:16,381 --> 01:29:17,610
something terrible happened to them.

2038
01:29:18,030 --> 01:29:18,960
It's not cancer,

2039
01:29:19,020 --> 01:29:19,860
it's not an earthquake,

2040
01:29:21,620 --> 01:29:22,453
it's not an academic,

2041
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,710
it's that somebody to them with attending.

2042
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:30,180
And if you look at the literature
on posttraumatic stress disorder,

2043
01:29:30,720 --> 01:29:33,510
it's quite clear that
what really breaks people,

2044
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,250
his betrayal and deceit on the
partner of someone they trust.

2045
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,760
And that might be to the south,

2046
01:29:38,780 --> 01:29:39,010
you know,

2047
01:29:39,010 --> 01:29:39,740
you can do that too.

2048
01:29:39,740 --> 01:29:41,280
So that's no problem that happens.

2049
01:29:42,210 --> 01:29:45,120
So it's not a tragedy into
the World Pacific catastrophe,

2050
01:29:45,121 --> 01:29:46,440
even though it is a catastrophe,

2051
01:29:46,441 --> 01:29:49,200
it's the level of the
world that's a catastrophe.

2052
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:50,540
And that's probably see.

2053
01:29:51,120 --> 01:29:56,120
And so the second part of Genesis has
another hypothesis embedded in it,

2054
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:59,840
and now that man and woman are
made in the but you've gone.

2055
01:30:00,150 --> 01:30:00,751
The question is,

2056
01:30:00,751 --> 01:30:00,871
well,

2057
01:30:00,871 --> 01:30:03,780
what does that mean as
far as I can tell them?

2058
01:30:03,781 --> 01:30:08,781
What it means is if on
the largest possible scale
what's happening to generate

2059
01:30:11,191 --> 01:30:15,810
the world is the Kale and consciousness
is interacting with potential to

2060
01:30:15,811 --> 01:30:17,130
generate order.

2061
01:30:17,910 --> 01:30:22,620
Then that's reflected in the
house at a smaller level.

2062
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:25,430
So each of us are also
doing that on a scale,

2063
01:30:26,550 --> 01:30:27,090
you know,

2064
01:30:27,090 --> 01:30:29,950
individual in humans and that

2065
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:37,020
requires your society to assume
that you have intrinsic value.

2066
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,660
And that's at the basis
of our legal system.

2067
01:30:39,661 --> 01:30:40,371
It really is.

2068
01:30:40,371 --> 01:30:40,610
You know,

2069
01:30:40,610 --> 01:30:43,080
the idea that what we're
all equal before the law,

2070
01:30:43,090 --> 01:30:45,870
whatever the hell that means you
have intrinsic rights unnecessarily.

2071
01:30:46,050 --> 01:30:49,920
Responsibilities is predicated on the
idea that there's something a little bit

2072
01:30:49,921 --> 01:30:50,910
so valuable,

2073
01:30:50,940 --> 01:30:54,240
but even the state has to
keep his distance from you.

2074
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,640
And the reason for that is
because it was so special.

2075
01:30:56,700 --> 01:30:58,410
Even though that isn't part of the reason,

2076
01:30:58,440 --> 01:31:03,180
the reason he hasn't found its interferes
too much with the individual than the

2077
01:31:03,181 --> 01:31:07,860
state itself collapses and that's true
because the individual is the forest that

2078
01:31:07,861 --> 01:31:12,150
renews to stay and so the stage is stay
the hell away from them individually

2079
01:31:12,550 --> 01:31:15,050
doesn't.

2080
01:31:25,820 --> 01:31:29,550
Let's say it was free speech isn't
because I'm a defender of free speed.

2081
01:31:29,610 --> 01:31:34,610
It's because I know you haven't divine
obligation to speak your truth in the

2082
01:31:36,781 --> 01:31:37,650
world,

2083
01:31:37,830 --> 01:31:42,830
so that transforms itself into the order
that isn't good and then no one has the

2084
01:31:43,861 --> 01:31:46,380
right to interfere with that period,

2085
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:47,633
no matter

2086
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:58,190
Humboldt chapter as well.

2087
01:31:58,191 --> 01:31:59,950
In the spirit of improvement,

2088
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:00,671
I could say,

2089
01:32:00,671 --> 01:32:00,881
well,

2090
01:32:00,881 --> 01:32:03,400
don't I can say tell the truth.

2091
01:32:03,670 --> 01:32:04,060
It's like,

2092
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:04,211
well,

2093
01:32:04,211 --> 01:32:04,500
yeah,

2094
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:05,560
what the hell you know,

2095
01:32:05,561 --> 01:32:06,361
and what do I know?

2096
01:32:06,361 --> 01:32:10,270
It looks like we're all making urine to
a degree that's almost indeterminable.

2097
01:32:10,271 --> 01:32:12,070
And so what do you know
about telling the truth?

2098
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:12,521
Well,

2099
01:32:12,521 --> 01:32:13,120
no,

2100
01:32:13,120 --> 01:32:14,680
because you don't know
enough to tell the truth,

2101
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:15,340
but,

2102
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:18,520
but maybe you could
stumble towards the truth.

2103
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:21,970
And so that's the message of
Chapter Eight will tell the truth,

2104
01:32:21,971 --> 01:32:24,340
or at least don't lie,

2105
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:25,960
because I could say,

2106
01:32:26,010 --> 01:32:26,501
and I look,

2107
01:32:26,501 --> 01:32:27,250
I think,

2108
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:30,640
I don't believe that there's
a person in this room

2109
01:32:30,910 --> 01:32:31,743
who

2110
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:34,043
wouldn't

2111
01:32:35,260 --> 01:32:38,470
feel in their heart the
truth of this proposition.

2112
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:45,610
There are things that you say sometimes
that you know to be true and you can

2113
01:32:45,611 --> 01:32:46,444
feel that.

2114
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:48,190
I mean sometimes you don't know.

2115
01:32:48,191 --> 01:32:49,570
You just don't know what the
hell you're talking about.

2116
01:32:49,600 --> 01:32:51,490
You can't tell if it's
true or false or whatever.

2117
01:32:51,491 --> 01:32:55,060
You just here to Hampton or
chaotic or ignorant or whatever.

2118
01:32:55,061 --> 01:32:55,841
You just can't tell.

2119
01:32:55,841 --> 01:32:59,430
I'm not talking about the times when
you might be an error and don't go it.

2120
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,230
I'm talking about the times when you
actually say something that you know to be

2121
01:33:02,231 --> 01:33:04,360
false and you say it.

2122
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:05,410
Then the question is,

2123
01:33:05,410 --> 01:33:06,580
why do you say it?

2124
01:33:07,090 --> 01:33:07,923
Well,

2125
01:33:08,110 --> 01:33:11,310
part of it is you want to get
your way and achieved map.

2126
01:33:11,380 --> 01:33:15,070
You don't want to do the work that's
necessary to get what you need in the way

2127
01:33:15,071 --> 01:33:15,681
that you shouldn't get.

2128
01:33:15,681 --> 01:33:16,810
If you want to take the shortcut.

2129
01:33:17,380 --> 01:33:17,830
Okay,

2130
01:33:17,830 --> 01:33:21,630
well that's not very bright
because there's no shortcuts
in reality and there's

2131
01:33:21,640 --> 01:33:22,510
a real,

2132
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:26,410
a really remarkable spirit underlying
that which is an arrogant spirit which

2133
01:33:26,411 --> 01:33:31,411
believes that somehow you
have the capacity to bend
the structure of reality to

2134
01:33:31,691 --> 01:33:36,100
favor you in a false manner and
that that will actually work.

2135
01:33:36,700 --> 01:33:37,990
It's like that won't work.

2136
01:33:38,110 --> 01:33:38,921
It's not gonna work.

2137
01:33:38,921 --> 01:33:39,790
You can't do that.

2138
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:40,690
It isn't gonna happen.

2139
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:41,980
So but the.

2140
01:33:41,980 --> 01:33:45,880
But there's an arrogance underlying that
misuse of language that's predicated on

2141
01:33:45,881 --> 01:33:47,890
the proposition that you
actually have that power.

2142
01:33:48,140 --> 01:33:49,310
I think that through.

2143
01:33:49,420 --> 01:33:50,230
It's so.

2144
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:51,700
It's so unlikely is it?

2145
01:33:51,701 --> 01:33:53,250
That would be the case that I,

2146
01:33:53,500 --> 01:33:57,030
that anybody clearheaded who actually
thought that through and sees believing a

2147
01:33:57,031 --> 01:33:57,864
fairly rapidly,

2148
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,233
so

2149
01:34:02,920 --> 01:34:03,753
true,

2150
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,420
and you know what's wrong too.

2151
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:09,280
And so what chapter eight is,

2152
01:34:09,281 --> 01:34:12,580
it's another question along the
lines of incremental improvement.

2153
01:34:14,050 --> 01:34:17,470
Try not to say things
that you know to be true.

2154
01:34:17,770 --> 01:34:21,760
The lie stopped going and see what happens

2155
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:27,220
and then you're stumbling towards
the truth and if it is the case,

2156
01:34:27,760 --> 01:34:30,160
as our deepest stories indicate that,

2157
01:34:30,161 --> 01:34:30,730
that,

2158
01:34:30,730 --> 01:34:31,420
that the,

2159
01:34:31,420 --> 01:34:33,600
that the order that is good to end,

2160
01:34:33,610 --> 01:34:36,550
habitable is established by truth.

2161
01:34:37,120 --> 01:34:40,810
Then if you start whining and order that
you bring into being from the potential

2162
01:34:40,840 --> 01:34:43,810
that you can front will be
the best possible order.

2163
01:34:44,170 --> 01:34:44,441
It's a,

2164
01:34:44,441 --> 01:34:45,010
it's a.

2165
01:34:45,010 --> 01:34:45,970
it's an element of faith.

2166
01:34:45,971 --> 01:34:47,610
It's the most profound faith.

2167
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:49,790
The idea would be at risk.

2168
01:34:49,810 --> 01:34:52,910
You have to take an existential risk
because there's no proving it beforehand.

2169
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:56,950
You have to act out the proposition that
the world that you bring into being as

2170
01:34:56,951 --> 01:35:01,310
a of align yourself with truth is the
best of all possible worlds would say

2171
01:35:01,311 --> 01:35:04,490
we'll make the experiment to find
out because I think you already know.

2172
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:05,720
I think everyone knows this,

2173
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:10,960
that the world you bring into being as a
consequence of deceit is definitely not

2174
01:35:11,031 --> 01:35:14,350
the world that you wanted would have
and certainly not world you want.

2175
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:17,900
If everyone is doing that because
the world you would have been,

2176
01:35:17,901 --> 01:35:19,970
if everyone is doing that is hell,

2177
01:35:20,630 --> 01:35:23,410
and if you do hit with hail,

2178
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:25,490
let's say thinking about East Germany,

2179
01:35:26,870 --> 01:35:27,290
right?

2180
01:35:27,290 --> 01:35:30,250
So here's the situation in East
Germany before the wall fell down,

2181
01:35:30,830 --> 01:35:32,330
if you live in east Germany,

2182
01:35:32,970 --> 01:35:37,540
onenote was three people was acting
as a government informer to regroup.

2183
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,940
So what that means is if you
had a family of six people,

2184
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:46,870
two people in your family were
willing to do the government.

2185
01:35:47,990 --> 01:35:50,270
They were actively
engaged in that process.

2186
01:35:51,380 --> 01:35:54,470
And if you don't think that that's
healthy and you don't know anything about

2187
01:35:54,471 --> 01:35:58,910
East Germany because that was magnified,

2188
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:01,100
say across the entire Soviet Union,

2189
01:36:01,130 --> 01:36:03,430
it was a 25,

2190
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:05,780
30 million people by deadly.

2191
01:36:06,380 --> 01:36:11,090
They were dance school fraction of the
people who were brutalized and destroyed

2192
01:36:11,091 --> 01:36:11,924
by that system.

2193
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:19,450
So it's actually this chapter because I
think that's so interesting is that if

2194
01:36:20,751 --> 01:36:22,400
you look hard enough at the darkness,

2195
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:23,420
you start to see the light.

2196
01:36:24,200 --> 01:36:25,910
Because if you look hard
enough at the darkness,

2197
01:36:25,911 --> 01:36:28,500
you start to see what the
opposite of the darkness.

2198
01:36:29,710 --> 01:36:31,550
And then it's easier to see the darkness.

2199
01:36:31,551 --> 01:36:33,710
In some sense it's even
easier to believe in it.

2200
01:36:33,740 --> 01:36:35,540
But if you see it clearly
enough and you're thinking,

2201
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:35,701
well,

2202
01:36:35,701 --> 01:36:40,660
whatever the light is is it's as
far away from that as you can get.

2203
01:36:41,090 --> 01:36:45,140
And when you see the Great Totalitarian
Society from the Twentieth Century were

2204
01:36:45,141 --> 01:36:47,780
fundamentally predicated upon the lie.

2205
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,130
Then after go to that
support and clear stop line,

2206
01:36:52,550 --> 01:36:53,610
someone should mention Sandra,

2207
01:36:54,020 --> 01:36:58,720
one starts lying can bring down
a tyranny and you're thinking,

2208
01:36:58,820 --> 01:36:58,950
well,

2209
01:36:58,950 --> 01:37:00,320
that can't possibly be true.

2210
01:37:00,350 --> 01:37:03,950
It's like I wouldn't
be so sure about that.

2211
01:37:04,660 --> 01:37:05,450
Like the truth,

2212
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:06,760
if the truth is a lie,

2213
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:08,720
reality itself,

2214
01:37:09,670 --> 01:37:12,340
and what makes you think it's stackable.

2215
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:16,640
It's not like reality is if you align
yourself with the truth that you ever

2216
01:37:16,641 --> 01:37:17,870
reality behind,

2217
01:37:17,871 --> 01:37:18,740
you know,

2218
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:19,970
if you're having trouble

2219
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:24,410
in your corner as probably a good idea

2220
01:37:35,670 --> 01:37:39,360
of the things that you're just in
an articulate manner in the west,

2221
01:37:40,830 --> 01:37:44,600
unabashed admirer of Western civilization,

2222
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:45,523
despite

2223
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:59,370
harbor pop are rapidly bringing to
everywhere in the world and saying,

2224
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:00,601
going for that.

2225
01:38:00,601 --> 01:38:02,910
And I say 10 minutes for that is clear.

2226
01:38:03,090 --> 01:38:05,930
Now that doesn't mean we don't have our
problems and now doesn't mean we should

2227
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:10,890
know about it because it's not like
we all generated western civilization.

2228
01:38:11,360 --> 01:38:13,420
It was there before it goes to the board,

2229
01:38:13,850 --> 01:38:15,070
so there's a lot of,

2230
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:16,853
well,

2231
01:38:16,890 --> 01:38:18,570
what do I see as possibilities?

2232
01:38:18,660 --> 01:38:22,740
I see unfolding in front of us
a world that rapidly improving,

2233
01:38:23,920 --> 01:38:24,753
we're,

2234
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,490
we're becoming rapidly,

2235
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:29,030
insanely technologically powerful,

2236
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:34,210
and it's a place of
unbelievable possibility and
potential catastrophe and I

2237
01:38:35,191 --> 01:38:38,960
think what we want to ride this
through property and how do we do it,

2238
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:39,700
what we don't know,

2239
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:43,590
because there's going to be a lot of
unknowns that come along with it and so

2240
01:38:43,650 --> 01:38:44,700
what are we gonna do about that?

2241
01:38:44,701 --> 01:38:48,120
Since we don't know what to
do about what's unreal with
and that's what that is.

2242
01:38:48,240 --> 01:38:51,630
We want to build ourselves as individuals
and to people who are capable of

2243
01:38:51,631 --> 01:38:53,910
dealing with the unknown
as it manifests itself,

2244
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:59,710
and that's for life is about the book
I wrote before which is coming out in

2245
01:39:00,061 --> 01:39:01,330
audio version on the twelfth.

2246
01:39:02,080 --> 01:39:02,913
It's

2247
01:39:07,420 --> 01:39:08,420
totalitarianism,

2248
01:39:09,730 --> 01:39:11,200
malevolence of evil in the world.

2249
01:39:11,201 --> 01:39:14,530
And my conclusion was
get your act together.

2250
01:39:15,400 --> 01:39:16,140
Fundamentally,

2251
01:39:16,140 --> 01:39:19,320
it's like there's way more to you
than you think for good or evil,

2252
01:39:19,450 --> 01:39:23,430
way more had you ever forced to be
contended with and in some real sense of

2253
01:39:23,431 --> 01:39:28,270
you're at the center of the world and
that the dance the world on your shoulders

2254
01:39:28,570 --> 01:39:32,800
and it's determined by the choices that
you make and that's true for all of us

2255
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:36,310
and that's why we have intrinsic value
and that's where the legal system

2256
01:39:36,700 --> 01:39:41,560
recognizes that and I believe it's as
true as if anything can be true and I do

2257
01:39:41,561 --> 01:39:44,530
think it would be a good idea if
we could consciously realize that.

2258
01:39:44,531 --> 01:39:47,890
I think we're at a point where we
could normally have these stories,

2259
01:39:48,070 --> 01:39:52,600
but we can understand what it would mean
in transformation in consciousness in

2260
01:39:52,601 --> 01:39:53,350
some sense,

2261
01:39:53,350 --> 01:39:57,730
and it kind of maturation that in some
sense it hasn't been possible before now

2262
01:39:58,210 --> 01:40:02,610
and so my hope for the best thing that
you could possibly hope for it because

2263
01:40:02,611 --> 01:40:03,444
why the hell no,

2264
01:40:03,710 --> 01:40:06,390
and so that's the most thing that
I could possibly hope for it.

2265
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:08,370
I think that we're capable of doing it.

2266
01:40:08,371 --> 01:40:13,371
I truly do believe that and so
that's all I have to say about that.

2267
01:40:54,830 --> 01:40:57,730
That's all I to say about

2268
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,700
talk literally for the first hour and a
half and when he said I'm going to end

2269
01:41:03,701 --> 01:41:04,990
with this and the entire room,

2270
01:41:08,560 --> 01:41:10,420
I didn't really think about
what's going on in your guys.

2271
01:41:10,421 --> 01:41:15,190
Thinking about what you just heard here
for the last two hours to thinking about

2272
01:41:15,191 --> 01:41:15,701
what you heard,

2273
01:41:15,701 --> 01:41:19,030
if anything about what was
on CNN for the last two hours

2274
01:41:23,200 --> 01:41:24,950
talking about porn star.

2275
01:41:24,970 --> 01:41:25,803
Okay.

2276
01:41:26,620 --> 01:41:27,820
The point is we're waiting.

2277
01:41:27,880 --> 01:41:29,020
We're finally waiting.

2278
01:41:29,021 --> 01:41:29,351
Guys.

2279
01:41:29,351 --> 01:41:30,450
I hope you could feel it

2280
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:36,740
happening.

2281
01:41:36,740 --> 01:41:40,510
All Jordan usually just takes a
moment to just create that as neck.

2282
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:41,980
I think he's probably ready.

2283
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:43,870
We took questions on slido.

2284
01:41:43,871 --> 01:41:45,730
You guys send us the questions ready?

2285
01:41:45,790 --> 01:41:47,650
We do this totally uncensored,

2286
01:41:47,710 --> 01:41:49,270
so give him around her claws.

2287
01:41:49,300 --> 01:41:50,133
Jordan.

2288
01:41:59,420 --> 01:42:00,253
Today.

2289
01:42:02,010 --> 01:42:03,980
We've been doing it the other way and

2290
01:42:05,850 --> 01:42:06,720
see what happened.

2291
01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:16,150
You didn't go into beyond the
root risks is side of the state.

2292
01:42:18,280 --> 01:42:19,760
We got a ton of great stuff here.

2293
01:42:19,761 --> 01:42:20,020
Again,

2294
01:42:20,020 --> 01:42:21,270
this is completely uncensored.

2295
01:42:21,280 --> 01:42:23,410
People are all asking
about you guys tonight.

2296
01:42:23,500 --> 01:42:26,500
I will start with clearly what
seems to be the most important one.

2297
01:42:26,680 --> 01:42:29,490
When will you be doing a
new web with Kanye West?

2298
01:42:33,810 --> 01:42:35,820
I don't think you want to hear her.

2299
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:36,753
Say,

2300
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:39,620
look,

2301
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:42,010
anyone who's ever heard me say finger,

2302
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,130
I think I kind of wanted to have.

2303
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:55,870
What do you think about understanding
thrown in bonus one for me here.

2304
01:42:55,871 --> 01:42:57,170
What do you think about this feeling?

2305
01:42:57,490 --> 01:42:58,211
Feeling in the room,

2306
01:42:58,211 --> 01:42:58,871
like the truth,

2307
01:42:58,871 --> 01:43:01,180
the joy that's in this
room right here about this.

2308
01:43:01,181 --> 01:43:01,790
What do you.

2309
01:43:01,790 --> 01:43:03,170
What do you love about

2310
01:43:12,840 --> 01:43:14,160
this whole intellectual start?

2311
01:43:14,180 --> 01:43:19,180
Web intake is completely surreal moment
and there's this group of people who

2312
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:25,420
have risen to a kind of strange,

2313
01:43:26,290 --> 01:43:31,290
somewhat countercultural position of
prominence and there isn't anything about

2314
01:43:32,920 --> 01:43:35,740
the same except they're all,

2315
01:43:36,740 --> 01:43:36,960
you know.

2316
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:38,330
That's about as part of the job.

2317
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:45,750
Thinking about what might unite them
to the degree that that's a reasonable

2318
01:43:45,911 --> 01:43:50,620
proposition and I think what it is is
that they actually have respect for their

2319
01:43:50,621 --> 01:43:52,520
audience and

2320
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:58,650
my sense is people.

2321
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:02,050
I never lecture down.

2322
01:44:02,810 --> 01:44:04,370
I'm not trying to make things simpler.

2323
01:44:04,371 --> 01:44:05,250
I'm trying to make them as,

2324
01:44:05,900 --> 01:44:08,620
I'm trying to communicate them
as clearly as I possibly count,

2325
01:44:08,870 --> 01:44:12,950
but I'm making the assumption
that everyone is on board
and we're going in the

2326
01:44:12,951 --> 01:44:13,820
same direction,

2327
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:14,913
you know,

2328
01:44:15,030 --> 01:44:18,290
and I think that that's a characteristic
and everyone in that group,

2329
01:44:18,650 --> 01:44:19,483
like if you look out,

2330
01:44:20,030 --> 01:44:20,180
oh,

2331
01:44:20,180 --> 01:44:20,781
Shapiro's,

2332
01:44:20,781 --> 01:44:21,530
like that.

2333
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:24,900
These are people in very
different political perspectives
like Ben Shapiro and

2334
01:44:25,070 --> 01:44:26,180
one on for example.

2335
01:44:26,181 --> 01:44:26,900
It's like they're,

2336
01:44:26,900 --> 01:44:30,410
they're pretty much on Daniel
for political distribution,

2337
01:44:30,680 --> 01:44:31,440
but they,

2338
01:44:31,440 --> 01:44:35,690
they both assumed that the people that
are talking to have enough sense to know

2339
01:44:35,691 --> 01:44:39,980
just that the people that are talking
to are intelligent and awkward.

2340
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,030
And so when I come in and
talk to a group like this,

2341
01:44:44,031 --> 01:44:46,210
I think are,

2342
01:44:49,100 --> 01:44:49,933
I'm

2343
01:44:51,290 --> 01:44:54,590
assuming that the best way mean
is talking to the best in you.

2344
01:44:55,100 --> 01:44:56,120
And that would be great.

2345
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:02,000
Thank you.

2346
01:45:04,070 --> 01:45:04,903
I like this one.

2347
01:45:04,940 --> 01:45:07,250
If you were to write a work of fiction,

2348
01:45:07,400 --> 01:45:08,480
what would it be about?

2349
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:10,551
Oh,

2350
01:45:10,551 --> 01:45:12,010
I started reading fiction.

2351
01:45:13,120 --> 01:45:13,761
It doesn't work,

2352
01:45:13,761 --> 01:45:14,810
you'd expect.

2353
01:45:15,070 --> 01:45:19,110
And so really the brutal
satirical murder registering

2354
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:22,250
as funny.

2355
01:45:22,251 --> 01:45:23,670
It's pretty dark

2356
01:45:25,370 --> 01:45:26,600
for shocking.

2357
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:27,633
Um,

2358
01:45:28,550 --> 01:45:29,750
I only wrote about,

2359
01:45:29,780 --> 01:45:33,710
I wrote about 25 pages of it
and are already having fun with,

2360
01:45:34,030 --> 01:45:37,730
it was kind of a satirical new,

2361
01:45:37,980 --> 01:45:39,950
our effective novel.

2362
01:45:39,951 --> 01:45:43,490
And then I ran into my
inlaws at Christmas one year.

2363
01:45:46,030 --> 01:45:47,740
I kind of forget what I'm like,

2364
01:45:47,750 --> 01:45:48,050
you know,

2365
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:49,090
because I've used it to me,

2366
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:57,140
I read it to my father in law and my
brother in law and my brother loves pretty

2367
01:45:57,141 --> 01:46:00,940
straight guy and the conservative guy
and in this sort of western Alberta,

2368
01:46:00,950 --> 01:46:02,330
Texas type tradition,

2369
01:46:02,331 --> 01:46:03,164
and Ooh,

2370
01:46:03,950 --> 01:46:07,460
it's a brutally satirical piece.

2371
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:08,750
And I read it in like,

2372
01:46:09,170 --> 01:46:11,610
all that happened was that
there was a lot of silence.

2373
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:13,340
Well,

2374
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:15,800
so I think that's what happened.

2375
01:46:15,860 --> 01:46:17,060
If I wrote a piece of fiction,

2376
01:46:17,061 --> 01:46:18,490
I think that that's
what's already happened.

2377
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:21,170
So I don't know if it's a good idea,

2378
01:46:21,171 --> 01:46:21,951
but you never know.

2379
01:46:21,951 --> 01:46:23,110
I might finish it sometime.

2380
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:24,343
I did enjoy

2381
01:46:28,770 --> 01:46:32,300
this theme has been sort of an ongoing
one that had all the shows that you

2382
01:46:32,310 --> 01:46:37,310
foresee a way for the Cultural Marxists
and the length is to be defeated in our

2383
01:46:37,461 --> 01:46:40,040
culture without violence.

2384
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:41,661
Well,

2385
01:46:41,661 --> 01:46:43,520
hopefully not precisely defeated.

2386
01:46:43,521 --> 01:46:45,170
I don't think it's the right terminology.

2387
01:46:45,860 --> 01:46:47,050
I think that the,

2388
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:50,040
I think the person who
tells the best story wins.

2389
01:46:51,150 --> 01:46:52,560
So that's the way forward is.

2390
01:46:55,690 --> 01:46:57,360
When I

2391
01:46:58,860 --> 01:47:01,110
went on Bill Maher while back,

2392
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:04,020
it was interesting because,

2393
01:47:04,700 --> 01:47:06,550
well I had a conversation with,

2394
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:07,080
with,

2395
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:07,601
with Mara,

2396
01:47:07,601 --> 01:47:11,190
but my book and that went pretty well
because he's kind of a free speech guy

2397
01:47:11,191 --> 01:47:12,200
because he's a comedian,

2398
01:47:12,240 --> 01:47:14,030
although he's pretty left as it is,

2399
01:47:14,070 --> 01:47:15,330
views and you know,

2400
01:47:15,331 --> 01:47:19,030
there's a bit of a tension there that
he hasn't fully come to terms with.

2401
01:47:19,150 --> 01:47:22,470
Most people are full of contradict
what people are full of contradictions,

2402
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:27,060
but then at the end of the show they
have this extra period that's only put on

2403
01:47:27,061 --> 01:47:30,410
Youtube and I was listening
to the panel as you know,

2404
01:47:30,660 --> 01:47:33,450
thrash away trump and it's
like that's amongst gay,

2405
01:47:33,451 --> 01:47:33,721
you know,

2406
01:47:33,721 --> 01:47:35,070
like anybody can do that.

2407
01:47:35,400 --> 01:47:38,550
And so it's just not that
interesting to listen to.

2408
01:47:38,640 --> 01:47:42,280
It's not interesting to
listen to celebrities actually
have trump because there

2409
01:47:42,281 --> 01:47:44,910
are no more interesting than hearing
anyone else do that as far as I'm

2410
01:47:44,911 --> 01:47:45,744
concerned.

2411
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:48,420
So it's like shooting fish in a barrel.

2412
01:47:49,860 --> 01:47:52,460
Obviously he has some flaws,

2413
01:47:52,470 --> 01:47:53,303
right?

2414
01:47:54,400 --> 01:47:55,410
Pointing them out.

2415
01:47:55,650 --> 01:47:57,150
It's not an act of brilliance.

2416
01:47:57,440 --> 01:47:58,273
Seriously.

2417
01:48:02,160 --> 01:48:05,850
Definitely doesn't mean you shouldn't
criticize your political leaders because

2418
01:48:05,851 --> 01:48:06,571
of course you should,

2419
01:48:06,571 --> 01:48:07,660
but what are.

2420
01:48:08,520 --> 01:48:13,520
There was a vitriolic undertone to the
commentary that went beyond trump and I

2421
01:48:13,981 --> 01:48:14,750
kept thinking,

2422
01:48:14,750 --> 01:48:14,940
well,

2423
01:48:14,940 --> 01:48:15,721
I'm Canadian,

2424
01:48:15,721 --> 01:48:19,110
so I was kind of looking at
this very sympathetic to the US.

2425
01:48:19,111 --> 01:48:21,270
I've lived here for seven years
and I really liked the US.

2426
01:48:21,330 --> 01:48:22,680
I think it's an amazing place.

2427
01:48:23,550 --> 01:48:24,383
So remarkable.

2428
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:25,430
I

2429
01:48:29,480 --> 01:48:29,971
was thinking,

2430
01:48:29,971 --> 01:48:30,804
well,

2431
01:48:31,170 --> 01:48:36,170
these idiot trump supporters that you
guys are on about like that's 50 percent

2432
01:48:36,271 --> 01:48:37,350
of your nation.

2433
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:40,890
It's probably people in your own family.

2434
01:48:40,891 --> 01:48:42,480
It certainly people that you work with,

2435
01:48:42,660 --> 01:48:44,220
they're actually not all stupid.

2436
01:48:44,230 --> 01:48:48,420
The hardest that is to believe because
50 percent of the people aren't stupid.

2437
01:48:48,540 --> 01:48:49,230
Besides that,

2438
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:50,490
for the last four elections,

2439
01:48:50,491 --> 01:48:53,460
50 percent of Americans
and voted Republican,

2440
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:58,080
but you guys are split exactly down the
middle and so what are you going to do?

2441
01:48:58,120 --> 01:48:59,490
Defeat half your country?

2442
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:00,780
Like what?

2443
01:49:00,780 --> 01:49:03,390
What the hell good is that you
have to live with these people.

2444
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:05,520
They're quite a lot like you.

2445
01:49:05,521 --> 01:49:06,310
In fact,

2446
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:09,360
they might be even beat
you for that matter,

2447
01:49:09,990 --> 01:49:12,750
so then I think while it's
with the radical left this too,

2448
01:49:12,751 --> 01:49:17,751
it's like it would be better to have them
drop what they're doing and integrate

2449
01:49:18,051 --> 01:49:20,070
themselves back into it,

2450
01:49:20,120 --> 01:49:25,120
do the reasonable world and be guided in
that process and I think the right way

2451
01:49:25,441 --> 01:49:27,570
to do that is to tell a
more compelling story.

2452
01:49:27,630 --> 01:49:31,770
It's like forget about all that
resentment and bitterness and oppression,

2453
01:49:31,771 --> 01:49:34,870
narrative and identity politics
and racial divide and all of that,

2454
01:49:34,871 --> 01:49:35,704
and it's like,

2455
01:49:35,790 --> 01:49:36,600
yeah,

2456
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:37,740
it's understandable.

2457
01:49:37,770 --> 01:49:39,660
There are people in the world.

2458
01:49:39,720 --> 01:49:41,160
We do have group identities.

2459
01:49:41,161 --> 01:49:43,170
Everything is divided up equally,

2460
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:44,333
but that's.

2461
01:49:45,480 --> 01:49:46,313
That's just

2462
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:48,733
no

2463
01:49:52,830 --> 01:49:55,990
from an identity politics
perspective was so god damn dog.

2464
01:49:55,991 --> 01:49:57,230
I can hardly stand it.

2465
01:50:01,660 --> 01:50:02,940
I'm hoping it's a better story.

2466
01:50:02,960 --> 01:50:04,960
The story of the individual
is a better story.

2467
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:18,280
When were you running for
prime minister of Canada

2468
01:50:27,710 --> 01:50:28,543
pipeline

2469
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:41,453
because.

2470
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:46,000
Because I don't think it's unreasonable
to assume that you have a political

2471
01:50:46,001 --> 01:50:48,250
career in Canada if I chose to do that,

2472
01:50:48,730 --> 01:50:51,130
but this is pretty good.

2473
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:51,993
You know,

2474
01:50:52,330 --> 01:50:57,040
I am a psychologist and an educated
and I am primarily concerned with the

2475
01:50:57,041 --> 01:50:59,660
individual and I don't think
that I could do both of them.

2476
01:50:59,830 --> 01:51:01,390
I don't think it's possible to do both.

2477
01:51:01,720 --> 01:51:06,460
I'm talking to a lot of politicians to
Canada and in Australia and in the United

2478
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:10,360
States about the idea of individual
sovereignty and a both personal

2479
01:51:10,361 --> 01:51:11,141
responsibility,

2480
01:51:11,141 --> 01:51:14,310
especially for the more conservative
types because they're starting to cotton

2481
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:16,360
onto the fact that
there's a market for that.

2482
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:17,230
No,

2483
01:51:17,230 --> 01:51:18,390
for responsibilities,

2484
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,190
but I think I'm far more effective
doing what I'm doing now.

2485
01:51:21,191 --> 01:51:24,670
Then I wouldn't be if I made a
lateral move into a political domain,

2486
01:51:24,671 --> 01:51:25,504
so I don't mind.

2487
01:51:29,420 --> 01:51:32,740
Thanks for the record.

2488
01:51:32,741 --> 01:51:34,420
I'm pretty sure if the Trudeau can do it,

2489
01:51:34,421 --> 01:51:35,254
you can do it.

2490
01:51:36,240 --> 01:51:39,370
I think of that as a compliment,

2491
01:51:39,440 --> 01:51:40,273
but

2492
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:43,840
I did not write this one,

2493
01:51:43,841 --> 01:51:45,280
but what did you think of Star Wars?

2494
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:46,150
Episode eight

2495
01:51:50,810 --> 01:51:51,643
show that.

2496
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:59,590
The problem was that I have with the
Star Wars Program says this shows is that

2497
01:51:59,620 --> 01:52:01,750
every one of them is the same movie.

2498
01:52:05,430 --> 01:52:10,120
It's well known that that
Tom who wrote star wars,

2499
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,280
George Lucas,

2500
01:52:12,550 --> 01:52:14,440
Lucas consultant with Joseph Campbell,

2501
01:52:15,700 --> 01:52:16,481
Joseph Campbell,

2502
01:52:16,481 --> 01:52:18,280
was a student of cardio exam.

2503
01:52:18,520 --> 01:52:21,100
There's clearly continual,

2504
01:52:21,700 --> 01:52:26,680
partially conscious
utilization of mythological
architects in movies like Star

2505
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:26,830
Wars,

2506
01:52:26,830 --> 01:52:28,970
all the big screen in
action adventure movies,

2507
01:52:28,971 --> 01:52:31,610
so that sort of having this
logical substrate and you know,

2508
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:37,880
I've always fail because a story to be
great has to be a great story and if it's

2509
01:52:38,231 --> 01:52:40,480
a great story then it's
an archetypal story.

2510
01:52:40,510 --> 01:52:41,410
There's no way around it.

2511
01:52:41,750 --> 01:52:46,750
What makes it distort so more power
to the horn with types for retailing.

2512
01:52:46,790 --> 01:52:48,190
The great stories of.

2513
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:50,450
I've noticed particularly
a fan of star wars.

2514
01:52:50,570 --> 01:52:51,530
Having said that,

2515
01:52:54,750 --> 01:52:58,040
I mean I can't really argue with them

2516
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:04,370
given the tremendous amount of effort
that goes into raising a child.

2517
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:07,970
What do you think of the state
and local parenting technique?

2518
01:53:09,850 --> 01:53:12,440
You mean winter people should
stay at home with their children.

2519
01:53:12,441 --> 01:53:13,610
I guess that's the question.

2520
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:17,650
That's a good thing you don't

2521
01:53:20,130 --> 01:53:22,100
think about having kids is that,

2522
01:53:22,450 --> 01:53:22,730
you know,

2523
01:53:22,730 --> 01:53:24,190
let's say you got 90 years,

2524
01:53:24,200 --> 01:53:26,990
something like that and
maybe having two kids,

2525
01:53:27,740 --> 01:53:28,461
maybe three,

2526
01:53:28,461 --> 01:53:33,461
but probably two is pretty
much the average and so
that means you have three to

2527
01:53:34,731 --> 01:53:37,310
six years of little kids are 48 years,

2528
01:53:37,340 --> 01:53:38,270
something like that.

2529
01:53:39,890 --> 01:53:40,760
So if you miss it,

2530
01:53:41,450 --> 01:53:46,450
you miss it and I would say don't miss
it because anymore than you have to the

2531
01:53:46,671 --> 01:53:47,001
problem.

2532
01:53:47,001 --> 01:53:49,190
We have a little kid in about
six months later you think,

2533
01:53:49,191 --> 01:53:49,281
oh,

2534
01:53:49,281 --> 01:53:53,830
I've always had this little kid because
he gave me kind of accustomed to it and

2535
01:53:53,840 --> 01:53:56,540
then I'm going to be living for very
long and you don't live very long.

2536
01:53:57,560 --> 01:53:58,460
Time passes.

2537
01:53:58,880 --> 01:53:59,631
The older you get,

2538
01:53:59,631 --> 01:54:04,631
the faster and palaces and your life is
not long and there isn't that much to

2539
01:54:04,731 --> 01:54:08,650
fill it with and one of the things to
fill it with as little kids and you'll

2540
01:54:15,860 --> 01:54:18,650
see little kids who paid
you for taking care of them.

2541
01:54:19,100 --> 01:54:23,780
They pay you by being happier than you
exist than anyone will ever be again in

2542
01:54:23,781 --> 01:54:24,620
your life period.

2543
01:54:28,430 --> 01:54:30,760
And they pay you because
they're ridiculous.

2544
01:54:30,761 --> 01:54:33,320
The comical and playful and funny.

2545
01:54:33,560 --> 01:54:36,920
There's like little kids are so damn
funny and I can't figure that out.

2546
01:54:36,921 --> 01:54:38,240
They have a sense of humor right?

2547
01:54:38,241 --> 01:54:39,320
From like eight months.

2548
01:54:39,630 --> 01:54:44,120
You can play tricks on them and they
laugh and I can't figure that out.

2549
01:54:44,121 --> 01:54:48,230
I can't figure out how they can be so
damn sophisticated before they can even

2550
01:54:48,231 --> 01:54:48,650
talk.

2551
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:49,730
They have a good sense of humor.

2552
01:54:49,731 --> 01:54:51,350
They can do little things,

2553
01:54:51,351 --> 01:54:52,184
you know,

2554
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:54,190
I'm catching onto your jokes and,

2555
01:54:54,560 --> 01:54:55,940
and you can play with them,

2556
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:57,770
which is ridiculous.

2557
01:54:58,310 --> 01:55:01,430
It's something that fathers in
particular do with their children,

2558
01:55:01,431 --> 01:55:02,660
especially rough and tumble play.

2559
01:55:02,661 --> 01:55:04,790
I just didn't talk about that.

2560
01:55:04,791 --> 01:55:05,810
It was quite a good talk.

2561
01:55:05,811 --> 01:55:10,310
I think it's about the importance of
rough and tumble play and fathering.

2562
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:13,880
And then the other thing that
little kids do for you is,

2563
01:55:13,940 --> 01:55:14,151
you know,

2564
01:55:14,151 --> 01:55:16,370
you get kind of jaded as you get older.

2565
01:55:16,370 --> 01:55:19,040
And the reason for that is
you start seeing the world.

2566
01:55:19,820 --> 01:55:24,320
What you start saying is your memory of
the world because that was years in the

2567
01:55:24,321 --> 01:55:25,040
world longer,

2568
01:55:25,040 --> 01:55:25,431
longer.

2569
01:55:25,431 --> 01:55:27,800
You build up representations of the world.

2570
01:55:27,890 --> 01:55:29,240
And then you look at the world,

2571
01:55:29,241 --> 01:55:30,620
but the whole world on the headset,

2572
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:33,230
you what representation
to use and it's so.

2573
01:55:33,231 --> 01:55:36,980
It's like you're just seeing icons of
your imagination that that's technically

2574
01:55:36,981 --> 01:55:40,850
what happens and that's why things
don't fill you with a sense of wonder

2575
01:55:40,851 --> 01:55:45,851
constantly and there are there ways of
subverting that to the world reappears in

2576
01:55:48,031 --> 01:55:49,280
order to regional Gloria,

2577
01:55:49,380 --> 01:55:51,510
one of the things that
psychedelics do for people,

2578
01:55:51,840 --> 01:55:53,780
but generally as you

2579
01:55:57,410 --> 01:55:58,660
renew their perceptions,

2580
01:55:58,670 --> 01:55:59,130
right?

2581
01:55:59,130 --> 01:56:00,340
And that can happen in radically,

2582
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,570
that can happen to appointments,

2583
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:02,730
absolutely overwhelming,

2584
01:56:03,120 --> 01:56:07,270
but little kids have that psychedelic
property because when you're around the

2585
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:07,500
point,

2586
01:56:07,500 --> 01:56:12,500
they're so completely blown away by
everything that's happening that you can

2587
01:56:13,531 --> 01:56:15,450
look at the world
through their eyes again.

2588
01:56:15,450 --> 01:56:17,640
And so that takes you
out of your cynicism.

2589
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:19,410
And that's also a really good thing.

2590
01:56:19,411 --> 01:56:21,660
So I would say it's not so much.

2591
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:21,820
Well,

2592
01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:24,120
you have a moral duty to
stay home with your kids,

2593
01:56:24,300 --> 01:56:25,140
although you might.

2594
01:56:25,680 --> 01:56:26,760
That's not the point.

2595
01:56:26,761 --> 01:56:27,594
The point is,

2596
01:56:27,780 --> 01:56:28,980
what the hell do you have to do?

2597
01:56:29,070 --> 01:56:30,390
It's actually better than that.

2598
01:56:31,100 --> 01:56:33,840
You know when you think you're going
to have to interrupt your career,

2599
01:56:33,860 --> 01:56:34,140
it's like,

2600
01:56:34,140 --> 01:56:35,310
well first of all,

2601
01:56:35,340 --> 01:56:37,630
most of you don't have careers and

2602
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:42,530
jobs and more power to you,

2603
01:56:42,580 --> 01:56:44,180
like jobs have to be done,

2604
01:56:44,720 --> 01:56:45,350
but,

2605
01:56:45,350 --> 01:56:47,310
and then even if you do have your career,

2606
01:56:47,370 --> 01:56:49,290
and I know this from experience,

2607
01:56:49,920 --> 01:56:54,420
the probability that your career is more
important than the time you spend with

2608
01:56:54,421 --> 01:56:54,961
your kids.

2609
01:56:54,961 --> 01:56:55,530
It's,

2610
01:56:55,530 --> 01:56:59,240
it's faddish really small and
especially because you can,

2611
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:01,260
with difficulty,

2612
01:57:01,261 --> 01:57:03,030
you can have your cake and eat it too.

2613
01:57:03,180 --> 01:57:05,970
You can spend lots of time with your
kids and you can have your career.

2614
01:57:05,971 --> 01:57:07,040
So I would say man,

2615
01:57:07,350 --> 01:57:08,183
don't mess it,

2616
01:57:08,490 --> 01:57:13,110
like don't mess with because there
isn't that much in life that's real and

2617
01:57:13,111 --> 01:57:13,741
meaningful.

2618
01:57:13,741 --> 01:57:15,930
And that's one thing that definitely is.

2619
01:57:18,940 --> 01:57:23,940
Thank you.

2620
01:57:24,610 --> 01:57:25,190
Actually,

2621
01:57:25,190 --> 01:57:26,640
you referenced Psychedelics,

2622
01:57:26,641 --> 01:57:28,210
the way your kind of original

2623
01:57:29,750 --> 01:57:31,150
maybe the next door

2624
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:38,190
when we wrap this tour and then
we do like a trip with Peter said,

2625
01:57:48,820 --> 01:57:49,653
well

2626
01:57:57,330 --> 01:58:00,720
are you worried about becoming
a bit of a cult of personality?

2627
01:58:01,990 --> 01:58:02,220
Well,

2628
01:58:02,220 --> 01:58:04,800
anyone with any sense
would worry about that.

2629
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:07,460
I'm so,

2630
01:58:11,760 --> 01:58:12,120
you know,

2631
01:58:12,120 --> 01:58:12,953
there's this,

2632
01:58:13,870 --> 01:58:16,660
there's this scene in the life of prior

2633
01:58:18,960 --> 01:58:20,430
window naked,

2634
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:21,570
if I remember correctly,

2635
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:23,490
and he's,

2636
01:58:23,510 --> 01:58:27,560
he's telling all these people who are
carrying his shoes and his gardens around

2637
01:58:28,110 --> 01:58:31,260
that they're all individuals
and they all chat.

2638
01:58:31,261 --> 01:58:31,710
Yes,

2639
01:58:31,710 --> 01:58:33,120
we're all individuals

2640
01:58:36,980 --> 01:58:39,730
and it's a great movie and,

2641
01:58:39,960 --> 01:58:41,940
but I like worry about

2642
01:58:42,760 --> 01:58:43,593
because

2643
01:58:45,070 --> 01:58:49,840
I think that it encourages
people to develop their
individuality is actually not

2644
01:58:49,841 --> 01:58:51,000
the way that he started calling.

2645
01:58:51,440 --> 01:58:52,273
You don't mind.

2646
01:59:01,540 --> 01:59:01,910
Yes,

2647
01:59:01,910 --> 01:59:02,271
yes.

2648
01:59:02,271 --> 01:59:03,104
I'm serious.

2649
01:59:06,320 --> 01:59:07,480
What do you call it?

2650
01:59:08,290 --> 01:59:12,410
Tight definition and there's a bunch of
things you have to do is you're going to

2651
01:59:12,420 --> 01:59:16,610
lead or do you have to separate people
from their families and you have to tell

2652
01:59:16,611 --> 01:59:20,090
them that everyone outside in the cold
is evil and you have to figure out a way

2653
01:59:20,091 --> 01:59:23,050
to extract their labor
and resources from them.

2654
01:59:23,570 --> 01:59:26,140
You have to have a
compound up in the hill.

2655
01:59:26,980 --> 01:59:29,950
You don't want to work to have a

2656
01:59:32,610 --> 01:59:37,610
well known and I'm not doing any
of that old school genuinely.

2657
01:59:39,010 --> 01:59:41,120
I think as much as I can tell,

2658
01:59:41,270 --> 01:59:42,260
I have some experience.

2659
01:59:42,760 --> 01:59:45,770
I really am trying to
encourage people to Africa.

2660
01:59:46,490 --> 01:59:50,260
I don't want to tell people how to live
apart from the fact that patients leave

2661
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:53,480
the lights that are the
baskets that they can conceive,

2662
01:59:54,120 --> 01:59:54,953
but,

2663
01:59:55,050 --> 01:59:58,600
and I'm partly don't want to tell me
a little device because I don't know.

2664
01:59:58,700 --> 02:00:03,640
One of the things I've learned is you
don't want to tell people how to live

2665
02:00:03,641 --> 02:00:05,900
their lives because you don't
want to steal their from.

2666
02:00:06,290 --> 02:00:08,540
That's the first thing
for better or for worse,

2667
02:00:08,541 --> 02:00:13,130
and you don't suffer for
their catastrophes no matter
how well meaning advice

2668
02:00:13,430 --> 02:00:14,730
and also what do you know?

2669
02:00:14,731 --> 02:00:18,470
You don't know what's so good for this
person to find out what's good for a

2670
02:00:18,471 --> 02:00:18,771
person.

2671
02:00:18,771 --> 02:00:21,650
You have to listen to them a lot because.

2672
02:00:21,700 --> 02:00:26,390
And they have to articulate your be to
discover what their appropriate destiny

2673
02:00:26,391 --> 02:00:27,224
is.

2674
02:00:27,330 --> 02:00:28,650
And that's what I.

2675
02:00:29,110 --> 02:00:30,990
that's what I'm hoping
that people who did I,

2676
02:00:31,150 --> 02:00:34,510
I really hope that that's what
everyone in this room was eating.

2677
02:00:34,570 --> 02:00:36,480
And I think perhaps
that's where you're here.

2678
02:00:36,481 --> 02:00:38,840
Do you perhaps to be encouraged in that?

2679
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:43,010
And I don't see anything about
benefits apart from the fact that,

2680
02:00:43,060 --> 02:00:43,300
you know,

2681
02:00:43,300 --> 02:00:47,030
I have a certain mode
of public visibility.

2682
02:00:48,250 --> 02:00:49,430
I don't see that as cold,

2683
02:00:49,450 --> 02:00:53,990
like I just see it as a conversation
about things that are important that we

2684
02:00:53,991 --> 02:00:56,260
should be attending to that
we're all participating in.

2685
02:00:56,300 --> 02:00:56,940
That's how I look.

2686
02:00:56,940 --> 02:00:57,773
Okay.

2687
02:01:03,940 --> 02:01:06,400
You don't want to pass out the
Koolaid like we did last night.

2688
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:12,100
What do you do for fun?

2689
02:01:12,101 --> 02:01:15,720
Beers and hanging around with comedians.

2690
02:01:18,220 --> 02:01:18,670
I like,

2691
02:01:18,670 --> 02:01:19,850
I listen to music a lot.

2692
02:01:20,350 --> 02:01:22,450
I bought a car last year
that I actually like.

2693
02:01:23,450 --> 02:01:25,450
It's an old Mercedes.

2694
02:01:25,750 --> 02:01:27,190
Well it's 2017,

2695
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:28,930
which is normal enough to be cool,

2696
02:01:28,931 --> 02:01:29,764
but you know,

2697
02:01:31,650 --> 02:01:35,140
it's a convertible and I liked him to
drive around in that and listen to really

2698
02:01:35,141 --> 02:01:35,974
loud music.

2699
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:41,953
I

2700
02:01:43,820 --> 02:01:48,820
do hang around with my wife and my
kids who are in their twenties now,

2701
02:01:49,191 --> 02:01:50,660
but we get along real well in there.

2702
02:01:50,661 --> 02:01:51,530
Pretty Damn funny.

2703
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:52,843
And,

2704
02:01:53,600 --> 02:01:54,500
and uh,

2705
02:01:54,560 --> 02:01:58,400
my son's a good musician and I like to
listen to him sing and play the guitar.

2706
02:01:59,210 --> 02:02:01,960
My daughter had a baby and so you're like

2707
02:02:07,340 --> 02:02:08,000
12.

2708
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:11,870
I read a lot about my daughter
and she had a brutal adolescence.

2709
02:02:11,871 --> 02:02:16,871
It was absolutely unbelievably
unbearable and no we didn't.

2710
02:02:17,660 --> 02:02:21,150
We didn't think she was really going
to make it to her thirties and she's

2711
02:02:21,170 --> 02:02:21,621
better,

2712
02:02:21,621 --> 02:02:22,454
so

2713
02:02:24,330 --> 02:02:29,330
thank

2714
02:02:32,810 --> 02:02:33,070
you know,

2715
02:02:33,070 --> 02:02:34,210
I kind of think this is.

2716
02:02:34,340 --> 02:02:35,230
There's something about this.

2717
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:36,083
It's funny

2718
02:02:38,390 --> 02:02:39,290
because I've been feeling.

2719
02:02:39,300 --> 02:02:42,550
I've had some health problems and I
seem to be recovering so accurate.

2720
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:45,110
You have to go down before I come up.

2721
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:45,921
Especially tonight.

2722
02:02:45,921 --> 02:02:47,180
I don't know what it is with you guys.

2723
02:02:47,181 --> 02:02:48,500
You are pretty damn positive.

2724
02:02:51,260 --> 02:02:56,260
Thank you.

2725
02:03:00,090 --> 02:03:04,310
The mood in this room is the most optimal
of all the places that we've been.

2726
02:03:04,580 --> 02:03:06,890
Other places were quite positive for sure,

2727
02:03:06,891 --> 02:03:10,520
but there's something emotional level of
enthusiasm and this crap that's higher

2728
02:03:10,521 --> 02:03:11,180
than usual.
