1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,183
Dr. Peterson.

2
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:09,221
So I want to say,

3
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:10,054
um,

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,120
uh,

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,800
what a great lecture series and uh,

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:15,350
this is the last this year.

7
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:17,870
So Merry Christmas to you and your family.

8
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:18,381
Thank you.

9
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:19,214
Thank you.

10
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,020
I just want to say this,

11
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:22,270
this,

12
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,260
don't get too enthusiastic about that.

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,660
I wrote you an essay of a
question and then I use the,

14
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:30,300
uh,

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,700
the lecture of the essay writing guide
on site two 30 to narrow it down to just

16
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,534
a few pages,

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,100
a few lines.

18
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:38,180
And then during this,

19
00:00:38,181 --> 00:00:38,800
uh,

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,250
this particular lecture,

21
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,100
like the Zigzag slide
manifest again and I thought,

22
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:43,520
ah,

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,353
basically just

24
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,480
had all my questions answered.

25
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,070
So,

26
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:48,903
um,

27
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,210
basically I just,

28
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,320
I want to ask,

29
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:52,154
um,

30
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,171
the idea of,

31
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,004
uh,

32
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:56,990
your,

33
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,990
you've made a lecture that was
on youtube many years ago and uh,

34
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,940
you keep referring to
Cain and Abel and the,

35
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:05,170
uh,

36
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:08,440
the death of Abel by
Cain and the Christina.

37
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,220
And I think that was the,

38
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,920
that was the single brother,

39
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,450
two brothers conflicting.

40
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:14,901
Um,

41
00:01:14,901 --> 00:01:15,620
but,

42
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,980
but here we have in the
sons of Jacob the 12,

43
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:22,610
there was one who was one who's good,

44
00:01:22,611 --> 00:01:27,110
one who was enable archetype and
there were 1211 that came after him.

45
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,510
So that,

46
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,051
I don't know,

47
00:01:30,051 --> 00:01:32,420
maybe there's something
about the division.

48
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:34,691
No,

49
00:01:34,691 --> 00:01:35,770
that's a good observation.

50
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:37,000
I hadn't thought about that.

51
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,170
Yeah.

52
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,340
Well I mean there's a bit of variability
because Ruben and Ruben isn't quite as

53
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:43,091
bad as the rest,

54
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:43,690
but yeah,

55
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,090
I would say it's probably
easier for the cane side,

56
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:46,924
the multiply.

57
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,820
Luckily it's not as powerful
because it doesn't do anything.

58
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,730
Yes,

59
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:56,091
yes.

60
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:56,924
And you know,

61
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,890
there's young was often included

62
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,290
accused of Manichean these,

63
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,720
I'm sorry I'm not
pronouncing that properly,

64
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:05,554
but there was a,

65
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,800
there was a variant of Christian
dogma that held that good and evil.

66
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:13,180
We're separate metaphysical realities
and that they were battling for the,

67
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,560
for governance of the Cosmo,

68
00:02:15,561 --> 00:02:16,361
something like that.

69
00:02:16,361 --> 00:02:20,800
But they both had an independent existence
and the classical Christian idea,

70
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,600
which won out over that was that no,

71
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:23,830
that good was real,

72
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:25,660
but evil was the absence of good.

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,170
Now that produced all sorts of the
absence of good produces all sorts of

74
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:30,004
consequences.

75
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,390
And it is interesting to read young
because he does get kind of Manichaean in

76
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:35,650
his discussions.

77
00:02:35,651 --> 00:02:38,770
And I think it was partly because he
was so concerned about what happened in

78
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,860
Nazi Germany and then with
a Cold War afterwards.

79
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,101
You know,

80
00:02:42,101 --> 00:02:44,170
cause evil seem to be a palpable force.

81
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,250
But I don't think that
it's as powerful as good.

82
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,340
But I do think it's easier for it to
multiply because it's what's easier path.

83
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,140
It's easy to be resentful
and hostile and bitter and,

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,610
and do nothing that's easy.

85
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:02,800
It's horrible and it's hard on people,

86
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:05,680
but it doesn't require a tremendous
amount of faith or effort.

87
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:09,790
So maybe that is why it's multiplied
in the final story in genesis.

88
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:10,711
Yeah,

89
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:11,131
and I,

90
00:03:11,131 --> 00:03:13,440
I've been reading ahead and for my own,

91
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:18,500
based on the interest of the present
presented stories and I keyed in on a few

92
00:03:19,921 --> 00:03:20,540
other books,

93
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,210
um,

94
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,190
chapters in the Bible,

95
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,790
First Corinthians 13,

96
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:24,870
which is the love chapter.

97
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,710
Um,

98
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:30,150
and that cycles through the idea
of I can have all things in life,

99
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:30,571
uh,

100
00:03:30,571 --> 00:03:31,051
knowledge,

101
00:03:31,051 --> 00:03:31,800
power,

102
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,700
but it's all passing.

103
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:33,890
And uh,

104
00:03:35,170 --> 00:03:37,380
the law now and forever.

105
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:37,681
Faith,

106
00:03:37,681 --> 00:03:38,460
hope and love.

107
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:41,520
And then of course love triumphs overall.

108
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,281
Yeah.

109
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,240
Well the love the issue.

110
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:43,700
See I've,

111
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,440
I've been,

112
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,340
I thought a lot about the relationship
between love and truth because I've

113
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,900
thought and talked a lot more about truth.

114
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,800
And I think partly that's because love
is a word that you can hardly even say

115
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,150
because it's been so,

116
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,160
it's like it's being dragged
behind a car through mud puddles.

117
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,120
It's something like that.

118
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,460
But it's so,

119
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:01,711
sorry,

120
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:03,870
let me just finish it
liberating this idea.

121
00:04:03,871 --> 00:04:05,360
But I think that the,

122
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:05,800
the,

123
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,450
the love idea is associated with w for me,

124
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:12,840
at least with what I discussed at the
beginning of this lecture with regards to

125
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:13,740
faith,

126
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:18,540
I think you have to make a decision
about what your attitude towards being is

127
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:19,440
going to be.

128
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,390
And the proper attitude in my estimation
is that you're working for its

129
00:04:24,391 --> 00:04:25,224
betterment,

130
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:26,161
you know?

131
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:27,030
And so maybe,

132
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,500
maybe you have the same attitude towards
being as you do towards someone that

133
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:31,951
you love,

134
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:33,840
like a son or a daughter or wife,

135
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,120
that you want things to be better.

136
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,130
And then so that's your aim.

137
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:43,131
So they aim is basically the
aim is motivated by love.

138
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,540
You want things to be better,

139
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:47,420
because I think that's a
good definition of love.

140
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,380
Like if you really care for someone,

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,590
you can tell because you want
things to be better for them.

142
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,880
And then I think truth is nested inside
that because I think that truth is the

143
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,200
best servant of love.

144
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,130
It's something like that.

145
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,180
[inaudible].
