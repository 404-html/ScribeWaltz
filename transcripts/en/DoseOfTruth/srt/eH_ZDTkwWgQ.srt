1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,410
Why do I know I discussed
religious fundamentalism
more often and more in depth.

2
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,490
Many people consider you a religious
apologist as a consequence.

3
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:17,883
Well,

4
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,590
it's okay if people considered
me a religious apologist.

5
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:22,180
I am a religious apologist.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,630
So an apologist is someone who
makes an argument for something.

7
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:31,020
And I'm constantly making arguments
for a religious perspective on life or

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,920
religious orientation towards life.

9
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:33,903
Uh,

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:34,913
uh,

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:37,240
an orientation that's centered in,

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,433
in meaning,

13
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,960
I know orientation that's centered in
desire for all things to thrive in so far

14
00:00:44,111 --> 00:00:49,111
is that it's possible desire for people
to speak the truth and act out the truth

15
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:52,150
and act responsibility,

16
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,200
act responsibly,

17
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:54,034
and all of that.

18
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,260
And I think that there's some something
transcendently necessary about all of

19
00:00:59,261 --> 00:00:59,710
that.

20
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,660
And I think it is the antidote to hell.

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:06,760
So that that makes me
a religious apologist.

22
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:08,620
The fundamentalists,

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:09,970
I dunno.

24
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,270
Which fundamentalists you mean if you
mean the Christian fundamentalists?

25
00:01:13,271 --> 00:01:14,104
Well,

26
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,180
I understand where they're coming from.

27
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:17,014
You know,

28
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,600
I think the Christian

29
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,790
Christianity is an ethical
framework above all else.

30
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:30,470
And it's predicated in a story about
the way the world is constituted and,

31
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:36,610
and the story provides the foundation
for that ethic and the ethic unites the

32
00:01:37,011 --> 00:01:38,780
community and gives people direction.

33
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,070
This is a big deal.

34
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,301
Now,

35
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,950
if the story is challenged,

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:45,020
if the foundational stories challenged,

37
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:48,200
which is certainly what happened as a
consequence of the rise of empirical

38
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:48,711
science,

39
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:52,550
then the foundation for
the ethic starts to,

40
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:55,013
okay,

41
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,730
starts to shake and tremble.

42
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,890
And that threatens the ethic.

43
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,070
But the ethic is what holds people
together and gives them direction.

44
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,320
So you can't just lose the ethic.

45
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:08,310
So the fundamentalist Christians are all
short circuited because they know that

46
00:02:08,311 --> 00:02:13,311
there's something to the ethic and they
understand that the foundation has been

47
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:14,304
shaken,

48
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,260
but they don't know what to do about it.

49
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,130
So they insist that the
foundation has not been shaken.

50
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,740
And I understand that.

51
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,840
So I think the way out of
that is to understand that

52
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,170
the truth that govern ethics and the
truths that govern the description of the

53
00:02:34,171 --> 00:02:37,380
world as a material
place are not the same.

54
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,580
They're not,

55
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,413
they're not.

56
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,480
They're not of the same kind.

57
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,020
Um,

58
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,040
how they're related.

59
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,150
I'm not exactly sure,

60
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:47,460
but there's no simple
one to one relationships.

61
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:52,490
You can't describe the world and then
immediately extract out in ethic.

62
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:56,550
It's partly because there are just
too many ways of describing the world.

63
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:57,701
So,

64
00:02:57,701 --> 00:02:58,534
and this is the,

65
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:03,400
that the fundamental point of difference
as far as I can tell between Sam Harris

66
00:03:03,401 --> 00:03:05,680
and I and hopefully what
we'll discuss in the summer.

67
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,023
So,

68
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,980
so that's the Christian fundamentalists
and I don't really see that they're a

69
00:03:11,981 --> 00:03:14,410
particularly threatening
group as far as I can tell.

70
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:18,310
I mean there are certainly not in
the ascendance by any stretch of the

71
00:03:18,311 --> 00:03:19,150
imagination.

72
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,023
Um,

73
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:25,540
they're not involved in any particularly
reprehensible political behavior unless

74
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:26,800
you count conservatism.

75
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,570
And it is by no means obvious that
they're even holding their ground in the

76
00:03:33,571 --> 00:03:34,404
culture war.

77
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,940
So I'm not very worried about them.

78
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:38,203
Um,

79
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,560
Islamic fundamentalism,

80
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,080
that's a whole different story.

81
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:48,600
But I don't know enough about
it to discuss it intelligently.

82
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:50,400
I don't understand Islam.

83
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,510
It,

84
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,343
it,

85
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,460
it,

86
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,230
I'm concerned about.

87
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:56,064
It's,

88
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,010
what would you call compatibility with,

89
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,890
with the Democratic West?

90
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:09,830
It isn't obvious to me that there
are medium to high functioning Muslim

91
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,070
democracies.

92
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,170
I suppose turkeys the closest one,

93
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:15,820
but Turkey's pretty soon,

94
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,470
pretty shaky at the moment.

95
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:22,120
I think that the failure to
separate church and state,

96
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:25,900
or even if we don't call it a failure,

97
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:30,901
the fact that church and state hasn't
been technically separated in Islam makes

98
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:36,451
it difficult to understand how it's
possible for Islam and modern western

99
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:40,030
democratic traditions to coexist.

100
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,560
I don't know how that can be,

101
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,570
that gap can be bridged.

102
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,953
Um,

103
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,821
you could say,

104
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:47,560
well with goodwill and let's,

105
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:49,330
let's hope that's the case.

106
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,470
Um,

107
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:54,640
that doesn't mean I don't think that
Muslims can live in a modern western

108
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:55,241
democracy.

109
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:55,961
I mean there are many,

110
00:04:55,961 --> 00:04:59,530
many kinds of Muslims just like there
are many kinds of Jews and Christians.

111
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,790
And so,

112
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,310
and then there's the problem
of the current proclivity
of the extreme end of the

113
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,110
Muslim fundamentalist world to become,

114
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,900
to be very violent in very many ways.

115
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:16,843
And so,

116
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,251
you know what,

117
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:22,130
I'm not a great admirer of
the Saudis to say the least.

118
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:25,310
I don't appreciate their brand of,

119
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,540
of Wahhabi Islam.

120
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,080
And I don't appreciate their exports of
that view with their petro dollars to

121
00:05:35,421 --> 00:05:36,410
the rest of the world.

122
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,113
So

123
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,870
I guess that's what I have
to say about fundamentalists.

124
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,051
Hello,

125
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:45,890
Dr. Peterson.

126
00:05:45,891 --> 00:05:47,750
I've been trying to
listen to my conscience,

127
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,210
but I can't tell the
difference between fear,

128
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,400
willful blindness or genuine conscience.

129
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,473
Well,

130
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,020
the first thing I would say about that
is it is quite clear that you are in fact

131
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,530
to listen to your conscience because
that's probably the first thing that you

132
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,364
discover.

133
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,900
So that's a really good question.

134
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,423
Okay.

135
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,993
Okay.

136
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,853
Fear.

137
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:10,611
Well,

138
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,430
here's the test and you don't
want to do this stupidly.

139
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,650
If you think that you should do something
and you think that the reason you

140
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:23,200
might not be doing it is
because you're afraid,

141
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,550
then you should do it.

142
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,470
Okay?

143
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,690
So that way you can find out if it's fear.

144
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:30,761
You know,

145
00:06:30,761 --> 00:06:31,720
I think your question is,

146
00:06:31,721 --> 00:06:31,841
well,

147
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:35,080
how do I know my conscience isn't
just masquerading as fierce saying,

148
00:06:35,081 --> 00:06:35,201
well,

149
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:36,160
you shouldn't do that,

150
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,950
but it's rationalizing the real issue,

151
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,390
which is you're afraid of doing that.

152
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,680
Now,

153
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,513
see,

154
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,370
here's a reason that you
want to tell the truth.

155
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,390
And I parked,

156
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,870
I kind of figured this out when I was
looking deeply into the Pinocchio Story.

157
00:06:49,871 --> 00:06:50,051
You know,

158
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:53,740
in Pinocchio as Pinocchio
strives to become real,

159
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:54,180
he,

160
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,990
he has a conscience to guide him,

161
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:57,400
but it's jimminy cricket,

162
00:06:57,401 --> 00:06:58,240
this insect.

163
00:06:58,241 --> 00:07:00,820
But Jimmy hasn't really
a very good conscience.

164
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,410
He's a bit dogmatic to begin with.

165
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:04,060
Dogmatic and inexperienced.

166
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,620
And so it's,

167
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,500
it's not like the conscience
is an unerring guide.

168
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,170
It's like a partner in discovery.

169
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:17,710
And as you move forward in your life
and you consult your conscience and you

170
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,124
listen to it,

171
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,940
then it gets smarter and so to you.

172
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:25,100
But there's a code of their,

173
00:07:25,101 --> 00:07:29,450
and this is why I've suggested part
of the reason why I've suggested so

174
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:34,220
frequently in my lectures and in
my book that people try not to lie.

175
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,223
You see,

176
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,920
there are many systems,

177
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:38,420
you have many systems within,

178
00:07:38,421 --> 00:07:39,254
let's say,

179
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,190
that guide you.

180
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,360
And one of those is your
capacity for rational thought.

181
00:07:44,361 --> 00:07:47,810
And then you have a variety of emotional
systems and motivational systems and

182
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:49,820
internal dramas and uh,

183
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,800
intuitions and bodily sensations
like lots and lots of and senses,

184
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,050
lots of systems that are guiding you.

185
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,380
And many of them operate,

186
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,303
you might say,

187
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,560
unconsciously,

188
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,820
autonomously,

189
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,010
instinctively,

190
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:07,911
implicitly,

191
00:08:07,911 --> 00:08:08,744
all of that.

192
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,020
Now you PR nonetheless,

193
00:08:12,021 --> 00:08:14,750
you programmed them like
you feed them content,

194
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:17,360
let's say just like you
feed your body nourishment,

195
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:22,361
you feed them content and a lot of the
content that you feed them pertains

196
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:26,270
directly to your voluntary thoughts
and speech and your actions.

197
00:08:26,271 --> 00:08:29,300
And then if you
pathologize those by lying.

198
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:33,140
So if you say things that you know not
to be true or you don't say things that

199
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:34,820
you know to be true when you need to,

200
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,110
which is more common.

201
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:41,690
And if you act in ways that you
consider that act in ways you considered

202
00:08:41,691 --> 00:08:42,560
reprehensible,

203
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:47,630
then you pathologize all of those
autonomous systems that guide you.

204
00:08:47,631 --> 00:08:49,250
It's like you're programming them badly,

205
00:08:49,251 --> 00:08:52,480
you're building an AI system
inside yourself really in,

206
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,740
in,

207
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,460
in some sense that is what
you're doing that has very bad,

208
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,230
it's very bad training data.

209
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,710
And so the output it
produces will be well,

210
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:01,950
won't guide you properly.

211
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:07,370
And so you don't want to
pathologize your guidance systems.

212
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,840
It's a really bad idea.

213
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,060
So that's why you have to not lie.

214
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,990
And maybe that's also why you
have to say what you have to say.

215
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,400
And you have to say it clearly as well.

216
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:18,540
And you have to learn how to do that.

217
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,860
So that's one of the ways of getting
your conscience straightened out.

218
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,500
And then you have to have a
dialogue with your conscience.

219
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,251
And you might ask,

220
00:09:26,251 --> 00:09:26,521
it's like,

221
00:09:26,521 --> 00:09:26,821
okay,

222
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:28,380
well what should I do?

223
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:29,370
Or what should,

224
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,440
should I do this or should I not do this?

225
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,490
So let's say you're thinking,

226
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:33,480
should I not do this?

227
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,650
In the case of a temptation,

228
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,120
maybe you have a chance to
develop a new relationship.

229
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:39,421
You know,

230
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:40,254
and you're,

231
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,470
you're excited about it and apprehensive
about it and afraid of it and you don't

232
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,970
know how to sort out all those feelings.

233
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,420
And the first thing is you really
have to want to sort them out.

234
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:55,680
That's why you have to orient yourself
to something that's a genuine up.

235
00:09:55,681 --> 00:09:57,540
You know that the star above the horizon,

236
00:09:57,541 --> 00:10:02,430
you have to really want things to be
straight and you have to have thought that

237
00:10:02,431 --> 00:10:03,090
through.

238
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,720
And you have to know what it means
for things not to be straight.

239
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,990
And really what it means is that you're
headed for hell in one way or another.

240
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,300
And if you understand that it's enough,

241
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,190
maybe it's enough to scare you straight,

242
00:10:14,191 --> 00:10:15,450
you really got to think that through.

243
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,540
Then you've got to think about how much
better it would be if you aimed up.

244
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:21,660
And that really has to kind
of permeate your whole being.

245
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,210
And so then you're oriented that way.

246
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:27,180
You're oriented to dop and you're
deciding that it's okay to try to tell the

247
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:31,020
truth and then you can start to rely
on this dialogue with your conscience.

248
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:35,790
But both of you have to learn and you're
going to make mistakes along the way.

249
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:37,500
You know that's okay.

250
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,011
You can say,

251
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:38,161
well,

252
00:10:38,161 --> 00:10:40,410
I'm going to try this without
being certain that it's right.

253
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:41,850
You can even say,

254
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm going to say this without
being certain that it's correct.

255
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:47,640
Like if you're arguing with your
wife or your husband or your,

256
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,601
or your sister,

257
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,434
your father,

258
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,080
and you have an idea about
what might be going on,

259
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:52,920
you can say,

260
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,263
look,

261
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,970
here's my idea about what's going on.

262
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,343
Um,

263
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:01,230
who knows what that idea
might be contaminated with,

264
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:04,560
like maybe I'm putting it forward just
because I'm too proud or arrogant or

265
00:11:04,561 --> 00:11:06,420
angry or fearful or whatever.

266
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,250
That's possible.

267
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:09,870
Let's see if we can figure that out.

268
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,500
But you can offer it
tentatively and both have added.

269
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:17,220
That's what you do if it's a hypothesis,

270
00:11:17,221 --> 00:11:17,401
right?

271
00:11:17,401 --> 00:11:20,460
You both have at it and see if
it's an idea that's worthy of,

272
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,830
of keeping you do that with your
conscience and then you were move forward.

273
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:27,900
There's a,

274
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,770
there's a technique in behavioral
psychology called psychotherapy called

275
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,060
collaborative empiricism.

276
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:34,740
So let's say that we,

277
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,770
you and I have been sitting down and
we decided that you're going to try

278
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,330
something new this week,

279
00:11:39,331 --> 00:11:42,570
like maybe your agoraphobic and you're
having a hard time in a parking lot.

280
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:45,570
And so getting out of the car
and going to the grocery store.

281
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:46,410
So maybe we say,

282
00:11:46,411 --> 00:11:47,100
well,

283
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,311
you know,

284
00:11:47,311 --> 00:11:50,160
to drive to the grocery store and
you're just going to walk halfway to the

285
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:53,560
halfway from your car to the door.

286
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:57,460
And that's good enough for like do that
every second day for a week and then

287
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:58,780
come back and let's talk about it.

288
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:00,520
So that's collaborative empiricism,

289
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:02,080
you're running a little experiment,

290
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:02,943
you think,

291
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:05,230
well your conscience is
guiding you towards something.

292
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,580
You take a tentative step in that
direction and then you check and see,

293
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:09,821
well,

294
00:12:09,821 --> 00:12:10,420
you know,

295
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:14,530
did what I wanted to have
happen ochre as an outcome.

296
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,220
That's the crucial question and that's
the crucial question for behavioral

297
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:18,641
truth,

298
00:12:18,641 --> 00:12:18,851
right?

299
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:20,560
That's the pragmatic perspective.

300
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:25,830
Did what I want to have happen happen
as a consequence of my framework of

301
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,460
interpretation and my action.

302
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,740
If the answer is yes,

303
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:32,410
then I have not invalidated it.

304
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,100
Right?

305
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,430
That's,

306
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:36,100
that's the pragmatic philosophy
in a nutshell and it's,

307
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:36,701
it's very,

308
00:12:36,701 --> 00:12:37,534
very smart.

309
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,000
So you have a dialogue with
your conscience that never ends,

310
00:12:45,001 --> 00:12:48,150
and hopefully it gets
wiser and you get wiser.

311
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:49,943
And

312
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,200
that's the dialogue that young talked
about between the conscious and the

313
00:12:55,201 --> 00:12:56,040
unconscious,

314
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,143
between your,

315
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,760
your fantasy life,

316
00:12:59,761 --> 00:13:04,470
say the life that sort of underneath
you as a conscious being like you're the

317
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:06,720
life that's part of your
biological platform,

318
00:13:06,721 --> 00:13:11,100
the biological platform that somehow
miraculously gives rise to your

319
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:11,940
consciousness.

320
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:13,860
If a dialogue with that,

321
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,250
we're always in dialogue.

322
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,510
We're always in dialogue,

323
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:18,990
right,

324
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,823
