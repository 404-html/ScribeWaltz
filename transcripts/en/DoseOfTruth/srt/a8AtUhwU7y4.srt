1
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,560
I'm a female student in stem and I feel
bombarded by all the feminist groups

2
00:00:13,561 --> 00:00:15,300
trying to infantilize me.

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,450
How do I prevent them from
turning me into an adult child?

4
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,113
You know,

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,170
one of the things that's really useful
to do in university is to pick your peer

6
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:27,004
group.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,300
When I went to university,

8
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:31,720
like I made new friends in university
and that was really useful.

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,040
So I had my personal friends and they
were people who were trying to aim at

10
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,780
something better than what they had,

11
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,870
something better than what they had left.

12
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:42,490
And that was a real relief to me.

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,160
I wrote about that in my new book too.

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,060
Um,

15
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,600
called make friends with people
who want the best for you.

16
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:50,530
That's rule three.

17
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,053
Um,

18
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,490
but I also realized that
when you went to university,

19
00:00:54,491 --> 00:00:58,810
you picked your peers and in the stem
fields what you should do is pick some

20
00:00:58,811 --> 00:01:02,080
great scientists and those could be
people that you just read books about.

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,490
Pick some great scientists,

22
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:06,130
man or some great engineers.

23
00:01:06,131 --> 00:01:07,360
There's some great mathematicians,

24
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:09,400
cause I don't know where
you are in the stem fields.

25
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:10,690
Pick some,

26
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:15,610
pick a hero or two or three and then
make those of your peers right and don't

27
00:01:15,611 --> 00:01:18,310
pay any attention to all the noise
and Ruckus that you hear around you.

28
00:01:18,311 --> 00:01:19,720
It's all nonsense anyways.

29
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,780
Partly what should happen when you go
to university is that you should be

30
00:01:22,781 --> 00:01:27,040
introduced to great people and those
can be great people of the past.

31
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:27,330
They,

32
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,230
their spirits still live on in their work,

33
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:29,861
in their books,

34
00:01:29,861 --> 00:01:34,180
and you can pick them as peers and
just ignore all that idiot political

35
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:34,901
nonsense.

36
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:35,111
Well,

37
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:38,920
you straighten yourself out and
learn to be great at what you do.

38
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:44,380
Develop a philosophy of greatness and
that will keep the social justice warriors

39
00:01:44,381 --> 00:01:44,950
at bay.
