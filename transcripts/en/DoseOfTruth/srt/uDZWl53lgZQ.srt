1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,593
Yeah.

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:10,080
Somebody asked,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:15,540
what's up with all the lending teachers
in your house and then how is it to look

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,380
at them every day?

5
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:19,323
Well,

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,503
about

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,380
in 2001 you to see it of
manic collective insanity.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,400
I decided to start seeing if I could
find Soviet era artists ox online,

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,630
mostly through Ebay.

10
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,820
I had read a paper by James
Pennebaker who claimed that uh,

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,860
past events start to become historically
significant about 15 years after the,

12
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,870
after the relevant event.

13
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:54,430
And so 2001 was 15 years after the fall,

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,400
essentially after the fall of
the Berlin Wall or close enough.

15
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,420
And so I started looking on Ebay to see
what sort of Soviet artifacts or might

16
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:04,960
be able to find.

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,070
Um,

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:06,611
first of all,

19
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:10,150
I was kind of curious about what
would be available for purchase.

20
00:01:10,151 --> 00:01:14,820
And I also saw it as deeply ironic
that the most free market of,

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,860
of what would you call
platforms ever device,

22
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:22,861
which would be Ebay could now be used
to scavenge communist era artists,

23
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:24,640
Alex from Russia.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,120
You know,

25
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,620
it just seemed like to be someone
who was raised during the Cold War.

26
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,850
The fact that that,

27
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:36,210
that I could buy things like heads of
Lennon on Ebay was just too comical to not

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,150
to pass up,

29
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,983
you know.

30
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,880
And so I started buying things that I
had some familiarity with because of what

31
00:01:42,881 --> 00:01:43,830
I'd read historic.

32
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,530
Again,

33
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,480
the first thing I bought was about a three
by five silk flag that was awarded to

34
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:53,500
a factory for meeting its
five year production quota.

35
00:01:53,501 --> 00:01:57,360
And I don't know what you know
about those infamous quotas,

36
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,360
but what would happen is that
there were dicta sent down on high,

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,320
but how much factories were
supposed to produce and the implied,

38
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,503
um,

39
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:07,443
um,

40
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:12,760
what the implication was produced
or else by any means necessary.

41
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,190
And so two things happened,

42
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,300
three things happened.

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,210
The goods were often shoddy
because they were rushed.

44
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:23,230
There was deception about how much was
actually produced and then people were

45
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:25,350
radically over worked and under supplied.

46
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,060
So it was a bad about and system.

47
00:02:28,061 --> 00:02:31,660
But it was very interesting to actually
have one of these flags and see what

48
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:32,494
they were like.

49
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,110
And then I bought a block,

50
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,980
a stainless steel plot,

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,160
windup clock that was a submarine clock.

52
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,150
And it was bomb proof.

53
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:44,410
So I thought that would be
handy if someone ever bombed
my house and I needed to

54
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:45,520
know what time it was.

55
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,070
So I bought that.

56
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:50,820
And then I found this painting
that's actually off to my left here.

57
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,490
It's five Russian revolutionaries,

58
00:02:54,491 --> 00:02:56,770
all younger and court stalwart looking,

59
00:02:56,771 --> 00:03:01,771
standing on the edge of a cliff with a
red soldier or a white soldier off to

60
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,870
decide they're all shackled together
and he's preparing to execute them.

61
00:03:05,871 --> 00:03:06,311
And that was,

62
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,144
uh,

63
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,501
that was,

64
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:09,030
uh,

65
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,350
a fairly common Soviet motif.

66
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:12,110
And,

67
00:03:12,110 --> 00:03:12,580
um,

68
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,810
on my right side,

69
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:14,644
I have a,

70
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,550
a decorated Soviet war hero who's,

71
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,930
who's working in a steel foundry and
like a lot of the Soviet art glorified,

72
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:23,764
I suppose the,

73
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,850
the working class.

74
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,360
And I suppose there's nothing wrong
with that depending on the degree of

75
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,880
propagandistic intent and falsifications.

76
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,670
But,

77
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,503
um,

78
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,590
they're kind of like
Norman Rockwell paintings,

79
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,320
except they don't have the
same degree of sentimentality,

80
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,490
which is quite interesting.

81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,040
And what's it like to have them around?

82
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,903
Well,

83
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,090
pretty much every square inch of
my house is covered with paintings.

84
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:47,650
And a fair number of them are,

85
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:50,950
I don't suppose the sorts of paintings
that people would usually have in their

86
00:03:50,951 --> 00:03:51,341
house.

87
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:51,561
There are,

88
00:03:51,561 --> 00:03:53,440
some of them are of the Second World War.

89
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,000
Some of them are strongly
political and uh,

90
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,943
but it's,

91
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,503
it's,

92
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,600
well sometimes people say,

93
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:06,890
well I wouldn't want to live in a museum.

94
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:09,400
And I guess that isn't how I feel.

95
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:13,990
I actually like living in a museum and
I like having these historical artifacts

96
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,310
around and I really like watching the
propaganda and the art more in the,

97
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,890
in the paintings because many of these
paintings were produced by very talented

98
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,790
impressionist artists who are trained
in the classical European tradition.

99
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,680
They spent months making these paintings
and yet their subordinate in some sense

100
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:34,330
to a political ideology.

101
00:04:34,331 --> 00:04:39,331
But what's interesting is that as the
political ideology recedes into the past,

102
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:44,290
the more purely artistic elements
of the painting seem to remain.

103
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,470
And so it's cool to kind of watch,

104
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,640
it's very slow process,

105
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:50,440
but it's very interesting to watch.

106
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:54,610
The art itself emerged
triumphant over the propaganda.

107
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:56,160
And then,

108
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,380
you know,

109
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:59,410
these things also remind me of what,

110
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,630
what I'm interested in.

111
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,880
And that's the study of videology.

112
00:05:03,881 --> 00:05:08,740
And they reminded me how powerful
ideology can be and how many different

113
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,300
pathways it can take,

114
00:05:10,301 --> 00:05:11,580
two to,

115
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:12,761
to control,

116
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:13,421
I suppose.

117
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:13,850
And,

118
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,683
and,

119
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,000
and it also reminds me of the reality
of the 20th century because it was a

120
00:05:19,001 --> 00:05:20,010
terrible reality.

121
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,030
And if we forget it,

122
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,500
then we were likely to repeat it.

123
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:25,503
Now,

124
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:28,570
my kids grew up in this
house and you know,

125
00:05:28,571 --> 00:05:28,930
they,

126
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,710
I asked them about it because as far as
the paintings are fairly heavy and maybe

127
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:34,000
even somewhat frightening,

128
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:37,940
but they really liked it
and people that I had,

129
00:05:37,941 --> 00:05:41,710
it gives me a reason to invite people
into my house and gives me something to

130
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:42,280
play with.

131
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,710
And,

132
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,790
and I,

133
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,190
I guess I need things to
play with by all appearances.

134
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,550
So that's the story of the,

135
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,170
of the Soviet paintings.

136
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,030
So.
