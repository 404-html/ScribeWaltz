1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,770
I lose my ability to think straight or
intelligently and confrontational or

2
00:00:10,771 --> 00:00:12,930
unfriendly social situations.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,140
Any suggestions for
adoptation or approvement?

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,300
Well,

5
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,380
a couple I suppose.

6
00:00:19,381 --> 00:00:19,811
One is,

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:24,150
is that when you get nervous in this
Hannah's situation that you're describing,

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,380
what often happens to people as they
start paying attention to themselves,

9
00:00:28,381 --> 00:00:29,460
they get self conscious.

10
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,110
So you know,

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,040
let's say I got self conscious all
of a sudden during this Q and a,

12
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,510
what would happen is that I'd stopped
paying attention to the questions and the

13
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:44,160
screen and what I'm doing and I'd start
paying attention to how I was feeling

14
00:00:44,161 --> 00:00:45,450
and to the nervousness.

15
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:49,980
And then I'd start to get aware that
I was not responding properly and that

16
00:00:49,981 --> 00:00:51,330
would make me more nervous.

17
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:55,440
And then I would get more aware of that
and that can just shut me down entirely.

18
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:56,580
And that's happened to me now.

19
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,270
And then in a lecture and sometimes
almost happened when I was talking to Sam

20
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,103
Harris the first time.

21
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,393
Um,

22
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:02,910
I,

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:05,820
I paused for a long time and
then became aware of the pause.

24
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:06,870
And then anyways,

25
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:11,700
what you have to do in a situation like
that is it's not so much that you have

26
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:16,260
to stop attending to yourself because
if you start thinking I should stop

27
00:01:16,261 --> 00:01:17,610
attending to myself,

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,860
then you'll just think
about yourself more.

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,100
What you have to do instead is pay more
attention to this situation and to the

30
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:27,810
people that you're talking to.

31
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:32,990
So you have to increase the degree to
which you're at attending outwardly and

32
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,630
that'll stop you from attending inwardly.

33
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,163
Um,

34
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,640
that's very effective technique.

35
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,750
You can practice that.

36
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,770
Generally speaking,

37
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:44,730
every time you get nervous,

38
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:48,090
start paying more attention and that'll,

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,373
that'll,

40
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,670
that'll help you out a lot.

41
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:51,810
Um,

42
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,090
the,

43
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:57,090
the really good suggestion for social
anxiety in general is that if you see most

44
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:58,560
people,

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,340
but not everyone,

46
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:03,840
but most people have enough implicit
social skill because they were reasonably

47
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,090
socialized when they were children so
that they do know how to act in social

48
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:09,691
situations,

49
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:13,740
but they get anxious and
then that interferes with
them implementing what they

50
00:02:13,741 --> 00:02:13,980
know.

51
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,300
Just like if you're a pianist and you
get anxious and self conscious while

52
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:18,841
you're playing,

53
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:20,550
you'll forget what you know.

54
00:02:20,551 --> 00:02:23,370
Because while you've activated
a different part of your brain,

55
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:28,770
if you can remember to pay attention and
you can direct your attention outward

56
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,000
and you attend hard enough,

57
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,200
then what will happen?

58
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,590
And try to put the other person at
ease and try to ask them questions,

59
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:39,860
then that'll kick in the automatic because
you're paying attention to what the

60
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:44,190
person is doing and to their
facial expressions and all of that,

61
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,710
that will clue in the
automatic and implicit,

62
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,360
uh,

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,120
knowledge that you have and make
things much more smooth and,

64
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,051
and,

65
00:02:55,051 --> 00:02:55,884
uh,

66
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,410
and anxiety free.

67
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,590
So attention really attention really
plays a huge role in regulating anxiety.
