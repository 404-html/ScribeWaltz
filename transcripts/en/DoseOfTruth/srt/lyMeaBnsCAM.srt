1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,551
Okay.

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,384
So

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,310
now there's an idea that's,

4
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:19,410
that's reflected in the
Jacob's ladder story,

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:24,950
that the center where you put the pillar
is also the place where heaven and

6
00:00:25,501 --> 00:00:26,430
earth touch.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,073
And so that's,

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,140
that's a complicated idea
I think that you can,

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,080
you know,

10
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,430
I'm trying to look at these stories
from a psychological perspective.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,720
And so then you could say that that's a
symbolic place where the lowest and the

12
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:41,280
highest come together.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,970
And so it's a place where earthly being
stretches up to the highest possible

14
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:49,830
ethical abstraction.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,340
And that's the center because one
of the things that defines us say,

16
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:56,730
as opposed to them,

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,780
is that we're all United
within a certain ethic.

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,210
That's what makes us the same.

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,230
This is a complicated line of reasoning,

20
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,523
but

21
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:12,420
I'll go back to it after I
show you some more pictures.

22
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:12,601
But,

23
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:13,051
so that's,

24
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:17,820
that's the first idea is that the center
is the place where the lowest and the

25
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:19,650
highest touch simultaneously.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
And so you could say that in some sense
it specifies the aim of a group of

27
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:24,630
people.

28
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,463
That's another way.

29
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,220
You know,

30
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,590
if you get together with
people to make a group,

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,851
even at work,

32
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:34,200
you group yourself around a project
and that unites you and it unites you

33
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,490
because you all have the same aim.

34
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:37,380
You're all pointing to the same thing.

35
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,570
And that makes you the same in some ways.

36
00:01:39,571 --> 00:01:42,120
Because if you're after
the same thing I am,

37
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,360
then the same things are going to be
important to you that are important to me.

38
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,301
And the same things,

39
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:49,050
they're going to be negative to you that
are negative to me because our emotions

40
00:01:49,051 --> 00:01:49,890
work out that way.

41
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,140
And that means I can
instantly predict you,

42
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,000
I know how you're going to behave.

43
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,290
And so our aim,

44
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,000
which is basically our ethical aim,

45
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:58,860
it's because we're aiming
at something better.

46
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,930
At least in principle,

47
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,400
we're aiming at something better.

48
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,950
It's our ethical aim that
unites our perceptions.

49
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,780
And that's what aligns or emotions.

50
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,760
And so that sort of begs the question,

51
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:13,140
if you're going to build a community
around what aim should the community

52
00:02:13,141 --> 00:02:14,010
congregate?

53
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:14,941
Okay.

54
00:02:14,941 --> 00:02:16,830
So the idea here is that the coe,

55
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,710
the center of the community is the
pillar that Unites Heaven and earth.

56
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:21,450
So it unites the lowest with the highest.

57
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,690
So there's some intimation of the idea
that it's the highest that unites the

58
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:27,564
community.

59
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,501
Okay.

60
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:30,150
And so keep that in mind.

61
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000
And that's a very old idea as well.

62
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,010
That's the idea of the access Monday,

63
00:02:35,011 --> 00:02:37,710
which is the center pole
that unites having an earth.

64
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,420
It's an unbelievably old idea.

65
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,310
Tens of thousands of years old.

66
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,720
It might even stretch back to
whatever our archaic memories,

67
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,520
Quasi Memories,

68
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,090
I dunno how what you would describe them
archetipal memories of are excessively

69
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:54,930
old ancestry and trees.

70
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,930
When the tree itself was in fact the
center of the world and that it was ringed

71
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:01,540
by snakes and chaos.

72
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:05,440
And so while we have no idea
how old these ideas are,

73
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,221
but they're very,

74
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,790
very old and evolution is
a conservative business.

75
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,710
Once it builds a gadget,

76
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:16,510
then it builds new things on top of
that gadgets like a medieval town.

77
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,540
The center of the town
is really old and new,

78
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,870
newer areas of the town
get built around it.

79
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,530
But the center is still really old.

80
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:26,050
And that's what we're like,

81
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,913
you know,

82
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:27,370
our,

83
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:27,760
our,

84
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,900
our platforms like our,

85
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,630
our basic physiological structure,

86
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,040
this,

87
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,040
this skeletal body is some tens of
millions of years old or older than that.

88
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:39,730
If you think about vertebrates,

89
00:03:39,731 --> 00:03:40,810
it's much older than that.

90
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,280
And that's all conserved.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,930
So everything's built on
top of everything else.

92
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:47,531
All right,

93
00:03:47,531 --> 00:03:48,070
so there,

94
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:52,480
there's a kind of a classic
town and there's the idea,

95
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,141
I showed you this,

96
00:03:53,141 --> 00:03:54,760
this Scandinavian world tree,

97
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:58,600
same idea at Unites Heaven and earth
and around the roots of that tree are

98
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:00,970
snakes that eat this tree constantly.

99
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:03,940
So that's the idea that there's stability,

100
00:04:03,941 --> 00:04:07,360
but there's constant transformation
around that stability.

101
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,310
And at the same time,

102
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,910
the snakes are knowing in the roots
there's streams that are nourishing it.

103
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,110
So it's sort of,

104
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,460
it's sort of an echo of the idea that
life depends on death and renewal

105
00:04:18,461 --> 00:04:22,840
constantly because your cells are
dying and being renewed constantly.

106
00:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,290
Right?

107
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,180
If they are just proliferating,

108
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:26,140
then you have cancer.

109
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,280
If they're just dying,

110
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,650
then you dye it.

111
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,940
You have to get the balance
between death and life.

112
00:04:30,941 --> 00:04:31,810
Exactly right.

113
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,190
So that you can actually live,

114
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,080
which is also a very strange thing.

115
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:36,550
So,

116
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:40,930
and that tree is something that reaches
from the bottom layers of being maybe

117
00:04:40,931 --> 00:04:43,120
the microcosm all the
way to the macrocosm.

118
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,231
That's the idea.

119
00:04:44,231 --> 00:04:45,064
Anyways,

120
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,080
so then there's,

121
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:47,321
okay,

122
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:48,154
so there's,

123
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,570
there's uh,

124
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,360
Jacob and his and his pillar.

125
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,480
He's got this idea that you can
mark the center with this stone.

126
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,240
Like it's sort of symbolizes what
he was laying on when he dreamt,

127
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,260
but now he's got this idea,

128
00:04:59,261 --> 00:05:04,261
you put something erect and it marks the
center and it symbolizes his vision of

129
00:05:05,081 --> 00:05:06,100
the highest good,

130
00:05:06,101 --> 00:05:09,520
something like that and the
promise that's being made to him.

131
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:12,610
And then this is an Egyptian obelisk,

132
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,410
the pyramid on top of it.

133
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,460
Um,

134
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,330
that's in Paris.

135
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:18,610
It was taken from Luxor
and it put in Paris.

136
00:05:18,611 --> 00:05:22,870
And so that's a much more sophisticated

137
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,770
instance of the same idea.

138
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:27,551
Okay.

139
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:32,170
And there was a stone age cultures
across Eurasia that put up these huge

140
00:05:32,171 --> 00:05:33,340
obelisks everywhere.

141
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:33,911
These huge,

142
00:05:33,911 --> 00:05:35,890
like the Stonehenge is
a good example of that.

143
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,480
Although it's,

144
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,180
it's very sophisticated and
there are also markers of places.

145
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,070
We don't know exactly
what their function is,

146
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:46,930
but they're very much akin to this
some permanent marker of place.
