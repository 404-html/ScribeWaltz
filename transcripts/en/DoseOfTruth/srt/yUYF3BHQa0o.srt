1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:10,370
It certainly raised a specter
in the back of people's minds.

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:11,450
And this he is,

3
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:12,763
um,

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:13,920
what,

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:14,840
what are the rules?

6
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,550
Who,

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,550
who gets punished when they fail and who
doesn't and what is too big to fail me?

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,230
Like I think you could reverse that.

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,480
So big failure is inevitable.

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:28,310
That's a really good rule of thumb.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:29,870
Okay.

12
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:30,171
No.

13
00:00:30,171 --> 00:00:31,360
Like I,

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,630
I think both the left and the right
haven't seen that cause the left things,

15
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:38,540
well big corporations
back and the right things,

16
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:39,920
big government bad.

17
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,440
And maybe you should just think big,

18
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:43,813
bad,

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,770
too many eggs in one basket.

20
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:48,020
So it goes against the
principle of diversification.

21
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,071
And so,

22
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:50,570
and I think there's
some real truth in this.

23
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:52,700
I think that as things get large,

24
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,770
they turned into cyclops,

25
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,120
let lumbering one,

26
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:57,770
I giant there,

27
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,210
they can't see worth a damn.

28
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,530
There's single minded which makes them
really narrow and they lumber around

29
00:01:03,531 --> 00:01:06,530
stepping on things accidentally
until they fall off things,

30
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,190
you know?

31
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:07,970
And that's the right,

32
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,160
I think that's the right
model for a giant system.

33
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:12,770
That's why we have the image
of the giant site logs.

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,641
It's,

35
00:01:13,641 --> 00:01:13,941
you know,

36
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:18,170
it's single mindedness turned
into gigantism and it's risky.

37
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,170
So should we bail out these big companies?

38
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,640
Okay.

39
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,880
There's something about that
that seems radically unfair.

40
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:29,083
So,

41
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:29,760
uh,

42
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,220
but I don't know what to do about that,

43
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:34,370
except to note that big in and of itself

44
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,830
is troublesome.
