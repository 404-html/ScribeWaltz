1
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:09,710
It is gradually become clear to me what
every Greek philosophy up until now has

2
00:00:10,121 --> 00:00:15,121
consisted of namely the concession of
its originator and the species of

3
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:19,210
involuntary and unconscious
autobiography.

4
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,650
Well,
that's deceptive.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,030
That's the deceptively simple sentence.
Even though it's not a particularly

6
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:31,460
simple sentence because it stands on its
head.

7
00:00:31,461 --> 00:00:35,410
What people generally assume about the
process of thinking.

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,630
You generally think that when you're
thinking,

9
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:41,750
you're thinking about,
as I mentioned before,

10
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:46,260
the structure of the objective world
need is making an entirely different

11
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:51,261
point here and what he's fundamentally
doing is treating the philosopher not as

12
00:00:52,141 --> 00:00:54,360
a rational being,
but as a living being,

13
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:58,770
and there's a big difference between
being a rational being and being a

14
00:00:58,771 --> 00:01:01,230
living being.
Because if you're living being your

15
00:01:01,231 --> 00:01:04,620
primary goal is to do whatever it is
that furthers your life and if you're a

16
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:07,200
rational being,
then your primary goal is to do whatever

17
00:01:07,201 --> 00:01:09,900
it is that a rational being.
Mike Do,

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:14,760
and you could say that a living being
should first and foremost be a rational

19
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:19,140
being and in some sense that's the
message of the of the Western

20
00:01:19,141 --> 00:01:22,440
enlightenment.
But it's by no means self evident that

21
00:01:22,441 --> 00:01:25,510
that's the case and it's certainly not
something that Nietzsche Nietzsche,

22
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,720
who doesn't believe that people are
rational beings,

23
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,840
certainly not primarily,
and more importantly,

24
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:33,810
he isn't exactly convinced that they
should be so.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,550
So for example,
one of niches,

26
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:40,551
most famous maximums is that truth
serves life and that's a very difficult

27
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,130
different idea.
Then the purpose of truth ses,

28
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,550
the accurate representation of the
objective world.

29
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,790
Those aren't the same thing at all.
Now you could ask,

30
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:52,470
well,
what does it mean for truth to serve

31
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:55,050
life?
And if you construe truth that way,

32
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:58,950
what would truly look like?
And you know the mere statement that

33
00:01:58,951 --> 00:02:03,270
truths should serve life doesn't offer
you the answers to those questions,

34
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,373
but

35
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:08,470
what did?
It's the beginning of a different

36
00:02:08,471 --> 00:02:11,770
metaphysics and in some sense of
metaphysics,

37
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:16,771
which is say the universe within which a
philosopher might operate a metaphysics

38
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:22,230
is the initial structure of
presuppositions within which a view of

39
00:02:23,831 --> 00:02:28,831
the world is organized.
One presupposition might be human beings

40
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:35,781
are rational and that we're attempting
to formulate and improve our sense of

41
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:39,100
the objective world,
our formulation for the objective world,

42
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:43,540
and another would be that you would be
aren't rational or irrational and that

43
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,820
we're.
What we're motivated to do is to live

44
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,690
whatever that means and that the purpose
of our thinking and our philosophy

45
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:53,550
should be to facilitate our living.
And that's niches.

46
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:58,620
That's one of the foundation
blocks of philosophy.

47
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,810
So He's a moral philosopher
fundamentally because morality is about

48
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:08,410
values and the values.
Essentially values are

49
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:11,970
you could say values are what you aim
for,

50
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:16,050
but it's more complicated than that.
Values actually constitute the lens

51
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:19,440
through which you view the world.
So it's partly what you're aiming at,

52
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:23,280
but it's also partly your conception of
who you are now and where you are.

53
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:28,170
And it's also partly your conception of
how you're going to get to where it is

54
00:03:28,171 --> 00:03:33,171
that you want to be.
And it's also partly the psychological

55
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:38,220
system that you use to parse up the
world so that it reveals to you the

56
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,670
pathway that you could take to get to
what you want,

57
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,180
values,
all of that,

58
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,570
and then it's more than that because you
could say that you have added value

59
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,660
which contains all of that,
but then you can say that you have a set

60
00:03:49,661 --> 00:03:52,000
of values which is the arrangement of
all of that out,

61
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:55,020
and then you could say that you have a
set of values that's the range,

62
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:57,580
but of all that,
that you have to arrange with other

63
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:02,080
people and then you could say that you
have all that and you have to arrange it

64
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:05,110
with other people and you have to
arrange it across different spans of

65
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,590
time because what you want today and
what you want next week and what you

66
00:04:08,591 --> 00:04:12,820
want next month are not necessarily the
same thing and one does not necessarily

67
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:16,090
lead into the other.
So to be a moral philosopher is to

68
00:04:16,091 --> 00:04:20,920
examine how that,
what that system is and how it operates

69
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:22,240
and how it came about.
Now,

70
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:26,170
one of the things that need to says is
it has gradually become clear to me what

71
00:04:26,171 --> 00:04:30,190
every Greek philosophy up until now is
consisted of namely the confession of

72
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,610
its originator and the species of
involuntary and unconscious

73
00:04:33,611 --> 00:04:36,880
autobiography.
So his claim fundamentally is that no

74
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:40,150
matter what the philosopher thinks he's
doing well,

75
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:44,890
he's reading philosophy.
What he's actually doing is revealing

76
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,290
and articulating his being,

77
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,830
and then you might say,
well,

78
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,460
where did that come from?
And the answer to that is,

79
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,010
well,
partly it's you could consider it a

80
00:04:56,011 --> 00:04:59,420
biological function.
In so far as that we have value

81
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,920
structures that are built into us that
are the process.

82
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,950
We would say the process of a very long
evolutionary history,

83
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:10,340
but because you're also a cultural
phenomena and because the manner in

84
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:14,850
which you've arranged your values and
your desires has been conditioned to the

85
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:19,851
last degree by the process of
enculturation that you were subjected to

86
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,323
when you

87
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,390
confessed and an autobiographical manner
and articulate that what you're also

88
00:05:28,391 --> 00:05:33,391
doing is really capitulating the entire
structure of your culture.

89
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,140
It's in you and you might say,
well,

90
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:38,080
where is it in you?
In that and what does it you mean,

91
00:05:38,081 --> 00:05:43,081
part of it means is that you act out a
pattern of behavior and that pattern of

92
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:48,361
behavior is like a dance that someone is
manifesting to a symphonic score.

93
00:05:48,641 --> 00:05:53,641
It's unbelievably complicated and it has
its psychological elements and some of

94
00:05:54,161 --> 00:05:55,810
those are conscious and some of them
aren't.

95
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,910
Some of them are just implicit,
embedded in the way you act and the way

96
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:03,290
you perceive and what the philosopher is
attempting to do is to reveal those to

97
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:08,120
himself and to articulate them so that
the entire structure can be analyzed

98
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,710
well.
So niches.

99
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:14,630
First proposition is that when a
philosopher is thinking that what he's

100
00:06:14,631 --> 00:06:17,840
doing is not thinking,
it's revealing himself and an

101
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:21,650
autobiographical sense under the guise
of rational thinking and so then it

102
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:26,651
becomes something more like a story and
well,

103
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,290
any covers all that in the first two
phrases.

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,520
So that gives you some example,
some indication of what this book is

105
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:34,940
like.
