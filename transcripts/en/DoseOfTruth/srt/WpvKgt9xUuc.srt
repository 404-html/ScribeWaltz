1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:10,150
How does one save a marriage when it
seems that there is no longer attraction

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:11,700
both physically and intellectually?

3
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,750
There are kids involved,

4
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,240
which is the main reason for
wanting to save the marriage.

5
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:16,763
Huh?

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,693
Well,

7
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:18,540
all right.

8
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,160
I know a couple of things about that.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:20,941
I mean,

10
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:25,941
the first thing I would say is that if
you haven't had any intimate interaction

11
00:00:26,941 --> 00:00:29,250
with one another for quite
a long period of time,

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,640
that can put both people into a stagnant
state where desire starts to slip away.

13
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:36,360
What,

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,340
what sex therapists recommend under
such conditions is to while essentially

15
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:42,720
start in some way,

16
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:43,920
start dating again.

17
00:00:43,921 --> 00:00:47,250
So you could ask your partner to go
out to a movie or something like that.

18
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:48,330
And you know,

19
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:50,940
maybe when you come home you could,

20
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,510
you could neck for a little while.

21
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,440
Like teenagers,

22
00:00:55,441 --> 00:00:57,960
that's probably a word
that no one uses anymore,

23
00:00:57,961 --> 00:01:00,750
but kind of pull back
and you got to agree,

24
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:01,710
say not to,

25
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,640
um,

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,120
engage in full sexual
activity for a while,

27
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,190
but to tease each other and to play a bit.

28
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:10,410
Even if you're not attracted,

29
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:11,390
you have to act,

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,240
act it out for awhile and hopefully
you can get the motor running again.

31
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:20,550
The other thing I would say is that you
guys might want to sit down and make a

32
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:21,630
joint plan.

33
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:23,370
It's like what?

34
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,570
Cause I,

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,570
a marriage is like a story that two people
are acting out simultaneously and you

36
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:34,641
have to have shared goals and because
you're both rowing the same boat,

37
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,331
let's say,

38
00:01:36,331 --> 00:01:38,880
and if you don't have
a destination in mind,

39
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:39,570
then,

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,250
well maybe you're rowing in circles
or maybe you're just standing still.

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:49,620
So I would say work hard to put some
romance back in the relationship.

42
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:49,861
You know,

43
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,960
you could say to each other,

44
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,211
look,

45
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,850
let's try this for six months
and just see how it goes.

46
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,330
We'll have two dates a
week for the first month.

47
00:01:57,331 --> 00:01:58,320
We won't have any sex,

48
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,540
but we'll play around and then,

49
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,111
you know,

50
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:02,580
we'll see how that goes and,

51
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:02,970
and,

52
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,170
but we'll try it out for the,

53
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,321
for,

54
00:02:05,321 --> 00:02:06,180
for the whole,

55
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,340
for the whole six months.

56
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,000
Um,

57
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,890
there are reasons to save a marriage.

58
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:11,131
I mean,

59
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,210
it's hard on kids.

60
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,870
Divorce is really hard on kids and
it's hard on the adults involved too.

61
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,460
Um,

62
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:17,791
so,

63
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,450
uh,

64
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,283
I would say

65
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,800
you have to negotiate
an agreement and you,

66
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:25,580
you know,

67
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,330
you could try the future
authoring program,

68
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:27,841
both of you.

69
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,640
What I would recommend for example,

70
00:02:29,641 --> 00:02:32,490
is that you each do the future
authoring program separately.

71
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,020
So that's that self authoring.com cause
then you both have a life plan and then

72
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:42,021
you could sit down and read each other's
future authoring plans and see if you

73
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:45,780
have some things in common and then see
if you can figure out how to support

74
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:49,950
each other with regards to each
of you obtaining what you want.
