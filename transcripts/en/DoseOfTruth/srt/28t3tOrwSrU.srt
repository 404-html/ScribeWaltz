1
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,650
So we had our panel discussion on the
stifling of free speech and university

2
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:15,651
campuses November 11 with doctor sad and
doctor Mfa and it was a capacity crowd,

3
00:00:17,821 --> 00:00:21,420
1500 it was sold out and there was people
that came from all over Canada and the

4
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,910
u s even some people from Europe.

5
00:00:23,911 --> 00:00:24,870
Surprisingly.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:30,270
And I guess you and I chatted about this
before that I was really surprised at

7
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:35,271
the absolute lack of any mainstream
media coverage of an issue that is very

8
00:00:36,151 --> 00:00:40,590
important for our times and the fact that
it was the largest such event held in

9
00:00:40,591 --> 00:00:41,424
Canada.

10
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,680
So I'm surprised about it,

11
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:45,390
but you didn't seem so surprised about it.

12
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:46,224
Why is that?

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,533
Well,

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,580
but not really surprised,

15
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:52,070
I would say at the moment
by anything that happens,

16
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,710
let's say in that conventional media.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:55,820
Um,

18
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,200
I think that what's happened to
large degree is that the people,

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,350
the journalists who operate in that
sphere have started confusing themselves

20
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:07,580
with the newsmakers themselves.

21
00:01:07,581 --> 00:01:12,230
And so they feel in some sense like
they should be leading the narrative,

22
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:14,000
let's say instead of saying we get,

23
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:16,460
and so if an event occurs,

24
00:01:16,461 --> 00:01:19,070
that's outside of what they assume.

25
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,181
I mean,

26
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,210
we're painting this with a broad brush
because there's obviously journalists who

27
00:01:23,211 --> 00:01:24,590
don't fit into this category.

28
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:25,610
Um,

29
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:28,220
but if it doesn't fall under their

30
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,780
fall under the guidelines
of their a priori story,

31
00:01:32,781 --> 00:01:34,340
then it isn't news.

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,370
And all that's happening as
a consequence of that though,

33
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:38,091
I think Serena,

34
00:01:38,091 --> 00:01:40,820
is that they're the mainstream media,

35
00:01:40,821 --> 00:01:41,511
so to speak,

36
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:45,260
is dooming itself to irrelevancy
at an unbelievably rapid rate.

37
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,363
See that with,

38
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,030
uh,

39
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,900
certainly,

40
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,380
um,

41
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,630
American news newspapers,

42
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:56,040
which are now being replaced because
people are tuning into social media to get

43
00:01:56,041 --> 00:01:56,874
their news.

44
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,350
Uh,

45
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,570
and a lot of people say they don't even
actually trust mainstream journalists

46
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:00,931
anymore,

47
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:05,640
which is a sad statement because media
is such an important aspect of any

48
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:06,810
democratic society.

49
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:07,540
Yeah.

50
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:07,691
Well,

51
00:02:07,691 --> 00:02:09,820
it's become democratized in a big way.

52
00:02:09,821 --> 00:02:11,560
And so maybe this is for the best,

53
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:12,430
it's hard to say.

54
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,150
Um,

55
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:14,530
there'll be pros and cons.

56
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,310
I mean,

57
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:16,143
I've had,

58
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:21,130
I can't complain about my treatment at
the hands of the media over the last year

59
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,971
in general,

60
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:22,271
though,

61
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:22,630
I mean,

62
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,970
there's been a lot of like post media,

63
00:02:24,971 --> 00:02:29,260
the entire post media group of about 250
newspapers came out in support of what

64
00:02:29,261 --> 00:02:34,261
I was doing and Margaret went to and
Christie Blatchford and Conrad Black and

65
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:35,331
are two,

66
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:37,720
so em to Nela and a whole array of,

67
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,810
of journalists have been
very forceful advocates,

68
00:02:40,811 --> 00:02:42,190
I would say for free speech.

69
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:44,230
So we also want to keep that in mind,

70
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:44,681
right?

71
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:45,461
Absolutely.

72
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:46,210
Absolutely.
