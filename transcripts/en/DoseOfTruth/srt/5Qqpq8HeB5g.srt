1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Wow,

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,910
there was one very important thing that
had happened to me when I was 16 years

3
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:13,970
old,
even though I was the popular kid in my

4
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:16,380
school.
They voted me for two years in a row,

5
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,180
the chairman of the programming
committee,

6
00:00:18,181 --> 00:00:22,440
which means I ran student assemblies
five days a week and I program to a

7
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:23,290
week.
Um,

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,090
so I was the emcee for these things.
And one day the Jews.

9
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:30,150
Did you manage that and simultaneously
be unpopular?

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,070
Uh,
that's a good question.

11
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,220
I think my school had very school was
school,

12
00:00:35,221 --> 00:00:40,080
was founded by an Acolyte of John Dewey
and he was behind the scenes actually

13
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,590
setting the school law and it,
you know,

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,510
schools have their popularity positions,
president,

15
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:47,070
vice president,
secretary,

16
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:48,420
treasurer,
all of that.

17
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,720
But my school was clever enough to start
putting functional team committees

18
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,220
together.
In your very first days at school,

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,550
your very first day,
a,

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:58,480
were a freshman year.

21
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:03,290
Now when you,
when you have kids vote for president

22
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:06,470
and vice president or an vote for the
most popular kid in the school as the

23
00:01:06,471 --> 00:01:08,870
precedent.
The second most popular kid as vice

24
00:01:08,871 --> 00:01:12,020
president,
the most popular girl as secretary and

25
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:15,170
the most popular Jewish treasurer.
That's just the way it goes.

26
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,470
Um,
so I was never aligned for any of those

27
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,750
positions.
I had no popularity whatsoever.

28
00:01:20,751 --> 00:01:23,750
In fact,
one of my classmates actually fired with

29
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:28,310
remarkable accuracy from only 23 d way a
soccer ball directly into my face.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,690
And believe me,
it has a lot of force distance of 20

31
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,760
feet.
So,

32
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,710
but when it comes to functional
positions,

33
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:39,230
like how do we run these school
assemblies?

34
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,700
The popular kids don't have a clue.
So if you bring them into a room,

35
00:01:43,701 --> 00:01:45,410
if there arbitrarily,
for example,

36
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:47,110
assigned to a committee,
um,

37
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:50,500
they will all piss on there a little
piece of territory.

38
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,420
They'll all stake out a position of some
kind just to establish their status in

39
00:01:55,421 --> 00:01:57,490
the room.
And after 15 minutes.

40
00:01:57,491 --> 00:01:59,960
So this one,
they've all said their piece and it

41
00:01:59,961 --> 00:02:02,690
comes time to actually do something.
They are clueless,

42
00:02:02,691 --> 00:02:04,700
they're silent,
they don't know what to do.

43
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,580
And if there is an unpopular geek like
me,

44
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,970
who at that 20 minute mark all of a
sudden has an idea,

45
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,330
they will glom around you even if they
don't like you.

46
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,640
Right?
So.

47
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,060
So yeah.
So competence can,

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,870
can,
can,

49
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:20,870
can step in where we're popularity
cannot go.

50
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,260
Yes.
That's a very well put phrase.

51
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:26,000
So,
so there I was the head of this

52
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:28,550
programming committee and one of the
kid,

53
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:31,280
one of the juniors came to me and said
we're doing a dance.

54
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:32,570
We're,
you know,

55
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:35,810
we're setting up a dance and could you
advertise it for us?

56
00:02:35,811 --> 00:02:38,960
And he didn't realize just how absurd
that statement was.

57
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,470
If there's a dance or a party of any
kind in buffalo,

58
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,210
New York,
one of the first things you have to

59
00:02:44,211 --> 00:02:48,020
realize about it is I am not just
disinvited.

60
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:53,590
I haven't invited to stay as far away as
humanly possible and yet they want me to

61
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:56,570
advertise this dance.
So Jordan,

62
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:57,800
I can't dance.
I am,

63
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,610
I can't do a box step.
I can't do a Fox trot,

64
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:02,920
I can't do a waltz,
I can't do any of those things.

65
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,330
But I went onstage and put some music on
the turntable and danced,

66
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,680
and I saw the pupils dilating of the
audience.

67
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:15,040
Three hundred 50 people who hated me and
hated me for two and a half years.

68
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,320
At that point,
their pupils were dilating,

69
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:21,880
their faces were melting.
I felt that pseudopod at vantage coming

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,310
to me and through me as if I were a
pipe.

71
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,610
I felt it going up to something inside
of me more or less.

72
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,610
It had level that utterly transmogrified
it and I felt the energy being sent back

73
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:36,760
through every move that I was making an
I had an outer body experience.

74
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,730
I saw,
I thought I was on the ceiling.

75
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:44,890
I've watched all of this from the
ceiling and it apparently it looked like

76
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:49,891
a loony toon drawn on Lsd as if Chuck
Jones had been doing Tom and Jerry after

77
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:54,880
taking a very big hit of acid.
It was one of the strangest,

78
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:57,910
weirdest things you've ever seen and
when it was all over.

79
00:03:58,390 --> 00:04:01,180
So that was my ecstatic experience.
When it was all over,

80
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,350
the audience did something.
It had never done in my days at school,

81
00:04:04,351 --> 00:04:06,490
I would never do again,
so long as I was there,

82
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,810
it surged to the foot of the stage and
as if it had practice this act all its

83
00:04:10,811 --> 00:04:12,970
life,
it picked me up off the stage,

84
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,170
it put me on his shoulders,
it carried me out of the auditorium and

85
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:21,580
it carried me up the pathway to the
building above where we had our classes.

86
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,800
So that was my introduction.
Yeah.

87
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,130
And,
but this is a crazy story,

88
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:30,030
right?
And this is three years after I'd gone

89
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,240
off after the ecstatic experience
knowing that it was something vital.

90
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,860
I mean,
I'd heard at the age of 14,

91
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,530
two years earlier,
I had heard that there was a book called

92
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:43,090
the varieties of religious experience.
And in those days we had no Amazon.

93
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,650
We had local bookstores and local
bookstores in Buffalo.

94
00:04:47,651 --> 00:04:48,640
I mean,
give me a break.

95
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,900
Um,
but I finally found a copy at the

96
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,600
University of Buffalo Bookstore and it
felt as if William James had been laying

97
00:04:55,660 --> 00:05:00,660
out a series of examples of the ecstatic
experience with all of its delusions and

98
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:06,610
hallucinations.
And all the rest on the laboratory bench

99
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,770
and then saying to me,
look,

100
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,040
you're coming along,
70 years later you're going to have

101
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:16,030
scientific tools that I did not have.
This is your job.

102
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,670
And it was my job,
not just because William James was

103
00:05:18,671 --> 00:05:22,090
giving it to me because something deep
inside of him he was crying out to

104
00:05:22,091 --> 00:05:22,990
understand it.

105
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:28,230
And it probably was that the privilege
of social disconnection,

106
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,490
the privilege of social deprivation,
because that privilege made me sensitive

107
00:05:33,491 --> 00:05:35,950
and it's always made me sensitive to
group behavior.

108
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:41,290
So when I was in Moscow in 2005
lecturing a group of quantum physicists

109
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:45,580
from all over the world on why
everything you know about quantum

110
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:48,340
physics does wrong.
It's because there is no such thing as

111
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:51,370
an isolated particle.
Every particle is part of our herd,

112
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,680
a mob,
a group of some kind.

113
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,000
Um,
the,

114
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,920
a lot of quantum physicists on the idea
that when you,

115
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:03,140
when you treat a Photon,
a single photon in a certain way,

116
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:05,760
when you split it into here's how it's
going to be,

117
00:06:05,761 --> 00:06:08,480
hey,
but if it's being measured,

118
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,250
that's not going to happen.
Well,

119
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:12,530
guess what,
we're constantly taking each other's

120
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:15,110
measure.
Photons are constantly taking each

121
00:06:15,111 --> 00:06:16,880
other's measure because they move in
groups,

122
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:17,870
crowds and herds.

123
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,080
That's why a beam of sunshine comes
through your window,

124
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:25,610
not a photon of sunshine.
And when I finished the speech,

125
00:06:25,611 --> 00:06:29,780
I was sure they were gonna throw me out
of the conference because these are all

126
00:06:29,781 --> 00:06:33,860
people committed deeply to quantum
physics and instead they sat there

127
00:06:33,861 --> 00:06:38,330
beaming like a proud uncles and I could
not figure out why.

128
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:43,331
And three years later my collaborator in
quantum physics at the university at the

129
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,500
[inaudible] Institute of Applied
Mathematics,

130
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:49,340
so the Russian Academy of Sciences in
Moscow Senate email and he said,

131
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,910
Dr,
use your club who ran that conference

132
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:55,100
and gave you such a hard time about your
credit card.

133
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:58,460
Has just published a book.
It's a new approach to quantum physics.

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,210
It's called constructive of physics.
You have to get it immediately.

135
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:07,310
So I downloaded it from arcserve org.
I listened to it that afternoon on my

136
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,090
hour and a half walk through the park on
my way to the cafe where I do all my

137
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:14,900
work and I got all excited.
Every social concept.

138
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:20,170
That means every concept that I had
given in this talk was in this book.

139
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,200
So Jordan,
I've had the privilege of proceedings

140
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:29,360
through life with this enormous
advantage social deprivation.
