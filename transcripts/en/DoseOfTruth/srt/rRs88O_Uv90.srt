1
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,590
Cause there's a limit to your strengths,

2
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,560
but God only knows to some
degree what that limit is.

3
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:11,801
You know,

4
00:00:11,801 --> 00:00:13,510
people can be unbelievably tough,

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,130
unbelievably tough.

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,780
And I think it's even the more admirable
for human beings to be tough because

7
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,670
we're so conscious of how we can be
hurt and we're so conscious of what that

8
00:00:24,671 --> 00:00:25,870
hurt can lead to.

9
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:26,650
You know,

10
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:29,980
you can have your family taken away
from you and you can be destroyed.

11
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:33,010
And the fact that you can be
courageous in the face of that at all,

12
00:00:33,011 --> 00:00:35,440
it's something that is
absolutely unbelievable,

13
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,101
right?

14
00:00:36,101 --> 00:00:37,690
And people deserve a lot more credit,

15
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:40,360
I think then people give themselves,

16
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,390
because the fact that we can be honorable
under conditions of life and death,

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:46,901
right?

18
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:47,531
Of suffering.

19
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:48,160
That's,

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,410
that's a testament to the human spirit.

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:55,360
And there's a profound anti-human ethos,

22
00:00:55,361 --> 00:00:56,860
I think that pervades our culture.

23
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,080
You know,

24
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,010
that considers human beings
cancer's on the planet,

25
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:00,850
something like that,

26
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:01,540
you know,

27
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:02,860
and that there should be less of us.

28
00:01:02,861 --> 00:01:07,720
It's the same spirit that motivated the
guy who wrote the book about it better

29
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,680
to have never been.

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:09,280
It's like,

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,390
I don't see it that way.

32
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:10,601
You know?

33
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:11,260
I mean,

34
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,420
I think people do pretty well for,

35
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:14,681
you know,

36
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:17,980
for having their leg caught in a bear
trap and their head caught in a vice,

37
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:21,040
they're actually doing pretty
well because life is really hard.

38
00:01:21,041 --> 00:01:25,030
And the fact that we're not absolutely
brutal and murderous all the time is

39
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:28,850
really something remarkable given
what we actually have to contend with,

40
00:01:28,851 --> 00:01:33,610
that we can go out of our way to be
honest and generous and altruistic and to

41
00:01:33,611 --> 00:01:34,630
care for each other.

42
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:34,890
Yeah.

43
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,250
Under unbelievably dire circumstances
and to act notably sometimes under the

44
00:01:39,251 --> 00:01:41,050
most trying conditions,

45
00:01:41,051 --> 00:01:41,291
you know,

46
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:43,390
and soldier Knutson's Gulag archipelago.

47
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:46,690
He tells story after story of
people who acted a bismuth Lee,

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,080
but also people who under
the worst threats imaginable,

49
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,550
never sacrifice their character and
know when reading about that is really,

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,540
while it really makes you wonder,

51
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,201
that's,

52
00:01:59,201 --> 00:02:00,100
that's what it does.
