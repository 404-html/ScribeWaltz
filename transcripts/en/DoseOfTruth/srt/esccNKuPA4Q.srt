00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:17,930
Dr Gears and thanks for
continuing this series,

2
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,130
even as atheists appreciate
the interaction and the,

3
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:22,964
uh,

4
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,190
the conversation.

5
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:30,820
I wanted to ask you something that is
both emotional and analytical because

6
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:34,430
oftentimes you're basically pigged,

7
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:35,343
um,

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:36,491
uh,

9
00:00:36,491 --> 00:00:38,120
seeing things very analytically.

10
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,610
So you were talking earlier about,

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,473
um,

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,780
you were talking about the,

13
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:44,170
the,

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,003
the,

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,920
the juxtaposition between happiness and,

16
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,843
um,

17
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:50,960
uh,

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,800
honor,

19
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,200
even though I don't think they're
mutually exclusive personally,

20
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,080
but if there's a situation,

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,651
let's say we're,

22
00:00:57,651 --> 00:01:02,651
someone is truly in love with someone
else and they loved them for many years

23
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:03,710
and decades.

24
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:07,190
They have a whole history
together and then someone,

25
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:10,190
and then one of the
people in this grouping,

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,473
um,

27
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,000
start falling in love with someone else.

28
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:19,880
So it's not that there's less
love for the original partner.

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,840
How analytically and emotionally do you,

30
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:24,950
uh,

31
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,950
take care of a situation like that when
you feel that you want to stay honorable

32
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,730
and be happy?

33
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:33,181
Okay.

34
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:36,330
So the first thing I would say is
the devil's always in the details,

35
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:37,351
right?

36
00:01:37,351 --> 00:01:42,351
So one of the things that I'm not happy
about with much modern moral theorizing

37
00:01:44,371 --> 00:01:47,610
is that it takes a story like that,

38
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,120
you know,

39
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,940
and then tries to extract out
of general moral principle.

40
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,970
And often that's impossible because the
particulars of the situation are very

41
00:01:56,311 --> 00:01:57,144
important.

42
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,980
But having said that,

43
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:00,301
all right,

44
00:02:00,301 --> 00:02:01,800
so let me think about that for a minute.

45
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,050
I'm not sure that it's possible to be
honorable in a situation like that because

46
00:02:07,051 --> 00:02:12,051
I think that you've acted out the
violation already and having acted out the

47
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:16,080
violation to confess it might
be the right thing to do,

48
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,580
although perhaps not,

49
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:18,601
you know,

50
00:02:18,601 --> 00:02:19,480
because if you,

51
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:23,100
it isn't obvious to me that if you'd be
traced someone then you get to have the

52
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,420
right to tell them about it.

53
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:25,830
I know,

54
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:26,340
I know.

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,001
I know you're not,

56
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:27,870
I understand that.

57
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,750
Yeah,

58
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,060
yeah,

59
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,550
yeah,

60
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,510
I understand.

61
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,373
I understand.

62
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,633
Um,

63
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:40,220
my observation has been that if there's
a tight relationship and if one party

64
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:42,510
has betrayed by the other in that manner,

65
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,450
that it's almost always irreconcilable.

66
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,210
It breaks it and all right.

67
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:49,441
You know,

68
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:49,740
I've,

69
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:52,980
I've helped people try to struggle
through that bolt on both sides of it.

70
00:02:52,981 --> 00:02:56,190
The person who was betrayed and
the person who did the betrayal.

71
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,420
Um,

72
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,070
I've seen people grow
up and not do it again.

73
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:02,740
And this was in situations
where their partner didn't know.

74
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,170
And in a couple of those situations,

75
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:09,760
it seemed to me that it might've even
been unnecessary learning experience for

76
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:10,930
the person who did it.

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:11,471
You know,

78
00:03:11,471 --> 00:03:11,640
it,

79
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,380
it,

80
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,690
it helped them develop.

81
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,600
That doesn't mean I'm justifying it,

82
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,670
but life is complicated.

83
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,803
But,

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,020
but I think that society works better.

85
00:03:25,021 --> 00:03:29,640
All things considered when you
make a promise and you stick to it.

86
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,940
And one of the things I
learned from reading young,

87
00:03:32,941 --> 00:03:33,270
which,

88
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,930
which I really liked was [inaudible].

89
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,440
Okay.

90
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:36,810
No,

91
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,200
he believed that he had his affairs too.

92
00:03:40,201 --> 00:03:42,690
So you might think about it
as somewhat hypocritical,

93
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:43,524
but,

94
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:48,090
but I think that people can make
mistakes without having what they think

95
00:03:48,091 --> 00:03:49,380
necessarily be wrong.

96
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:50,490
You know,

97
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,180
he said that there were things in a
marriage that you can't have unless you're

98
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:55,014
all in.

99
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:56,790
And I believe that.

100
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:57,930
I believe that.

101
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:02,130
And so if there's a back door
open or like to begin with,

102
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:03,540
or a backdoor opens,

103
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:07,590
then I think that there's something
about the relationship that is lacking at

104
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:08,011
least,

105
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:10,140
and I think you pay a big price for that.

106
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,641
So I mean,

107
00:04:11,641 --> 00:04:16,641
it depends on whether you regard a
marriage as a practical arrangement or a

108
00:04:16,921 --> 00:04:18,030
spiritual arrangement.

109
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,350
Now really it's both,

110
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,070
you know,

111
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,150
both are important,

112
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:25,800
but if it's a spiritual arrangement or
a psychological arrangement above all,

113
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,720
then I do think that

114
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,370
you don't get the transformation
without being all in.

115
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,510
And if you violate it,

116
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:36,270
then even if you can work
it out with your partner,

117
00:04:36,271 --> 00:04:40,230
there's something that you will
never get as a consequence.
