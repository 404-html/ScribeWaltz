1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,310
Who's the bird headed god of Egypt,

2
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:09,941
who I told you about,

3
00:00:09,941 --> 00:00:12,400
who represents the
capacity to pay attention.

4
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:17,500
Very important concept
because the Egyptians realized
and really it's brilliant.

5
00:00:17,501 --> 00:00:20,800
It is something modern people do
not understand cause we tend to make

6
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:23,170
rationality the highest God that's,

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,580
that's not a good thing.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,500
That's a pathway to totalitarianism.

9
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,540
What the Egyptians knew,

10
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,770
but they only knew it in symbolic form
was it was the capacity to attend to

11
00:00:32,771 --> 00:00:37,030
things that in some sense was the highest
psychological function because it's

12
00:00:37,031 --> 00:00:40,900
the capacity to pay attention
that actually moves you
beyond what you only know.

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,330
And rationality tends to make,

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:43,631
you know,

15
00:00:43,631 --> 00:00:45,520
integral systems that are coherent,

16
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,150
that are boxlike and then claim
that they're absolutely right.

17
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:52,390
Whereas the tension is always
looking beyond what you know.

18
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,200
And,

19
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,960
and attention is an
unbelievably powerful force.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,273
You know,

21
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,990
that's why advertisers pay for it.

22
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,760
That's why people demand it.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,650
That's why children can't live without it.

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,290
That's why it's what you want
from your friends and your family.

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:07,420
You want them to pay attention to you.

26
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,670
It's an unbelievably valuable resource.

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,490
And so one of the things
I always tell my clients,

28
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:13,031
for example,

29
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,260
if they're socially anxious,

30
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:14,501
I say,

31
00:01:14,501 --> 00:01:15,334
look,

32
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,000
pay more attention to the
person you're talking to.

33
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,170
If you pay,

34
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:22,420
if you really pay close attention to them,

35
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:25,360
then the thoughts that are making
you anxious will be suppressed.

36
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,670
And because you're paying
close attention to them,

37
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,780
you'll match your movements to theirs
and you'll match your conversation to

38
00:01:31,781 --> 00:01:32,290
them.

39
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:34,900
And then there's no reason for you
to be socially anxious cause socially

40
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:35,231
anxious.

41
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:36,940
People will go like this
when they're talking,

42
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:37,331
you know,

43
00:01:37,331 --> 00:01:39,190
they don't want look at you of course,

44
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,120
how the hell can you engage anyone if
you're not in a little dance with them,

45
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,291
you know you can't.

46
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,760
And a lot of it's non verbal,

47
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:50,710
it's physical and it's embodied and
without paying attention then you lose

48
00:01:50,711 --> 00:01:51,071
people.

49
00:01:51,071 --> 00:01:53,200
And you see this with
speakers all the time too.

50
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:54,400
There in front of audiences,

51
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,710
they have their paper and
they're going like this.

52
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,840
And usually they're talking like this too.

53
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,430
And you know the logical thing to do in
that case is like look at Facebook or

54
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,020
get the hell out of there something.

55
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,750
But they're not paying
attention to the audience,

56
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,550
and so there's no power in the,

57
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,670
there's no power in the
dynamic conversation at all.
