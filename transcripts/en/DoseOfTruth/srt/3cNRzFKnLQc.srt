1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:12,340
Assuming a minimal mutual willingness to
be any contact and to receive

2
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:16,010
communications,
we may say that the greater the

3
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:20,120
communicated congruence of experience,
awareness and behavior on the part of

4
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:22,970
one individual,
the more the ensuing relationship will

5
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:27,140
involve a tendency towards reciprocal
communication with the same qualities,

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,040
mutually accurate understanding of the
communications.

7
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,220
It probed psychological adjustment and
functioning in both parties and mutual

8
00:00:34,221 --> 00:00:37,380
satisfaction in the relationship.
Pretty good hypotheses.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,890
So basically what he's saying is that,

10
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,050
okay,

11
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:46,580
if we're communicating and I tell you
what's actually going on with me the

12
00:00:46,581 --> 00:00:50,210
best I possibly can and try to get rid
of all of the motives that have nothing

13
00:00:50,211 --> 00:00:55,010
to do with communication,
then that's going to work out quite

14
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:58,310
nicely in the long run.
It's gonna work out for both of us and

15
00:00:58,311 --> 00:01:01,160
for the relationship.
So like it's good.

16
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:03,020
It's an interesting hypothesis.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,240
I can tell you that people don't do
this.

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,790
You know,
I showed you that Gottman,

19
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:15,390
I don't know how many of you looked at
that blame the Godman studies on marital

20
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,290
satisfaction.
Right?

21
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,840
But I thought that was really
interesting because I've seen people

22
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:20,010
like that lots of times,
you know,

23
00:01:20,011 --> 00:01:23,220
they're on the surface,
everything's fine,

24
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:26,640
but well sometimes the tension is so
high,

25
00:01:26,641 --> 00:01:29,100
you can hardly even stand to be in the
room with the people you know,

26
00:01:29,101 --> 00:01:30,850
because you,
you can just add,

27
00:01:30,851 --> 00:01:31,490
add,
add,

28
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:35,520
add an embodied level,
you're mirroring the distress,

29
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:36,960
you know,
we get a pit in your stomach,

30
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:39,870
it's hard to breathe and you just know.
It's probably smell,

31
00:01:39,871 --> 00:01:42,960
I think is what it's trans as what it's
communicated by,

32
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,130
you know,
smell affects us and all sorts of ways

33
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:48,500
we don't understand.
So here,

34
00:01:48,501 --> 00:01:51,810
here's an example.
Women like the smell of tee shirts that

35
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:55,080
men wore if the men are symmetrical
better than if the men aren't

36
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,710
symmetrical.
So that's a good example of how smell

37
00:01:58,711 --> 00:02:00,570
affects you.
It affects you in lots of ways.

38
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:01,404
So anyways.

39
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,763
MMM.

40
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:09,500
What godman observed was that basically
that the capitals that weren't getting

41
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:11,120
along,
we're just lying to each other all the

42
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:11,960
time.
Right?

43
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:15,110
Because they were pretending that
everything was all right.

44
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,760
When in fact nothing was all right at
all.

45
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,280
Their bodies were going haywire.
That's a technical term haywire.

46
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,980
So it was way too stressful for them.
And you,

47
00:02:23,981 --> 00:02:24,621
you might say,
well,

48
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:27,380
why is that bad?
Why shouldn't you be like that?

49
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,330
Because that's a good question.
Well,

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,510
one is if your stress responses are to
elevated,

51
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,060
we know what happens.
That's the general I stress response.

52
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:38,900
Your cortisol levels go up and then well
then you age the fast.

53
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,140
So if you want to age fast,
that's a very good way of doing it.

54
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:46,430
But if that's not your goal,
your goal is peace and harmony.

55
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:51,170
Then pretending that everything's all
right without communicating isn't going

56
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:54,020
to work.
And so the couples aren't saying things

57
00:02:54,021 --> 00:02:57,110
like
there's something about the way we're

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,150
talking,
it's making me extremely nervous,

59
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,080
you know?
And then actually tried to figure that

60
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:02,771
out.
It's like,

61
00:03:02,771 --> 00:03:03,431
I wouldn't say,
well,

62
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,290
you're making me nervous because,
well,

63
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,640
maybe you are,
but maybe not.

64
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,950
Maybe I'm just a nervous type.
God only knows.

65
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,800
Let's see if we can sort this out.
Or maybe I'm nervous about something

66
00:03:11,801 --> 00:03:14,010
else completely.
You know,

67
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,460
maybe I'm nervous about women.

68
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,100
So there's lots of digging to do.
Okay.

69
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,020
So you can think about that and think,
well,

70
00:03:23,021 --> 00:03:26,140
is that a reasonable proposition now?

71
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:28,900
Okay,

72
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,520
you can try this.
This is an excellent,

73
00:03:30,521 --> 00:03:32,950
this is,
I'm not going to t tell you many

74
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:37,000
specific psychological exercises,
but this is a really good one.

75
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,523
It's hard to,

76
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:40,870
okay,

77
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:44,980
Rio communicational curves and the
evaluative tendency avoided when we

78
00:03:44,981 --> 00:03:49,870
listen with understanding.
So the evaluated Roger's theory is,

79
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,320
is difficult to understand with regards
to the relationship between the

80
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:57,520
evaluation and unconditional positive
regard because he tends to speak as if

81
00:03:57,521 --> 00:04:01,150
the valuation is bad.
But really what he means is hierarchical

82
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:04,810
elevate evaluation,
which is you're worse than me or I'm

83
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:07,780
better than you.
It's like those things might even be

84
00:04:07,781 --> 00:04:10,270
true in any given case,
but they're not relevant to what we're

85
00:04:10,271 --> 00:04:11,320
doing.
Right?

86
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,030
We're trying to do something,
I'll do it than that.

87
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:15,610
So when that creeps in,
I think of that as dominance,

88
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:16,660
hierarchy,
maneuvering,

89
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,940
not Africans all the time.
When people are talking,

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,010
you know,
they're just maneuvering around in a

91
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:22,870
dominance hierarchy.
They're not trying to communicate.

92
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:27,310
So that's the evaluative tendency.
What does this mean?

93
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:29,080
It means to see the expressed idea.

94
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:32,590
And attitude from the other person's
point of view to sense how it feels to

95
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:36,550
him to achieve his frame of reference in
regard to the thing he is talking about

96
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,900
stated so briefly.
This may sound absurdly simple,

97
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:43,900
but it is not.
It's an approach which we have found

98
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,120
extremely potent in the field of
psychotherapy.

99
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:49,690
It's the most effective agent we know
for altering the basic personality

100
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:53,470
structure of an individual and improving
his relationships and his communications

101
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:56,320
with others.
That's a quite the statement.

102
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,980
You know
the most effective agent we know for

103
00:04:59,981 --> 00:05:02,440
altering the basic personality structure
of an individual.

104
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,030
If I can listen to what he tells me,
if I can understand how it seems to him,

105
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,220
if I can see it's personal meaning for
him,

106
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,970
if I can sense the emotional flavor
which it has for him,

107
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:16,270
then I will be releasing potent forces
of change in him.

108
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,220
If I can really understand how he hates
his father or the university or

109
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,050
columnists,
if I can catch the flavor of this sphere

110
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:26,350
of insanity or his fear of atom bombs or
of Russia,

111
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:30,520
it will be of the greatest help to him
in altering those very hatreds and fears

112
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,060
and in establishing realistic and
harmonious relationships with the very

113
00:05:34,061 --> 00:05:37,810
people and situations towards which he
has felt hatred and fear.

114
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,260
We know from our research,
by the way,

115
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:46,261
Rogers was one of the first clinicians
who empirically evaluated the outcome of

116
00:05:46,391 --> 00:05:51,391
psychotherapy and so he actually more or
less established the idea that therapy

117
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,590
outcomes should be measured
scientifically.

118
00:05:53,591 --> 00:05:55,090
And,
and in doing that,

119
00:05:55,091 --> 00:05:55,901
he,
in some sense,

120
00:05:55,901 --> 00:06:00,901
he set down one element of the standards
by which modern clinical psychologists

121
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:06,251
are actually trained in practice because
the modern clinical psychologist is a

122
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:09,890
scientist practitioner.
So the idea is that you should be

123
00:06:09,891 --> 00:06:14,000
trained as a researcher and as a
practitioner and that's quite unique.

124
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:15,860
Doctors,
medical doctors for example,

125
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:18,530
are not trained that way.
Although you could make a very strong

126
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:22,940
case that they should be.
We know from our research that such

127
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:25,790
empathic understanding,
understanding with a person,

128
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,950
not about him.
It's such an effective approach that it

129
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:30,020
can bring about major changes in
personality.

130
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,800
Now,
some of you may be feeling that you

131
00:06:33,801 --> 00:06:36,830
listen well to people and that you've
never seen such results.

132
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:41,420
The chances are very great indeed that
you're listening has not been of the

133
00:06:41,421 --> 00:06:44,090
type I have described.
Fortunately,

134
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,610
I can suggest a little laboratory
experiment,

135
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,430
which you could try to test the quality
of your understand.

136
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:54,380
The next time you get into an argument
with your wife or your friend or with a

137
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:58,820
small group of friends to stop the
discussion for a moment and for an

138
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:03,320
experiment institute this rule.
Each person can only speak up for

139
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:08,000
himself once he has first restated the
ideas and feelings of the previous

140
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:13,001
speaker accurately and to that speaker
satisfaction.

141
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,680
Now,
that's the annoying part,

142
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,170
right?
Because if you're in an argument,

143
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,340
you're going to use all sorts of
rhetorical devices in order to win.

144
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,840
One of the most obvious of those
rhetorical devices is that you make your

145
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:29,270
case.
And I only half listen cause I'm

146
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:31,280
formulating what I'm going to say to you
next.

147
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,670
And then I pro I impose a bias in my
processing of your argument.

148
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,350
And so that what I address when I talked
to you is the sort of argument that

149
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:46,070
you'd make if you were weak and stupid
and contemptible and then I go after

150
00:07:46,071 --> 00:07:48,080
that and that's basically a straw man
approach,

151
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,040
right?
I take your,

152
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,810
I take your position and I try to make
it into the scrawny as little ratty ass

153
00:07:53,811 --> 00:07:58,370
thing I can possibly manage illustrating
that it needs to be rubbed out and then

154
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:01,250
I'd rub it out.
It's like the rigid approaches are

155
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,650
actually exactly the officer.
