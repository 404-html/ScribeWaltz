1
00:00:08,890 --> 00:00:09,090
No.

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,210
What are they paying for?

3
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,630
You're paying for that fun
that's associated with the
anticipation of the reward

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,191
and the brain.

5
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:16,461
You know,

6
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:16,711
your,

7
00:00:16,711 --> 00:00:20,640
your emotional brain isn't that
great at calculating mathematically

8
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,650
probabilities.

9
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:26,600
And so it sort of says some chance you
have some chance of winning $50 million.

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:27,111
Well,

11
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:29,030
it might be one in 380 million,

12
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:29,864
but your,

13
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,170
you know,

14
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:33,350
your anticipation system
isn't a mathematical system.

15
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,333
It just says,

16
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:34,611
well,

17
00:00:34,611 --> 00:00:37,250
you have some chance that's
a lot more than none.

18
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:38,510
Well,

19
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,510
in some ways it's infinitely more than
none because at zero you have no chance.

20
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,031
And you know,

21
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:46,160
with one tech you have some chance.

22
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,260
So that gets the old excitement going.
