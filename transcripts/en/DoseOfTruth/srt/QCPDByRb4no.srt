1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:08,280
Oh,

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,113
who does?

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:13,740
I'm against poverty.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,101
You know,

5
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:16,440
that's like classic protest sign.

6
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:16,801
It's like,

7
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:17,634
really?

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,910
It's like I'm against torture.

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,773
It's like,

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,670
it's so obvious you don't get any
Brownie points for being against poverty.

11
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,460
No one in their right mind is for poverty.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:31,780
Okay.

13
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:32,031
You know what?

14
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:33,300
You ever watched the Simpsons?

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:34,390
You ever see the,

16
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,350
the Republican Party in the Simpsons,

17
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:41,400
they all meet in an old haunted castle
at night with like lightening bolts going

18
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:43,430
off and there's a vampire and a crazy tax.

19
00:00:43,431 --> 00:00:48,431
And then even the Simpson Republicans
don't sit around in the haunted tower at

20
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:51,210
midnight saying the way
we need more poverty.

21
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,193
Okay,

22
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:00,420
here's an interesting thing.

23
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:04,720
So one of the postmodernist claims is
that diversity is necessary and they make

24
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:07,010
it racial and they make it sexual.

25
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,150
They may get ethnic and all of that.

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,520
That's actually technically
incorrect by the way,

27
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,354
because

28
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:13,870
yeah,

29
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,820
I study individual differences.

30
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,920
So those are the
differences between people.

31
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,080
No,

32
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,191
no,

33
00:01:19,191 --> 00:01:19,350
no.

34
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:19,951
The literature.

35
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:23,700
So you know about James
Tomorrows memo right from Google.

36
00:01:23,701 --> 00:01:25,890
He wrote that partly because
he was watching my videos,

37
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:27,720
which is why he wanted
me to interview him.

38
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:32,730
And I'm a believer that there
are biological differences
in temperament between

39
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:33,564
men and women,

40
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,220
apart from the other obvious differences
and that they're actually not trivial.

41
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,320
Okay.

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,590
And that they maximize in the
societies that have the most,

43
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:45,090
have moved farther as to
producing egalitarian states,

44
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,350
Scandinavian countries,

45
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,350
and that the reason for that is that
there's two reasons why men and women,

46
00:01:50,351 --> 00:01:51,220
different temperament.

47
00:01:51,221 --> 00:01:53,860
One is biological and the
other is environmental.

48
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,650
And if you remove the
environmental variation,

49
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:57,161
which you do,

50
00:01:57,161 --> 00:01:58,690
if you make the state egalitarian,

51
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,880
you maximize the genetic variation.

52
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:05,590
And that's been demonstrated in the
scientific literature over about four

53
00:02:05,591 --> 00:02:08,470
decades and no one
wanted it or hope for it.

54
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,040
And they weren't biased in looking for
it because that was exactly the opposite

55
00:02:12,041 --> 00:02:13,840
of what social scientists wanted to find.

56
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:17,530
Because social scientists lean heavily
to the left and what they wanted to find

57
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:21,550
was you flatten out the state so that
everyone has equal opportunity and the

58
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,440
differences between people disappear.

59
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,800
That is not what happened.

60
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:30,070
The opposite happened that wasn't wrong
and no one was happy about it and no

61
00:02:30,491 --> 00:02:31,271
one's happy about it.

62
00:02:31,271 --> 00:02:35,230
Now you can actually tell when you've
discovered something in the social science

63
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:37,110
cause you're not happy about it.

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,193
But

65
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,150
if you take,

66
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,360
let's say there's a big difference
between men and women in terms of trait,

67
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,200
agreeableness,

68
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:53,690
compassion and politeness.

69
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:54,261
On average,

70
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:56,030
women are more agreeable than men.

71
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,610
And the difference is approximately this.

72
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:01,840
If you random pairs of men and
women out of the population,

73
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,510
let's say you had to make a
bet on who was more agreeable.

74
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,010
If you bet that it was the woman,

75
00:03:06,011 --> 00:03:07,870
you'd be right 60% of the time.

76
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,300
Well that's not that much.

77
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,610
It means you'd be wrong 40% of the time.

78
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:14,740
That's almost 50% of the time.

79
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:18,010
So this is a big difference
by social science standards,

80
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,830
but that's the magnitude
of the difference.

81
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:22,450
There are some differences
that are bigger,

82
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:26,020
like the difference between
men and women's interest
in people versus things is

83
00:03:26,021 --> 00:03:26,980
actually bigger than that.

84
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,360
That's the biggest difference we know,

85
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,860
but it's a big difference.

86
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,450
Let's say the agreeable this difference,

87
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:34,260
but still they,

88
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:39,540
the shared attributes of men and
women far outweigh the attributes that

89
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:41,020
differentiate them.

90
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:46,090
Because you could ask are there more
differences within groups or between them?

91
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,720
Now the postmodern answered
that is between them.

92
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,170
That's why you need diversity by group,

93
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:53,680
right?

94
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,970
That's why you need different races.

95
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,120
That's why you need different ethnicities
and sexual preferences and all of

96
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:58,954
that.

97
00:03:59,110 --> 00:03:59,590
Well,

98
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,640
that's wrong.

99
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,480
There's more difference within the
groups than there is between them.

100
00:04:04,481 --> 00:04:07,720
You don't get diversity
by crossing the groups.

101
00:04:07,721 --> 00:04:08,680
You'd get diversity by,

102
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,170
by selecting across individuals.

103
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:11,891
In fact,

104
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:15,450
the idea that there is more differences
between groups and there is between

105
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,150
individuals is actually the
fundamental racist idea.

106
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,310
It's the fundamental racist idea,

107
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:21,910
which is,

108
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,091
well,

109
00:04:22,091 --> 00:04:23,230
let's say you're

110
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,000
Asian Oriental,

111
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,650
to use the old word to discriminate

112
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,690
the one type of Asian say from the other.

113
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,690
You're so different from me that there's
no overlap between our groups and

114
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:41,010
you're all so different and there's so
little difference within your group that

115
00:04:41,011 --> 00:04:42,900
now that I know that you're not me,

116
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:43,770
you're not one of mine.

117
00:04:43,771 --> 00:04:45,240
I actually know what you're like.

118
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,483
No,

119
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,500
technically that's incorrect.

120
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,460
That's wrong.

121
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,140
That isn't how you get diversity.
