1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:03,870
Nisha was a devastating critic of,

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,200
I would say dogmatic Christianity,

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,050
Christianity as it was
instantiated in institutions,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,160
I suppose.

5
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:11,671
Although he,

6
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:14,850
he's a very paradoxical
thinker because for example,

7
00:00:14,851 --> 00:00:19,140
one of the things neat just said was that
he didn't believe that the scientific

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:24,120
revolution would have ever got off the
ground if it hadn't been for Christianity

9
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:29,121
and more specifically for Catholicism
because he believed that over the course

10
00:00:29,251 --> 00:00:32,370
of really a thousand years,

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,620
the European mind,

12
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:36,150
so to speak,

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,080
had to train itself to interpret
everything that was known within a single

14
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,720
coherent framework,

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,630
coherent if you accept the initial axioms,

16
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,040
a single coherent framework and so neat,

17
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,920
you believe that that
Catholicism Nation of,

18
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:55,130
of,

19
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:00,130
of the phenomena of life and of history
produced the kind of mine that was then

20
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:05,511
capable of transcending that it's dogmatic
foundations and then concentrating on

21
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:06,571
something else,

22
00:01:06,571 --> 00:01:09,840
which in this particular case
happened to be the natural world.

23
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:10,950
And so Nietzsche,

24
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,160
you believe that in some sense
Christianity died at its own hand.

25
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:19,550
It had spent a very long period of time
trying to attune people to the necessity

26
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:20,700
of the truth.

27
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,051
You know,

28
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,940
absent the corruption and all of that,

29
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:26,130
that's always part of any human endeavor.

30
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,720
And then the truth,

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,800
the spirit of the truth that was developed
by Christianity turned on the roots

32
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:32,611
of Christianity.

33
00:01:32,611 --> 00:01:35,220
And everyone woke up
and said something like,

34
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:36,120
or thought something like,

35
00:01:36,121 --> 00:01:38,520
well how is it that we came
to believe any of this?

36
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,273
Um,

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,200
it's like waking up one day and noting,

38
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:44,790
noting that you really don't know
why you put a Christmas tree up,

39
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:46,470
but you've been doing it for a long time.

40
00:01:46,471 --> 00:01:47,940
And that's what people do.

41
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,080
And in know,

42
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,390
there are reasons that
Christmas trees came about,

43
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,580
but the,

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,601
what would you say?

45
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:58,500
The ritual lasts long after the
reasons have been forgotten.

46
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:04,550
So now Nicha although he was a critic
of Christianity and also a champion of,

47
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,930
of its disciplinary capacity,

48
00:02:09,931 --> 00:02:10,531
because you see,

49
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:14,070
the other thing that needs you believed
was that it was not possible to be free

50
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,031
in some sense,

51
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:15,864
unless you,

52
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,270
unless you had been a slave.

53
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:18,740
And,

54
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,740
and by that he meant that you don't go
from childhood to full fledged adult

55
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:25,470
individuality.

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,130
You go from childhood to
a state of discipline,

57
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:32,310
which you might think is akin to slavery,

58
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,200
to self imposed slavery,

59
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:38,790
that that would be the best scenario
where you have to discipline yourself to

60
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:43,791
become something specific before you might
be able to retain the generality that

61
00:02:43,921 --> 00:02:45,870
you had as a child.

62
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,530
And he believed that Christianity had
played that role for Western civilization.

63
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,100
Um,

64
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,720
bought in the late 18 hundreds,

65
00:02:54,721 --> 00:02:57,840
he announced that God was dead.

66
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,350
And you often hear of that
as something triumphant.

67
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,440
But for Nietzsche it wasn't
because he was too nuanced.

68
00:03:07,441 --> 00:03:09,400
The thinker to be that simple minded,

69
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,001
see,

70
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,261
neat.

71
00:03:10,261 --> 00:03:10,600
Yep.

72
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,010
Understood that this is something I'm
going to try to make clear as that

73
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,241
we,

74
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:19,521
there's,

75
00:03:19,521 --> 00:03:24,190
there's a very large amount that we don't
know about the structure of experience

76
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:29,191
that we don't know about reality and we
have our articulated representations of

77
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:29,980
the world.

78
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,930
And then you can think of outside of that,

79
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:35,410
there are things we know absolutely
nothing about and there's a buffer between

80
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:36,070
them.

81
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,370
And those are the things we sort of know
something about and we don't know them

82
00:03:39,371 --> 00:03:40,780
in an articulated way.

83
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,770
Here's an example.

84
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:42,011
You know,

85
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:43,720
sometimes you're arguing with one of your,

86
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,730
someone close to you and
they're in a bad mood,

87
00:03:45,731 --> 00:03:46,564
you know,

88
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,590
and uh,

89
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:52,590
they're being touchy and unreasonable and
you keep the conversation up and maybe

90
00:03:52,631 --> 00:03:53,620
all of a sudden they,

91
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:53,921
you know,

92
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:54,521
they get angry.

93
00:03:54,521 --> 00:03:57,730
Maybe they cry and then when they cry
they figure out what they're angry about.

94
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:00,760
And it has nothing to do with you
even though you might've been.

95
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,260
What precipitated the argument?

96
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:02,481
You know,

97
00:04:02,481 --> 00:04:05,770
one that's an interesting phenomena as
far as I'm concerned because it means

98
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:10,450
that people can know things at one level
without being able to speak what they

99
00:04:10,451 --> 00:04:11,320
know at another.

100
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:12,850
And so in some sense,

101
00:04:12,851 --> 00:04:17,430
the thoughts rise up from the body and
they do that in moods and they do that in

102
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:19,120
images and they do that and actions.

103
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:24,121
And we have all sorts of ways that we
understand before we understand in a fully

104
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,420
articulated manner.

105
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:29,650
And so we have this articulated
space that we can all discuss.

106
00:04:29,651 --> 00:04:30,550
And then outside of that,

107
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:34,160
we have something that's more akin
to a dream that we're embedded in.

108
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:36,730
And it's an emotional dream
that we're embedded in.

109
00:04:36,731 --> 00:04:39,300
And that's based at least
in part on her actions.

110
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:40,480
I'll describe that later.

111
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:43,600
And then outside of that is what we
don't know anything about at all.

112
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:45,100
And in that dream,

113
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,660
that's where the mystics live and that's
where the artists live and they're a

114
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,530
mediators between the absolute unknown
and the things we know for sure.

115
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,703
And

116
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,883
you see

117
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,140
what that means in some sense is what
we know is established on a form of

118
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:05,960
knowledge that we don't really understand
and that if those two things are out

119
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:06,501
of sync,

120
00:05:06,501 --> 00:05:10,430
so you might say if our articulated
knowledge is out of sync with our dream,

121
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,000
then we become dissociated internally.

122
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,860
We think things we don't act out and we
act out things we don't dream and that

123
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:23,861
produces a kind of sickness of the spirit
and and that sickness of the spirit it

124
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:26,060
see it.

125
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:31,060
It's cure is something like an integrated
system of belief and representation.

126
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,600
And then people turn to
things like ideologies,

127
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:38,870
which I regardless parasites
on an underlying religious
substructure to try to

128
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:41,390
organize their thinking and
then that's a catastrophe.

129
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,560
And that's what Nisha,

130
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,840
Nisha foresaw.

131
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,211
You see?

132
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:48,470
He knew that when we knocked the slats
out of the base of Western civilization

133
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,870
by destroying this representation,

134
00:05:50,871 --> 00:05:52,580
this is God ideal,

135
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:53,414
let's say,

136
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:56,810
that we would destabilize
and move back and forth.

137
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,411
They,

138
00:05:57,411 --> 00:05:58,430
between nihilism,

139
00:05:58,431 --> 00:06:00,290
let's say in the extremes of videology,

140
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:05,291
he was particularly concerned
about radical left ideology
and no one believed in

141
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:08,990
it and predicted this in the late 18
hundreds which is really an absolute

142
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:09,920
intellectual tour.

143
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:13,910
De Force of staggering magnitude
predicted that in the 20th century that

144
00:06:13,911 --> 00:06:18,650
hundreds of millions of people would
die because of the replacement of these

145
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,070
underlying dreamlike
structures with this rational,

146
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,301
rational,

147
00:06:23,301 --> 00:06:26,360
but deeply incorrect
representation of the world.

148
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:26,841
And you know,

149
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:30,800
we've been oscillating back and forth
between the left and right in some sense

150
00:06:30,801 --> 00:06:31,531
ever since.

151
00:06:31,531 --> 00:06:32,151
And you know,

152
00:06:32,151 --> 00:06:35,390
with some good sprinkling of
nihilism in there and despair,

153
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,720
some sense that's the situation of the
modern western person in increasingly of

154
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,740
people in general.
