1
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,680
Dangerous people are
indoctrinated in your children.

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,850
That's according to a leading conservative
who is warning parents in a new video

3
00:00:13,851 --> 00:00:17,210
about sending their kids to
America's liberal colleges.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,330
You're supporting ideologues who
claimed that all truth is subjective,

5
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,040
that all sex differences are socially
constructed and that Western imperialism

6
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,740
is the sole source of
all third world problems.

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,760
The man in that video,

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:34,100
Dr. Jordan Peterson is with us right now.

9
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,570
He's a University of Toronto,

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:39,710
psychology professor and
author of the world hit book.

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,660
It's called 12 rules for life,

12
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:44,030
an antidote to crisis,

13
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:45,560
which has spoken to so many people.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:45,880
Uh,

15
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,551
Dr. Peterson,

16
00:00:46,551 --> 00:00:48,920
we thank you very much for
joining us live in that,

17
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,050
in that introduction you say,

18
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:51,500
uh,

19
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,850
I go to you is saying there are
dangerous people teaching your children.

20
00:00:55,851 --> 00:00:56,720
Who are you talking about?

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:57,681
Well,

22
00:00:57,681 --> 00:01:00,680
increasingly and this is normally
the case in the universities,

23
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:05,681
people are being taught by ideologues
north by educators and idiot logs have a

24
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,970
very simple way of looking at the world.

25
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:11,330
They reduce it to a few
principals like inequality,

26
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,190
unfairness and power.

27
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,310
Those would be the fundamental principles
at the moment that are operating on

28
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:19,550
the radical left and they're
on an ideological campaign.

29
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:22,670
And that's increasingly
the case in in elementary,

30
00:01:22,671 --> 00:01:24,440
junior high and high schools as well.

31
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,190
Mostly because the faculties of education
are full of people who were radical.

32
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:29,251
So on.

33
00:01:29,251 --> 00:01:31,040
This is well documented.

34
00:01:31,041 --> 00:01:34,520
I mean even the chronicle of higher
education came out a month ago with a,

35
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:38,210
with a blistering piece on faculties
of education describing them is

36
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,330
academically suspect and
ideologically possessed,

37
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:42,770
which I think is exactly right.

38
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,370
Well we've talked a lot about
that on this program and,

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,090
but the,

40
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,310
the question is four for appearance,

41
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:53,810
who are thinking about sending their kids
to college someday or already have is,

42
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:57,110
is this effort rather than these uh,

43
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,720
professors and whatnot being
educators but being law,

44
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,420
where'd that come from?

45
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,970
Is it a concerted across the board thing
or is it just happening by accident?

46
00:02:06,971 --> 00:02:07,400
I don't know.

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,300
I think part of it,

48
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,510
part of it's still a hangover
from the 1960s I would say,

49
00:02:11,511 --> 00:02:13,850
and perhaps even a bit of a
hangover from the cold war.

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,211
What do you mean?

51
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:17,920
You mean the people from the sixties
and seventies are now and the ethos that

52
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:18,681
that that was,

53
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:23,540
that was broadcast so widely in the 1960s
and there was a lot of stress in the

54
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,750
60s especially because of the Vietnam
war and the consequences of the ongoing

55
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,584
called Warren.

56
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:31,250
We're still sort of suffering from the
aftermath of that ideological battle,

57
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:36,440
but I also think the university's made
a dreadful mistake expanding their

58
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:40,280
humanities per view to include disciplines
like women's studies and these ethnic

59
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,300
studies disciplines,

60
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:42,260
which aren't disciplines.

61
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,540
They're pseudo disciplines I
have passed and they have very,

62
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:48,920
very low academic standards and they're
corrupting the rest of the enterprise.

63
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,671
And so,

64
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:50,270
and that's,

65
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:50,810
and that's,

66
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,920
that's not a good thing.

67
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,200
What do you mean corrupting
the rest of the enterprise?

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:54,741
Well,

69
00:02:54,741 --> 00:02:56,630
you need to have standards in education.

70
00:02:56,631 --> 00:03:01,000
And the fact that disciplines emerged
that have no real methodology and no

71
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:01,900
method of proof,

72
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,430
no philosophical background,

73
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:08,410
no real history meant that and that they
became degree granting enterprises and

74
00:03:08,411 --> 00:03:08,920
that they,

75
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,550
that they,

76
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,220
that they emerge to produce
political activists,

77
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,500
which is exactly what they
advertise on their websites,

78
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,820
means that you've got to,

79
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,290
like,

80
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:20,560
you've got a fifth column of video logs
operating behind the scenes and all

81
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:20,950
they,

82
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,370
they,

83
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:21,850
there,

84
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,450
they spend almost all of their
time engaged in political activism,

85
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,261
you know,

86
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:26,860
and,

87
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,480
and that's not good for the university
as a whole or any stretch or biases or

88
00:03:31,481 --> 00:03:32,770
for society as a whole.

89
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:32,951
Well,

90
00:03:32,951 --> 00:03:33,400
Jordan,

91
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,671
if,

92
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,950
if somebody is thinking about
sending their kids at college,

93
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,350
I've put three through good schools,

94
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:38,660
uh,

95
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,860
what should they know about
where they send their kids?

96
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:42,360
I mean,

97
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,630
it's not like you have a
big choice because a lot of
the people in positions of

98
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:50,380
power in education are
to the political left.

99
00:03:50,381 --> 00:03:50,621
I mean,

100
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,700
that's just a fact.

101
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:55,900
You can go and you could go look
up the heterodox academy on online.

102
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,430
That's run by Jonathan Heit,

103
00:03:57,431 --> 00:03:57,820
Hu,

104
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,510
Hu Hu,

105
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,430
or he's a main player in it at that he's
here in New York and he's tried to rank

106
00:04:03,431 --> 00:04:07,660
order universities by their adherence
to truth rather than social justice and

107
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:09,910
put University of Chicago
at the top of the list,

108
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:10,481
for example.

109
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:14,920
And I think increasingly that parents
and students will wise up and start,

110
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:15,940
start,

111
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,510
uh,

112
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:20,110
not tending may universities that are
basically playing an ideological game.

113
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:25,000
What is the matter with having people
from the ideological left to being your

114
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,920
children's instructors though?

115
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:27,251
I mean,

116
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:27,771
Jose late.

117
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:30,850
It depends on how you want
all sides of the equation.

118
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:32,230
You want to know all the opinions.

119
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:32,830
Well,

120
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,521
yes you do.

121
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,180
But there's,

122
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,540
there's no evidence that the middle of
the road or the conservative side of the

123
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:41,050
PA or the opinion spectrum
is being represented in the
humanities and the social

124
00:04:41,051 --> 00:04:41,280
studies.

125
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,670
That's your worry if that,

126
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:45,790
and the fact that there's
something to be said for the left,

127
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,460
but there's not very much to
be said for the radical left.

128
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,570
And that distinction isn't being made
and the left can clearly go too far as it

129
00:04:52,571 --> 00:04:54,460
did many times in the 20th century.

130
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:56,230
And so when it gets too radical,

131
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,620
especially when there's no countering
voices and there are very few,

132
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,910
then that's a bad,

133
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:01,900
that's a bad thing.

134
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,070
It's bad for education.

135
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:04,570
It's bad for broader society.

136
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,200
It's,

137
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:05,710
it's,

138
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,880
it's altogether bad.

139
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,480
Right?

140
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,781
Jordan,

141
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,330
you've been around the
world talking your book up.

142
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:10,720
Uh,

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,111
you know,

144
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:12,850
people stop you on the
street all the time.

145
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,390
Now,

146
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:17,440
what's the one thing you have learned
since your book a 12 rules for life and

147
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:19,060
antidote to chaos came out.

148
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:23,260
How has the response been
and how has it impacted you?

149
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:23,550
Who,

150
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:23,860
well,

151
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,311
there's,

152
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,390
I've learned two things.

153
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:29,350
I've learned that people are starving
for a real conversation about

154
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,800
responsibility and meaning and about the
relationship between those two things.

155
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,800
Because people need us
sustaining meaning in their life.

156
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,430
And it's not to be found through
rights and impulsive gratification.

157
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:41,830
It's to be found through the
adoption of responsibility.

158
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:43,000
That's the first thing.

159
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:46,150
And the second thing is that people
are a lot smarter than we think.

160
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,840
So if you allow them
longform dialogue time,

161
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:51,220
even in public lectures,

162
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,660
there's a huge market for it.

163
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,950
There's a huge hunger for it,

164
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,120
podcasts and,

165
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:55,850
and the,

166
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,080
and the new video that's emerging online
with these long form discussions is

167
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:02,990
that people are smarter
than we thought and more,

168
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,420
and people can listen to
very complex material.

169
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,260
So that's,

170
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,970
that's a really positive thing.

171
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:08,660
Right.

172
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:08,960
Well,

173
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,800
it's always a pleasure.

174
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:10,671
Thank you very much.

175
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:11,481
Thanks very much for the,

176
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:13,820
and it's actually going
to be on PBS very shortly.

177
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,480
And of course the big book
is called 12 rules for life.

178
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,740
It's a worldwide bestseller.

179
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,330
Dr. Jordan Peterson.

180
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:20,691
Thank you,

181
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:20,930
sir.

182
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:21,530
Thanks very much.
