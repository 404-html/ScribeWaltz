1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,750
What happened,
the academy has,

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,360
has always leaned left in the 20th
century,

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,780
but leaning isn't the problem.
So people think,

4
00:00:17,781 --> 00:00:19,640
oh,
viewpoint diversity we need,

5
00:00:19,641 --> 00:00:21,230
we need everybody.
We need Nazis.

6
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:22,280
We need.
No,

7
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:25,880
we don't need everybody.
What we need is no orthodoxy.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,880
That's what's fatal orthodoxy.
So if you have a,

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:34,040
if you have a field like sociology or
social psychology in which it's two or

10
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:36,650
three to one left to right,
that's totally fine with me.

11
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,210
That's totally fine because if someone
makes some claim that's just like

12
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,420
ideologically blind,
someone will say,

13
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:45,340
uh,
you know,

14
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,290
common sense,
other evidence that you've missed and

15
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:51,950
then the system works.
But what I learned when I started down

16
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,310
this road in 2011,
I gave a talk at the big conference with

17
00:00:55,311 --> 00:00:58,400
social psychologists.
I gave a talk about this problem that

18
00:00:58,401 --> 00:01:02,510
we're losing our diversity,
that I could only find one conservative

19
00:01:02,511 --> 00:01:03,530
in the entire field.

20
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:05,710
And I gave a talk on this.
Um,

21
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,770
and um,
um,

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,080
and so what I've learned since then is
that the ratio in psychology was between

23
00:01:15,801 --> 00:01:17,450
two to one and four to one left,
right?

24
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,590
All the way up to the early nineties,
we've gathered together all of the

25
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:22,790
studies we could find.
So all the up to the early nineties,

26
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,530
it's only three or four to one left to
right,

27
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:26,300
which would be okay.
Um,

28
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:31,360
but then between 1995 or four and 2010,
it goes to a 14 to one.

29
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:36,350
Do you have any idea why and why that
time?

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,060
Yes.
So,

31
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,490
um,
so you get the same story whether you

32
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:43,640
look at Republican,
Democrat ratios or liberal conservative

33
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:44,810
there,
they tell the same story.

34
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,370
So the two of the big things going on
there are one is that the greatest

35
00:01:49,371 --> 00:01:51,350
generation which had a lot of
Republicans,

36
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:54,350
um,
so a lot of men go off to World War II.

37
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,590
They are there on the Gi bill.
They entered the academy in the 19

38
00:01:57,591 --> 00:02:00,020
fifties.
A lot of them are conservative or

39
00:02:00,021 --> 00:02:02,420
Republican and so you have a lot of
them,

40
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,930
but in the sixties and seventies,
one of the main reasons to go to Grad

41
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:10,931
school and the social sciences is either
a to stay in school to escape the

42
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,480
Vietnam war draft or be to fight for
social justice and against racism.

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,170
So in sociology and psychology in
particular and political science maybe

44
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:21,080
I'm not sure.
You get a huge influx of left leaning

45
00:02:21,081 --> 00:02:26,081
people who are there to pursue social
justice so you know the motives are fine

46
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,850
and if it was balanced to be totally
fine,

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,620
but as you get these young junior people
on the left come in in the seventies and

48
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:36,440
eighties and then you get the older
people that are more politically

49
00:02:36,441 --> 00:02:38,210
balanced,
retiring of the eighties and nineties.

50
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,980
By the time you get to the late nineties
it's all baby boomers and so do you get

51
00:02:42,981 --> 00:02:44,840
a.
You get a positive feedback loop

52
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,280
developing their.
Like you said,

53
00:02:46,281 --> 00:02:47,930
if it's like three to one,
it's okay,

54
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,140
but maybe when it hits four to one it
goes to like 20 to one.

55
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,100
Then you stick.
Exactly.

56
00:02:52,101 --> 00:02:54,440
So then,
so then you start getting hostile

57
00:02:54,441 --> 00:02:57,080
climate.
So I wrote a review paper on this with

58
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:01,120
a,
with Joe Duarte and Phil and lead Justin

59
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,830
Jarrett,
Crawford,

60
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,130
um,
um,

61
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,730
and um,
um,

62
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,160
and we,
uh,

63
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,360
we reviewed everything that we could
find and we concluded that most of

64
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:13,990
what's going on is self selection.
That is people on the left are more open

65
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:16,180
to experience.
They're always going to get self

66
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:18,850
selection.
But then there's really good evidence

67
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:20,500
that there's also hostile climate.
I mean,

68
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,820
it's undeniable now that if you are not
on the left in a Grad program,

69
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,810
there's just constant little subtle or
not so subtle reminders that you don't

70
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:29,520
belong.

71
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,900
And in the academy we're all about
saying,

72
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,360
Hey,
if there are subtle hints here and

73
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:35,530
there,
you can't succeed.

74
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,101
Right?
I mean,

75
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:39,070
that's what we do for a living is when
we say that little things will stop

76
00:03:39,071 --> 00:03:40,380
people.
Um,

77
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,740
well,
little things are put in the way of

78
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,170
anyone who doesn't fit politically.
Uh,

79
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,990
and so you do get hostile climate,
you do get over discrimination.

80
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,510
There's evidence of that.
And then there is also,

81
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:53,500
it is part of the story here that what
it means to be a conservative in the

82
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:55,510
nineties and especially 2000 has
changed.

83
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,410
So,
um,

84
00:03:56,410 --> 00:03:58,780
it is true that you know,
that,

85
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,010
that the,
the conservative,

86
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:02,700
we're not in any way anti-science,
um,

87
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,450
until much more recent times.
Now actually both sides are anti-science

88
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,910
about different sciences.
But I'm in America,

89
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:12,940
the right wing,
the Republican Party has,

90
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:16,330
it's controversial,
but I do believe that the polarization

91
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:18,100
starts with the right moving further
out.

92
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,880
So what it means to be conservative to
the anti anti evolutionary,

93
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,700
which is actually what's happening on
the left now to exactly.

94
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:24,010
That's.
Yeah.

95
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,460
So,
well as modern laptop to Bret Weinstein

96
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:27,750
the other day.
And you know,

97
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,320
he,
he,

98
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,850
one of his claims is that evolutionary
biology has something in it to offend

99
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,640
everyone.
So it's a,

100
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,950
it's a science that's very likely to be
targeted by extremists.

101
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,090
You also brought up something that
actually touches on the site on the

102
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,320
difficult problem of how it is that you
might define someone who is

103
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,240
ideologically possessed,
let's say,

104
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:52,800
or ideologically rigid,
because the idea was that you can make a

105
00:04:52,801 --> 00:04:57,780
valid case for the utility of free
information flow and the free flow of

106
00:04:57,781 --> 00:05:00,720
people that would go along with that and
you could make a good case for the

107
00:05:00,721 --> 00:05:03,690
danger of that.
And so the idea might be that if you're

108
00:05:03,691 --> 00:05:06,000
only making a case for the danger of
that,

109
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,890
then you're tilted too far to the right.

110
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,500
And if you're only making a case for the
utility of that,

111
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,490
then you're tilted too far to the left.
Exactly.

112
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,010
That's right.
And so we can look at immigration as a

113
00:05:15,011 --> 00:05:16,810
nice example.
There was a recent essay in the

114
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:18,760
Atlantic,
I think it was by Peter Beinart,

115
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,550
where he,
um,

116
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,820
he reviews.
He had started with a lot of quotes that

117
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:28,150
are pretty nuanced positions about
immigration from Barack Obama.

118
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:30,820
Paul Krugman,
a bunch of other people on the left who

119
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:32,770
used to be able to say,
on the one hand,

120
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:34,000
you know,
compassion,

121
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,620
economic,
on the other hand,

122
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:38,440
you know,
we have to have a legal process and

123
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:41,890
there's a threat to low wage workers,
so people on the left,

124
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,070
you still have to talk about immigration
and talk about the pros and cons,

125
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:48,040
pluses and minuses,
but beinart shows how in the last four

126
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:53,041
or five years you can't if you so much
as suggest that will maybe immigration

127
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:56,620
is a net good,
but it might have some deleterious

128
00:05:56,621 --> 00:05:59,900
effects on certain classes of of low
wage American workers.

129
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,150
You could get in big trouble,
right?

130
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:06,410
Because that's instantly prejudicial
because immigration has become a sacred

131
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:08,330
topic.
So this is the key thing that I want

132
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:12,290
everyone to keep in mind.
We are fundamentally religious creatures

133
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,610
were built for religion and it's a great
achievement to create a scientific

134
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:19,910
establishment and an academic
establishment that keeps that way of

135
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:22,730
thinking out.
Scientific thinking is not natural

136
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:24,920
thinking.
Religious thinking is natural thinking

137
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,660
and what's happening to us in the last
few years especially is a flooding in of

138
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:33,770
religious thinking and so let's get a
bunch of social scientists talk about

139
00:06:33,771 --> 00:06:35,390
immigration.
What are they going to do?

140
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
Look at the data,
way up.

141
00:06:36,921 --> 00:06:38,660
The pluses and minuses.
No,

142
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,740
they're going to.
Many of them feel they're on a team and

143
00:06:42,741 --> 00:06:45,640
that team is fighting the right.
The right is anti-immigrant.

144
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:50,420
It includes racist elements there for
that justifies us in being pro.

145
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Immigration and social sciences are
always.

146
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:56,240
There's always ambiguity.
There's always conflicting stories,

147
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:59,810
multiple causal factors.
Is that always in the social science

148
00:06:59,811 --> 00:07:00,770
study?
That's right.

149
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:05,510
So [inaudible] point was that the left
used to be able to think straight about

150
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:06,860
immigration.
Clearly it had a,

151
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,540
you know,
it was generally pro immigration,

152
00:07:08,541 --> 00:07:09,890
but it used to be able to think
straight,

153
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,480
but in the last few years a religious
orthodox mindset has overtaken it.

154
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,400
Okay.
So we might as well also pointed out

155
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,770
that it's a primordial religious
mindset,

156
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,950
right?
Because I mean there are definitely

157
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,110
Christian or Jewish,
I mean ancient tribal,

158
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,970
small scale,
lots of gods.

159
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,601
Right,
right.

160
00:07:26,601 --> 00:07:28,310
Well,
so then one of the things that you might

161
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:33,040
suggest is that when you throw out a
sophisticated religious structure in

162
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,920
unsophisticated religious structure
comes in to fill the gap.

163
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,880
I do.
So that's true.

164
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,120
That's definitely worth thinking about.
So that's right.

165
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,610
So that's right.
The thing with religions,

166
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,520
we have to clarify,
fundamentalism is the problem,

167
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,550
not religion.
And so if you close tribalism,

168
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,160
that's right.
If you get a fundamentalist,

169
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,470
you know,
I'm happy to say,

170
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,230
and if you have people applying to a
Grad program in psychology and I find

171
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,510
out that they're Christian,
that's fine.

172
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,600
There's no problem.
But if they're fundamentalist Christian,

173
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,550
I would think,
well let's say let's say it's not

174
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,130
psychologists,
it's a geology.

175
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:09,500
So somewhat applies to a geology
program.

176
00:08:09,501 --> 00:08:11,360
There are fundamentalists,
young,

177
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:14,150
earth creationist.
Are you gonna admit them?

178
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,920
No,
I don't think you should.

179
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,950
They're not able to do the right kind of
thinking based on what we know to be the

180
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:23,800
case there.
They're not in the scientific paradigm,

181
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,710
not in the sand type.
That's right.

182
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,740
So,
so if we wouldn't admit a fundamentalist

183
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,390
Christian to a geology program,
why would we admit someone who is just

184
00:08:32,391 --> 00:08:35,780
as fundamentalist about certain moral
and political issues into a sociology

185
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:40,070
program or into a psychology program if
they come in knowing what the right

186
00:08:40,071 --> 00:08:42,230
answer is,
committed to that right answer,

187
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,700
likely to get angry at anyone who
contravenes that right answer.

188
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:48,500
Um,
and,

189
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:52,940
and showing signs of close mindedness.
I don't think they belong in the.

190
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,330
I guess the question is how in the world
do you set up mechanisms to ensure that

191
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:00,960
you're not swamped by fundamentalists of
any sort?

192
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,870
So those are people who are reducing
everything to a single cause.

193
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:07,290
It's something like that.
How can you implement a structure that

194
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,490
protects the organization against that
without the structure itself becoming

195
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,010
totalitarian?
Because these things,

196
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,990
these things spin out of control so
fast.

197
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,280
But so,
you know,

198
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,210
I think what we have to realize in the
academy is that we face,

199
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,860
I think we face an existential crisis.
Um,

200
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:28,080
we rely on an enormous amount of public
goodwill.

201
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:33,230
We get enormous tax subsidies,
a direct research support and recent

202
00:09:34,111 --> 00:09:38,010
polling shows that while Democrats have
always had a higher opinion of the

203
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,380
universities and Republicans until two
years ago,

204
00:09:40,381 --> 00:09:42,540
everybody thought universities are a
good thing.

205
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,420
They make life better.
So Americans have been very supportive

206
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:47,760
of higher education.
There have been rising gripes on the

207
00:09:47,761 --> 00:09:51,540
right,
but it's only between 2015 and 2017 that

208
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:55,710
now republicans go from saying mostly
universities are good things in two

209
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:57,470
years.
They go way down and say universities

210
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,190
are bad things.
They're making things worse.

211
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,380
Now,
how is this news greeted?

212
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,740
Pundits on the left are saying,
oh,

213
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:08,820
those republicans are so anti science.
Look how ignorant they are.

214
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:12,240
They now hate universities.
Come on.

215
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,780
Anybody who's been watching the news,
anybody who's seen the mobs,

216
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,300
the shout downs,
the illiberal behavior,

217
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,800
you know,
the metaphor I use is like,

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,260
you know,
Americans on the right and left are

219
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,010
really supportive of the military.
We have.

220
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,970
It's one of the few institutions that we
still hold in highest team on both

221
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,370
sides.
And so the Republicans more than

222
00:10:29,371 --> 00:10:29,970
Democrats.

223
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,900
So suppose you had Gallup poll and I,
uh,

224
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,530
showing Republicans liked the military
more than Democrats,

225
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:39,420
but both really liked it.
Then suddenly in 2015 we started seeing

226
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,600
video from all over military bases and
military academies in which the,

227
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,760
the military leaders are overtly right
wing.

228
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,610
They're there,
they're saying terrible things about

229
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:54,900
leftists and progressives and the
midshipmen and the cadets and everybody

230
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:58,710
is mobbing the occasional liberal and to
behaving in a really despicable,

231
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:02,430
scary and intimidating way.
What do you think the left would now

232
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:05,130
think about the military?
Obviously support for the military would

233
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:08,370
plummet and that's what's happening in
America with universities.

234
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:11,130
We are losing the support of half the
country.

235
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:14,550
This is unsustainable,
especially in red states where,

236
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:16,200
you know,
they control the purse strings.

237
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,060
So I think we have a major crisis.
I think we've got to go into crisis mode

238
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,480
and we've got to clean up our act.
So just as we're doing in psychology

239
00:11:24,481 --> 00:11:28,050
with replication project where we
recognize that our methods weren't good

240
00:11:28,051 --> 00:11:32,160
enough and we're doing a crash course,
a thanks to Brian Nosek and others,

241
00:11:32,161 --> 00:11:35,130
the open science project,
we're really trying to improve our game.

242
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,100
Thank God we need to.
I think we have to do the exact same

243
00:11:38,101 --> 00:11:41,460
thing about partisanship and our on our
duty.
