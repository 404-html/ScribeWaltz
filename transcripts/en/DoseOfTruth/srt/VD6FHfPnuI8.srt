1
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,120
Can you hear me?

2
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:39,780
Oh,

3
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,613
you can hear me.

4
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,250
Oh,

5
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,083
okay.

6
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,543
Well that's good.

7
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:48,780
Let me turn off.

8
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,480
Turn on music.

9
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,443
All Right,

10
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,283
nice.

11
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,333
Cool.

12
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:00,190
What I was trying to do

13
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,023
is

14
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,810
instead of using the laptop

15
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,820
video source was trying
to hook up my dslr camera

16
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,270
is a canon add.

17
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:13,511
Yeah.

18
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:15,520
And I have that one of
those Yeti mic hooked up.

19
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:18,880
Cool.

20
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,713
Cool.

21
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:24,120
So I know you guys have probably seen it.

22
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,400
There's a whole lot of people that post,

23
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:26,850
you know,

24
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:27,960
Jordan Peterson stuff.

25
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,293
Um,

26
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,270
the only reason I stopped
is because in September,

27
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,713
um,

28
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,120
I think it was mid September,

29
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:40,830
I received a message from youtube
saying that my channel was going to be

30
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,440
demonetized a produce allocation.

31
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,150
There were other channels that
got demonetized to like voltaire.

32
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,090
Um,

33
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,731
I'm drawing a blank,

34
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:57,520
but there were a few of the
channels that would cut clips.

35
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,253
Uh,

36
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:03,640
I was kind of surprised that it happened.

37
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,183
Um,

38
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,290
but,

39
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,123
you know,

40
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:09,003
that's what happens.

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,833
Um,

42
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,980
so I'm not really sure what to do now.

43
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,713
I didn't stop.

44
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I didn't stop posting Jordan's content
because anything with the cabinet thing

45
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,693
seat,

46
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,790
the most amazing thing to
me because I've listened to,

47
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:29,280
not all of his university lectures,

48
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,580
but all the Bible lectures,

49
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,150
probably each one at
least two or three times,

50
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,800
not because I want to listen to it,

51
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:36,220
to her.

52
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:36,750
Oh yeah.

53
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,300
I liked,

54
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,280
I liked listening to them,

55
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,440
but the whole thing was,

56
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,800
the idea was I was editing,

57
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,770
so I was listening to
segments over and over.

58
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:49,020
And as soon as I read the cabin,

59
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:50,650
I think I thought to myself,

60
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,071
Oh yeah,

61
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,840
I know what he's,

62
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,541
what he's getting at.

63
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,140
He's,

64
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,760
even though he didn't explain it to later,

65
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,060
I,

66
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,980
I instantly knew probably be because,

67
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:57,971
you know,

68
00:04:57,971 --> 00:05:02,260
if all the stuff he says on youtube
is any indication of his personality,

69
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,140
which you would imagine it would be.

70
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,423
Um,

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,290
the idea was that,

72
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,703
uh,

73
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:10,923
maybe we should,

74
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:11,771
maybe Kevin,

75
00:05:11,771 --> 00:05:16,570
how should back off and let
there be peace rather than

76
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,840
rather than,

77
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,093
uh,

78
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,010
so much turmoil.

79
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:26,731
I mean,

80
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:27,240
I didn't,

81
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,380
I don't really care.

82
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:33,890
I consider most of what's in what
you see on the mainstream news to be.

83
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:38,673
Uh,

84
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:40,240
basically the,

85
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,660
the pr arm for the state,

86
00:05:42,661 --> 00:05:46,380
that's what I consider politics basically
the public relations arm for the

87
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,214
state.

88
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,323
Okay.

89
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,360
So it doesn't matter.

90
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,830
Kevin gets elected Kevin
and doesn't get elected.

91
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,000
It doesn't matter.

92
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,170
You know,

93
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:58,280
Kevin was definitely a status as much,

94
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:00,860
as much as he could be one,

95
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:04,683
but.

96
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:05,961
And then,

97
00:06:05,961 --> 00:06:06,710
um,

98
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,570
but there is one thing that I,

99
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:13,690
that I came across recently
and that was a Peterson's.

100
00:06:14,661 --> 00:06:15,494
I'm thinking,

101
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,200
I'm thinking how to thank you.

102
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,034
You need help here.

103
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,590
I don't know what that means,

104
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,510
what kind of help do I need?

105
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,893
But,

106
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,063
but um,

107
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:35,960
oh,

108
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:36,860
but the odd thing that,

109
00:06:36,861 --> 00:06:41,861
that Peterson had tweeted out was the
whole Holocaust denier being synonymous

110
00:06:46,611 --> 00:06:47,780
with climate change.

111
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:48,830
Denial is that,

112
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,360
I don't know if I'm getting it right.

113
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,130
You guys remember that tweet.

114
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,593
I don't fall,

115
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,063
uh,

116
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,590
Jordan Peterson's twitter that often.

117
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,760
Um,

118
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:03,760
but I've tried to get in contact with
a publicist to ask for permission to.

119
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,410
We broadcast this stuff so I could forward
an email to youtube and hopefully get

120
00:07:11,411 --> 00:07:12,340
re monetized.

121
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,510
I don't know that that's going to happen,

122
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,883
but.

123
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,470
So yeah.

124
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:24,710
Mm,

125
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,693
mm

126
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,793
mm.

127
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,201
Yeah.

128
00:07:33,201 --> 00:07:35,750
I don't have anything with Peterson today.

129
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,630
Penguins are upside down.

130
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,033
Yeah.

131
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,933
Well

132
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,720
that's fine with me.

133
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,051
Yeah,

134
00:08:07,051 --> 00:08:07,920
it should be clear.

135
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,940
Is it looking like it's pretty clear.

136
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,580
I think that if I had a.

137
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,090
How about I pay pal you?

138
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:23,241
Yeah.

139
00:08:23,241 --> 00:08:27,320
I don't think I can turn on super chat
because I'm no longer a part of the

140
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:29,630
youtube part or program.

141
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,493
Um,

142
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,141
well that's good.

143
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:42,440
I think the video would probably
be even clear if I had a,

144
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,283
uh,

145
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,240
a lens with a lower stop.

146
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,550
You can start posting about your own
ideas since he might've taken some

147
00:08:52,551 --> 00:08:53,510
influence from Latinos.

148
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:54,344
Peterson lectures.

149
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:55,883
Well,

150
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,610
funny enough.

151
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,413
Um,

152
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,340
no,

153
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,130
I've,

154
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,320
I've thought quite a bit more.

155
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,570
I'm kind of looking at
streaming options here.

156
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:11,893
Do

157
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,650
you have a son?

158
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:30,610
I go into the CEO Volusia Pako

159
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:37,070
was Spanish and I don't know that song.

160
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,103
What's the topic?

161
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,640
Or May I suggest one?

162
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:42,803
Yes.

163
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,561
Your own ideas.

164
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:44,394
Give us some.

165
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,360
Well,

166
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,110
uh,

167
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,780
I don't think that I'm,

168
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:56,250
well I'm still kind of trying to
learn a little bit more about history.

169
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,600
Like for instance,

170
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,020
uh,

171
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,280
I started watching,

172
00:09:59,440 --> 00:09:59,670
uh,

173
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:03,630
Chris hedges on Youtube who
was a war correspondent,

174
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,250
a journalist,

175
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,850
and he's written quite a few books.

176
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,390
One of the more interesting books is a
book of his called a war force that gives

177
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,234
us meaning

178
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,543
and,

179
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,583
and

180
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,163
sorry,

181
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,153
I get sidetracked.

182
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:28,720
I start to want to read the chat.

183
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:30,170
And uh,

184
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,050
Chris Hedges book is basically about,

185
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:33,183
um,

186
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,420
I haven't,

187
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,253
I haven't read it.

188
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,241
Uh,

189
00:10:36,241 --> 00:10:36,520
I've,

190
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,353
I've got hedge,

191
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,230
his newest book America,

192
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,850
the fell,

193
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,510
fell,

194
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:43,000
fell where the farewell tour,

195
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:43,751
sorry,

196
00:10:43,751 --> 00:10:45,550
it's a bit dyslexic but not his,

197
00:10:45,551 --> 00:10:46,384
uh,

198
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,040
as far as I know his first book,

199
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:50,500
a force to gives us meaning,

200
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,670
but it's about basically,

201
00:10:51,671 --> 00:10:52,504
you know,

202
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,980
that soldiers,

203
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,710
um,

204
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,830
people in combat,

205
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,060
you don't have a lot to relate to a,

206
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,870
especially when they start,

207
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,733
when they make,

208
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:04,240
when they make contact.

209
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,603
So,

210
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,111
you know,

211
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:10,630
they develop this,

212
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,330
I dunno,

213
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:19,490
it,

214
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:23,140
it just gives soldiers meaning combat
gives soldiers meaning and when they come

215
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:28,141
home it becomes a whole lot more
difficult to assimilate to something that

216
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,290
doesn't recognize combat at all.

217
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:33,581
Um,

218
00:11:33,581 --> 00:11:34,150
so,

219
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:34,690
but I was,

220
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:35,523
someone asked me,

221
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:35,950
you know,

222
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:36,910
some of your own ideas.

223
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,480
Well,

224
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,520
I've recently found out that,

225
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,553
uh,

226
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,670
some of the

227
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:45,820
people that brought us,

228
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,790
if you're an employee in the United States

229
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,820
in the early,

230
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,020
early 20th century,

231
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
the early 20th century

232
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,220
workers had a lot to be

233
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,310
upset about.

234
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,840
Their living conditions were bad.

235
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,200
They worked a tremendous amount of hours
for little pay for as far as I know,

236
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,720
next to no ability to
advance at all in society.

237
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,300
That's the majority,

238
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,530
not just a generalization,

239
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:26,130
so no workers started
to strike and a lot of,

240
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:28,810
not a lot of,

241
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,040
but an organization,

242
00:12:30,070 --> 00:12:31,750
the industrial workers of the world,

243
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:35,980
which was a socialist organization which
had both socialists and communists in

244
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:36,814
it,

245
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:38,993
um,

246
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,980
advocated on behalf of
American workers to strike.

247
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,270
And from what I've read,

248
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,410
the,

249
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:45,950
the,

250
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:46,550
uh,

251
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,490
the beginning of the strikes,

252
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,190
the beginning of the strikes were a

253
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:57,530
peaceful,

254
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,363
nonviolent,

255
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,440
and the state,

256
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,401
not just the state,

257
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:02,630
sorry,

258
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:03,860
not the state that first.

259
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,350
But first corporations were,

260
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:07,923
you know,

261
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:13,540
became very apprehensive to the
idea of strike from what I've read.

262
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,360
And so they started to hire a militias
in local organizations to try and police

263
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,490
and intimidate,

264
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:31,630
and I use violence against the peaceful
protests to the point where when the

265
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:37,490
protests became so out of hand,

266
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,750
the companies would,

267
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,200
would petition the state,

268
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,960
the state would petition
the federal government,

269
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,120
and then they would bring in the military,

270
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,593
um,

271
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,540
to put down strikes.

272
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,580
And,

273
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:48,800
you know,

274
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,790
I don't know,

275
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,853
I'm not that,

276
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,153
uh,

277
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,300
I don't know that much about history,

278
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:56,931
but,

279
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:57,081
you know,

280
00:13:57,081 --> 00:14:00,080
I try and look at parallels
that are happening.

281
00:14:00,081 --> 00:14:00,710
And,

282
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:00,981
you know,

283
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:02,130
one thing that I saw you,

284
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:04,783
uh,

285
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,790
um,

286
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,240
one thing that I saw was
around the same time,

287
00:14:15,241 --> 00:14:15,511
the,

288
00:14:15,511 --> 00:14:16,344
uh,

289
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,180
revolutions in Russia we're going on.

290
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:18,840
So maybe the,

291
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,673
maybe the state

292
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,180
basic to understanding history,

293
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,920
understanding human nature,

294
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,703
um,

295
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:32,443
but the,

296
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,060
so maybe the state thought that what was
happening in eastern Europe was going

297
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:45,980
to happen in the United States.

298
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,120
Um,

299
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,400
so I could see why there would,

300
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,900
there there were legitimate.

301
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,430
Although I don't think that that's really,

302
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,740
that's the truth.

303
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,230
That's just one possibility.

304
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,163
Um,

305
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:11,540
so I find it very interesting
that socialists and
communists are the ones that

306
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:17,730
advocate it and eventually got to giving,

307
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,123
um,

308
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,280
the better living standard of the

309
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:24,920
American employee.

310
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,070
Um,

311
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:27,380
you know,

312
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,430
if you're self employed,

313
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:29,290
you know,

314
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:30,830
you don't follow the same guidelines.

315
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,830
I'm lucky now because I'm self employed.

316
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,840
I'm a cabinet installer,

317
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,200
matures carpenter,

318
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:44,980
but much better and finished
carpentry then rough carpentry.

319
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,143
Um,

320
00:15:46,150 --> 00:15:48,940
but I'm not an employee so,

321
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:49,740
you know,

322
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:49,970
I'm,

323
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,790
I'm lucky a lot of ways and you know,

324
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,540
people I've left comments
and comment sections.

325
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,530
This guy is boring.

326
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,753
Nice,

327
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,803
low key.

328
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,490
Well I'm,

329
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,100
I forgot I was going to say,

330
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,180
oh,

331
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,050
people have said to me,

332
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:19,231
well,

333
00:16:19,231 --> 00:16:20,340
what if I don't want to work?

334
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,773
So the,

335
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,540
all those socialist movements,

336
00:16:24,541 --> 00:16:25,680
the communist movements,

337
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:30,681
the strikes basically gave you the
American worker like an eight hour working

338
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:32,070
day,

339
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,010
weekends,

340
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:33,993
a,

341
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,670
a better standard of living.

342
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,260
And you know,

343
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:41,270
where that contrasts with
Peterson's idea that you know,

344
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,113
you shouldn't,

345
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,420
it's not a good idea to,

346
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:50,640
to place a group above you,

347
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:51,691
you know,

348
00:16:51,691 --> 00:16:52,740
if I'm saying it correctly,

349
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:52,891
will,

350
00:16:52,891 --> 00:16:54,270
the idea is that they're not,

351
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:55,230
you know,

352
00:16:55,230 --> 00:17:00,060
these people are not only advocating for
everyone for a better living standard

353
00:17:00,061 --> 00:17:00,990
for everybody else,

354
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,120
but also for themselves.

355
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,040
So a,

356
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,120
and people have tried
to rebut the idea of,

357
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:09,511
you know,

358
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:11,160
what if I don't want to work eight hours,

359
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,263
well,

360
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,300
what if I want to work
12 hours or 14 hours?

361
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:16,320
Well,

362
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,040
okay,

363
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:20,340
but what if you weren't
making even minimum wage?

364
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,300
What if you were making

365
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,913
a dollar,

366
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,920
$2 to $3 an hour?

367
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,253
Um,

368
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:28,710
you know,

369
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:32,840
working a 16 hour days
for $3 an hour would be a,

370
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,830
would be really rough.

371
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,150
And something that I've
recently learned about,

372
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,393
uh,

373
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:45,080
in the libertarian camp
was a little big on me.

374
00:17:45,081 --> 00:17:50,081
So this was actually advocating
for workers across the
world so that trade could

375
00:17:55,681 --> 00:17:57,030
flow freely.

376
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,100
That worker is,

377
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:00,991
like I said,

378
00:18:00,991 --> 00:18:03,030
across the world would be paid the same,

379
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,330
so the migrant workers would be paid well.

380
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,070
So what that would do was basically
reduced the American living standard and

381
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,870
European living standard down to that,

382
00:18:12,871 --> 00:18:13,621
of the migrants,

383
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:17,370
which at that time I think
we're Chinese and black workers.

384
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,540
Um,

385
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,510
so a lot of people don't
know that about me,

386
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,010
sis.

387
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,843
Uh,

388
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:23,471
I mean,

389
00:18:23,471 --> 00:18:24,304
uh,

390
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,173
uh,

391
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,700
it just doesn't sound like
a very good idea that,

392
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,760
that means that you and probably all 33
people watching right now wouldn't ever

393
00:18:36,961 --> 00:18:39,270
have been able to get out of

394
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:43,470
what would be far below poverty in the,

395
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,670
in the West now.

396
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,693
Um,

397
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,733
and,

398
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,301
you know,

399
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,134
so

400
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,320
it's just weird that
that's kind of stamped,

401
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,100
that's kind of stamped out of history
in a lot of people don't know that.

402
00:18:59,101 --> 00:18:59,840
I certainly did.

403
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,080
No,

404
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,430
that I'm,

405
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,510
I don't know,

406
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,380
I'm definitely

407
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,450
don't have any type of ideology,

408
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:11,980
I believe that will fix anything.

409
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:17,370
I personally like a Karl
Popper's idea of open society.

410
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:20,920
I don't even know that
much about Karl Popper,

411
00:19:20,921 --> 00:19:21,671
but the,

412
00:19:21,671 --> 00:19:21,851
I,

413
00:19:21,851 --> 00:19:26,851
the concept of open society
is that in order to,

414
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,000
uh,

415
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
it's not George Soros Open society though
he may have grabbed ideas from it for

416
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:37,270
his organization,

417
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:42,330
Karl Popper philosophers idea
of an open society was that,

418
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:52,400
that everything is in flux and ideas are
dynamic and times change and that you

419
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:57,401
constantly have to figure out what's
going to work and if that means

420
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,000
experimenting with,

421
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,363
with different

422
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,190
social ideas or

423
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:11,120
it's just the idea that there's
never any one set of ideas.

424
00:20:11,991 --> 00:20:13,250
Nothing's ever final.

425
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:15,710
Everything has to be
under constant scrutiny,

426
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,520
which,

427
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:16,791
you know,

428
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:19,130
if you extrapolate that
out to the individual,

429
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,233
you know,

430
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,810
if you are constantly policing,

431
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,130
policing is a good word.

432
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:26,750
But being mindful of yourself,

433
00:20:28,170 --> 00:20:29,003
uh,

434
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:30,223
then

435
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:34,740
and taking action to
do what's best for you,

436
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,530
then you know,

437
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:37,643
you'll probably

438
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:39,451
come out.

439
00:20:39,451 --> 00:20:40,284
Well,

440
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,680
I don't think that the
future is going to be.

441
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,090
I don't think that Americans,

442
00:20:51,091 --> 00:20:52,000
especially in the future,

443
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:56,100
are going to survive in the exact
same system that they have now.

444
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,843
Um,

445
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,100
basically the whole idea of
profit being the bottom line.

446
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:07,831
I mean,

447
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:08,664
you hear people

448
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,950
every once in awhile I'll,

449
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,070
I'll see something on Fox News and

450
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,973
uh,

451
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,730
and there was a segment,

452
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:30,030
I think it was on Fox business
news and this guy was saying,

453
00:21:30,431 --> 00:21:30,551
well,

454
00:21:30,551 --> 00:21:32,410
how do you know what,

455
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:37,150
what arguments do you use against people
who claim that socialism the answer?

456
00:21:37,151 --> 00:21:37,601
And he said,

457
00:21:37,601 --> 00:21:37,721
well,

458
00:21:37,721 --> 00:21:38,740
just look at the Internet.

459
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,210
Well,

460
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:40,421
you know,

461
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,440
that's another thing that you,

462
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,600
you have to know something
about and you know,

463
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:47,530
whereas,

464
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:49,210
you know,

465
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,960
Ebay was the perfect example
of a free market to begin with.

466
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:55,300
I don't know that it's still like that.

467
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,150
Free markets existed on the Internet,

468
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:02,950
but the Internet itself is the
product of a socialist institution,

469
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,960
a centralized institution.

470
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,500
The United States military
and the Department of Defense,

471
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:09,520
Advanced Research,

472
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,430
uh,

473
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:10,621
you know,

474
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:12,910
it was arpanet before
it became the Internet.

475
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,373
Um,

476
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,780
so no socialism gave you the Internet,

477
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:17,710
uh,

478
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:18,543
you know,

479
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,260
tax dollars gave you,

480
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,230
you know,

481
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,640
what we enjoy today.

482
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:27,123
Um,

483
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,080
and something that I've,

484
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,120
I don't know that much about.

485
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,740
But,

486
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,573
uh,

487
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,100
as far as I know,

488
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,800
Marxism is a critique,

489
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:39,941
you know,

490
00:22:39,941 --> 00:22:42,250
it's like saying that,

491
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,113
you know,

492
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,090
I guess I'm trying to say that

493
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,060
Marxism didn't kill

494
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,650
however many people in,

495
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:54,883
uh,

496
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:55,620
in Europe.

497
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,070
Well,

498
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:56,903
you know,

499
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:59,910
Stalin was in eastern Europe.

500
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,770
Stalin was basically a thug.

501
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:05,880
He was a lot like the United
States organized criminals,

502
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:06,091
you know,

503
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:06,810
he was just a,

504
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,890
he was basically just a gangster
who rose to the head of the state.

505
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,430
But Marxism is a critique of,

506
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,623
uh,

507
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,380
financial institutions or I get.

508
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:21,701
Sorry,

509
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,660
economics.

510
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:23,610
Marxism is,

511
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,970
is a critique of economics.

512
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,860
I don't know that much about Marxism,

513
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,540
but like I said,

514
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:32,480
the idea would be that
Marxism didn't kill 'em.

515
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:37,920
However many people that would be like
saying that Algebra killed the people in

516
00:23:39,011 --> 00:23:40,540
Nagasaki and Hiroshima,

517
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:40,841
you know,

518
00:23:40,841 --> 00:23:41,674
it's not,

519
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,690
you can't make that distinction,

520
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,050
you know,

521
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:49,730
as much as Peterson
says that Marxism is a,

522
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,730
it's a philosophy of resentment.

523
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,593
That may be true,

524
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,081
you know,

525
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:57,810
I don't know that much about marks.

526
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:58,560
Um,

527
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,060
one thing that I've heard from people
who have read mark's more that's

528
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:08,150
interesting is that mark spoke out
against a financial speculation.

529
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:10,710
Um,

530
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,710
much of what gave you much of what gives
a Western societies the bubbles that

531
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,673
are created,

532
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:22,260
the housing bubble,

533
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:22,531
the,

534
00:24:22,531 --> 00:24:23,280
uh,

535
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,450
securities bubble,

536
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,200
the bubble that we have now that's,

537
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,903
that's bursting.

538
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,390
I'm not only is it bad for,

539
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,100
well,

540
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,500
I don't know why it would be
bad for people on the way up,

541
00:24:37,501 --> 00:24:39,450
but on the way down
when the bubble bursts,

542
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,333
you have the,

543
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,420
uh,

544
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,250
finance financial institutions,

545
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:47,340
the banks that just go ahead and buy up
all the assets of the people that can no

546
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:48,540
longer afford things.

547
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:50,963
Um,

548
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,613
so,

549
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:52,861
you know,

550
00:24:52,861 --> 00:24:53,031
it,

551
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:57,090
it would seem that mark's
had some good ideas though.

552
00:24:57,091 --> 00:24:58,110
His character,

553
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:03,090
the character of his person wasn't

554
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,560
an marble,

555
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,450
but,

556
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:06,661
you know,

557
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:08,220
maybe some of his ideas,

558
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:13,250
maybe some ideas of
Marxism are worth noting.

559
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,283
Um,

560
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,151
you know,

561
00:25:18,151 --> 00:25:22,650
obviously private property seems
like a pretty good thing to me.

562
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,203
Um,

563
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:25,381
but like I said,

564
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:29,430
I'm much more towards Karl
Popper's idea of an open society.

565
00:25:29,431 --> 00:25:31,620
So it shouldn't just be,

566
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,363
uh,

567
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,290
you know,

568
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:36,660
straight capitalism or straight socialism,

569
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:37,441
you know,

570
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:38,910
it should be basically,

571
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,840
there should be little
experiments in the economy.

572
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:44,310
A company's,

573
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:47,351
you know,

574
00:25:47,351 --> 00:25:47,981
for instance,

575
00:25:47,981 --> 00:25:48,280
in,

576
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:53,280
as far as I know in Germany for
corporations that have over a thousand for

577
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:58,540
corporations that have over
a thousand or so people

578
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,590
for corporations and what the hell is up
in this chat for corporations that have

579
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,450
more than a thousand or so people.

580
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:14,850
I'm the executives are actually
voted on by the workers.

581
00:26:14,851 --> 00:26:16,050
I don't know if that's true.

582
00:26:16,051 --> 00:26:18,410
I've heard that a,

583
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,530
if that is true,

584
00:26:19,531 --> 00:26:19,831
you know,

585
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:20,664
that's

586
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:22,023
um,

587
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,380
I mean these are just little things that,

588
00:26:25,381 --> 00:26:26,214
you know,

589
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,780
why isn't,

590
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,550
why isn't anything?

591
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,230
Why doesn't anything ever change?

592
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:31,531
Well,

593
00:26:31,531 --> 00:26:32,364
of course,

594
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:32,671
you know,

595
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:37,260
there's always unintended consequences
and you go ahead and you solve one

596
00:26:37,261 --> 00:26:39,840
problem and you create
a whole bunch of others,

597
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:43,800
which is true.

598
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:45,950
Um,

599
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,840
but there's no,

600
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,570
it doesn't seem like there's
enough innovation and economics.

601
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,813
I mean,

602
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,870
not that I know that much,

603
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,830
but it seems like we're
reaching a pretty bad

604
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,273
time now.

605
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:08,150
And there's other one point of
contention they have with Peterson,

606
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,360
you know,

607
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,320
where is he says,

608
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:10,131
you know,

609
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:11,330
people in the West

610
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,730
are the,

611
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,780
the people who are the poorest are still
among the one percent of the world.

612
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,183
Well,

613
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,173
you know,

614
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:22,590
I kinda like to

615
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:25,291
though,

616
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:25,831
I don't know,

617
00:27:25,831 --> 00:27:27,540
always know if it's appropriate.

618
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:34,100
Basically go from micro to macro and
by that I mean that maybe we shouldn't

619
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:41,520
judge the western countries
shouldn't judge themselves based on,

620
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,020
uh,

621
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,280
the other countries of the world.

622
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,790
We shouldn't judge ourselves
based on poor countries,

623
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:50,610
but by where we were at,

624
00:27:52,710 --> 00:27:53,670
where we are at,

625
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,710
I think that if we,

626
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:57,211
we did that,

627
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:57,391
you know,

628
00:27:57,391 --> 00:27:58,224
maybe we would,

629
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,103
uh,

630
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,431
move forward.

631
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:03,780
I don't know what the hell that means.

632
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:05,423
I mean if I was,

633
00:28:05,610 --> 00:28:05,940
you know,

634
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,780
an executive,

635
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,320
a making a whole lot of money,

636
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:13,080
it would basically just
be the status quo for me.

637
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:17,040
So I can understand why things don't
change or they change very slowly.

638
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,650
I'm just kinda rambling.

639
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,130
What are your thoughts on
the reason behind almost
everyone in the photo is her.

640
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,230
I don't know anything about that.

641
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,730
You guys have any questions?

642
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,160
I don't know if I can answer anything.

643
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,760
No.

644
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,153
So yeah,

645
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:57,663
I dunno.

646
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:00,450
Ideas I have are still being formulated,

647
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,313
but

648
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:05,040
I don't think it's ever a
good idea to just write off

649
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,340
right off all that's something.

650
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,930
I mean financial speculation,

651
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:12,764
gambling,

652
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:13,641
financial,

653
00:29:13,641 --> 00:29:14,430
gambling use.

654
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,480
It used to be illegal and now it's not,

655
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:19,600
um,

656
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:21,111
you know,

657
00:29:21,111 --> 00:29:24,470
the idea that speculation
is a good thing because,

658
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:24,861
you know,

659
00:29:24,861 --> 00:29:28,700
speculation can be a good thing because
then it allows banks to lend more money

660
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,950
so an economy can be more productive.

661
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:34,070
I've read that in some
article that was probably,

662
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:35,813
uh,

663
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,560
some bank funded article
or somebody that paying

664
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:45,370
for those views to be me put out,

665
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,453
I don't know.

666
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,221
But you know,

667
00:29:48,221 --> 00:29:50,050
Karl Popper's open society,

668
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,340
the philosopher Karl Popper and
the idea of open society now.

669
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:56,060
That's not as far as I know,

670
00:29:56,061 --> 00:29:57,370
that's not open borders.

671
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,353
That's not,

672
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,080
you know,

673
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,340
what all migrants in that's

674
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,240
more of a way I think to organize,

675
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,400
organize a state.

676
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,553
Mm.

677
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:15,243
Mm.

678
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,910
I'm not really too concerned with

679
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,650
the Jews so much.

680
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,680
Don't really understand why.

681
00:30:32,681 --> 00:30:34,600
That's why is that such a big thing in the

682
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,013
hmm?

683
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,450
Mm,

684
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,180
mm,

685
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,180
mm,

686
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,170

mm.

699
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,570
As little Sunday night
rather than a few days ago.

700
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,360
Just simple stupid shit.

701
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,830
Mm MM.

702
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,230
Wow.

703
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:18,210
There was a comment that
was held for review.

704
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,280
It's interesting.

705
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,540
I don't understand why that's.

706
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,440
I don't pay a whole lot of attention to,

707
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:34,933
to a

708
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,440
Jewish conspiracy theories.

709
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,240
Mm.

710
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,490
I really don't make too much sense to me.

711
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,483
Mm,

712
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:44,643
mm,

713
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,703
mm,

714
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,263
mm,

715
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:57,920
mm,

716
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,770
mm,

717
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,770
mm.

718
00:33:13,550 --> 00:33:14,840
The idea that

719
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,240
Jews are behind

720
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,710
most of the ills of the world,

721
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:29,700
I think most of the ills of a
world can be chalked up to people,

722
00:33:29,921 --> 00:33:30,754
not a

723
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,840
first a degradation in the family.

724
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,060
That's the primary reason in the
West for the breakdown of everything.

725
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,581
The breakdown.

726
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:45,870
I don't even know what that means.

727
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:49,361
You know,

728
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:54,361
the thing is if people wanted to get
up and start making noise like is being

729
00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:56,560
done in France,

730
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,213
then

731
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,740
things would change.

732
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:02,360
You know,

733
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,360
Frank Douglas has a famous quote that
power concedes nothing unless people

734
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:08,924
demand of it,

735
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:09,950
and that's the truth.

736
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,020
If people don't get out in the streets,

737
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,330
then nothing happens.

738
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:55,743
Mm

739
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,103
minimalism

740
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,030
or anything?

741
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,743
Mm.

742
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:39,050
Mm,

743
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,640
mm.

744
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,070
I don't know that much about

745
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:49,993
way of life.

746
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,163
What do you mean

747
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,291
minimalism?

748
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:59,240
Like doing the least amount of
what's required to get by in life?

749
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,020
Working part time.

750
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:06,203
What do you mean?

751
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,190
Mm.

752
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,890
I don't quite understand what you mean
by it's Jordan Peterson's guitar son.

753
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,830
This isn't his son,

754
00:36:19,831 --> 00:36:20,664
man.

755
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:22,863
MMM.

756
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:26,050
This isn't a Julian.

757
00:36:26,051 --> 00:36:27,160
This isn't Julian.

758
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:31,550
This is some guy who's
only met Peterson once

759
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:35,200
and that was only at one of his lectures.

760
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:39,430
Basically it was all the
money that I made up youtube.

761
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:43,740
I felt kind of obligated
to give back a little bit.

762
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,060
How dare you resent your,

763
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,903
uh,

764
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,360
minimalistic way of life
living on minimal things.

765
00:36:57,361 --> 00:36:58,410
Anti-Capitalism,

766
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,180
living in a van,

767
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,140
having one plate,

768
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:02,951
one spoon,

769
00:37:02,951 --> 00:37:04,480
and barely any necessity

770
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,850
living in a van.

771
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,283
I don't

772
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:13,673
know

773
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:21,030
that van would have to be fairly
nice size having one plate.

774
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:21,211
Yeah.

775
00:37:21,211 --> 00:37:24,990
I'm cool with having one plate and one
set of utensils until you get people that

776
00:37:24,991 --> 00:37:26,820
come over and then what
the hell do you do then?

777
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,013
You know,

778
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,240
now if it's a girl you can
eat off the same plate,

779
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:35,550
but it's a bunch of people you don't know.

780
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:40,390
Not Everybody's going to want to eat off
that one plate and use the same floor

781
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:41,243
work.

782
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,820
Living in a van.

783
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,390
There's a whole lot of
people who live in vans now.

784
00:37:58,391 --> 00:37:59,350
It's kind of a big thing

785
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,181
living in an rv.

786
00:38:02,181 --> 00:38:03,140
He's living in vans.

787
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,820
I guess in San Francisco.

788
00:38:04,821 --> 00:38:08,240
A lot of people have to live in their
vehicles because they can't afford

789
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:10,240
it.

790
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,380
Can't afford the real estate prices,

791
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,150
whether it be renting or owning

792
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,630
adjunct professors have to live in vans.

793
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,410
People involved in Silicon
Valley and live in vans.

794
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:25,823
That kind of sucks.

795
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,533
Hm,

796
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:32,023
okay.

797
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:35,940
Mm.

798
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,370
I think that if a,

799
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:52,920
I wanted to travel,

800
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,560
maybe living in a van
would be a cool thing,

801
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:56,394
but

802
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,360
I'm not interested that interested in
traveling around the United States right

803
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:03,594
now.

804
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,220
Minimal things anti-capitalism.

805
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:22,850
Well,

806
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:24,350
I got another little rant for you.

807
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:25,550
You know,

808
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:30,550
trump's whole thing with
food chain and blaming China

809
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:32,573
four.

810
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,211
Well,

811
00:39:37,211 --> 00:39:38,950
I don't know exactly what
he's blaming China for,

812
00:39:38,951 --> 00:39:39,784
but you know,

813
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,880
United States companies moved to
China and though Chinese work in them,

814
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:50,260
there's still a lot of
American corporations that

815
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:53,521
basically,

816
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:54,750
or making things

817
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:01,390
and the reason that a lot of the things
that are made cheaply is because the

818
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,050
bids are so low,

819
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,321
you know,

820
00:40:04,321 --> 00:40:05,154
you,

821
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,770
you can only do,

822
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,370
you can only make so much of something.

823
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:15,440
You can only keep the quality of something
so high when you're being paid so

824
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:16,274
much.

825
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:17,863
So.

826
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,040
No,

827
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,873
that's,

828
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:22,910
that's,

829
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:23,743
uh,

830
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,543
that's what I've heard.

831
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,640
But they probably do steel.

832
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,350
I mean,

833
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,183
China is not good.

834
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,790
That's not a good place in
that they steal a lot of the,

835
00:40:37,791 --> 00:40:38,624
uh,

836
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,230
a lot of,

837
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,063
uh,

838
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,970
technology when they can.

839
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,950
But I've kind of find it interesting that
people would think that a state would

840
00:40:49,951 --> 00:40:52,650
not mean a state is ruthless.

841
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,633
You know what I mean?

842
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:55,710
Our federal government is ruthless.

843
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:57,303
Um,

844
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:00,831
you know,

845
00:41:00,831 --> 00:41:02,540
when you're in the Geo political game,

846
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,060
I don't think that there are any rules.

847
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,540
I think it's basically
what you can get away with.

848
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:10,280
Um,

849
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,113
and that's it.

850
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,263
No.

851
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,680
When there's egg on your face
when you take a step back,

852
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,543
but it's

853
00:41:18,890 --> 00:41:19,723
uh,

854
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:21,663
it's a different

855
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,270
set of arrangements.

856
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,143
Um,

857
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:32,500
[inaudible] you have any questions?

858
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:33,350
Any other questions?

859
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,170
One of these lights?

860
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:04,970
I don't know.

861
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:05,803
It's kind of bright.

862
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:10,781
Yeah.

863
00:42:10,781 --> 00:42:11,111
Haven't noticed.

864
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,010
There's a lot of people that

865
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:14,343
really

866
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:18,340
got upset with Jordan.

867
00:42:18,341 --> 00:42:19,690
Peterson of the Kevin thing,

868
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,313
whatever.

869
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,960
I'm not hanging on some guys.

870
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,030
Every words on twitter.

871
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,750
Oh God.

872
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,620
It's so funny.

873
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:42,160
So many different camps on the Internet,

874
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,180
on Youtube.

875
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,440
It doesn't resemble the world that much.

876
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,893
Real world.

877
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:01,460
I don't know that many original songs,

878
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:02,380
so I can't play you.

879
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,543
I used to,

880
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:08,230
I used to do on guitar was
learning other people's songs,

881
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,260
but probably for five,

882
00:43:11,350 --> 00:43:12,340
six years I.

883
00:43:18,850 --> 00:43:20,160
where is all this going,

884
00:43:20,190 --> 00:43:21,023
Bruh?

885
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,150
Division in this country is
getting pretty out of hand.

886
00:43:24,151 --> 00:43:25,530
Is Social media to blame?

887
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:27,660
Well,

888
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:28,493
I don't know.

889
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:32,860
I don't know anything,

890
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:33,723
but

891
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:36,150
where is all this going?

892
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,523
Probably

893
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:46,470
probably just more division.

894
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:49,410
I couldn't see it going.

895
00:43:49,411 --> 00:43:54,411
I couldn't really see it going anywhere
else besides that right now is social

896
00:43:56,541 --> 00:43:57,620
media to blame?

897
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:00,373
Well,

898
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:06,710
I believe that with Youtube
and all specifically youtube,

899
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:07,980
you have the comments section,

900
00:44:07,981 --> 00:44:08,814
you have a video,

901
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:10,210
you watch something,

902
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:11,520
you know,

903
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,990
you got an idea or something,

904
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:14,850
so you want to jot it down on the,

905
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:15,684
uh,

906
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:16,683
um,

907
00:44:16,770 --> 00:44:20,270
in the comments section and
then you think that you're,

908
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:20,791
you know,

909
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,410
you're responding to somebody.

910
00:44:22,470 --> 00:44:24,630
I think I've heard Sam Harris
say something about this.

911
00:44:24,930 --> 00:44:28,560
It might've been somebody else
and you think that you're,

912
00:44:30,950 --> 00:44:31,660
you're

913
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:33,820
entering into a
conversation with somebody,

914
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:34,900
you know what I mean?

915
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:35,291
Like there's,

916
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:37,420
this dialogue is being
opened up and there's not,

917
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:38,441
you know,

918
00:44:38,441 --> 00:44:39,260
it's basically,

919
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:39,551
oh,

920
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:42,490
I think it was Shapiro at some
point you said something about that.

921
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:43,851
The idea is,

922
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:46,960
is that somebody posts a comment and you
post a comment and somebody has already

923
00:44:46,961 --> 00:44:47,890
moved on,

924
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:48,820
you know,

925
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,653
their,

926
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,773
uh,

927
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,493
the uh,

928
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:55,630
the context isn't

929
00:44:58,090 --> 00:44:58,923
there anymore,

930
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,003
I don't know,

931
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,110
but social media to blame,

932
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,460
you know,

933
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,480
people face to face and people in the
comments section or two entirely different

934
00:45:07,481 --> 00:45:08,314
things

935
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,580
and people get really upset and

936
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:15,663
about her

937
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:17,160
in comment sections.

938
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:18,720
That probably wouldn't happen

939
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:20,400
then I'm

940
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:25,760
probably wouldn't happen
in real life in reality.

941
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,633
Yeah,

942
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,790
I don't know where it's gone.

943
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:35,811
Like I said,

944
00:45:35,811 --> 00:45:36,644
more division.

945
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:38,960
Um,

946
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:44,721
put the guitar down.

947
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:45,271
When you speak,

948
00:45:45,271 --> 00:45:46,970
he's use your hands to emphasize points.

949
00:45:46,971 --> 00:45:48,590
You'll be a much stronger speaker.

950
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,463
Oh,

951
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:52,790
I didn't know this was a toastmasters

952
00:45:55,510 --> 00:45:56,343
wasn't aware.

953
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,160
God,

954
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,611
look at me.

955
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:04,780
I'm in the corner of a room.

956
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,900
I used to have a little studio.

957
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,173
Um,

958
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,353
mm.

959
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:19,110
Mm,

960
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,950
mm,

961
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,830
mm.

962
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:42,510
Mm.

963
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,430
No,

964
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:45,263
no.

965
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,060
You got anything else?

966
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:55,243
Mm,

967
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:56,973
mm,

968
00:46:57,790 --> 00:46:58,890
mm,

969
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:00,750
mm,

970
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,390
mm,

971
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:04,410
mm,

972
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,640
mm,

973
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:13,323
mm,

974
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:21,443
mm,

975
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:27,713
mm,

976
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,080
mm,

977
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:33,200
mm,

978
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:34,693
mm,

979
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:36,423
mm,

980
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,063
mm,

981
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,393
mm,

982
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,493
mm,

983
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:44,763
mm,

984
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:46,023
mm,

985
00:47:46,190 --> 00:47:47,023
mm,

986
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,253
mm.

987
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:52,150
And that just go on,

988
00:47:52,470 --> 00:47:53,303
loop around,

989
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:53,861
around.

990
00:47:53,861 --> 00:47:55,240
And then finally I came up with

991
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:56,353
mm,

992
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:58,280
mm,

993
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,113
mm,

994
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:01,743
mm,

995
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:03,453
mm,

996
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:06,000
mm.

997
00:48:07,430 --> 00:48:08,263
Bit Darker.

998
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,240
Mm mm,

999
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:12,523
mm,

1000
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:13,790
mm,

1001
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:15,630
mm,

1002
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:17,840
mm,

1003
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:20,150
mm,

1004
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,313
mm,

1005
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:23,623
mm,

1006
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:26,993
mm.

1007
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:31,771
Yeah.

1008
00:48:31,771 --> 00:48:32,910
They are looking kind of batty.

1009
00:48:35,030 --> 00:48:35,990
They are birds.

1010
00:48:36,230 --> 00:48:37,660
Weight bats are birds.

1011
00:48:37,661 --> 00:48:38,494
Are they?

1012
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:44,860
This is El Dragon.

1013
00:48:45,070 --> 00:48:46,720
I asked because I am the former.

1014
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,280
How do I turn off having
to review comments.

1015
00:48:52,281 --> 00:48:54,110
I don't want to have to
review people's comments.

1016
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,380
I asked because I am the former.

1017
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:00,214
You,

1018
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:04,600
the vitriol between the
groups left and right.

1019
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,130
Black white is as bad or even worse
than than the prewar Yugoslavia.

1020
00:49:09,970 --> 00:49:10,211
Oh,

1021
00:49:10,211 --> 00:49:11,140
I don't know much

1022
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,870
about Eastern Europe.

1023
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:15,563
I mean,

1024
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:19,840
the most I know about you could Slavia
is what I've heard from Chris Hedges.

1025
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:25,570
Vision is fishing.

1026
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:27,261
Well,

1027
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:29,480
I don't know that its vision

1028
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,020
using union is fusion.

1029
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,500
Mm mm,

1030
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,430
mm.

1031
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:50,813
Mm.

1032
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:52,083
Mm.

1033
00:49:58,600 --> 00:49:59,433
Yeah.

1034
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:01,790
It's kind of Nice being able to

1035
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,293
take

1036
00:50:07,710 --> 00:50:10,560
scientific concepts and apply them to

1037
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,460
other areas in life.

1038
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,513
Hmm.

1039
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,130
Character of Jesus Christ is fishing.

1040
00:50:56,230 --> 00:50:58,140
I don't know anything about that.

1041
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:18,921
What do you think?

1042
00:51:18,921 --> 00:51:20,420
Jesus Christ came to divide.

1043
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:21,980
Oh,

1044
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,230
is that what that is about?

1045
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,620
The Salvation Army band.

1046
00:51:25,870 --> 00:51:29,120
I don't know if somebody
was blasting some music.

1047
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:30,710
I heard a uh.

1048
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:30,951
Oh,

1049
00:51:30,951 --> 00:51:31,191
you know,

1050
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:31,551
you're right.

1051
00:51:31,551 --> 00:51:32,181
That's what it is.

1052
00:51:32,181 --> 00:51:32,711
It's the,

1053
00:51:32,711 --> 00:51:33,450
uh,

1054
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,870
the subdivision that I live in,

1055
00:51:35,871 --> 00:51:39,020
the homeowner's association
is really involved,

1056
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,460
so there's a,

1057
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:45,320
a it bring the firetrucks around.

1058
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:49,850
I'll have music playing

1059
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:01,260
this Christmas will be a
little bit more difficult.

1060
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:06,510
Well this whole past few months have
been difficult because my father died in

1061
00:52:06,511 --> 00:52:07,344
July,

1062
00:52:10,230 --> 00:52:11,250
has been tough.

1063
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,790
Mm MM.

1064
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:40,841
Yeah.

1065
00:52:40,841 --> 00:52:41,674
I don't really

1066
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,030
have that much more to,

1067
00:52:50,790 --> 00:52:53,910
and they contribute
and lost the dashboard.

1068
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:00,800
How did he pass?

1069
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:10,893
Um,

1070
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:15,613
well,

1071
00:53:16,380 --> 00:53:17,300
didn't have cancer.

1072
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:19,820
The cancers would kill them.

1073
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,920
I think an infection in his money

1074
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,193
and infection,

1075
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:28,600
I believe killed him.

1076
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,653
Yeah.

1077
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,820
He had a soft Gel,

1078
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:50,940
cancer in 2004.

1079
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,980
He was involved in an auto accident,

1080
00:53:53,010 --> 00:53:53,843
which he,

1081
00:53:53,950 --> 00:53:54,800
it was a not,

1082
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,340
he wasn't at fault.

1083
00:53:56,341 --> 00:53:56,671
Basically.

1084
00:53:56,671 --> 00:53:59,220
He was at a red light and
a guy driving a vehicle

1085
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,280
dropped his phone when I had a to go
grab his phone and instead of hitting the

1086
00:54:07,221 --> 00:54:12,221
brake pedal the gas pedal and accelerated
into my dad sitting at a red light.

1087
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,440
And of course you know,

1088
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:16,520
is a domino effect.

1089
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:18,390
My Dad went ahead and hit another car,

1090
00:54:18,391 --> 00:54:19,760
so it was a bad accident for him.

1091
00:54:19,761 --> 00:54:22,250
And a few other people in my dad had some

1092
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:24,920
extremely bad headaches.

1093
00:54:24,921 --> 00:54:26,030
So he would take it,

1094
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:30,520
be popping tylenol three
or four a day and a

1095
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,770
sure enough,

1096
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,793
um,

1097
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,580
once his cancer was diagnosed
and we were surprised that it,

1098
00:54:42,770 --> 00:54:47,770
that it wasn't as far as we could
tell primarily in his lungs.

1099
00:54:48,830 --> 00:54:51,020
That is a soften that,

1100
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:53,870
so there's a correlation
that's been found,

1101
00:54:53,930 --> 00:54:54,763
a,

1102
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:59,980
there's medical articles that found
a correlation between asset ace and

1103
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,873
medicine,

1104
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,020
which is something that allows the
medication to be absorbed quicker.

1105
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:08,430
I believe as a metaphor,

1106
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,230
a metaphor.

1107
00:55:09,230 --> 00:55:11,330
It's like tylenol and asymmetric when,

1108
00:55:11,331 --> 00:55:13,250
like when you get a hydrocodone,

1109
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:15,480
hydrocodone for pain reliever,

1110
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,660
like when you have your
wisdom tooth pulled out,

1111
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:20,390
which I just had recently,

1112
00:55:20,391 --> 00:55:21,890
you probably can't see it on the screen,

1113
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:23,600
but um,

1114
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:29,450
I believe that allows your body
to absorb the pain reliever,

1115
00:55:29,670 --> 00:55:30,650
the hydrocodone,

1116
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:32,450
the opioid more effectively.

1117
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:33,110
Um,

1118
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:34,450
but uh,

1119
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:36,770
as a matter of fin is also correlated

1120
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:38,550
with a,

1121
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:39,383
like an

1122
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:43,460
longterm use is correlated
with esophageal cancer.

1123
00:55:45,690 --> 00:55:46,523
So

1124
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,390
for awhile I thought that's what
Gildan tylenol and not cigarettes.

1125
00:55:51,391 --> 00:55:53,070
He smoked cigarettes quite a bit,

1126
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:55,830
but I don't think it was cigarettes,

1127
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:56,401
you know,

1128
00:55:56,401 --> 00:55:59,040
some people have the genes for it and
some people don't and I don't think the

1129
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:00,060
cigarettes when we've got them.

1130
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,173
Um,

1131
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,413
so

1132
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,213
yeah,

1133
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,760
open up a bit about yourself.

1134
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:17,761
Well,

1135
00:56:17,761 --> 00:56:18,660
my mind's gone blank.

1136
00:56:18,661 --> 00:56:19,494
I don't know.

1137
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:21,623
What do you want to know?

1138
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,020
I didn't know that.

1139
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,310
It's made from the poison

1140
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:25,390
from apricots,

1141
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:29,170
like what does it synthesized
from the Afrikaans or something?

1142
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,313
I don't know.

1143
00:56:32,780 --> 00:56:34,610
Cancer is a rebellion within the body.

1144
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,173
Yeah.

1145
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:45,380
Yeah.

1146
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:45,831
Well I'm,

1147
00:56:45,831 --> 00:56:46,660
I'm upset.

1148
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:51,660
I'm the ad revenue that I was getting
from Peterson's reposting things pretty

1149
00:56:53,241 --> 00:56:54,340
substantial for awhile

1150
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,660
and you know,

1151
00:56:57,710 --> 00:56:59,360
Youtube sent me a letter saying,

1152
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,500
sent me a letter saying
that I need permission.

1153
00:57:05,501 --> 00:57:10,501
I went ahead and looked for an email
and of course I think it's Peterson's

1154
00:57:10,751 --> 00:57:11,351
publicist.

1155
00:57:11,351 --> 00:57:12,520
The handle is emails,

1156
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:17,740
but I was hoping to maybe get and eat,

1157
00:57:18,030 --> 00:57:18,863
uh,

1158
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:20,710
an email from him or somebody

1159
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:26,410
so that I could go ahead and forward that
to youtube and maybe get my channelry

1160
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,280
monetized.

1161
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:30,473
I

1162
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,353
mean like,

1163
00:57:32,550 --> 00:57:33,383
um,

1164
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:37,843
yeah.

1165
00:57:44,990 --> 00:57:47,030
So that may not happen

1166
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:48,613
and

1167
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,020
if it doesn't then I should find
something else to do with this.

1168
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:55,450
With this channel.

1169
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,400
Your commentary on
Peterson is permissible.

1170
00:58:00,590 --> 00:58:00,771
Yeah.

1171
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:02,030
But is it monetizeable?

1172
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:05,030
You know what I mean?

1173
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,860
I didn't start doing the
clip thing for the money,

1174
00:58:09,861 --> 00:58:13,640
but when the money started rolling
it was kind of Nice and I thought,

1175
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:13,791
oh,

1176
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:14,870
this is decent,

1177
00:58:14,871 --> 00:58:15,561
this is decent.

1178
00:58:15,561 --> 00:58:17,960
And they're just like hockey sticked

1179
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:19,733
and then,

1180
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:23,720
and then when I,

1181
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:28,930
the the video that I uploaded that get
the most views and the shortest amount of

1182
00:58:29,511 --> 00:58:32,660
time was an accident because I
was clipping like five minute,

1183
00:58:33,170 --> 00:58:34,640
five minute long clips.

1184
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:36,283
No.

1185
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:37,483
And

1186
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,640
I accidentally put a posted because I had
ripped the video and then I went ahead

1187
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:47,580
and clicked it like I had
like three clips done.

1188
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:50,940
And then I excellent
closed one of the folders.

1189
00:58:50,941 --> 00:58:52,500
So I went pack open the folder,

1190
00:58:52,501 --> 00:58:53,430
drag it over to the,

1191
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:54,300
to the uh,

1192
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:59,300
upload thing and I'm uploaded it and
I'm thinking I'm looking at it thinking

1193
00:59:03,121 --> 00:59:03,751
what the hell?

1194
00:59:03,751 --> 00:59:06,930
And it took 15 minutes to upload and it
was getting stock interview right after

1195
00:59:06,931 --> 00:59:07,500
the cat,

1196
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,333
Kathy Newman.

1197
00:59:08,910 --> 00:59:09,721
And I'm sitting here like,

1198
00:59:09,721 --> 00:59:10,381
what the hell?

1199
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:11,940
Why did this video take so long?

1200
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,320
Why is it taking so long to upload?

1201
00:59:13,530 --> 00:59:15,510
And of course I'm doing something else,

1202
00:59:15,511 --> 00:59:16,010
you know,

1203
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,610
I have a desktop computer.

1204
00:59:17,611 --> 00:59:20,940
I was doing something talking to my
friends and I go back and look at my.

1205
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:22,840
And I go back and I'm,

1206
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,110
what the hell is taken so long?

1207
00:59:24,111 --> 00:59:24,711
And sure enough,

1208
00:59:24,711 --> 00:59:26,330
I have uploaded the full,

1209
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:28,970
the full video and out of sheer laziness,

1210
00:59:28,971 --> 00:59:29,900
I just thought to myself,

1211
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,580
I'm not even gonna worry about it.

1212
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,920
I'm just gonna Hey Joe,

1213
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:37,820
I'm just going to let it
hang out and whatever.

1214
00:59:38,150 --> 00:59:39,220
I'll just get up Rhonda,

1215
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,620
load another video and then sure enough,

1216
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:44,690
20 minutes go by and you know,

1217
00:59:44,691 --> 00:59:45,381
I would check,

1218
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,040
uh,

1219
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:50,240
I would check the analytics and
I'm looking at it and you know,

1220
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,113
I'm

1221
00:59:52,430 --> 00:59:54,410
pretty good about

1222
00:59:57,050 --> 00:59:59,060
what statistics I should be following on.

1223
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:01,070
I'm not good with statistics,

1224
01:00:01,071 --> 01:00:04,040
but average is I should be following.

1225
01:00:04,041 --> 01:00:04,461
And it was like,

1226
01:00:04,461 --> 01:00:04,671
man,

1227
01:00:04,671 --> 01:00:05,600
this is like way,

1228
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:11,540
way beyond what I thought and then then
I just kinda got greedy at that point.

1229
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,150
I just started just what the hell.

1230
01:00:14,330 --> 01:00:19,250
And just start like taking
until you hand gets slapped.

1231
01:00:21,050 --> 01:00:21,441
Well,

1232
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:22,274
I mean,

1233
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:23,091
you know,

1234
01:00:23,091 --> 01:00:23,960
it's just like,

1235
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:28,850
you wonder why things
don't change in the states,

1236
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:29,151
you know,

1237
01:00:29,151 --> 01:00:32,660
why you have a for profit healthcare
system that the insurance companies own

1238
01:00:32,661 --> 01:00:34,370
everything and you know,

1239
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:34,940
everyone's,

1240
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,350
everyone wants to make it out.

1241
01:00:36,351 --> 01:00:36,591
Like,

1242
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,220
oh,

1243
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:38,060
can't change.

1244
01:00:38,061 --> 01:00:39,230
And it's for the better.

1245
01:00:39,231 --> 01:00:40,064
And

1246
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:42,560
that's bullshit.

1247
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:44,550
The only reason it doesn't change,

1248
01:00:44,551 --> 01:00:45,950
just because you don't see
people out in the street,

1249
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,784
like in France,

1250
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:49,070
I mean it's so bad in the states that,

1251
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:54,240
that doctors make mistakes and people
die and people aren't accountable.

1252
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:57,740
And in Europe there

1253
01:00:59,440 --> 01:00:59,921
they're uh,

1254
01:00:59,921 --> 01:01:00,581
in France,

1255
01:01:00,581 --> 01:01:01,414
they're a,

1256
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,783
there a,

1257
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,193
what do you call it,

1258
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:09,873
a,

1259
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:15,550
they're protesting over diesel tax and
people are dying in the states because of

1260
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:20,390
malpractice because they're not
valuable enough because they can't,

1261
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:22,280
they don't have as much money,

1262
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,330
you know,

1263
01:01:23,330 --> 01:01:27,050
their insurance company is not the
company that is not the type of insurance

1264
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:28,460
that your doctor will take.

1265
01:01:28,461 --> 01:01:32,180
Lucky for me at the few
things that I've had recently,

1266
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,160
I've just been able to pay with cash,

1267
01:01:34,161 --> 01:01:35,190
but you know,

1268
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,640
that's not the case with a,

1269
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,030
with a lot of people.

1270
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,083
Hey Adam.

1271
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:45,050
But yeah,

1272
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:47,060
things won't change in
the states until people

1273
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:50,630
get up.

1274
01:01:50,630 --> 01:01:52,100
Which now,

1275
01:01:52,170 --> 01:01:53,003
I don't know.

1276
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:57,560
The states seemed like the most
isolated nation on planet earth.

1277
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,410
Cash is king.

1278
01:02:02,411 --> 01:02:03,244
Who is the Queen?

1279
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,240
I don't know.

1280
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:08,773
How old are you?

1281
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,213
Really old?

1282
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:15,160
Let me guess.

1283
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:16,203
Credit.

1284
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:18,581
Yeah,

1285
01:02:18,581 --> 01:02:19,020
I've,

1286
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:19,320
I've,

1287
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:20,070
I've heard that the

1288
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:25,070
average person has $60,000
in credit card debt.

1289
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:28,963
That's unreal.

1290
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,090
I just use my,

1291
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:33,820
uh,

1292
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:38,020
I just use my credit card to build credit,

1293
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:38,860
you know what I mean?

1294
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,710
Keeping the account open
for six months to a year.

1295
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:43,390
Close it open.

1296
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:44,224
Another one.

1297
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,450
We're ruled by Queen.

1298
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:48,441
I'm doing good.

1299
01:02:48,441 --> 01:02:50,470
I only have 59,000.

1300
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:55,311
Yes,

1301
01:02:55,311 --> 01:02:55,411
I'm,

1302
01:02:55,411 --> 01:02:56,244
I'm 31.

1303
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,310
We are ruled by Queen.

1304
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:03,450
Oh,

1305
01:03:03,450 --> 01:03:04,283
that means.

1306
01:03:10,230 --> 01:03:10,411
Yeah,

1307
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:11,244
there's not a whole lot.

1308
01:03:14,140 --> 01:03:16,120
I never enter into these
with really anything to

1309
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:18,911
say.

1310
01:03:18,911 --> 01:03:19,744
Partly because I'm

1311
01:03:21,160 --> 01:03:21,993
lazy.

1312
01:03:22,510 --> 01:03:22,980
I mean this,

1313
01:03:22,980 --> 01:03:25,810
this entire thing was a
test to see if my dslr would

1314
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:28,600
with handled the

1315
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:33,863
would handle

1316
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,203
will be functional.

1317
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:40,483
It is.

1318
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:44,220
I think next time we'll change the lenses
so I get a bit of f stop so I don't

1319
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:45,060
have to use this.

1320
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,360
I don't have to use this light.

1321
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:50,070
I turned it down.

1322
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:55,740
Delays so much on the computer
that I can immediately tell.

1323
01:03:55,741 --> 01:03:56,574
What

1324
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,010
did we pass your test?

1325
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:09,273
Yeah.

1326
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:10,480
Oh,

1327
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,313
Adam,

1328
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:13,540
if you're still here.

1329
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:15,513
Um,

1330
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:16,301
funny enough.

1331
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:18,550
Before you posted that Richard Wolf,

1332
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:20,860
that video on Richard Wolff,

1333
01:04:21,070 --> 01:04:22,270
I had actually been watching,

1334
01:04:23,420 --> 01:04:24,253
um,

1335
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:29,900
I had been watching things on like Russia,

1336
01:04:29,901 --> 01:04:30,734
TV,

1337
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:31,700
Russia,

1338
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:32,151
America,

1339
01:04:32,151 --> 01:04:37,151
that channel and along with
Chris Hedges on contact,

1340
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:41,800
I had seen Richard Wolf and not,

1341
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:43,950
I don't really know so much about the.

1342
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,193
Oh,

1343
01:04:58,720 --> 01:04:59,553
hold on.

1344
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,240
The camera died.

1345
01:05:04,340 --> 01:05:05,370
Let me replace the battery.

1346
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:25,261
Well,

1347
01:05:25,261 --> 01:05:25,590
we got.

1348
01:05:25,590 --> 01:05:26,423
No,

1349
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:31,060
no,

1350
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:32,160
that's the battery's dead.

1351
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:35,080
No.

1352
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:36,953
Yeah.

1353
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:44,503
Okay.

1354
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:47,180
Sounds like he's wrestling liberals.

1355
01:05:49,690 --> 01:05:54,690
Uh,

1356
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:13,010
and this is a,

1357
01:06:14,410 --> 01:06:15,500
this is kind of difficult.

1358
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,430
Oh Damn.

1359
01:06:25,430 --> 01:06:27,320
Delay is so bad on the
computer that I can't.

1360
01:07:06,800 --> 01:07:06,951
Oh,

1361
01:07:06,951 --> 01:07:07,784
nice.

1362
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:08,650
Should,

1363
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:09,590
should be able to see me now.

1364
01:07:17,190 --> 01:07:17,431
Well,

1365
01:07:17,431 --> 01:07:18,264
you know,

1366
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:27,990
I don't really like the whole
idea of hating liberals.

1367
01:07:28,730 --> 01:07:29,460
You know,

1368
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:30,540
the whole idea was that

1369
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:32,970
there again,

1370
01:07:32,970 --> 01:07:36,000
the same people that bought the better
living standards of the American employee

1371
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,490
were socialists and communists,

1372
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:42,300
the industrial workers of the world
marching in the early 20th century,

1373
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:45,900
striking alongside workers as they
could have a better living standard.

1374
01:07:46,230 --> 01:07:48,780
Those people were
liberals and there again,

1375
01:07:48,781 --> 01:07:51,990
if they hadn't existed that,

1376
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:52,411
you know,

1377
01:07:52,411 --> 01:07:53,910
the majority of us would,

1378
01:07:54,490 --> 01:07:55,323
uh.

1379
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:56,101
Well,

1380
01:07:56,101 --> 01:07:57,900
I can understand your
thing with abortion there,

1381
01:07:57,901 --> 01:07:58,530
Joe,

1382
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:03,530
but the whole idea that if they hadn't
existed that the American worker would be

1383
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,860
paid probably as much
as the Chinese worker,

1384
01:08:07,861 --> 01:08:08,694
if not less.

1385
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:09,983
I mean,

1386
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:11,160
you know,

1387
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,450
the American living standard,

1388
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,040
we owe unfold,

1389
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:15,290
but unfortunately,

1390
01:08:15,290 --> 01:08:16,130
but we owe

1391
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:20,390
to people who were self-described
communists and socialists in a large,

1392
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,253
in large part

1393
01:08:23,570 --> 01:08:25,490
had the strikes occurred without them,

1394
01:08:25,820 --> 01:08:26,271
I don't know,

1395
01:08:26,271 --> 01:08:27,170
but they were the,

1396
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:28,323
uh,

1397
01:08:28,930 --> 01:08:30,200
the industrial workers of the world.

1398
01:08:30,201 --> 01:08:32,720
The wobblies were the
ones that get the credit.

1399
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,790
You don't learn that in school that much.

1400
01:08:37,820 --> 01:08:39,530
So I don't like the idea of really hating

1401
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:41,611
liberals,

1402
01:08:41,611 --> 01:08:42,444
but

1403
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:46,010
I guess I guess the whole thing is that,

1404
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:46,401
you know,

1405
01:08:46,401 --> 01:08:46,601
it's,

1406
01:08:46,601 --> 01:08:47,840
it's a catchall term

1407
01:08:50,580 --> 01:08:51,271
in a lot of ways.

1408
01:08:51,271 --> 01:08:52,480
There's a lot of catch all terms,

1409
01:08:52,481 --> 01:08:53,314
like

1410
01:08:55,420 --> 01:08:58,180
neoliberalism is a catchall,

1411
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:08,370
but I guess yeah,

1412
01:09:08,370 --> 01:09:09,290
I could see what you mean.

1413
01:09:09,370 --> 01:09:09,650
I mean,

1414
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,970
I don't even consider kids out
in the street and colleges,

1415
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:12,481
liberals,

1416
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:13,170
they're just,

1417
01:09:13,170 --> 01:09:16,070
they're just kids doing stupid shit.

1418
01:09:16,130 --> 01:09:18,800
Maybe they didn't get the anchor of
their system when they were young,

1419
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:20,723
you know?

1420
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,093
I don't know.

1421
01:09:36,820 --> 01:09:37,653
So yeah,

1422
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:46,210
I don't,

1423
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:47,043
uh,

1424
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,400
I don't really want to play any,

1425
01:09:53,401 --> 01:09:54,234
um,

1426
01:09:55,590 --> 01:10:00,590
any youtube videos because like playing
on the screen because if I do that I

1427
01:10:04,441 --> 01:10:06,360
could get a copy struck,

1428
01:10:07,930 --> 01:10:08,880
you know what I mean?

1429
01:10:09,870 --> 01:10:10,710
Don't want that.

1430
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,310
That's the one thing I'm happy about is
that I only have to deal with copyright

1431
01:10:16,311 --> 01:10:17,210
strikes right now.

1432
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:22,910
Jordan Peterson's maps.

1433
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:23,271
A meeting.

1434
01:10:23,271 --> 01:10:24,560
That's not a good title.

1435
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:32,880
Does the truth hang out?

1436
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:33,723
That's a better.

1437
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,013
Yeah.

1438
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,030
I mean,

1439
01:10:52,030 --> 01:10:54,220
I don't have anybody on here to talk with,

1440
01:10:54,221 --> 01:10:55,054
so

1441
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:11,240
my face has a box on it.

1442
01:11:11,241 --> 01:11:12,074
I'll fix that.

1443
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:27,090
It's a leveling function.

1444
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:31,651
Oh No,

1445
01:11:31,651 --> 01:11:32,550
I'm upside down.

1446
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:34,270
Okay.

1447
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:36,290
Um,

1448
01:11:36,290 --> 01:11:37,250
just like the penguins,

1449
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:37,821
the penguins are.

1450
01:11:37,821 --> 01:11:38,654
Writes that up.

1451
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:41,541
Yeah,

1452
01:11:41,541 --> 01:11:42,374
it's better now.

1453
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:51,080
Yep.

1454
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:51,913
And I am.

1455
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:58,460
Hmm.

1456
01:11:59,860 --> 01:12:01,480
What's more enjoyable for the penguins?

1457
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,330
So I don't know what to do.

1458
01:12:04,660 --> 01:12:09,010
Maybe I should bring the camera with
me and film me installing a kitchen.

1459
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,790
Maybe overlay it with some commentary.

1460
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,790
I don't know how fitting it
would be for this channel.

1461
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:24,120
I have the idea of going back and actually
taking every single one of the videos

1462
01:12:25,361 --> 01:12:25,931
that I've put out,

1463
01:12:25,931 --> 01:12:28,180
which is probably an 800 now

1464
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:32,590
every single video and basically

1465
01:12:35,170 --> 01:12:40,030
cutting it up and putting commentary
over every single one so I can.

1466
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:41,853
Yeah,

1467
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:44,020
that might not be such a bad idea.

1468
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,593
That would

1469
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:48,270
potentially qualify,

1470
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:49,711
but then you know,

1471
01:12:49,711 --> 01:12:49,901
you,

1472
01:12:49,901 --> 01:12:50,790
you get 100,

1473
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:53,550
you get 100 videos in,

1474
01:12:55,900 --> 01:12:56,710
maybe not 100.

1475
01:12:56,710 --> 01:13:01,480
Maybe you get 60 videos in and don't even
know if you don't even know if you're

1476
01:13:01,481 --> 01:13:02,500
going to get monetized.

1477
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:04,390
I mean that's the whole point of this now.

1478
01:13:06,780 --> 01:13:07,613
No,

1479
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,120
I wouldn't let anybody fully it.

1480
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:10,740
Most people do this

1481
01:13:13,260 --> 01:13:14,093
for the money.

1482
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:15,750
No,

1483
01:13:15,750 --> 01:13:16,583
I certainly did.

1484
01:13:17,730 --> 01:13:18,720
Not to begin with,

1485
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:19,643
but

1486
01:13:25,510 --> 01:13:26,231
the snacks,

1487
01:13:26,231 --> 01:13:27,290
I don't know.

1488
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:28,630
Snacks and just peanuts,

1489
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,513
peanuts,

1490
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:32,533
almonds,

1491
01:13:35,060 --> 01:13:35,893
walnuts.

1492
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:37,183
Hazelnuts.

1493
01:13:47,770 --> 01:13:47,961
Yeah,

1494
01:13:47,961 --> 01:13:48,261
there.

1495
01:13:48,261 --> 01:13:49,094
I guess.

1496
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:50,760
No.

1497
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:51,930
For years for me,

1498
01:13:52,190 --> 01:13:54,090
they were basically a staple
and I put them in everything.

1499
01:13:54,091 --> 01:13:54,924
Soups.

1500
01:13:58,860 --> 01:13:59,693
Yeah.

1501
01:14:08,530 --> 01:14:09,363
Yeah.

1502
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,233
The street.

1503
01:14:10,260 --> 01:14:11,093
Chris.

1504
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:24,790
I had gotten that red
dead redemption game and

1505
01:14:26,650 --> 01:14:27,483
played it and

1506
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:32,070
about a ps four just to play that stupid
game and the only reason I'm going to.

1507
01:14:32,680 --> 01:14:35,980
The only reason I've kept the PS four
is to play final fantasy seven remake

1508
01:14:36,010 --> 01:14:37,830
comes out and then I'm going
to ditch the playstation

1509
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:39,713
because I don't.

1510
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:40,843
I

1511
01:14:42,060 --> 01:14:42,893
don't play

1512
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:45,410
console games that much.

1513
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,240
Just got to prove that the earth is flat.

1514
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:51,591
What's that?

1515
01:14:51,591 --> 01:14:52,424
Joe?

1516
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:58,140
Joe Can prove to us
that the earth is flat.

1517
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:59,860
Have you seen the South Park?

1518
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:01,110
Is Hamlet Red Dead Redemption?

1519
01:15:01,620 --> 01:15:02,340
Yeah.

1520
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:05,100
I saw a clip of it and I
thought it was hilarious.

1521
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,500
Oh

1522
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:08,700
God.

1523
01:15:08,700 --> 01:15:09,071
It is.

1524
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:09,780
It's,

1525
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:10,830
it's to a tee.

1526
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:13,471
I mean,

1527
01:15:13,471 --> 01:15:14,550
I played that thing.

1528
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:16,110
Okay,

1529
01:15:16,110 --> 01:15:17,250
so I'm self employed.

1530
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:18,833
So

1531
01:15:20,170 --> 01:15:21,003
what the.

1532
01:15:21,170 --> 01:15:22,020
Oh Man.

1533
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:23,730
Battery number two.

1534
01:15:23,731 --> 01:15:24,600
Debt gone.

1535
01:15:25,730 --> 01:15:26,131
Here we go.

1536
01:15:26,131 --> 01:15:26,570
Let's see.

1537
01:15:26,570 --> 01:15:27,403
We got to

1538
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,210
run out of batteries here.

1539
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,470
This may come to an early ending.

1540
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:46,750
I'm going to go ahead and
get one of those batteries.

1541
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,583
You plug in

1542
01:15:55,830 --> 01:15:56,940
remote shooting.

1543
01:16:09,510 --> 01:16:10,050
Oh,

1544
01:16:10,050 --> 01:16:10,883
what you mean?

1545
01:16:17,550 --> 01:16:17,880
Oh,

1546
01:16:17,880 --> 01:16:18,870
who's that box again?

1547
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:30,220
Get a Webcam that plugs into your pc.

1548
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:36,680
I've got a really nice dslr camera.

1549
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:38,660
I plugged it into my pc.

1550
01:16:40,410 --> 01:16:41,970
I think I'd rather use the DSLR.

1551
01:16:42,150 --> 01:16:43,050
I just need to get the.

1552
01:16:43,051 --> 01:16:43,884
A,

1553
01:16:46,060 --> 01:16:48,090
the battery that plugs into an outlet.

1554
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:51,643
You know what I mean,

1555
01:16:52,470 --> 01:16:53,303
know what I mean.

1556
01:16:54,420 --> 01:16:55,253
Can you guys

1557
01:16:58,020 --> 01:16:58,853
shit?

1558
01:16:59,610 --> 01:17:00,443
Can you see me?

1559
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:00,571
Oh,

1560
01:17:00,571 --> 01:17:01,770
you're seeing that crap again.

1561
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:04,203
Boy,

1562
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,113
a boy.

1563
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:11,753
Oh boy.

1564
01:17:12,590 --> 01:17:14,880
Let's see if we can fix this.

1565
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:19,071
Yes,

1566
01:17:19,071 --> 01:17:20,400
he is going on here.

1567
01:17:38,170 --> 01:17:39,003
Um,

1568
01:17:45,790 --> 01:17:46,623
what the hell?

1569
01:17:48,740 --> 01:17:49,573
Huh?

1570
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:13,323
There we go.

1571
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:45,833
Oh Shit.

1572
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:47,303
That looks terrible.

1573
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:50,353
Going on there.

1574
01:18:53,510 --> 01:18:54,343
Okay.

1575
01:18:54,590 --> 01:18:55,423
Sorry guys.

1576
01:19:00,010 --> 01:19:00,843
Sorry about that.

1577
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:11,770
Don't tip pizza delivery person to
deliver out number of pizzas licensed.

1578
01:19:11,771 --> 01:19:14,370
They've already had
their tip from your meal.

1579
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:21,570
What about if you've got a,

1580
01:19:21,700 --> 01:19:24,540
a square cut pizza?

1581
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:27,480
Like I'm from Chicago that you
don't cut it in big slices.

1582
01:19:27,500 --> 01:19:30,030
Like you cut it in squares,

1583
01:19:30,330 --> 01:19:30,541
you know,

1584
01:19:30,541 --> 01:19:32,010
Kinda like how Chicago is.

1585
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:33,300
The city is laid out,

1586
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:33,991
you know what I mean?

1587
01:19:33,991 --> 01:19:36,060
In the real grid like fashion,

1588
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:40,230
you're going to sit there and count all
those pieces and see if you got an even

1589
01:19:40,231 --> 01:19:41,064
or odd number.

1590
01:19:46,850 --> 01:19:50,360
Yup,

1591
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:51,193
Yup.

1592
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,283
Yeah.

1593
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:31,770
I don't really have anything.

1594
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:36,170
Beer by slaughter beach dog.

1595
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:39,580
I don't know how that is mad.

1596
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:42,673
Maybe the dog.

1597
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:50,663
Yep.

1598
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:52,140
Maybe the dog.

1599
01:20:55,340 --> 01:20:57,950
So it seems like every,

1600
01:21:00,380 --> 01:21:01,940
everything's coming to an end here

1601
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:11,270
link way too

1602
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:19,391
in a long time.

1603
01:21:19,391 --> 01:21:20,470
So is there a blink lady too?

1604
01:21:43,590 --> 01:21:44,460
It looks grainy.

1605
01:21:46,230 --> 01:21:47,160
Picture looks kind of grainy.

1606
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:48,720
Like the ISO or the cameras?

1607
01:22:02,840 --> 01:22:03,673
No.

1608
01:22:04,230 --> 01:22:04,530
Yep.

1609
01:22:04,530 --> 01:22:05,310
So what do we got?

1610
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,143
Anything else?

1611
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:08,730
What else is going on?

1612
01:22:08,730 --> 01:22:09,563
Please

1613
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:12,450
free to raise a great goodbye song.

1614
01:22:20,570 --> 01:22:22,300
Free Word is the most requested song.

1615
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:27,390
I could play the one song that.

1616
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:28,400
But last time on here.

1617
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:34,810
Mm MM.

1618
01:22:57,790 --> 01:23:00,110
Type of the blackbird.

1619
01:23:07,180 --> 01:23:08,740
Well I guess since the 14th amendment.

1620
01:23:08,741 --> 01:23:09,880
The blackboard screen now?

1621
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:40,513
Yeah.

1622
01:23:42,740 --> 01:23:44,290
Fair to say burden of color.

1623
01:23:57,910 --> 01:23:58,181
Yo.

1624
01:23:58,181 --> 01:24:01,150
Why won't Jordan Peterson
say he believes in God?

1625
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,060
I think he talks about them enough.

1626
01:24:16,950 --> 01:24:17,783
I mean come on.

1627
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:20,330
Yeah,

1628
01:24:20,330 --> 01:24:23,300
he does these frigging biblical lectures.

1629
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:28,460
I don't have to ask somebody.

1630
01:24:29,750 --> 01:24:31,070
Do you believe in God?

1631
01:24:32,630 --> 01:24:33,463
No.

1632
01:24:33,680 --> 01:24:34,461
I could care less.

1633
01:24:34,461 --> 01:24:35,300
What your beliefs are

1634
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:43,870
it just get back to real talk.

1635
01:24:43,871 --> 01:24:44,191
Oh yeah,

1636
01:24:44,191 --> 01:24:44,590
yeah.

1637
01:24:44,590 --> 01:24:45,423
Oh I'm sorry.

1638
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:45,970
Yeah.

1639
01:24:45,970 --> 01:24:46,803
Well,

1640
01:24:47,160 --> 01:24:47,993
uh,

1641
01:24:48,840 --> 01:24:53,280
I was seeing a Owen Owen
Benjamin's livestream

1642
01:24:54,860 --> 01:24:55,201
and you know,

1643
01:24:55,201 --> 01:24:57,440
they bring on,

1644
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:59,760
brings it up quite a bit.

1645
01:25:00,420 --> 01:25:01,253
The

1646
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:04,520
thing with a.

1647
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:07,480
Why would he answer a simple question?

1648
01:25:09,510 --> 01:25:12,270
I mean he tells you because he doesn't
want to be reduced to a soundbite.

1649
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:15,031
And the thing is,

1650
01:25:15,031 --> 01:25:15,601
in his lecture,

1651
01:25:15,601 --> 01:25:19,080
nobody's asking him questions
and his two hour long lectures,

1652
01:25:19,530 --> 01:25:24,530
nobody's asking him questions if
people continuously grinded him,

1653
01:25:25,830 --> 01:25:29,640
if everybody in a q and a period
just got together and said,

1654
01:25:29,641 --> 01:25:29,821
look,

1655
01:25:29,821 --> 01:25:32,370
we're just gonna keep asking him
the same question over and over,

1656
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:32,970
you know,

1657
01:25:32,970 --> 01:25:34,740
you might get some more
information out of him,

1658
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:35,753
but

1659
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:47,060
it's fine with me.

1660
01:25:47,061 --> 01:25:48,920
I don't expect a bunch of

1661
01:25:50,900 --> 01:25:52,550
new information to come out of him.

1662
01:26:03,690 --> 01:26:04,470
I mean,

1663
01:26:04,470 --> 01:26:06,210
what I found most interesting

1664
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:13,400
was that he was putting biblical stories
into perspective to the point where

1665
01:26:15,060 --> 01:26:16,260
a mechanic friend of mine,

1666
01:26:16,261 --> 01:26:17,940
who I had come out and do the struts,

1667
01:26:18,030 --> 01:26:20,730
the rear struts on my car,

1668
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:21,900
you know,

1669
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:26,070
he goes to ease really religious guy
and we're sitting down and I was talking

1670
01:26:26,071 --> 01:26:26,904
about,

1671
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:27,691
Oh,

1672
01:26:27,691 --> 01:26:27,991
you know,

1673
01:26:27,991 --> 01:26:29,040
I do this thing on youtube.

1674
01:26:29,041 --> 01:26:29,731
I cut clips.

1675
01:26:29,731 --> 01:26:29,971
He's like,

1676
01:26:29,971 --> 01:26:30,301
Oh yeah,

1677
01:26:30,301 --> 01:26:30,661
okay,

1678
01:26:30,661 --> 01:26:30,781
well,

1679
01:26:30,781 --> 01:26:30,991
you know,

1680
01:26:30,991 --> 01:26:31,824
what do you do?

1681
01:26:32,430 --> 01:26:33,700
And I said,

1682
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:33,911
oh,

1683
01:26:33,911 --> 01:26:34,890
well there's this,

1684
01:26:34,920 --> 01:26:39,920
a clinical psychologist out of
Toronto University professor.

1685
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:42,960
He ran a private practice,

1686
01:26:42,990 --> 01:26:43,801
all this Yada,

1687
01:26:43,801 --> 01:26:43,981
Yada,

1688
01:26:43,981 --> 01:26:44,600
Yada.

1689
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:45,450
I still talking about the,

1690
01:26:45,451 --> 01:26:46,650
a biblical lectures.

1691
01:26:46,651 --> 01:26:47,484
So I start,

1692
01:26:48,410 --> 01:26:49,243
uh,

1693
01:26:52,680 --> 01:26:54,000
so I started telling him about the,

1694
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:02,290
I'm having trouble remembering it now.

1695
01:27:05,070 --> 01:27:05,903
I think

1696
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,233
with Jacob,

1697
01:27:07,300 --> 01:27:08,470
you had the idea of

1698
01:27:10,260 --> 01:27:11,093
like a,

1699
01:27:12,570 --> 01:27:15,060
the idea of permanence
and the plate placing,

1700
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:22,050
placing something down and basically
centering around that one thing.

1701
01:27:23,150 --> 01:27:23,983
Um,

1702
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,910
I'm terrible at being able to explain
things but not with John Height that would

1703
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:30,960
be like circling,

1704
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:31,801
you know,

1705
01:27:31,801 --> 01:27:36,801
the one thing being able to get
around this one state of permanence,

1706
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:39,990
state of permanence,

1707
01:27:39,991 --> 01:27:41,850
this object permanence,

1708
01:27:42,260 --> 01:27:42,660
you know,

1709
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:47,660
it could probably be anything in eminent
inanimate object or a person that's

1710
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,270
probably what people do with clergy,

1711
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:53,340
but,

1712
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:53,581
you know,

1713
01:27:53,581 --> 01:27:56,580
there's a lot of benefits I think to,

1714
01:27:56,581 --> 01:27:57,414
uh,

1715
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,400
to Jordan Peterson's lectures.

1716
01:27:59,401 --> 01:28:00,520
And um,

1717
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:05,550
one thing that I've found interesting
was Fox day mentioned that,

1718
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:06,481
well,

1719
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:06,721
you know,

1720
01:28:06,721 --> 01:28:08,100
if you listen to Jordan Peterson,

1721
01:28:08,101 --> 01:28:11,820
then you're probably already pretty
messed up already and there's probably

1722
01:28:11,821 --> 01:28:12,720
something wrong with you.

1723
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:13,261
Well,

1724
01:28:13,261 --> 01:28:14,460
I was listening to his,

1725
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:15,963
uh,

1726
01:28:16,870 --> 01:28:20,740
to his lectures and they
seemed pretty interesting,

1727
01:28:20,741 --> 01:28:20,951
you know,

1728
01:28:20,951 --> 01:28:24,130
he was putting a different perspective

1729
01:28:25,270 --> 01:28:26,103
on

1730
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:29,760
stories and

1731
01:28:32,410 --> 01:28:33,850
I just don't think that's the case.

1732
01:28:33,910 --> 01:28:34,121
I mean,

1733
01:28:34,121 --> 01:28:35,140
I worked in a Woodshop,

1734
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,970
I worked in a cabinet shop where
I would put furniture together,

1735
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:45,640
either I worked in tandem with people or
I worked by myself and I mean this is a

1736
01:28:45,641 --> 01:28:47,140
high end accustomed wood shop,

1737
01:28:47,141 --> 01:28:47,321
you know,

1738
01:28:47,321 --> 01:28:49,990
doing $60,000 to a million dollar houses.

1739
01:28:50,310 --> 01:28:51,143
Um,

1740
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:52,270
and I basically,

1741
01:28:52,271 --> 01:28:52,780
you know,

1742
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:53,561
in the beginning of the day,

1743
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:54,590
you just get a clipboard,

1744
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:57,310
fair out what you're going
to do and you start doing it.

1745
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:01,180
So I would put on
headphones and just listen.

1746
01:29:02,550 --> 01:29:04,290
And I found Peterson and I was like,

1747
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:04,531
yeah,

1748
01:29:04,531 --> 01:29:04,951
hell yeah,

1749
01:29:04,951 --> 01:29:05,810
I'll listen to some of these.

1750
01:29:05,870 --> 01:29:06,390
And,

1751
01:29:06,390 --> 01:29:06,620
you know,

1752
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,330
he uh,

1753
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:09,780
through him I,

1754
01:29:10,680 --> 01:29:10,981
you know,

1755
01:29:10,981 --> 01:29:15,981
I knew about but didn't know the extent
to which it would be interesting,

1756
01:29:17,130 --> 01:29:18,450
the Gulag archipelago.

1757
01:29:18,451 --> 01:29:23,160
So I listened to probably five or
six hours of that and Holy Shit.

1758
01:29:23,161 --> 01:29:23,561
Like when,

1759
01:29:23,561 --> 01:29:24,870
when they start talking about,

1760
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:25,830
uh,

1761
01:29:25,830 --> 01:29:30,300
the torture that the soldiers would engage
in with people basically setting you

1762
01:29:30,301 --> 01:29:32,460
up on a bench and not
letting you go to sleep.

1763
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:33,993
Um,

1764
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:34,980
you know,

1765
01:29:34,980 --> 01:29:38,250
kicking dudes in the balls over and over.

1766
01:29:38,251 --> 01:29:39,850
And uh,

1767
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:40,981
Oh God,

1768
01:29:40,981 --> 01:29:44,280
like it gets really graphic
and specific that book.

1769
01:29:45,360 --> 01:29:46,193
So,

1770
01:29:48,690 --> 01:29:49,840
and uh,

1771
01:29:50,630 --> 01:29:51,463
I think,

1772
01:29:52,550 --> 01:29:55,350
I don't know that I had
ever read any Dostoevsky.

1773
01:29:57,030 --> 01:30:00,120
I haven't finished any dust he asked me,

1774
01:30:00,121 --> 01:30:04,380
but I started to read
crime and punishment and

1775
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:06,780
something else.

1776
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:09,623
But I mean,

1777
01:30:10,740 --> 01:30:11,573
I don't know,

1778
01:30:15,220 --> 01:30:16,030
I think,

1779
01:30:16,030 --> 01:30:16,361
you know,

1780
01:30:16,361 --> 01:30:17,194
what,

1781
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,810
what vox is biggest issue is that,

1782
01:30:20,450 --> 01:30:20,710
you know,

1783
01:30:20,710 --> 01:30:22,500
he's Devoxx.

1784
01:30:22,660 --> 01:30:24,190
He seems to be taking away

1785
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:27,910
western men

1786
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:30,503
from

1787
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,230
wanting to

1788
01:30:39,390 --> 01:30:42,960
group up to be able to
fight the migrant crisis.

1789
01:30:42,961 --> 01:30:44,130
That and that,

1790
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:44,581
you know,

1791
01:30:44,581 --> 01:30:45,720
vox would say that,

1792
01:30:47,500 --> 01:30:47,970
you know,

1793
01:30:47,970 --> 01:30:50,100
he's not an intellectual.

1794
01:31:00,590 --> 01:31:00,750
Well,

1795
01:31:00,750 --> 01:31:04,210
who is the most interesting
intellectual use subscribe to.

1796
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:11,223
I Dunno,

1797
01:31:13,980 --> 01:31:15,450
I like Ralph Nader a lot.

1798
01:31:15,930 --> 01:31:20,100
I like his idea that the way that you're
going to change things in the states is

1799
01:31:20,101 --> 01:31:21,060
through congress.

1800
01:31:22,070 --> 01:31:22,903
Um,

1801
01:31:25,060 --> 01:31:25,301
you know,

1802
01:31:25,301 --> 01:31:28,990
unless you have people that get
out in the street basically,

1803
01:31:28,991 --> 01:31:31,270
if you can overtake Congress,

1804
01:31:32,290 --> 01:31:32,920
then you can,

1805
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:33,753
um,

1806
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:35,770
you can get work done,

1807
01:31:38,620 --> 01:31:39,460
good things done.

1808
01:31:40,360 --> 01:31:40,571
You know,

1809
01:31:40,571 --> 01:31:41,470
I didn't know that,

1810
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:43,713
that

1811
01:31:44,850 --> 01:31:45,311
the Aaron,

1812
01:31:45,311 --> 01:31:48,430
what the clean air and Water Act,

1813
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:50,373
Osha

1814
01:31:52,050 --> 01:31:55,660
and I think seat belts were laws
that were drafted by Ralph Nader.

1815
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,473
That's

1816
01:32:05,060 --> 01:32:05,893
pretty interesting.

1817
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:12,300
I don't know Chris Hedges.

1818
01:32:14,110 --> 01:32:15,040
It's interesting to.

1819
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:17,251
Yeah,

1820
01:32:17,251 --> 01:32:18,720
he's definitely a darker.

1821
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:21,570
He's got to be way
darker than most people.

1822
01:32:21,571 --> 01:32:21,841
I mean,

1823
01:32:21,841 --> 01:32:25,500
he was a war correspondent
who's was captured by the Iraqi,

1824
01:32:25,950 --> 01:32:27,750
I think they were called
the Republican Guard,

1825
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,010
believe he thought he said
he's going to be murdered,

1826
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:34,590
but he ended up being turned over.

1827
01:32:37,300 --> 01:32:40,480
He's been in so many different
war torn environments.

1828
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:42,620
I mean,

1829
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,510
Peterson can be dark and he's,

1830
01:32:44,570 --> 01:32:44,841
you know,

1831
01:32:44,841 --> 01:32:45,320
he,

1832
01:32:45,320 --> 01:32:47,450
he recommends reading a
lot of dark literature,

1833
01:32:47,451 --> 01:32:48,290
but you know,

1834
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:52,160
Chris hedges is a dark person.

1835
01:32:52,790 --> 01:32:53,623
You know what I mean?

1836
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:54,260
You know,

1837
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:55,280
you got people like,

1838
01:32:57,780 --> 01:32:58,613
uh,

1839
01:32:58,620 --> 01:33:02,670
Jocko willink and other people
who are trained in the military,

1840
01:33:03,590 --> 01:33:04,423
but

1841
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:06,850
you know,

1842
01:33:06,850 --> 01:33:08,980
hedges is a lot closer to what,

1843
01:33:09,430 --> 01:33:12,760
at least probably in the beginning of
his career as being a bureau chief is a

1844
01:33:12,761 --> 01:33:16,060
lot closer to what a US citizen

1845
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:23,630
isn't that close to how US citizen
would react if I'm there to see war.

1846
01:33:25,170 --> 01:33:26,910
Can you recommend some dark literature?

1847
01:33:33,180 --> 01:33:33,391
Yeah,

1848
01:33:33,391 --> 01:33:33,960
go read,

1849
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:35,430
go read the Gulag archipelago.

1850
01:33:35,790 --> 01:33:37,590
If you want to feel sick to your stomach,

1851
01:33:40,410 --> 01:33:41,243
maybe you won't be.

1852
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:47,250
I probably felt sick to my stomach
because I was listening for five hours one

1853
01:33:47,251 --> 01:33:50,370
day I was ripping stuff
through a table saw

1854
01:33:53,010 --> 01:33:58,010
probably for three hours of that day
building face frames for cabinets and it

1855
01:33:59,221 --> 01:33:59,730
just,

1856
01:33:59,730 --> 01:34:04,260
it just kept going on and on
about the specifics of torture

1857
01:34:07,070 --> 01:34:07,940
in eastern Europe.

1858
01:34:28,070 --> 01:34:28,903
Yeah,

1859
01:34:48,160 --> 01:34:48,993
yeah.

1860
01:34:49,330 --> 01:34:50,163
Well

1861
01:34:54,270 --> 01:34:55,440
I'm kind of interested.

1862
01:34:55,650 --> 01:34:56,930
They have the audiobook for dog.

1863
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:59,030
Is it unabridged?

1864
01:34:59,150 --> 01:34:59,361
Yeah.

1865
01:34:59,361 --> 01:35:02,810
Cause that's the thing is you got
to read the unabridged version,

1866
01:35:02,811 --> 01:35:03,320
right?

1867
01:35:03,320 --> 01:35:05,210
You get to read every single word of

1868
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,600
social needs in this work.

1869
01:35:10,740 --> 01:35:10,981
You know,

1870
01:35:10,981 --> 01:35:12,810
I've thought of the perfect screenplay,

1871
01:35:14,130 --> 01:35:14,963
uh,

1872
01:35:15,100 --> 01:35:15,450
ice,

1873
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,440
I call it perfect,

1874
01:35:16,441 --> 01:35:21,441
but basically would open up with social
since Harvard speech basically talking

1875
01:35:22,501 --> 01:35:25,330
to the individuals and
then slowly it would like,

1876
01:35:26,730 --> 01:35:29,470
like transition to social
needs and being in a cell

1877
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:34,490
and it would basically the story,

1878
01:35:34,850 --> 01:35:36,890
the film would revolve around,

1879
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:38,750
you know,

1880
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:41,240
different people who had
told him different stories.

1881
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:43,400
I don't know that much
about social needs in our,

1882
01:35:43,401 --> 01:35:48,030
how he collected a lot of
those stories for that,

1883
01:35:48,670 --> 01:35:50,030
a piece of work.

1884
01:35:50,060 --> 01:35:52,430
But I think it would be a
really interesting movie.

1885
01:35:53,270 --> 01:35:56,180
It could be really interesting
film if created correctly,

1886
01:35:57,830 --> 01:35:58,790
probably better than

1887
01:36:06,780 --> 01:36:07,613
it could be on the,

1888
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:10,860
it could be in the realm of

1889
01:36:13,070 --> 01:36:15,540
like a Schindler's list.

1890
01:36:19,150 --> 01:36:22,800
So if you can't use Liam Neeson
line anymore because of his,

1891
01:36:22,801 --> 01:36:23,634
uh,

1892
01:36:25,210 --> 01:36:25,540
God,

1893
01:36:25,540 --> 01:36:29,590
Hollywood's obsession with him and taken
to like everything has been reduced to

1894
01:36:29,591 --> 01:36:29,771
a,

1895
01:36:29,771 --> 01:36:30,130
uh,

1896
01:36:30,130 --> 01:36:30,963
to a meme.

1897
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,390
And his is the taken meme,

1898
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:34,473
right?

1899
01:36:37,150 --> 01:36:39,940
So you'd have to find somebody
else to play social needs,

1900
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:41,380
but it would be a good,

1901
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:42,701
good story.

1902
01:36:42,701 --> 01:36:43,534
Good film.

1903
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:47,500
Could be a Hollywood film too.

1904
01:36:57,840 --> 01:36:58,710
That was my thought.

1905
01:36:58,980 --> 01:37:00,420
I've done some videography work.

1906
01:37:01,180 --> 01:37:05,310
I do some videography work now
for company out of Rochester,

1907
01:37:05,311 --> 01:37:06,144
New York,

1908
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:07,433
CGI.

1909
01:37:08,540 --> 01:37:12,680
Basically I just shoot the raw
content and send it off and they.

1910
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,000
They edited down.

1911
01:37:17,030 --> 01:37:18,200
I do that in the carpentry.

1912
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:28,753
What else?

1913
01:37:31,720 --> 01:37:32,850
Soon as they listened to jpl,

1914
01:37:32,870 --> 01:37:35,560
the symbols and he talks about no
jumps at me when I watch movies.

1915
01:37:38,870 --> 01:37:39,703
Like what?

1916
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:58,141
Oh yeah.

1917
01:37:58,141 --> 01:38:00,090
I know he does a lot about Harry potter.

1918
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:02,050
Remember the Lion King?

1919
01:38:03,470 --> 01:38:04,303
Harry Potter.

1920
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:06,153
Pinocchio.

1921
01:38:17,830 --> 01:38:20,500
The snake stands for evil.

1922
01:38:26,530 --> 01:38:29,050
I thought that this snake.

1923
01:38:31,210 --> 01:38:31,820
Awesome.

1924
01:38:31,820 --> 01:38:31,960
Yeah.

1925
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:32,793
I don't know.

1926
01:38:36,940 --> 01:38:39,520
I don't know if that's the only
thing that the snake symbolizes,

1927
01:38:41,660 --> 01:38:46,660
but that which man the predators are
that which man has to pay attention to.

1928
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:49,460
Yeah,

1929
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:49,790
yeah,

1930
01:38:49,790 --> 01:38:49,971
yeah,

1931
01:38:49,971 --> 01:38:50,430
yeah,

1932
01:38:50,430 --> 01:38:51,263
yeah.

1933
01:39:00,350 --> 01:39:02,240
Despite what everybody else has said,

1934
01:39:04,550 --> 01:39:06,080
despite what everybody else said,

1935
01:39:06,081 --> 01:39:06,914
I don't.

1936
01:39:09,260 --> 01:39:10,040
I think he was.

1937
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:13,310
I think Peterson has been a net benefit.

1938
01:39:15,590 --> 01:39:16,423
Two people.

1939
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:17,943
I don't know.

1940
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:18,980
I don't know what that means.

1941
01:39:33,830 --> 01:39:34,050
No.

1942
01:39:34,050 --> 01:39:36,380
It might also be that you just
didn't look for symbolism.

1943
01:39:37,290 --> 01:39:38,340
You know,

1944
01:39:47,000 --> 01:39:47,833
a director

1945
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:50,913
director

1946
01:39:53,210 --> 01:39:54,043
will,

1947
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,890
depending in which capacity
the director is acting in,

1948
01:39:59,891 --> 01:40:01,480
but let's say somebody wrote a screenplay,

1949
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:06,510
he'll go ahead and he'll
take that screenplay and
he'll pick out what he wants

1950
01:40:08,111 --> 01:40:08,944
to.

1951
01:40:09,550 --> 01:40:10,720
Uh,

1952
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:17,280
he'll pick out exactly the
symbolism that he wants to,

1953
01:40:17,800 --> 01:40:18,633
um,

1954
01:40:19,440 --> 01:40:20,273
highlight.

1955
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:21,940
And if you read the reading,

1956
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:23,970
but if you listen to the
commentary of a movie,

1957
01:40:23,971 --> 01:40:24,151
you know,

1958
01:40:24,151 --> 01:40:26,490
you can listen to a
director talking about,

1959
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:27,181
oh,

1960
01:40:27,181 --> 01:40:28,230
I love this this way,

1961
01:40:28,231 --> 01:40:29,970
and I framed this shot this way,

1962
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:30,730
you know,

1963
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:32,460
and I let the flower,

1964
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:37,760
I let the vas stay in the left
part of the shot to symbolize the,

1965
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:39,060
you know,

1966
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:40,620
person passed the.

1967
01:40:44,590 --> 01:40:45,670
When you hear these things,

1968
01:40:45,671 --> 01:40:46,181
you think like,

1969
01:40:46,181 --> 01:40:49,690
how the hell would I ever get that?

1970
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:54,010
Why would I think that the
light in the back being left on

1971
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:57,130
back there would mean something.

1972
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:58,053
You know what I mean?

1973
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:00,430
And it could just be that they watched,

1974
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,380
they watched these shots,

1975
01:41:03,320 --> 01:41:04,091
they see these,

1976
01:41:04,091 --> 01:41:04,924
uh,

1977
01:41:05,230 --> 01:41:07,000
scenes afterward and they come up with it.

1978
01:41:10,770 --> 01:41:12,810
People love Peterson
for his suggesting that,

1979
01:41:13,110 --> 01:41:13,540
Kevin,

1980
01:41:13,540 --> 01:41:14,640
I quit after winning.

1981
01:41:15,180 --> 01:41:15,781
Like I said,

1982
01:41:15,781 --> 01:41:17,190
I knew exactly what Peterson meant,

1983
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:18,301
you know,

1984
01:41:18,301 --> 01:41:23,301
Peterson's message has been consistently
that sometimes it's better to go for

1985
01:41:24,091 --> 01:41:29,091
peace than it is to go for a
war and as soon as I read that,

1986
01:41:29,461 --> 01:41:30,390
it took me less than,

1987
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:32,670
less than 10 seconds.

1988
01:41:32,671 --> 01:41:33,420
And I went,

1989
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:33,541
oh,

1990
01:41:33,541 --> 01:41:35,100
that's the whole piece.

1991
01:41:35,101 --> 01:41:38,970
And then he said that he said
it days later and I thought,

1992
01:41:39,810 --> 01:41:40,111
yeah,

1993
01:41:40,111 --> 01:41:41,130
that makes sense.

1994
01:41:41,870 --> 01:41:43,020
And I didn't really care.

1995
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,873
I mean,

1996
01:41:44,200 --> 01:41:47,250
I don't care if Cavanaugh's is put in,

1997
01:41:47,790 --> 01:41:48,623
you know what I mean?

1998
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:50,940
Like I'm not for.

1999
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,640
I've not been a part of the state,

2000
01:41:56,641 --> 01:41:57,900
so I'm not for this state.

2001
01:41:58,260 --> 01:41:58,830
You know,

2002
01:41:58,830 --> 01:42:00,150
if I was in Kevin's shoes,

2003
01:42:00,151 --> 01:42:00,751
it'd be different.

2004
01:42:00,751 --> 01:42:03,270
Or if I was a person who

2005
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:06,060
it would be different,

2006
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,073
you know what I mean?

2007
01:42:07,940 --> 01:42:08,773
Uh,

2008
01:42:09,660 --> 01:42:10,530
you know what I mean?

2009
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:18,010
That if I was part of like a bushes era,

2010
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,420
if I was,

2011
01:42:20,170 --> 01:42:25,170
if I was one of the people involved in
drafting the Patriot Act where Kevin,

2012
01:42:27,161 --> 01:42:28,570
I would go ahead and copyright it

2013
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:30,413
into law.

2014
01:42:33,410 --> 01:42:38,410
See I the whole thing with Kevin or is
everybody was watching the spectacle

2015
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:42,033
and

2016
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:43,661
you know,

2017
01:42:43,661 --> 01:42:44,590
to me it's like

2018
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:48,700
this is not what you should
be paying attention to.

2019
01:42:49,730 --> 01:42:50,630
Who is Kevin on?

2020
01:42:50,631 --> 01:42:51,650
What did he vote on?

2021
01:42:57,720 --> 01:42:57,901
I mean,

2022
01:42:57,901 --> 01:42:59,310
you're just not going to get a.

2023
01:43:05,510 --> 01:43:05,661
no,

2024
01:43:05,661 --> 01:43:07,190
I think you should listen to everybody.

2025
01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:07,910
No,

2026
01:43:07,910 --> 01:43:11,420
I think I like Owen Benjamin
and I think he should be.

2027
01:43:13,100 --> 01:43:15,050
I think everybody can have something.

2028
01:43:16,610 --> 01:43:19,070
Everybody can have something worse.

2029
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:20,833
Communicating.

2030
01:43:25,470 --> 01:43:25,950
Sure.

2031
01:43:25,950 --> 01:43:29,640
Everybody has the potential
to communicate something to a.

2032
01:43:33,430 --> 01:43:34,210
I don't know.

2033
01:43:34,210 --> 01:43:35,710
Everybody has the potential to

2034
01:43:37,500 --> 01:43:38,680
something worth communicating.

2035
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:39,260
Yeah.

2036
01:43:39,260 --> 01:43:40,093
Constrict.

2037
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:41,153
Just criticism,

2038
01:43:41,680 --> 01:43:42,513
right?

2039
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:48,600
Like I'm totally for the idea
that if you hate somebody though,

2040
01:43:52,810 --> 01:43:53,581
why don't you hate them?

2041
01:43:53,581 --> 01:43:54,140
But I get it.

2042
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:55,460
I guess there's probably reasons,

2043
01:43:55,730 --> 01:43:58,060
but if you don't like
somebody you should listen.

2044
01:43:58,080 --> 01:43:59,270
Especially to those people

2045
01:44:01,760 --> 01:44:06,760
because they're going to be the ones who
may have a grain of truth that they're

2046
01:44:08,961 --> 01:44:11,540
willing to share with you.

2047
01:44:11,810 --> 01:44:16,250
Whereas I like Owen
Benjamin on Jordan Peterson.

2048
01:44:19,270 --> 01:44:20,440
I like box day,

2049
01:44:20,441 --> 01:44:21,730
but you know,

2050
01:44:21,731 --> 01:44:22,564
there's,

2051
01:44:24,580 --> 01:44:26,680
there's just everybody.

2052
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:30,070
Every single one of those guys
have said things that I go,

2053
01:44:30,071 --> 01:44:30,581
oh yeah,

2054
01:44:30,581 --> 01:44:31,414
no,

2055
01:44:32,750 --> 01:44:33,583
no.

2056
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:41,210
And it's ridiculous.

2057
01:44:41,211 --> 01:44:41,820
Like,

2058
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:42,081
like,

2059
01:44:42,081 --> 01:44:42,441
okay.

2060
01:44:42,441 --> 01:44:45,350
So the whole thing like it in,

2061
01:44:46,430 --> 01:44:49,280
I didn't watch it from the beginning,

2062
01:44:49,281 --> 01:44:52,160
but in own Benjamin's
livestream with Fox day,

2063
01:44:53,270 --> 01:44:54,320
he comes up to the own.

2064
01:44:54,321 --> 01:44:55,130
Ben's was like,

2065
01:44:55,130 --> 01:44:55,401
yeah,

2066
01:44:55,401 --> 01:44:58,820
didn't he do something with a agenda 21?

2067
01:44:59,570 --> 01:45:00,740
And Vox is like,

2068
01:45:00,741 --> 01:45:01,131
no,

2069
01:45:01,131 --> 01:45:06,131
it was a basically as far as
I can understand what it was,

2070
01:45:06,561 --> 01:45:08,690
he was invited to,

2071
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:10,233
um,

2072
01:45:10,600 --> 01:45:12,400
to participate in the.

2073
01:45:14,570 --> 01:45:16,400
I don't know if it was
the writing of any type.

2074
01:45:16,790 --> 01:45:19,010
I believe it was in the drafting of a,

2075
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:22,370
I don't know what you would consider it,

2076
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:27,050
but Peterson even has peter even talks
about it as being something where,

2077
01:45:27,470 --> 01:45:27,710
you know,

2078
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:32,330
he came into this and everybody's
not predictions but there.

2079
01:45:32,690 --> 01:45:33,523
Uh

2080
01:45:34,940 --> 01:45:35,773
Huh.

2081
01:45:39,280 --> 01:45:39,851
Estimates,

2082
01:45:39,851 --> 01:45:40,360
no,

2083
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:41,740
I don't know their projections,

2084
01:45:41,741 --> 01:45:45,340
everybody's projections where I very dark,

2085
01:45:45,490 --> 01:45:45,830
you know.

2086
01:45:45,830 --> 01:45:48,340
And as far as what he said,

2087
01:45:48,341 --> 01:45:49,510
he came out and he said that it,

2088
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:50,650
it was different.

2089
01:45:50,650 --> 01:45:52,720
Now vox probably read that.

2090
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:54,793
Uh,

2091
01:45:55,750 --> 01:45:56,583
I think it's,

2092
01:45:56,590 --> 01:45:59,290
I can't even remember what
the article is called.

2093
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:01,690
Something for a sustainable future.

2094
01:46:02,770 --> 01:46:05,950
Now I'd have to read it
to be able to say exactly.

2095
01:46:12,690 --> 01:46:15,300
Owen went crazy and
turned on the whole idw.

2096
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:18,061
Well,

2097
01:46:18,061 --> 01:46:20,070
I don't know about that.

2098
01:46:20,071 --> 01:46:21,570
I don't really know anything.

2099
01:46:24,490 --> 01:46:25,031
What do you mean?

2100
01:46:25,031 --> 01:46:25,840
This whole lot?

2101
01:46:25,840 --> 01:46:26,673
This whole.

2102
01:46:26,750 --> 01:46:28,180
The whole idw thing.

2103
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:28,460
Okay.

2104
01:46:28,460 --> 01:46:28,960
It's like,

2105
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:29,890
look at it like this.

2106
01:46:30,820 --> 01:46:35,820
You're on a baseball team and
you're making millions of dollars.

2107
01:46:37,030 --> 01:46:37,863
Okay.

2108
01:46:38,050 --> 01:46:38,560
And you,

2109
01:46:38,560 --> 01:46:38,741
you know,

2110
01:46:38,741 --> 01:46:41,500
you get together with
your friends and you know,

2111
01:46:41,501 --> 01:46:42,630
it's like Rah Rah,

2112
01:46:42,960 --> 01:46:46,300
can you have this Kamar
comradery and you know,

2113
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:48,850
one of the guys comes up with a,

2114
01:46:48,851 --> 01:46:49,350
well,

2115
01:46:49,350 --> 01:46:49,860
you know,

2116
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:50,040
well

2117
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:50,880
this is what we are.

2118
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:51,830
You know what I mean?

2119
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:53,160
It's kind of a joke and

2120
01:46:54,780 --> 01:46:57,450
it permeates and people take it.

2121
01:46:57,480 --> 01:47:02,480
People being people on Youtube take it
and the intellectual dark web and oh now

2122
01:47:03,991 --> 01:47:08,520
it's a joke that kinda now it's
a running joke among people,

2123
01:47:08,521 --> 01:47:09,354
but it wasn't.

2124
01:47:10,380 --> 01:47:11,520
It's just these guys,

2125
01:47:11,521 --> 01:47:12,300
his thoughts,

2126
01:47:12,300 --> 01:47:12,901
you know what I mean?

2127
01:47:12,901 --> 01:47:13,950
These are just dudes,

2128
01:47:16,090 --> 01:47:17,100
albeit intelligent,

2129
01:47:17,101 --> 01:47:18,090
but they're just dudes.

2130
01:47:24,790 --> 01:47:25,001
Yeah.

2131
01:47:25,001 --> 01:47:25,781
They're just dudes.

2132
01:47:25,781 --> 01:47:26,614
Man.

2133
01:47:28,420 --> 01:47:29,380
Fucking rich dudes.

2134
01:47:29,381 --> 01:47:30,220
But they're just dudes.

2135
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:41,110
Rogan called him out when?

2136
01:47:41,111 --> 01:47:41,920
Benjamin.

2137
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:42,401
I don't know.

2138
01:47:42,401 --> 01:47:43,031
I don't remember that.

2139
01:47:43,031 --> 01:47:43,864
What do you mean?

2140
01:47:43,930 --> 01:47:44,531
What did he say?

2141
01:47:44,531 --> 01:47:45,250
John?

2142
01:47:45,250 --> 01:47:45,791
His name is.

2143
01:47:45,791 --> 01:47:47,380
Doth who the hell's doth?

2144
01:48:03,600 --> 01:48:03,811
Oh,

2145
01:48:03,811 --> 01:48:04,644
my name is Mike.

2146
01:48:04,680 --> 01:48:05,161
You just call me.

2147
01:48:05,161 --> 01:48:05,994
Mike

2148
01:48:11,270 --> 01:48:12,320
should have put that in the title.

2149
01:48:15,710 --> 01:48:16,190
Yeah,

2150
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:17,023
Mike.

2151
01:48:20,530 --> 01:48:22,250
I'm surprised it's live for this long.

2152
01:48:22,300 --> 01:48:23,920
Robin called him out on his erratic.

2153
01:48:24,550 --> 01:48:24,870
You know,

2154
01:48:24,870 --> 01:48:25,703
I think,

2155
01:48:25,780 --> 01:48:28,240
I don't know because I haven't
really followed Benjamin.

2156
01:48:28,990 --> 01:48:29,823
Nice to meet you too.

2157
01:48:30,100 --> 01:48:31,570
Haven't really fallen on Benjamin.

2158
01:48:31,571 --> 01:48:32,170
But you know,

2159
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:33,010
I think one bedroom,

2160
01:48:33,011 --> 01:48:34,420
it was kind of in a tough place.

2161
01:48:35,920 --> 01:48:36,753
You know what I mean?

2162
01:48:37,030 --> 01:48:40,240
Didn't he get dropped by talent agency

2163
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:42,113
or something?

2164
01:48:42,570 --> 01:48:43,403
I Dunno.

2165
01:48:45,620 --> 01:48:49,490
Do people are not in the
best place right now?

2166
01:48:55,970 --> 01:48:57,620
He's a giant Viking maniac.

2167
01:48:58,290 --> 01:48:59,190
Ah,

2168
01:48:59,590 --> 01:49:00,423
uh,

2169
01:49:03,440 --> 01:49:04,273
yeah man,

2170
01:49:04,610 --> 01:49:06,020
I don't fault any of the people.

2171
01:49:06,080 --> 01:49:09,170
I mean somebody went on a killing spree.

2172
01:49:09,770 --> 01:49:12,350
They listen to Shapiro
Shapiro got shit for it.

2173
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:14,480
Peterson gets shit for stuff.

2174
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:18,980
Rogan smokes bud and his
friends with Alex Jones.

2175
01:49:18,981 --> 01:49:23,981
Alex Jones just goes on a tirade
and Rogan gets shit for stuff.

2176
01:49:24,201 --> 01:49:25,280
And I mean,

2177
01:49:28,680 --> 01:49:29,513
uh,

2178
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:30,850
what is his name?

2179
01:49:30,850 --> 01:49:31,350
Brian?

2180
01:49:31,350 --> 01:49:34,750
A Bret Weinstein has integrity and

2181
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:38,380
things that he won't know.

2182
01:49:38,780 --> 01:49:39,613
Um,

2183
01:49:40,440 --> 01:49:41,340
let go,

2184
01:49:41,800 --> 01:49:42,030
you know,

2185
01:49:42,030 --> 01:49:44,100
so he ends up in a situation,

2186
01:49:45,120 --> 01:49:45,751
you know what I mean?

2187
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:46,584
There's just,

2188
01:49:52,350 --> 01:49:53,071
if you drink coffee,

2189
01:49:53,071 --> 01:49:53,520
drink coffee,

2190
01:49:53,520 --> 01:49:55,230
these broadcasts will
perk up your rhetoric.

2191
01:49:55,850 --> 01:49:56,110
No,

2192
01:49:56,110 --> 01:49:57,390
I haven't drank any coffee.

2193
01:49:59,800 --> 01:50:03,220
I have to work tomorrow and I'll probably
get up around 4:30 so I can be at the

2194
01:50:03,221 --> 01:50:04,330
job site earlier.

2195
01:50:04,480 --> 01:50:05,410
I like to get there earlier,

2196
01:50:05,411 --> 01:50:06,970
so I'm not gonna drink
anymore coffee tonight,

2197
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:08,073
but

2198
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:13,703
I don't know.

2199
01:50:16,990 --> 01:50:17,823
No clue.

2200
01:50:18,810 --> 01:50:20,710
I never really followed Milo.

2201
01:50:21,890 --> 01:50:23,140
It started in the garden job.

2202
01:50:23,830 --> 01:50:24,720
Hmm.

2203
01:50:32,940 --> 01:50:33,141
Yeah.

2204
01:50:33,141 --> 01:50:34,340
Youtube is put the correct on.

2205
01:50:34,341 --> 01:50:37,040
People in finished carpentry,

2206
01:50:37,310 --> 01:50:38,570
furniture making cabinet,

2207
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:39,471
making cabinet.

2208
01:50:39,471 --> 01:50:40,304
Installing

2209
01:50:41,810 --> 01:50:43,640
specifically just cabinet installing.

2210
01:50:45,230 --> 01:50:46,063
Right now

2211
01:50:47,870 --> 01:50:48,830
it's still around.

2212
01:50:52,510 --> 01:50:56,020
There was one video where
I thoughts on Patrion.

2213
01:50:56,350 --> 01:50:57,183
Well,

2214
01:50:57,340 --> 01:51:02,340
I listened to Pambula Moose back and like
I was Kinda late finding Pamplemousse

2215
01:51:02,950 --> 01:51:07,180
you guys remember Pamplemousse before
Jack Conte became the CEO of Patriot.

2216
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:11,500
You guys remember who
jack contact was before

2217
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:18,360
he came up with Patriot and I remember
I was watching Jack Conte at the same

2218
01:51:18,701 --> 01:51:20,650
time where he started
posting videos about,

2219
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:22,540
I've got this great idea with a,

2220
01:51:22,541 --> 01:51:25,300
I don't know if it was his
girlfriend at the time,

2221
01:51:25,301 --> 01:51:25,691
Natalie,

2222
01:51:25,691 --> 01:51:27,280
the girl he plays music with.

2223
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:30,153
Well they,

2224
01:51:30,190 --> 01:51:30,990
they,

2225
01:51:30,990 --> 01:51:31,240
uh,

2226
01:51:31,240 --> 01:51:32,920
arrange these songs.

2227
01:51:34,660 --> 01:51:35,180
Um,

2228
01:51:35,180 --> 01:51:36,013
and it's,

2229
01:51:37,220 --> 01:51:38,090
they're great.

2230
01:51:38,180 --> 01:51:38,990
I mean,

2231
01:51:38,990 --> 01:51:43,990
he is definitely a very creative
musician and they put out quality.

2232
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:48,913
Have you checked?

2233
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:50,091
No,

2234
01:51:50,091 --> 01:51:50,620
I haven't.

2235
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:52,160
They put out quality music.

2236
01:51:52,390 --> 01:51:54,620
He puts out quality music
content and Natalie,

2237
01:51:54,621 --> 01:51:55,454
I think her name is.

2238
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:56,930
And at the same,

2239
01:51:56,930 --> 01:51:58,490
at around 2013,

2240
01:51:58,491 --> 01:52:00,290
there was like 14.

2241
01:52:00,650 --> 01:52:01,760
He was saying that,

2242
01:52:02,570 --> 01:52:02,740
oh,

2243
01:52:02,740 --> 01:52:04,790
we're coming out with this big thing,

2244
01:52:04,940 --> 01:52:05,241
you know,

2245
01:52:05,241 --> 01:52:08,680
it's going to be this way that
you can help creators and,

2246
01:52:09,170 --> 01:52:09,381
you know,

2247
01:52:09,381 --> 01:52:10,250
because I think they were,

2248
01:52:11,720 --> 01:52:15,260
they were looking for a way
to be able to make money.

2249
01:52:15,261 --> 01:52:15,891
And then of course,

2250
01:52:15,891 --> 01:52:16,071
you know,

2251
01:52:16,071 --> 01:52:17,630
you come up with your own idea and,

2252
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:25,061
and,

2253
01:52:25,061 --> 01:52:25,894
uh,

2254
01:52:25,910 --> 01:52:26,601
then you know,

2255
01:52:26,601 --> 01:52:29,450
that then you figure out that
that idea can benefit others.

2256
01:52:29,750 --> 01:52:30,320
So you friends,

2257
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,370
the enum friend in PSS,

2258
01:52:31,430 --> 01:52:33,230
I've talked with Adam a few times,

2259
01:52:33,590 --> 01:52:34,130
I don't know,

2260
01:52:34,130 --> 01:52:34,963
PSA,

2261
01:52:35,170 --> 01:52:37,280
stitch stitch.

2262
01:52:37,310 --> 01:52:38,143
Is it such,

2263
01:52:39,050 --> 01:52:39,883
um,

2264
01:52:40,550 --> 01:52:41,030
you know,

2265
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:42,560
so he was a good musician and

2266
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:46,220
I know what's going on with

2267
01:52:47,540 --> 01:52:48,373
Patriot.

2268
01:52:52,190 --> 01:52:53,180
Why should I care though?

2269
01:52:53,181 --> 01:52:54,014
I mean,

2270
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:56,560
well I know why I should care.

2271
01:52:59,150 --> 01:52:59,983
But

2272
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:05,421
yeah,

2273
01:53:05,421 --> 01:53:06,830
you can talk politics.

2274
01:53:07,280 --> 01:53:09,980
You can type about politics
and I talk about it.

2275
01:53:14,320 --> 01:53:18,940
I didn't start clipping the content for
the money when I started making quite a

2276
01:53:18,941 --> 01:53:19,511
bit of money.

2277
01:53:19,511 --> 01:53:20,050
Yes,

2278
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:21,820
I did it yet.

2279
01:53:21,821 --> 01:53:22,151
Well yeah,

2280
01:53:22,151 --> 01:53:23,980
I did it for the money for a long time.

2281
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:27,950
Well,

2282
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:31,150
well I save for a long
time for about six months.

2283
01:53:31,900 --> 01:53:32,733
I mean I didn't,

2284
01:53:33,390 --> 01:53:36,110
I mean I still clipping
clips but you know,

2285
01:53:36,160 --> 01:53:37,180
when I realized that,

2286
01:53:38,690 --> 01:53:39,523
uh,

2287
01:53:40,900 --> 01:53:43,030
that I could make money at it.

2288
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:43,953
Yeah.

2289
01:53:44,970 --> 01:53:49,810
I don't make any money on this channel
now youtube is demonetized this channel.

2290
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:52,780
I have a possibility of
getting re monetized.

2291
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:53,633
But

2292
01:53:55,620 --> 01:53:56,453
um,

2293
01:53:56,850 --> 01:54:01,850
there's no guarantee that a youtube is
going to allow me to enter the Youtube

2294
01:54:02,731 --> 01:54:03,810
partnership program again.

2295
01:54:13,140 --> 01:54:13,740
Yeah,

2296
01:54:13,740 --> 01:54:14,573
I dunno,

2297
01:54:14,820 --> 01:54:16,050
I don't really have that much.

2298
01:54:18,350 --> 01:54:19,980
The oppression will end one day.

2299
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:22,710
I don't think that's true.

2300
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:27,760
I don't think depression will ever end.

2301
01:54:28,350 --> 01:54:30,190
It will just be different
forms of oppression.

2302
01:54:30,250 --> 01:54:31,450
You can't get rid of oppression

2303
01:54:35,390 --> 01:54:36,223
and if you get.

2304
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:39,140
If you were to be able
to get rid of oppression,

2305
01:54:39,141 --> 01:54:43,880
you wouldn't even recognize the paradigm
that humans would live in because

2306
01:54:43,881 --> 01:54:45,410
humans wouldn't even resemble there.

2307
01:54:45,411 --> 01:54:46,244
Today.

2308
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:58,550
The prophecy speaks of a new website
that will from the ashes of Youtube.

2309
01:54:59,810 --> 01:55:00,021
Yeah.

2310
01:55:00,021 --> 01:55:00,854
I don't know.

2311
01:55:01,460 --> 01:55:03,620
Google is like in bed with the state.

2312
01:55:03,621 --> 01:55:04,454
So

2313
01:55:05,570 --> 01:55:07,850
you think you that

2314
01:55:10,730 --> 01:55:13,190
you think that youtube
is going to be replaced.

2315
01:55:14,480 --> 01:55:15,313
Really?

2316
01:55:20,330 --> 01:55:21,500
You don't see that happening.

2317
01:55:24,700 --> 01:55:28,150
It's in bed with Google
is in bed with the state.

2318
01:55:30,410 --> 01:55:31,580
If it keeps this up.

2319
01:55:34,600 --> 01:55:35,440
I don't think so.

2320
01:55:35,470 --> 01:55:36,910
They hold all the cards

2321
01:55:38,620 --> 01:55:39,220
now.

2322
01:55:39,220 --> 01:55:41,370
Now if they piss the state offer,

2323
01:55:41,390 --> 01:55:42,760
they piss politicians off.

2324
01:55:42,880 --> 01:55:44,250
I even know what that means.

2325
01:55:45,180 --> 01:55:47,970
If they piss people off
the people that matter,

2326
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:51,630
then you might have some antitrust issues

2327
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:56,680
if we have weaponized autism on our side.

2328
01:56:00,880 --> 01:56:01,390
Yeah,

2329
01:56:01,390 --> 01:56:03,000
I mean that's kind of
what I'm doing right now.

2330
01:56:03,020 --> 01:56:04,180
It's kind of an autistic thing.

2331
01:56:04,181 --> 01:56:05,260
Sit in front of a camera.

2332
01:56:12,250 --> 01:56:12,551
Well,

2333
01:56:12,551 --> 01:56:13,060
the,

2334
01:56:13,060 --> 01:56:13,301
you know,

2335
01:56:13,301 --> 01:56:14,710
we're working towards a positive.

2336
01:56:16,580 --> 01:56:18,170
We are far beyond the antitrust.

2337
01:56:23,370 --> 01:56:25,680
I don't like the idea
that Obama was a liberal,

2338
01:56:25,700 --> 01:56:26,533
cause he wasn't,

2339
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,120
you know,

2340
01:56:27,120 --> 01:56:29,190
Obama was as right wing as Bush.

2341
01:56:29,910 --> 01:56:30,750
Clinton was,

2342
01:56:30,751 --> 01:56:32,880
as right wing as Bush,

2343
01:56:33,600 --> 01:56:34,080
you know,

2344
01:56:34,080 --> 01:56:35,190
you haven't had,

2345
01:56:35,610 --> 01:56:40,610
you haven't had liberal since Nixon
and the only reason Nixon gave him the

2346
01:56:41,371 --> 01:56:43,080
liberal policies because he was afraid.

2347
01:56:43,110 --> 01:56:43,230
No,

2348
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:43,861
that's the truth.

2349
01:56:43,861 --> 01:56:48,861
And I can tell you exactly why obamacare
was Romney care and Romney care,

2350
01:56:49,081 --> 01:56:50,190
I believe was,

2351
01:56:51,500 --> 01:56:52,220
I mean,

2352
01:56:52,220 --> 01:56:53,053
it's.

2353
01:56:53,310 --> 01:56:54,870
Obama is a globalist Marxist.

2354
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:55,890
See that?

2355
01:56:55,890 --> 01:56:57,240
You have to think about it differently.

2356
01:56:57,510 --> 01:57:00,390
That's not exactly true.

2357
01:57:00,510 --> 01:57:01,110
Okay.

2358
01:57:01,110 --> 01:57:01,381
I mean,

2359
01:57:01,381 --> 01:57:01,561
there,

2360
01:57:01,561 --> 01:57:01,910
there,

2361
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:03,450
there is some truth to that.

2362
01:57:03,510 --> 01:57:04,343
But

2363
01:57:06,620 --> 01:57:11,620
Obama I believe really liked control
and he liked being able to control

2364
01:57:15,820 --> 01:57:18,140
geopolitics and the TPP.

2365
01:57:18,260 --> 01:57:19,250
I believe

2366
01:57:21,330 --> 01:57:24,810
the TPP was meant to help cripple China.

2367
01:57:26,070 --> 01:57:26,903
Um,

2368
01:57:30,150 --> 01:57:32,250
and we didn't go through with it.

2369
01:57:32,251 --> 01:57:33,690
Of course it's bad for America,

2370
01:57:33,900 --> 01:57:34,733
but it was supposed to be,

2371
01:57:35,190 --> 01:57:36,840
as far as I've read,

2372
01:57:36,900 --> 01:57:39,540
it's supposed to be very bad for China.

2373
01:57:43,870 --> 01:57:46,450
Control doesn't care about your idealisms.

2374
01:57:51,510 --> 01:57:52,380
So you know,

2375
01:57:52,381 --> 01:57:53,220
a Bama liked,

2376
01:57:55,890 --> 01:57:56,081
you know,

2377
01:57:56,081 --> 01:57:56,914
he's a,

2378
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:58,090
he's a bad dude.

2379
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:02,630
Obama sought to deconstruct,

2380
01:58:02,690 --> 01:58:03,170
you know what?

2381
01:58:03,170 --> 01:58:04,670
I don't think Obama gave me shit.

2382
01:58:05,180 --> 01:58:06,013
Okay.

2383
01:58:06,380 --> 01:58:09,470
Obama was doing what was going to
make him money just like Clinton.

2384
01:58:10,160 --> 01:58:10,993
Alright.

2385
01:58:12,050 --> 01:58:13,310
You think those guys care,

2386
01:58:13,370 --> 01:58:14,031
you think they have?

2387
01:58:14,031 --> 01:58:17,810
I think they have some ideology.

2388
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:19,670
Hell No.

2389
01:58:19,670 --> 01:58:21,710
You have to to get to where you are.

2390
01:58:21,711 --> 01:58:26,711
Then you have to kiss ass here and kiss
ass there and you know and huddle up

2391
01:58:27,111 --> 01:58:29,550
here and huddle up there and you know,

2392
01:58:29,620 --> 01:58:31,010
you have to play the game.

2393
01:58:31,011 --> 01:58:34,550
You play the game and then
once you're the lead chief

2394
01:58:36,320 --> 01:58:41,320
then it's just about now I can do
favors for people that secure me in

2395
01:58:42,010 --> 01:58:44,800
the future because I've only
got four to eight years here.

2396
01:58:45,130 --> 01:58:48,370
But once I'm out I don't want
to ever have to work again.

2397
01:58:48,371 --> 01:58:49,420
I don't want to have to do anything.

2398
01:58:49,421 --> 01:58:52,210
Not that they would if
they didn't cozy up to.

2399
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:54,900
You have to be a lizard.

2400
01:59:02,850 --> 01:59:05,310
Obama's ideology is Satan
and it's divas part.

2401
01:59:05,340 --> 01:59:08,340
He sold out the US like
the last four presidents.

2402
01:59:17,630 --> 01:59:19,580
It goes back more than four.

2403
01:59:20,390 --> 01:59:20,661
I mean,

2404
01:59:20,661 --> 01:59:20,810
I,

2405
01:59:20,810 --> 01:59:25,640
I certainly think that Reagan cutting
the taxes on the wealthy was a terrible

2406
01:59:25,641 --> 01:59:26,474
idea.

2407
01:59:28,500 --> 01:59:29,333
No,

2408
01:59:30,180 --> 01:59:35,010
the idea that the super
rich or anything like

2409
01:59:36,570 --> 01:59:37,420
you and I are,

2410
01:59:37,590 --> 01:59:38,423
are not true.

2411
01:59:38,640 --> 01:59:38,881
I mean,

2412
01:59:38,881 --> 01:59:39,714
first off,

2413
01:59:39,870 --> 01:59:44,670
a lot of very wealthy people get to where
they're at by working extremely hard.

2414
01:59:45,210 --> 01:59:45,840
Okay.

2415
01:59:45,840 --> 01:59:50,700
So they're very driven and that already
disqualifies them from being like most

2416
01:59:50,701 --> 01:59:51,534
people.

2417
02:00:02,910 --> 02:00:03,121
No.

2418
02:00:03,121 --> 02:00:04,470
Reagan had a lot of things that weren't

2419
02:00:06,890 --> 02:00:07,723
very good.

2420
02:00:21,070 --> 02:00:22,240
No wealthy people aren't bad.

2421
02:00:30,550 --> 02:00:31,383
Yeah.

2422
02:00:39,580 --> 02:00:39,940
Can you.

2423
02:00:39,940 --> 02:00:41,800
The bleed is going on for two hours.

2424
02:00:53,830 --> 02:00:57,010
Is it true that people who tend to be
assholes become either criminals or

2425
02:00:57,011 --> 02:00:57,844
politicians?

2426
02:00:58,320 --> 02:00:59,170
I don't know about that,

2427
02:00:59,171 --> 02:01:01,480
but if the person's an asshole
and they just stay in ass

2428
02:01:04,100 --> 02:01:07,070
and what may be an asshole to somebody
else may not be to other people.

2429
02:01:08,200 --> 02:01:08,851
Like if you're a disc,

2430
02:01:08,851 --> 02:01:10,340
a disagreeable person,

2431
02:01:10,341 --> 02:01:10,491
you know,

2432
02:01:10,491 --> 02:01:11,930
maybe people see that as

2433
02:01:14,090 --> 02:01:15,830
having asshole tendencies.

2434
02:01:20,920 --> 02:01:21,910
What is wealth?

2435
02:01:26,100 --> 02:01:28,350
Wealth is money assets

2436
02:01:31,730 --> 02:01:33,500
that span over generations.

2437
02:01:40,670 --> 02:01:44,090
I mean if you have enough wealth
and it's the first generation of it,

2438
02:01:44,091 --> 02:01:44,690
then that's.

2439
02:01:44,690 --> 02:01:46,700
You can still at wealth and
being the first generation.

2440
02:02:07,950 --> 02:02:09,990
Do you have thoughts on psychedelics?

2441
02:02:13,810 --> 02:02:14,643
Oh,

2442
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:18,310
like what Jonathan?

2443
02:02:38,830 --> 02:02:39,071
Well,

2444
02:02:39,071 --> 02:02:44,071
I think cannabis can make cancer
cells destroy themselves in mice.

2445
02:02:49,900 --> 02:02:50,733
I think high,

2446
02:02:51,490 --> 02:02:53,070
high doses of A.

2447
02:02:53,170 --> 02:02:58,170
I think there's a medical
article of a single girl being,

2448
02:02:59,290 --> 02:03:00,123
um,

2449
02:03:01,380 --> 02:03:04,630
that when there were low
doses of thc and cannabinoids,

2450
02:03:05,570 --> 02:03:08,980
there was no effect and
actually exacerbates,

2451
02:03:09,070 --> 02:03:11,290
exacerbated the cancer cells,

2452
02:03:11,590 --> 02:03:15,820
but when she started taking extremely
high doses that her cancer cells,

2453
02:03:15,950 --> 02:03:16,783
uh,

2454
02:03:18,760 --> 02:03:19,720
pretty much wiped out.

2455
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:21,110
But,

2456
02:03:21,110 --> 02:03:21,943
um,

2457
02:03:23,690 --> 02:03:25,520
I don't know how much further
research has been done.

2458
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:03,783
Hmm.

2459
02:04:10,270 --> 02:04:11,103
Well,

2460
02:04:19,690 --> 02:04:20,130
I don't,

2461
02:04:20,130 --> 02:04:21,060
I don't think so.

2462
02:04:21,160 --> 02:04:21,760
That's true.

2463
02:04:21,760 --> 02:04:22,211
Chris.

2464
02:04:22,211 --> 02:04:23,200
I think that's a good general.

2465
02:04:23,201 --> 02:04:24,034
I think that's.

2466
02:04:24,670 --> 02:04:26,080
Well the did the generalization.

2467
02:04:26,081 --> 02:04:26,914
I think it's true,

2468
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:29,380
but it's not true in all cases.

2469
02:04:36,400 --> 02:04:38,100
What do you think about the moon landing

2470
02:04:38,220 --> 02:04:39,210
being a hoax?

2471
02:04:41,550 --> 02:04:43,420
It's hard for me to
imagine it being a hope.

2472
02:04:45,000 --> 02:04:45,241
I mean,

2473
02:04:45,241 --> 02:04:45,820
there were a certain,

2474
02:04:45,820 --> 02:04:46,560
uh,

2475
02:04:46,560 --> 02:04:47,670
there were quite a few

2476
02:04:49,520 --> 02:04:53,510
apollo missions that we're gearing up
to be able to go to the moon before they

2477
02:04:53,511 --> 02:04:54,470
actually went to the moon.

2478
02:04:56,570 --> 02:04:57,403
So,

2479
02:04:59,010 --> 02:04:59,251
you know,

2480
02:04:59,251 --> 02:05:04,251
if people think about the moon landing
is being a hoax or that single moon

2481
02:05:04,381 --> 02:05:05,214
mission,

2482
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:06,623
there were other

2483
02:05:08,490 --> 02:05:09,570
missions that were,

2484
02:05:09,571 --> 02:05:10,404
uh,

2485
02:05:10,680 --> 02:05:13,290
that were vital to be
able to get to the moon.

2486
02:05:17,370 --> 02:05:18,203
I believe,

2487
02:05:18,300 --> 02:05:19,380
if I'm remembering correctly,

2488
02:06:04,830 --> 02:06:05,221
Sophia,

2489
02:06:05,221 --> 02:06:06,011
all I'd say is like,

2490
02:06:06,011 --> 02:06:07,960
how do we know that we can't
get through the van Allen Belt?

2491
02:06:12,570 --> 02:06:13,403
How do you know that

2492
02:06:41,430 --> 02:06:42,600
time and pressure

2493
02:06:45,210 --> 02:06:46,450
and did do fruit and

2494
02:06:55,560 --> 02:06:56,980
what is a podcast about?

2495
02:06:56,981 --> 02:06:57,520
I don't know.

2496
02:06:57,520 --> 02:06:58,360
Ask Me your question.

2497
02:07:12,370 --> 02:07:15,710
I have sophia probably 10 years ago.

2498
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:20,513
Yeah.

2499
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:50,133
No,

2500
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:53,020
I haven't had a girlfriend before.

2501
02:07:57,060 --> 02:07:58,650
Two Thousand 16

2502
02:08:00,200 --> 02:08:01,230
and 2016.

2503
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:27,400
I don't really watch

2504
02:08:30,330 --> 02:08:31,560
Netflix all that much.

2505
02:08:32,470 --> 02:08:33,510
I watched mine hunter.

2506
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,390
I watched that last show with the uh,

2507
02:08:37,080 --> 02:08:42,080
which is kinda old since 2017
with the Canadian organized mom.

2508
02:08:42,840 --> 02:08:45,330
I think it was called blood something.

2509
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:50,163
I'm from Chicago

2510
02:08:53,050 --> 02:08:53,883
in my thirties,

2511
02:09:03,350 --> 02:09:04,183
who

2512
02:09:06,340 --> 02:09:07,430
I watched a lot of youtube.

2513
02:09:14,140 --> 02:09:18,340
I've been trying to pay them more
and more attention to climate change.

2514
02:09:20,650 --> 02:09:22,000
Anthropogenic climate change.

2515
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:26,930
What do you watch on Youtube?

2516
02:09:28,210 --> 02:09:30,290
A watch Russia America.

2517
02:09:32,260 --> 02:09:33,380
So like a watch

2518
02:09:36,020 --> 02:09:39,980
Chris Hedges show recently listened
to the Ralph Nader Radio Hour.

2519
02:09:41,820 --> 02:09:42,653
Uh,

2520
02:09:45,810 --> 02:09:46,800
a lot of different stuff.

2521
02:09:50,890 --> 02:09:51,190
So you,

2522
02:09:51,190 --> 02:09:52,023
Joe

2523
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:55,800
just graduated boot camp near Chicago?

2524
02:09:57,710 --> 02:09:57,920
Well,

2525
02:09:57,920 --> 02:09:58,110
yeah.

2526
02:09:58,110 --> 02:09:59,130
What branch of the service?

2527
02:10:24,780 --> 02:10:26,790
I don't know what they call
career paths in the navy.

2528
02:10:27,430 --> 02:10:28,091
But what's your,

2529
02:10:28,091 --> 02:10:28,480
uh,

2530
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,370
what's the field that you're in?

2531
02:10:31,600 --> 02:10:31,871
No,

2532
02:10:31,871 --> 02:10:32,704
it's not Chris.

2533
02:10:34,560 --> 02:10:35,550
I'm not there right now.

2534
02:10:35,940 --> 02:10:36,773
I've moved.

2535
02:10:38,450 --> 02:10:39,810
It depends on where you're in Chicago,

2536
02:10:39,811 --> 02:10:40,081
but no,

2537
02:10:40,081 --> 02:10:40,914
it's not that bad

2538
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:45,573
if you're,

2539
02:10:46,330 --> 02:10:50,350
if you're unfortunately unfortunate
enough to be in a certain situation in a

2540
02:10:50,351 --> 02:10:51,550
certain tire in place,

2541
02:10:51,551 --> 02:10:52,780
then yeah,

2542
02:10:52,781 --> 02:10:54,190
then it can be bad.

2543
02:10:56,170 --> 02:11:01,170
My father was a union carpenter in Chicago
and he worked on the west side and he

2544
02:11:01,871 --> 02:11:05,750
had been in multiple shootouts,

2545
02:11:07,030 --> 02:11:09,910
basically gang rival gangs
shooting at each other

2546
02:11:13,370 --> 02:11:13,610
instead.

2547
02:11:13,610 --> 02:11:15,320
It was the most ridiculous
stuff they ever saw.

2548
02:11:15,590 --> 02:11:16,820
Of course they'd go for cover,

2549
02:11:16,821 --> 02:11:17,654
but

2550
02:11:18,860 --> 02:11:20,420
basically a vehicle would roll up

2551
02:11:22,010 --> 02:11:24,050
and would just start shooting at a house.

2552
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:27,560
No,

2553
02:11:27,560 --> 02:11:28,460
not really aiming.

2554
02:11:42,040 --> 02:11:43,000
You're in tech school.

2555
02:12:00,090 --> 02:12:01,050
You a feminist?

2556
02:12:05,740 --> 02:12:07,060
Sounds like a loaded question.

2557
02:12:08,680 --> 02:12:11,890
Do you think Americans
are stupid or more stupid?

2558
02:12:11,891 --> 02:12:12,724
You mean

2559
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:16,213
it's like a.

2560
02:12:17,420 --> 02:12:19,240
You asking that question is a.

2561
02:12:24,690 --> 02:12:26,700
What do you mean by more stupid?

2562
02:12:29,030 --> 02:12:29,863
As far as what?

2563
02:12:35,920 --> 02:12:36,753
Ooh,

2564
02:12:51,840 --> 02:12:54,780
I think Americans more isolated than
other people in other countries.

2565
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:00,860
I think America is lucky because
it's southern border of Mexico,

2566
02:13:01,220 --> 02:13:01,851
whereas Europe,

2567
02:13:01,851 --> 02:13:03,470
southern border is Africa.

2568
02:13:06,120 --> 02:13:11,120
America would look like Europe if you
flipped Mexico and Africa or it wouldn't.

2569
02:13:15,540 --> 02:13:17,190
You'd have a pretty authoritarian

2570
02:13:18,770 --> 02:13:20,180
element in the south

2571
02:13:28,940 --> 02:13:30,860
everywhere as people
from all over the world.

2572
02:13:32,040 --> 02:13:33,420
Maybe less so and

2573
02:13:36,470 --> 02:13:37,370
some countries.

2574
02:13:45,760 --> 02:13:45,891
Oh,

2575
02:13:45,891 --> 02:13:46,271
America.

2576
02:13:46,271 --> 02:13:50,830
Certainly as more people who probably
migrated here from other countries,

2577
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:54,380
but.

2578
02:14:19,920 --> 02:14:20,753
Hmm.

2579
02:14:22,930 --> 02:14:23,860
Well this is getting.

2580
02:14:30,320 --> 02:14:32,260
It's been two hours and 15 minutes now.

2581
02:14:46,230 --> 02:14:46,980
Yeah.

2582
02:14:46,980 --> 02:14:48,870
Well it's always fun
to run on some people.

2583
02:14:49,710 --> 02:14:50,131
Alright guys.

2584
02:14:50,131 --> 02:14:50,964
I'm gonna.

2585
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:52,601
I'm gonna.

2586
02:14:52,601 --> 02:14:53,434
Get going

2587
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:58,500
some dinner and do whatever I do.

2588
02:15:03,510 --> 02:15:04,343
You're welcome.

2589
02:15:05,990 --> 02:15:10,700
Hopefully I can figure something out at
some other point and maybe get monetized

2590
02:15:10,701 --> 02:15:11,534
and

2591
02:15:12,470 --> 02:15:13,790
we'll see if I can eventually ever

2592
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:17,930
make it back on here permanently again

2593
02:15:20,650 --> 02:15:20,861
later.

2594
02:15:20,861 --> 02:15:21,130
Guys.
