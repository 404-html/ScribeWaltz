1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,540
We know that if you're caught up in one
of these little world games that you may

2
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,020
be motivated by something very,

3
00:00:13,021 --> 00:00:14,100
very fundamental,

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:14,470
right,

5
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,440
a tendency that transcends you,

6
00:00:16,441 --> 00:00:18,870
the tendency to propagate yourself,

7
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:23,871
say Freud's fundamental motivational level
sexual affiliation or the tendency to

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,230
maintain yourself.

9
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,460
Those you could say are the
fundamental gods of existence,

10
00:00:29,461 --> 00:00:31,980
the fundamental driving force.

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:32,761
And it's there.

12
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:36,090
It's the interaction of those two
forces over great periods of time that

13
00:00:36,091 --> 00:00:40,140
produced the great diversity of life
and human life that we see before us.

14
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,240
And each of those fundamental,

15
00:00:42,241 --> 00:00:44,340
most fundamental of gods have their

16
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,240
differentiated many and so to speak.

17
00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:52,200
So that well engaged in the Matt
had goal of self preservation.

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,320
You Act out plots of hunger and plots of
thirst and he moved from cold to hot or

19
00:00:58,381 --> 00:01:00,660
from hot to cold depending
on your particular,

20
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,873
uh,

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:03,330
on your particular,

22
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:07,470
on the particular temperature of your
surroundings or with regards to self

23
00:01:07,471 --> 00:01:08,400
propagation.

24
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,700
You're attracted to people who are
repelled by them for reasons that are

25
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:14,310
frequently absolutely
beyond your comprehension,

26
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:14,701
by the way.

27
00:01:14,701 --> 00:01:16,380
So I just found out this week,

28
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,120
and this is absolutely staggering.

29
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:19,440
I think that if you,

30
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,573
uh,

31
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,630
if you run an experiment on a group of
women and you track their menstrual cycle

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,560
and then you give them t shirts
that men have worn to smell,

33
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,790
that women who are ovulating like the
smell of symmetrical men better than

34
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,880
asymmetrical man.

35
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:34,591
So,

36
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:37,620
and that's partly because symmetrical
men are probably more healthy,

37
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:42,621
but this is a good example of how the
motive forces that configure your world

38
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:46,920
are dependent on instinctual forces that
are not only beyond your consciousness,

39
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:51,921
but they're beyond even at the moment
any of our explicit explanations.

40
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,001
So,

41
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:57,211
uh,

42
00:01:57,211 --> 00:02:01,140
another finding that's very similar
that I came across recently,

43
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,500
it turns out that mice will not mate
with mice that have rh blood factors that

44
00:02:06,841 --> 00:02:08,100
are likely to produce,

45
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,263
um,

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,550
unfit offspring.

47
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,630
Uh,

48
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,600
the more closely genetically
related the RH factors,

49
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,050
the more likely there is to be a,

50
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:17,550
uh,

51
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,050
uh,

52
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:20,190
a catastrophe with regards to offspring.

53
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:23,660
And the mice seem to detect
the RH factor by smells.

54
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:27,960
So recently this was run by with women
and it is also the case that women prefer

55
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,780
man who's rh factors are at
an optimal distance from them.

56
00:02:30,781 --> 00:02:31,680
In terms of smell.

57
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,490
So this is some example of how
these unbelievably archaic systems,

58
00:02:35,491 --> 00:02:38,340
cause like the olfactory systems
are unbelievably archaic,

59
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:43,820
produce alterations in Worldview
at a level that's massively below

60
00:02:45,811 --> 00:02:46,800
consciousness.

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,270
So underneath your cortical shell,

62
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:55,410
which is tonically inhibiting all your
emotional and motivational systems,

63
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,680
lies all these motivational and emotional
systems and they have branches that

64
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:03,370
grow up into the cortex and they have
the capacity to control your behavior

65
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,890
completely involuntary.

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,791
So for example,

67
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:07,900
if you're gripped by fear,

68
00:03:07,901 --> 00:03:08,830
if you're gripped by fear,

69
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:09,311
it's very,

70
00:03:09,311 --> 00:03:11,290
very difficult to
overcome that voluntarily.

71
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,450
And at least initially
you won't be able to,

72
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,580
which is to say that
when the chips are down,

73
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,810
the underlying motivational and
emotional systems have control.

74
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:20,950
Okay,

75
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,220
so then what happens from that perspective
then what happens when you encounter

76
00:03:24,221 --> 00:03:25,420
something you don't understand?

77
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,440
And I think the best way to explain
it is something like generalized

78
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,400
disinhibition,

79
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:35,020
which is that all your
underlying motivational and
emotional systems are more or

80
00:03:35,021 --> 00:03:36,640
less disinhibited simile.

81
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:37,240
Tanium.

82
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:40,450
And the reason for that is because you
want to be maximally prepared to do

83
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:43,420
whatever the hell is necessary to do
when you're somewhere that you don't

84
00:03:43,421 --> 00:03:44,254
understand.

85
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,990
And because you don't know
what that thing is going to be,

86
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,580
all your systems go on.

87
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:50,980
And when psychologists talk about stress,

88
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:52,810
which is an abysmal word,

89
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:53,051
right?

90
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:54,460
It means everything and nothing.

91
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:56,290
When psychologists talk about stress,

92
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,170
what they mean is
generalized disinhibition.
