1
00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:00,973
Hmm,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,630
so
this is a fun one.

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,800
This is from the ead wind salter,
ninth to twelfth century.

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,230
That's how Adam and eve,
but the.

5
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:22,040
There is speculation that the fruit that
they're eating there,

6
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:25,970
you see this psilocybin mushrooms,
right?

7
00:00:25,971 --> 00:00:28,340
Because they're the only kind of
mushroom that girl like that.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,360
So that's pretty wild you might say.
And then this is the,

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,640
I think it's called [inaudible] steria
vine if I remember correctly,

10
00:00:37,641 --> 00:00:41,210
and it's what Iowasca is made out of and
it has this double helix form which is

11
00:00:41,211 --> 00:00:43,040
very,
very interesting.

12
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,810
And they,
the people that natives,

13
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:48,080
nobody could figure out how the hell
they made this Iowasca which,

14
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,560
which transports people spiritually in a
very intense manner.

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,300
And there's a whole religion based on
it,

16
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,060
like a modern religion as well as the
archaic religion to to,

17
00:00:57,250 --> 00:00:59,660
to make this stuff.
They had to take two plants that don't

18
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:03,620
grow anywhere near each other and like
there's like a million plants in the

19
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:04,160
Amazon.

20
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,350
So like how do you figure that out?
Nobody knows.

21
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,070
And then you have to cook them in this
very particular way for a particular

22
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,710
amount of time before you produce this
stuff.

23
00:01:12,711 --> 00:01:16,160
So one of the plants has dmt in it,
which is a very intense psychedelic,

24
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:20,540
but it's very short acting and the other
has a Mao inhibitor.

25
00:01:20,541 --> 00:01:23,360
So if you take the DMT and you take the
Mao inhibitor,

26
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,860
then the DMT trip lasts for much longer.
And so that's what these Amazonian

27
00:01:27,861 --> 00:01:31,550
natives figured out and no one has any
idea how they managed it and if you ask

28
00:01:31,551 --> 00:01:33,290
them,
they tell you that the plants told them

29
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,900
how to do it,
which isn't much of an explanation as

30
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:39,620
far as modern people are concerned.
But then when modern people take the

31
00:01:39,621 --> 00:01:42,680
IOWASCA and the plant,
so to speak,

32
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,830
starts to talk to them.
They're a little less leery of the whole

33
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:48,140
theory that the plants had something to
do with this.

34
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,560
So you know when these things that.
These.

35
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,130
I'm loath to talk about this because I'm
not an advocate for drug use,

36
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:58,520
but by the same token,
you can't ignore empirical data.

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,600
It's not reasonable.
And the empirical data that psychedelic

38
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:06,050
substances can produce mystical
experiences and that those often have a

39
00:02:06,051 --> 00:02:07,400
transformative effect.
I mean,

40
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,270
one of the latest study showed that if
you took people who were dying of cancer

41
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:15,350
and you and you gave them silicide,
been in a sufficient dose to produce a

42
00:02:15,351 --> 00:02:19,490
mystical experience that you radically.
It decreased their fear of death.

43
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,360
It's like you gotta think about that,
man.

44
00:02:23,361 --> 00:02:25,460
That's,
that's tough.

45
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,530
That's a tough experiment.
You just wouldn't expect that,

46
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:33,410
that you think you take someone,
you do range them intensely and then

47
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:35,480
when they come back they're not.
Even though they're dying,

48
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:37,850
they're not nearly as afraid of dying,
you know,

49
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:39,770
you,
you got to kind of wake up and smell the

50
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:41,270
roses when you see something like that.

51
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:44,360
And the people who are doing this
research are very reliable people.

52
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,070
So
there's the Amanita Mascara,

53
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,180
you know,
there's this old idea.

54
00:02:50,181 --> 00:02:53,930
It's quite a funny idea.
Toadstools so flies like avenue to

55
00:02:53,931 --> 00:02:57,590
Mascara and there's some.
This is ridiculous.

56
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,850
There's some evidence that they actually
like getting stoned.

57
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,930
So because animals will eat these,
like reindeer will eat these things too.

58
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:08,980
And they get pretty tripped out by them
and so I have this book on psychedelic

59
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,380
use among animals,
which is a small book,

60
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:12,880
but.
And so,

61
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,290
so there's,
there's this idea that toads used to sit

62
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:22,270
around the haven't eaten miscarry and
wait for the stone flies to like buzz

63
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,440
badly around them and then snap them up.
So that's pretty funny I think.

64
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,350
And so,
and you know,

65
00:03:29,351 --> 00:03:32,350
there are mushrooms in the US that are
the oldest,

66
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,960
the oldest organisms on the planet.
Hey,

67
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:37,030
there's one mushroom,
I can't remember where it is,

68
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:39,520
but it covers something like,
Oh God,

69
00:03:39,521 --> 00:03:42,010
I don't know,
like square hundreds of square miles.

70
00:03:42,011 --> 00:03:44,710
It's like this huge thing because it's
all underground,

71
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,420
right?
And they have these very complex

72
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:50,410
networks of mycelium.
They're called and they think the thing

73
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:53,170
is like 150,000 years old,
something like that.

74
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,710
So there's plenty of things about the
world that we don't know,

75
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,060
that's for sure.
