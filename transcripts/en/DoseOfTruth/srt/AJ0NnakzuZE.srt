1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:11,271
Okay.

2
00:00:11,271 --> 00:00:12,104
Let's see here.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,780
I'm a British conservative millennial
training to be a school teacher.

4
00:00:16,781 --> 00:00:20,320
How can I protect children age
five to 11 from postmodernism,

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,820
which is everywhere in school.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:22,511
God,

7
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:23,440
that's a good question.

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:24,310
That's Freya Hana.

9
00:00:24,550 --> 00:00:27,100
That was the main video I was
making today was about that.

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,550
Okay.

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,260
Teach them what you believe to be true.

12
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:35,460
Right?

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,990
Formulate for yourself.

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,790
A philosophy of education.

15
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:39,781
A serious one.

16
00:00:39,781 --> 00:00:40,441
Write it down,

17
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:40,710
right.

18
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,480
You can think about it
as a mission statement,

19
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:43,200
but write it down.

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,490
Spend some time on it man.

21
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:46,350
Cause You're devoting
your whole life to that.

22
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,890
Figuring out what kind of teacher you
want to be and come up with articulated

23
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:53,700
reasons why you're going to be that sort
of teacher and then do it come hell or

24
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:54,534
high water.

25
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,040
You know like often there's kids out
there that only have to run into one good

26
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:02,220
adult and that will set them on
a proper course through the life.

27
00:01:02,221 --> 00:01:03,930
And you could be that one good adult.

28
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:07,650
So I would say learn everything
you can about paws postmodernism.

29
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:08,760
So you're a master of it.

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:10,770
Decide what sort of
teacher you want to be.

31
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:11,521
Implement that,

32
00:01:11,521 --> 00:01:12,000
and,

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,990
and you'll,

34
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:18,050
you'll be a bulwark against that
kind of catastrophic foolishness and,

35
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:20,490
and help many,

36
00:01:20,491 --> 00:01:21,210
many people.
