00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,480
I want to begin with something that
Churchill wrote in the 19 thirties and

2
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:16,210
he said this,
one of the signs of a great society uses

3
00:00:16,211 --> 00:00:20,610
a diligence with which it passes culture
from one generation to the next.

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:27,340
When one generation no longer passages
on the things that are dear to it,

5
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,010
its heroes and they stories and its
religious faith.

6
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,990
It's in effect saying that past is not
void.

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,990
It's of no value.
He goes on to say that leaves young

8
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:44,991
people feeling a lack of direction and a
lack of purpose and opens them to the

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:50,940
dictum of Karl Marx that are people
derived of the history,

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,620
easily persuaded.
Have we stripped down young people have

11
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,270
purpose and meaning and left them open
to being bullied around whether there's

12
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,960
two things about that that I think are
really worth worth laying out.

13
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:07,170
The for the first is an analysis of the
purpose of memory.

14
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,800
Now because people think that the
purpose of memory is to remember the

15
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:13,500
past and that's not the purpose of
memory.

16
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:18,870
The purpose of memory is to extract out
from the past lessons to structure the

17
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,360
future,
and that's the purpose of personal

18
00:01:21,361 --> 00:01:24,870
memory and so you're done with a memory
when you've extracted out the

19
00:01:24,871 --> 00:01:27,600
information that you can use to guide
yourself properly in the future.

20
00:01:27,601 --> 00:01:29,550
So if you have a traumatic memory,
for example,

21
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:34,230
that's really obsessing you.
If you analyze that memory to the point

22
00:01:34,231 --> 00:01:38,310
where you figured out how you put
yourself at risk and you can determine

23
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,610
how you might avoid that in the future,
then the emotion associated with that

24
00:01:41,611 --> 00:01:44,910
goes away.
So memories are has a very pragmatic

25
00:01:44,911 --> 00:01:49,320
function and cultural memories.
The same thing is that we need to

26
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:53,340
extract out stories from our past that
structure our future and we need that

27
00:01:53,341 --> 00:01:56,700
because first of all,
if you don't have a purpose,

28
00:01:56,701 --> 00:02:00,570
let's say it isn't,
that your life becomes neutral in a in a

29
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,010
meaningless sentence.

30
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:05,790
It's that your life becomes
characterized by unbearable suffering

31
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,020
because the baseline condition of life
is something like unbearable suffering

32
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,350
and what you have to set against that is
a noble and worthwhile purpose and

33
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:18,660
hopefully,
hopefully your determination of that

34
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:22,260
purpose is buttress to some degree by
the wisdom of the past because you can't

35
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:24,030
conjure something like that up on your
own,

36
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,540
and if you provide people with nobility
of purpose,

37
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,230
then they can tolerate the suffering of
existence without becoming entirely

38
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:34,170
corrupted by it.
And cultures that don't do that,

39
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,890
it isn't even so much that they die.
It's that cultures that don't do that

40
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,960
are dead.
They're done.

41
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,590
They don't have a story anymore and they
don't have a call to adventure.

42
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:46,470
And then while then everyone suffers
stupidly.

43
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:48,600
As a consequence.
It's a very bad thing.

44
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,130
So Churchill made the same observation
that many of the great psychologists and

45
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,410
philosophers made in the early part of
the 20th century.

46
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,740
It's like bringing this story forward
and and propagate it and make it the

47
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:05,520
most noble possible story.
And then you motivate people to do,

48
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,040
to transcend themselves,
which they need to do.

49
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,760
So yes,
he's exactly right in his diagnosis.
