1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:11,550
Mr Dates it should I hide
my anti spam anti feminism?

2
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:14,730
I presume as I study
university to become a nurse?

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,973
Well

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,043
look,

5
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:24,060
you shouldn't make unnecessary enemies
and you probably shouldn't mouth your

6
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:25,620
opinion more than necessary.

7
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:30,840
But I think you risk damaging your soul
under certain circumstances when you

8
00:00:30,841 --> 00:00:32,070
don't say what you think.

9
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:36,870
So I wouldn't hide it because I
think it's dangerous to hide it.

10
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,220
And you also won't find out,

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,170
find the other people
that you listened to.

12
00:00:40,171 --> 00:00:42,030
But I would say be prudent,

13
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:42,830
you know,

14
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:43,620
um,

15
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,250
don't falsify your opinions
when you're writing.

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,210
That's a big mistake.

17
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,550
Don't falsify your opinions
when you're speaking.

18
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,010
You can always choose not to speak,

19
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:53,830
you know?

20
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,390
Um,

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,250
but if you feel that you would be
doing damage to your integrity,

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,560
then you have to say what you have to say.

23
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,360
Do it carefully and,

24
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:06,330
and prepare for the consequences,

25
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:06,960
you know,

26
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,320
uh,

27
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,000
probably prepare beforehand,

28
00:01:09,001 --> 00:01:09,780
I would say.

29
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,660
So I think the hiding is a bad idea,

30
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:13,261
like I said,

31
00:01:13,261 --> 00:01:15,120
but don't make unnecessary enemies,

32
00:01:15,121 --> 00:01:15,421
you know,

33
00:01:15,421 --> 00:01:17,190
cause there's just no utility in that.

34
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,120
How important do you
believe the American right?

35
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,120
Is the American right to bear
arms and maintain malicious?

36
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,670
Is it equivalent to the
right to free speech?

37
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,391
Well,

38
00:01:27,391 --> 00:01:30,360
I don't think anything is equivalent
to the right to free speech or the

39
00:01:30,361 --> 00:01:32,250
responsibility for free speech.

40
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:32,970
Um,

41
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:36,660
how important do I believe
that that right is Jesus?

42
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,770
That's a tough question.

43
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,460
You know,

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,450
my dad's a hunter.

45
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,820
He has 200 rifles,

46
00:01:41,821 --> 00:01:42,571
something like that.

47
00:01:42,571 --> 00:01:45,990
They're all single shots because
he believes in aiming carefully.

48
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:46,800
Um,

49
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,060
the culture I come from,

50
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:52,050
which is Northwestern
Canada is a rural culture,

51
00:01:52,051 --> 00:01:56,190
a hunting culture of people take their
guns seriously there and it is definitely

52
00:01:56,191 --> 00:01:57,330
part of their lifestyle.

53
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:01,410
Mean my dad is hunted his whole life and
we ate wild meat almost all the time I

54
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:02,244
was growing up.

55
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,540
Um,

56
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,650
I think that the right to bear
arms is one of the markers of a,

57
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,450
of a free society.

58
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:13,020
I don't think it's reasonable that
only the police and the army should be

59
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:14,430
allowed to be dangerous.

60
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:15,983
Um,

61
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,580
having said that,

62
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,061
well,

63
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:23,410
I think I'll just leave it at that.

64
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,160
I mean,

65
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,900
I feel obligated in some sense,

66
00:02:25,901 --> 00:02:26,740
to go farther,

67
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,530
especially with regards to
what happened in Las Vegas.

68
00:02:29,531 --> 00:02:30,364
But,

69
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,333
um,

70
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,530
it seems to me that mostly what happens
after these mass shootings is that the

71
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,470
event gets absolutely politicized and
people take their standard positions and

72
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:43,750
there's no moving either
side and that's too bad.

73
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,771
But,

74
00:02:44,771 --> 00:02:45,604
um,

75
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,400
I think that it's unfortunate to use an
event like the Las Vegas event or the

76
00:02:57,401 --> 00:02:59,200
Columbine shootings to make political.

77
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,840
And I think that's usually what happens.

78
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,760
And so I'm not going to do that.

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,110
I think it's an important,

80
00:03:05,111 --> 00:03:05,680
right.

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,220
I believe that the individual should
be allowed or even encouraged to be

82
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:09,821
dangerous,

83
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:10,780
but controlled,

84
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,380
you know?

85
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,180
So along with that,

86
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:13,510
right,

87
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,230
is a responsibility and,

88
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,130
and I guess maybe from the NRA,

89
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,560
there should be more
discussion of responsibility.

90
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,550
Is that possible?

91
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,830
That seems to me to be reasonable.

92
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,550
So.
