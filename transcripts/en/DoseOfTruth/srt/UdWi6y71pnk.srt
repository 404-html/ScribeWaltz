1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,263
Can you say something again?

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:03,310
Yammer right here?

3
00:00:03,311 --> 00:00:03,441
Uh,

4
00:00:03,441 --> 00:00:07,360
I'll say whatever you been out
of that a nice going to do today.

5
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,030
I'm picking up the audio
again and there's no echo.

6
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:12,940
So let me get back to the live.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:14,560
I can't even see.

8
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,760
I really need two computer monitors.

9
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,110
I mean I have computer monitors,

10
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:20,351
I just don't,

11
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:21,470
I have my desk setup since I,

12
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,833
I've moved

13
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,410
so I can always have youtube
live on and the other one.

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,313
Oh boy.

15
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:34,650
Yeah.

16
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:34,981
Okay.

17
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:35,660
So,

18
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,493
uh,

19
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,401
let's see if they,

20
00:00:38,401 --> 00:00:39,234
uh,

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,460
it was this guy swamping mcgee.

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:43,980
Okay.

23
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,610
Well any heroes?

24
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:51,380
Oh my God.

25
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:52,213
Maybe

26
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,180
I could hear him right now.

27
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,110
Not on it right now.

28
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,070
Of course you checked me.

29
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:00,923
Just go back to them.

30
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:02,790
Okay.

31
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,680
So I'm skipping the daughter that's check.

32
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,820
Devote works on her own.

33
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,273
Okay.

34
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,231
Yeah,

35
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:10,650
she said that she can hear me,

36
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:11,041
but not.

37
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,010
You asked,

38
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,073
you said though?

39
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:13,801
Oh man,

40
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:16,740
that's not good because I'm
picking up your audio right now.

41
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,140
Steve Nichols.

42
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:18,973
Sorry,

43
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,720
I'm picking up your audio
right now through obs.

44
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,100
So it should be routing.

45
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,193
Okay.

46
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,480
I've turned my volume up quite a bit.

47
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:28,260
Uh,

48
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,810
I don't want to crank
it to and rapes my ears,

49
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:31,644
but.

50
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,330
Alright.

51
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:35,670
So,

52
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:36,570
so it looks like we're good,

53
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,400
I think.

54
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,233
Oh really?

55
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,313
Uh,

56
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,140
I can hear us both.

57
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,973
Yeah,

58
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:43,943
that's bad.

59
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,053
That's bad.

60
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:48,750
No Echo on no echo on either one.

61
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,330
It must've been some priorities,

62
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,680
driver issue that right things
in the right order or something

63
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,593
or something.

64
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:01,803
Ice.

65
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,733
It makes me happy

66
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,270
because I knew nothing
to do at that point.

67
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,890
Nothing I could do.

68
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:10,700
Okay.

69
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,020
Alright.

70
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:11,853
So

71
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,710
you were alright.

72
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,090
So back to the Sargon

73
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,120
yeah.

74
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:19,331
Yeah.

75
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:19,931
So uh,

76
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:24,760
you had asked me if I had a
watched the video and I finished it

77
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,220
today a few hours ago and uh,

78
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:31,751
you know,

79
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:32,720
one of the things that,

80
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,150
that I had mentioned to you
in the beginning because
I hadn't watched the rest

81
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:37,631
of the video,

82
00:02:37,631 --> 00:02:39,190
was how like,

83
00:02:39,191 --> 00:02:39,820
uh,

84
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,360
that group,

85
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:45,360
Chapo Trap House basically a
seemed to be siting with A.

86
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,130
I'm forgetting the director's name again.

87
00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:49,000
I can't remember his name.

88
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,913
What was it?

89
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,500
Over Verhoeven?

90
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,040
Yeah,

91
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,880
I'll remember that now.

92
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:58,020
Relevant for Hoven a diaper.

93
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,800
I rewatched the that day too,

94
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,040
just

95
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,630
to keep up with it.

96
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,050
But yeah,

97
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:02,740
if go,

98
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,071
yeah.

99
00:03:03,071 --> 00:03:05,080
And so verhoeven was,

100
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,293
uh,

101
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:11,850
was basically creating what he thought
was a movie based off have based off of

102
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:14,973
but a movie,

103
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,343
um,

104
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:21,700
or a story that he believed
was a fascistic and uh,

105
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:22,880
you know,

106
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,250
Sargon pointed out that,

107
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,031
well,

108
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:26,241
you know,

109
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,950
it's a voluntary society.

110
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:29,090
Everybody who joins up,

111
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:29,850
you know,

112
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,710
does so willingly,

113
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,650
nobody's conscripted and

114
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,351
yeah,

115
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:35,130
it's almost,

116
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,500
it's almost like verhoeven
didn't even read the book,

117
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,490
which is true.

118
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,420
You didn't actually read it.

119
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,230
Yeah,

120
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,063
I don't,

121
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,750
I don't really.

122
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:44,111
It was like,

123
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:44,944
oh,

124
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,250
it's over fighting with the
source material constantly.

125
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,483
Like,

126
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:52,740
that made no sense because you
didn't hit second year already.

127
00:03:52,741 --> 00:03:54,460
You hardly use the source material.

128
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,840
It was like,

129
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,210
it was like that old Batman show.

130
00:03:57,211 --> 00:03:58,021
It's not really bad,

131
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:58,211
man.

132
00:03:58,211 --> 00:03:58,481
It was like,

133
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:59,314
almost like a sharp.

134
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,233
Yeah.

135
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,420
Yeah.

136
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,480
And compared to good.

137
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,440
And they considered it fascistic,

138
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:06,591
you know,

139
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:11,150
they considered it to be
a work of fascism and uh,

140
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,663
it doesn't.

141
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,070
No,

142
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:14,000
it doesn't make sense to me.

143
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:15,050
The only way I could,

144
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,093
I could,

145
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,073
you know,

146
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,870
see it or see them as interpreting
it as fast as well as being this,

147
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,313
uh,

148
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
like them using the Arachnids as them
not taking a literal approach to the

149
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:33,294
story,

150
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,901
but you know,

151
00:04:33,901 --> 00:04:38,901
rather than being arachnids maybe it
could be humans and because I never read

152
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,481
the book,

153
00:04:42,481 --> 00:04:45,690
I don't know if the directors are still
the same insect creatures where they

154
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:46,524
are.

155
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,320
Oh,

156
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,520
there's a couple of races actually
there's the terrans with other humans and

157
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:54,420
then there's the skinnies which the
way they describe and is very strange.

158
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:57,510
So you have to kind of use your
imagination but just imagine like a really

159
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:58,800
skinny alien guy.

160
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:03,270
And then there's directors and in the
beginning of the rapids are sort of allied

161
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:07,980
with the skinnies and then over time
the human start like rating the skinnies

162
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:12,750
and basically thought not killing a lot
of them but just kinda like fucking shit

163
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:13,500
up.

164
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,270
And in doing so they get the skinny to
change sides to give them intelligence

165
00:05:18,271 --> 00:05:19,630
and how to help the feed the,

166
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,620
it's because the humans aren't doing
very well in the book against them.

167
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:23,551
So,

168
00:05:23,551 --> 00:05:23,670
uh,

169
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:27,570
they kind of have to turn the skinnies
first and it opens up with a sore toe

170
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,850
against the skinnies and
it's quite descriptive.

171
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:30,091
I mean,

172
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:31,020
it is science fiction,

173
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:34,140
so it was way different than the movie,

174
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,033
like the movie.

175
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,670
Um,

176
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:38,330
the way their hoven shows it,

177
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,870
it was clearly you didn't read the book.

178
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,531
He clearly,

179
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:42,700
he must have been fighting with
the writer because the writer,

180
00:05:42,701 --> 00:05:43,411
I read the book,

181
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:48,411
but they must've just been a constant
battle to get things properly in there.

182
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,651
There are some things,

183
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:50,311
we're obviously,

184
00:05:50,311 --> 00:05:51,750
they had to squish it all together,

185
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,120
you know,

186
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,480
because the way they filled
with adapt from movies or um,

187
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,890
sort of films with that from books.

188
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,640
But a lot of the stuff
didn't make a lot of sense.

189
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,260
Yeah.

190
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:00,651
Well,

191
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:05,651
I think that if verhoeven
had actually read the book,

192
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,470
he would have had more of an argument
of it being a metaphor for fascism in

193
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,154
that,

194
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,311
and I,

195
00:06:14,311 --> 00:06:15,560
I may be completely wrong,

196
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:16,311
but you know,

197
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:16,660
if,

198
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,630
if humans were,

199
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,700
were committing the
violence against humans,

200
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:19,941
I mean,

201
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:20,900
if it wasn't the same,

202
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,700
the same to the same capacity where
the Arachnids we're just mindless

203
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,570
destroyers,

204
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:27,811
then you know,

205
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:28,644
you could,

206
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,140
you could say,

207
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:30,950
well,

208
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:31,221
you know,

209
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:31,750
the human,

210
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,301
the Terran,

211
00:06:32,301 --> 00:06:34,340
we're just protecting themselves.

212
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:35,300
But you know,

213
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,260
if they weren't,

214
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,100
if they weren't protecting themselves.

215
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,551
But see,

216
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:41,510
that's the thing is that I,

217
00:06:41,511 --> 00:06:42,260
I don't,

218
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,130
I haven't read the book.

219
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:48,131
I mean with the skinnies not violent
and did the terran initiate violence

220
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:52,190
against the skin and all of this is
irrelevant because verhoeven did read the

221
00:06:52,191 --> 00:06:52,840
book.

222
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,700
But I mean now I'm trying
to make a case for fascism.

223
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,703
You know,

224
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,410
skinnies weren't even really
involved like even in the book,

225
00:06:59,411 --> 00:07:01,150
but we just talked about.

226
00:07:01,151 --> 00:07:01,984
And uh,

227
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,690
they were,

228
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:04,650
they had kind of switched
sides to the humans.

229
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,250
Yeah.

230
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:06,971
Detail to really,

231
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:09,430
I guess maybe make part of the movie.

232
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,510
So maybe that's why they didn't include
them because I was confused at first I

233
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:14,231
was reading the book and I'm like,

234
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:15,020
where's the Arachnids?

235
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:15,680
They're like fighting news.

236
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:16,920
We're thinking still skinnies.

237
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:17,681
And then,

238
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:17,831
uh,

239
00:07:17,831 --> 00:07:18,660
in the movie

240
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,990
sample is another part where there's
like the Mormon extreme mormon columnists

241
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:22,824
or whatever,

242
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,760
but they're not in the book at all.

243
00:07:24,761 --> 00:07:26,430
And even after I finished
the book I was like,

244
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:26,840
Hey,

245
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,271
wait a minute.

246
00:07:27,271 --> 00:07:29,040
Wasn't there like Mormon
columnists or something?

247
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,450
Did I like miss those pages?

248
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:30,841
But no,

249
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,280
they're just not in the book at all.

250
00:07:32,281 --> 00:07:34,830
I went online just to make sure it
wasn't fucked up because I read,

251
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,370
I read the book pretty quickly
over a period of a couple of days.

252
00:07:38,371 --> 00:07:39,150
So,

253
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,983
um,

254
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:40,370
yeah,

255
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:40,931
I was just worried.

256
00:07:40,931 --> 00:07:41,640
I maybe like,

257
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,890
must have like blanked out,

258
00:07:42,891 --> 00:07:45,710
but I know there is no mormons in
the book at all of us just made up.

259
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,220
I guess they have to make
him look bad or something.

260
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,054
I don't know.

261
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,313
Yeah.

262
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,050
But I wonder if the

263
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,330
good

264
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,840
that was going to say I wonder
what verhoeven's outside of,

265
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,100
you know,

266
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,010
being a director,

267
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,660
what his politics are.

268
00:08:00,661 --> 00:08:01,190
You know,

269
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,023
what he,

270
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,030
what he believes,

271
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:03,720
you know,

272
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:03,991
I mean,

273
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:04,824
I guess we kind of.

274
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,673
All right,

275
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,310
well my guess is that he's kind of not,

276
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:11,250
like not a far left.

277
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,780
It's like a default socialist or be
full Democrat sort of thing through to

278
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:17,220
translate to American politics.

279
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:17,571
Yeah,

280
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,130
definitely a social democrat,

281
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,480
like not nothing in the movie.

282
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,850
Even the movie like it's funny,

283
00:08:25,851 --> 00:08:28,150
I think if he thought it wasn't a,

284
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,190
I think if you had not
thought it was a fascist,

285
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,810
like based system,

286
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,690
I think he probably wouldn't have made
the movie because then he wouldn't have

287
00:08:35,691 --> 00:08:36,524
been able to market.

288
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,860
I think he probably would have like
the movie wouldn't have gotten made,

289
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:44,330
so maybe it's a good thing that he kind
of fucked it up because that way at

290
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:45,950
least the film was presented.

291
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,463
Yeah,

292
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,620
that's probably the,

293
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:48,980
uh,

294
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,510
the recipe to his success.

295
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:53,150
Just a making a mockery of something.

296
00:08:53,151 --> 00:08:56,860
Just Straw manning a
straw man or something,

297
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:57,231
you know,

298
00:08:57,231 --> 00:08:58,064
it doesn't exist.

299
00:08:59,180 --> 00:08:59,480
Yeah,

300
00:08:59,480 --> 00:08:59,991
exactly.

301
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:00,240
Uh,

302
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,841
it's really easy.

303
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:02,520
I don't have a lot of
people talk about like,

304
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,563
um,

305
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,810
there's like rising outright
and fascism or whatever.

306
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,290
Uh,

307
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:08,850
but it's really the easiest,

308
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:13,110
it's one of the easiest ideologies to
make fun of because they're both rooted in

309
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:17,460
a collective level of [inaudible]
and he galleon like collectivism,

310
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:19,800
which I was just listening.

311
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,020
I was listening to your,

312
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:21,480
uh,

313
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:21,670
the,

314
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,830
the link you sent me a camera.

315
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,000
That was the.

316
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,840
Oh yeah,

317
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,840
it was the stability and excellent Quinn's
Slobodin I think that was listening

318
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:30,781
to him.

319
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:31,880
And then I listened to a,

320
00:09:31,881 --> 00:09:32,280
uh,

321
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,911
also today,

322
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:35,190
Steven Hicks explaining postmodernism.

323
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,200
Have you read or listened
to that a while ago?

324
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:40,860
I think when,

325
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,270
when I first started
listening to Peterson,

326
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,100
I listened a little bit too,

327
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,840
Steven Hicks and I can't remember much
of what I heard and I can't recall the,

328
00:09:48,841 --> 00:09:49,670
uh,

329
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:52,980
the Peterson Steven Hicks conversation.

330
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,360
Oh,

331
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:54,541
I,

332
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:54,991
I listened,

333
00:09:54,991 --> 00:09:58,530
I listened to Steven Hicks
has audio book explaining,

334
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,820
explaining postmodernism.

335
00:09:59,821 --> 00:10:01,110
He has a couple of interviews.

336
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:01,591
I guess you'd be,

337
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:02,940
I'd probably see on
the same ones you have,

338
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:06,270
but I've listened to the audiobook and
it goes into like the detail from the

339
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,530
medieval ages basically.

340
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,773
Okay,

341
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,780
cool.

342
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,830
Can you give me the gist of it?

343
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,301
Yeah,

344
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:16,020
well he runs through like how
postmodernism came to be then it Kinda,

345
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,220
it's,

346
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,520
it's,

347
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,810
it's a six hour audio books,

348
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:23,400
so it's Kinda hard to make
it smaller to understand,

349
00:10:23,401 --> 00:10:25,320
but I recommend listening to that.

350
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:26,880
But essentially,

351
00:10:26,881 --> 00:10:27,714
um,

352
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,510
you go from Emmanuel Kant,

353
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,051
so you have the,

354
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:31,884
uh,

355
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,350
the enlightenment movement,

356
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:37,920
which is this idea that things are real
and you can sense things and you'd get

357
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:40,320
like empiricists and uh,

358
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,990
a rationalist and these different groups
that kind of compete with each other,

359
00:10:45,991 --> 00:10:47,490
but they believe the world's real right.

360
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:49,050
And it works.

361
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,610
It works really well for science,

362
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,710
but it doesn't work so well with like the,

363
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:52,920
uh,

364
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,900
spiritual humanity side of things.

365
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,800
And that's,

366
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,570
that was exposed by Emmanuel Kant.

367
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,950
He was part of the counter enlightenment.

368
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,260
And over time you find,

369
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:01,840
can't,

370
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,673
uh,

371
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,120
see,

372
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,070
he says,

373
00:11:05,071 --> 00:11:05,850
well,

374
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,860
science is fine,

375
00:11:06,861 --> 00:11:08,400
that it's explaining about these things,

376
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,130
but you can't explain the
other half of humanity,

377
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,310
the humanities and like a religion,

378
00:11:14,311 --> 00:11:15,144
for example.

379
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:15,691
Uh,

380
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:18,400
with the same techniques
because they don't match match.

381
00:11:18,401 --> 00:11:19,021
Like for example,

382
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:19,431
you know how you,

383
00:11:19,431 --> 00:11:20,690
if you drink a,

384
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:21,720
uh,

385
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,800
an orange tastes sweet,

386
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:23,190
right?

387
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,180
When do you eat an orange but not
after you drink like a sugary drink?

388
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,453
Yeah.

389
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,653
So it,

390
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,493
what he's saying is like,

391
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:31,830
well,

392
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,670
how do you know whether the orange is
sweet or what was the true nature of it?

393
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,070
Because it's sweet when
you get it on its own,

394
00:11:38,071 --> 00:11:39,930
but if you needed after
eating the chocolate cake,

395
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:40,561
it tastes sour.

396
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:45,390
So he goes into those sorts of things
and that's just the subjectivity of,

397
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,100
uh,

398
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,020
your sense or the
subjectivity of empiricism,

399
00:11:49,021 --> 00:11:50,550
I guess since data,

400
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:50,851
right.

401
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:51,800
That's parasitism,

402
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,540
right?

403
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,373
Um,

404
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:55,210
so you're saying you can't trust it.

405
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,583
Yeah.

406
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,491
So from,

407
00:11:58,491 --> 00:11:58,840
um,

408
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,120
Kantz a,

409
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:01,500
that's where the,

410
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:06,500
that's where the German school kind of
booked this anchor in with cans and uh,

411
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,750
like the first one to the mirror
and you say journalists before,

412
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:12,830
oh,

413
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,720
this is way before that I'm
talking to like Prussia and stuff.

414
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:16,260
Uh,

415
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,190
so can't,

416
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,220
became a sort of the German continental
sort of system of philosophy versus like

417
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,500
the British and French more,

418
00:12:25,501 --> 00:12:26,334
uh,

419
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,070
a more opportune,

420
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:33,230
sort of a philosophy like
unlocking philosophy is like
basically what the United

421
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,370
States was founded on Rehab
your rights and all that stuff.

422
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,703
Um,

423
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:40,370
but in,

424
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,610
in Germany is different.

425
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:46,611
Like the way their philosophy came about
was a lot another thing sargon goes

426
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:50,700
into in another video
where he talks about how,

427
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,560
because of the German question,

428
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,270
you know,

429
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,103
as a joke,

430
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,160
um,

431
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:56,640
but uh,

432
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,750
he goes into how like the Germans are
very imperialist and they seem to try to

433
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:04,290
reform an empire of the good they call it.

434
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,040
And this goes back to Russia would like
Frederick the great and he formed the,

435
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:14,880
you started like public schools for
boys and you've tried to make his army

436
00:13:14,881 --> 00:13:17,610
professional rather than
being peasants and stuff.

437
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,050
And it developed this sort
of like Germans superiority.

438
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,040
And uh,

439
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,131
oh,

440
00:13:23,131 --> 00:13:24,660
the German doesn't need to be educated.

441
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:29,460
They're fine being a dom and pour on the
farm and that's that they're superior

442
00:13:29,461 --> 00:13:31,260
people and all this other stuff.

443
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:31,761
And that,

444
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:36,761
that developed slowly with it eventually
that Kinda came up in some parts as

445
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:41,560
Nazi-ism in some parts as
Marxism in competition,

446
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,170
like as,

447
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,411
as,

448
00:13:42,411 --> 00:13:43,860
as a collective ideology.

449
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,470
And that's where you see all the
collective ivl she's came from,

450
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:47,580
they came from like a,

451
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,640
he galleon then marks and then do a
genteel gentilly on the fascist side of

452
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:53,964
things.

453
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,920
They came out to be a collectivist.

454
00:13:55,921 --> 00:13:58,520
And if you look at the British
and the American side of politics,

455
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,290
you get a very individualist policies,

456
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:04,920
even though I would say Britain's less
individuals than the United States,

457
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,020
it still is a,

458
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,400
it's way more
individualistic than Germans.

459
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,841
Then you've got the French,

460
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:10,890
which are kind of like a mix.

461
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,510
So they were very individualistic.

462
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:16,140
Then the lock Ian's last up to the
resilience during the French revolution.

463
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:18,761
And then,

464
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:19,594
uh,

465
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:22,180
Napoleon eventually
filled that power vacuum,

466
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,733
right?

467
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,420
So you can see the,

468
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,440
you can see the French switch
from individualism to imperialism,

469
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,360
which is a,

470
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,860
during the revolution
from say the ropes peer,

471
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,190
a peer that was like walking.

472
00:14:36,191 --> 00:14:37,420
So then rose Pierre took over,

473
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,110
he came,

474
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,290
he sort of brought the roof.

475
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:42,790
Sophia and ideas in and then
after that came the polio,

476
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,960
eventually after rubs,

477
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:48,990
pier was destroyed or had his head
chopped off and their policies all changed

478
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,180
and then you get a French empire
and they competed with the Russians.

479
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:55,280
Then eventually he falls because,

480
00:14:55,281 --> 00:14:55,940
uh,

481
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,700
all of your allies against them
essentially in the pulling on a course.

482
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,050
Yeah.

483
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,883
I'm getting it

484
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,380
history lesson in philosophy
and philosophy and how
it impacts almost running

485
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:07,190
out of breath,

486
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,023
but yeah.

487
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:09,531
Yeah.

488
00:15:09,531 --> 00:15:11,440
So basically it's just a in a,

489
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,160
you can't really see.

490
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,320
You can always start from a
particular place because it,

491
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,000
it evolved over time.

492
00:15:17,001 --> 00:15:17,834
All this stuff.

493
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,800
So it's hard to pinpoint when
likes a postmodern ideas happen.

494
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,870
But you could say they happened with Kant.

495
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:28,871
He might've been like the first prototype
postmodernist before modernism even

496
00:15:28,881 --> 00:15:29,390
existed.

497
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,590
Like he was the seed of it.

498
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,633
Yeah.

499
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,593
That's interesting.

500
00:15:34,550 --> 00:15:37,040
A university I went to a,

501
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:38,340
she didn't graduate from,

502
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,151
but then I went to,

503
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:39,981
was it a Catholic?

504
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:40,814
A salient.

505
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,960
You'd have a private university and uh,

506
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:44,890
and was,

507
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,573
uh,

508
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:50,220
there were quite a few extra lectures,

509
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,150
extra,

510
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,193
um,

511
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:57,240
things that you could attend a
highlighting the words of con.

512
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:58,170
Um,

513
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:01,680
I just remember seeing
through the brochures a thing,

514
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:06,710
extra things that you could attend and
a lot of them had to do with a manual.

515
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:08,010
Yeah.

516
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:08,843
Ideas.

517
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,413
Yeah.

518
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,550
His philosophy.

519
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:13,710
What was,

520
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:14,630
when I was in elementary school,

521
00:16:14,631 --> 00:16:18,200
I first came across Canada because we
had to do a project on a philosopher in

522
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,100
our philosophy class.

523
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,580
I just chose con.

524
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,740
I don't know what the fuck I was doing.

525
00:16:21,741 --> 00:16:22,431
I was like grade eight.

526
00:16:22,431 --> 00:16:24,460
So I just chose count because uh,

527
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,100
no one else chose them and whatever
that I learned a little bit about.

528
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:28,191
Um,

529
00:16:28,191 --> 00:16:28,930
then,

530
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:29,170
uh,

531
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:33,410
I didn't really care about them until
recently where I started listening to the

532
00:16:33,411 --> 00:16:35,540
Steven Hicks and he said,

533
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:37,340
the way he breaks it down
in this book is like,

534
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:41,630
I'm sort of like the grandfather of the,

535
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:41,751
uh,

536
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:45,740
the German School of
philosophy and the from him,

537
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:50,610
you get like the Eagle who then
he gets split off into UC eagles.

538
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,241
A collectivist,

539
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:52,450
like people believe like a,

540
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,540
the states,

541
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,220
it,

542
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,530
he,

543
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,140
he believed in the state
almost as strongly as fascist
to basically astronomers

544
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:02,930
fascist do and Marx took those
ideas and adapted them to be more,

545
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:03,490
uh,

546
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,990
a brew Sonia and I guess you could say,

547
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:10,850
and you can also see over time how the
leftists have abandoned marks to some

548
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:15,851
degree and started to adopt more resilient
ideas of like the noble savage and

549
00:17:15,891 --> 00:17:20,270
stuff like we should go back to the cave
days because back then man was so happy

550
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,800
and wasn't dying of diseases.

551
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,900
And you're being murdered
at super high res.

552
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:24,730
Right?

553
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:29,730
So does that like split classes to be
extreme or you kind of do away with

554
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:32,020
glasses and just one class?

555
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:34,240
The elite versus the peasants?

556
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,100
Who a re Rousseau,

557
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:40,120
Rousseau.

558
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:40,581
I don't think we're.

559
00:17:40,581 --> 00:17:42,980
So we're so wanting to
get rid of everything.

560
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:44,480
He,

561
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,390
he wanted to go back to
like a tribal society.

562
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:49,183
Oh.

563
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,260
Which is,

564
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:50,590
I mean,

565
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:51,650
you even know if he,

566
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:52,200
he would.

567
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,150
He postulated whether or
not that was realistic,

568
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:57,450
but that's what he said would be the
ideal state because we couldn't go back to

569
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,290
our animal nature,

570
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,720
which is sort of like the Adam
and Eve story with the fruit.

571
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,413
No

572
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,250
eating from the tree of
knowledge and then you know,

573
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,084
you can never go back.

574
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,860
I mean that's just obviously a metaphor,

575
00:18:08,861 --> 00:18:10,310
but yeah,

576
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,460
an interesting one anyways.

577
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:14,241
Yeah,

578
00:18:14,241 --> 00:18:15,074
I can hear you good.

579
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:15,831
Okay.

580
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:17,180
I think the stream just reconnected.

581
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:17,810
Yeah,

582
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:18,643
there we go.

583
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:19,861
Yeah.

584
00:18:19,861 --> 00:18:21,000
I wish I had more of an opinion,

585
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:22,950
but I don't because you know,

586
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:24,993
uh,

587
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,080
my retention of a philosophy historically
and how it's impacted nations and say

588
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:35,150
them over and over again because I
won't get everything the first time,

589
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,830
like not focused on it.

590
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:40,140
I'm kind of focusing on other banks
but over like we saw like absorbed,

591
00:18:40,141 --> 00:18:40,410
like,

592
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,243
you know,

593
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:45,260
that all 40 years of my head and
then I can kind of talk about them.

594
00:18:45,261 --> 00:18:46,220
But like the,

595
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,390
you know that Jordan Peterson,

596
00:18:47,391 --> 00:18:51,710
I'm with that lecture series
of maps of meaning 2017.

597
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,023
Yeah.

598
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,340
I think I've listened to
that like four or five times

599
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,190
the first time listen to that,

600
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,070
but first time I listened
to it blew my fucking mind.

601
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,660
Like I couldn't,

602
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,070
it,

603
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:03,460
it,

604
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,101
it basically,

605
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,590
to me it rationalized religious belief,

606
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,513
like it made it,

607
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,140
it made it make sense,

608
00:19:09,141 --> 00:19:10,580
like in an evolutionary way,

609
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,473
you know,

610
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:13,180
that's,

611
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:13,480
that's,

612
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,560
that's still kind of blows my mind.

613
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:14,961
I'm still around.

614
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:16,570
I'm still working my way through his book,

615
00:19:16,571 --> 00:19:19,630
but I keep getting sidetracked on
other things like starship troopers for

616
00:19:19,631 --> 00:19:20,464
example.

617
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,750
But,

618
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,583
but,

619
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,593
but uh,

620
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:24,993
but yeah,

621
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,020
the first starship troopers,

622
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,460
a lot of people have this issue with the,

623
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:27,691
uh,

624
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:28,391
the voting thing,

625
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:29,224
right?

626
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,580
Yeah.

627
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,220
What,

628
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:31,500
what,

629
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,333
what,

630
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,120
what exactly,

631
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,881
because you have to,

632
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:34,714
uh,

633
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,340
you have to commit to service.

634
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,130
Yeah.

635
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,940
You have to do through
your service a minimum.

636
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,700
Um,

637
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,440
and you have to,

638
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,800
I guess,

639
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:46,300
earn your right to vote by becoming
conscious of you're a collective

640
00:19:46,301 --> 00:19:48,070
responsibility or social responsibility.

641
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,550
Um,

642
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,050
and civilians don't
have to deal with that.

643
00:19:51,051 --> 00:19:52,330
And it makes a lot of sense.

644
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,560
I meant today there's a
lot of people that have no,

645
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:56,830
no clue what they're doing,

646
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:58,061
which is fine.

647
00:19:58,061 --> 00:19:59,710
I guess with our system,

648
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:04,920
but it turns into more of a
popularity contest then if you,

649
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:08,080
if you're voting someone
else's money into your pocket,

650
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,130
that's not.

651
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:13,330
I mean that's just a
really open for abuse,

652
00:20:13,331 --> 00:20:14,164
right?

653
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:15,663
Yeah.

654
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,430
And for economic prosperity,

655
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:22,431
you need to have sort of a guarantee of
property rights and that totally takes

656
00:20:22,861 --> 00:20:24,210
away from that in some,

657
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:24,810
in some way.

658
00:20:24,810 --> 00:20:25,380
I mean,

659
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:30,000
luckily our system has been relatively
reasonable and we haven't like quote

660
00:20:30,001 --> 00:20:31,380
unquote eating the rich.

661
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,940
But uh,

662
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,830
you never know with our Kazia Cortez the
70 percent rate that's used proposing,

663
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,473
that's insane.

664
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,820
Like quotes back.

665
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,050
She drove us back to like the
19 forties or whatever they can,

666
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,410
fifties when the rates were that high,

667
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:46,860
uh,

668
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,321
back then,

669
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:50,370
like the American economy was the only
one that was still industrialized.

670
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:52,660
That wasn't like flat into
the ground by the war.

671
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:57,880
So I mean Germany was one of the main
industrial nations before the war.

672
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:58,360
Right?

673
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,530
And so it was Britain,

674
00:20:59,531 --> 00:21:01,810
but during the war that it
kind of flattened everything.

675
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,180
So all of us left with Americans.

676
00:21:03,181 --> 00:21:06,340
So they kind of had a monopoly
on industrial production.

677
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,780
So that's the reason why wages were
so high and the tax rates for a,

678
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:13,020
I'm so high because there was the word,

679
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,120
they're gonna move the money to write,

680
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,370
you know,

681
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,430
nowadays you just move it to some third
world country and build a factory and

682
00:21:18,431 --> 00:21:18,640
then,

683
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:18,971
you know,

684
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:19,781
your money is there now.

685
00:21:19,781 --> 00:21:20,830
So it's not even the state.

686
00:21:20,831 --> 00:21:21,641
So yeah,

687
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:24,760
absolutely good decline of
the American economic empire.

688
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:25,221
Yeah.

689
00:21:25,221 --> 00:21:26,870
And the age of globalization,

690
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:27,231
you know,

691
00:21:27,231 --> 00:21:28,910
that everything's,

692
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:31,320
all the tables have turned and uh,

693
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:35,300
companies can just move
away or like you said,

694
00:21:35,301 --> 00:21:36,590
industry can just move away.

695
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:37,370
I mean,

696
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,020
it doesn't have to be
centered in the states.

697
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:40,223
Um,

698
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:40,930
yeah.

699
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:41,190
And you,

700
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,431
yeah,

701
00:21:41,431 --> 00:21:44,000
you can see now like with the
way things are in the states.

702
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:45,400
So like all technology,

703
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:46,290
um,

704
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:47,290
before trump,

705
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:50,370
I think trump's really turned
some things around but uh,

706
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,090
to some limited degree anyways,

707
00:21:52,091 --> 00:21:55,060
but definitely under Obama it was almost
like the economy in the states was

708
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:57,970
going under a sort of
a controlled decline,

709
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,920
which I think is quite a bad idea
if you want to win elections,

710
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,813
you know.

711
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,021
Well,

712
00:22:05,021 --> 00:22:05,854
um,

713
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,010
I forgot what I was going to say.

714
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:12,430
Yeah,

715
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,640
sorry I interrupted you there.

716
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,180
No,

717
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,430
no,

718
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,263
you didn't.

719
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,570
Okay.

720
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,111
Oh yeah,

721
00:22:17,111 --> 00:22:17,440
yeah.

722
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:17,591
Well,

723
00:22:17,591 --> 00:22:18,010
there,

724
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:18,843
you know,

725
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:22,330
when you mentioned a Kazia Cortez citing,

726
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,300
you know,

727
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,430
probably ftrs,

728
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,690
what was it [inaudible] 91 and
96 or whatever percent tax rate.

729
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,380
Um,

730
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:31,090
I mean even some of the programs,

731
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,220
social programs that they instituted then,

732
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:33,690
you know,

733
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:35,740
basically fell flat on their face and,

734
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,521
you know,

735
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,354
I don't

736
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:38,891
know,

737
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:40,540
it would be all well and good if,

738
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,403
uh,

739
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,240
those taxes,

740
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,600
if,

741
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:43,840
you know,

742
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,840
there was transparency with what exactly
money went to and how it contributed to

743
00:22:50,111 --> 00:22:52,960
a productivity in the economy,

744
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:55,450
but don't necessarily know that,

745
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:55,691
you know,

746
00:22:55,691 --> 00:22:58,210
there isn't any transparency and maybe,

747
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,170
you know,

748
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,940
maybe people would be afraid to,

749
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:01,774
uh,

750
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,940
to now when I say people,

751
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:04,774
I mean,

752
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,733
um,

753
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,530
anybody who knows

754
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:14,560
whether it be economists or engineers
or exactly how things are being

755
00:23:14,561 --> 00:23:18,760
misappropriated or mishandled
or the inefficiencies or the,

756
00:23:18,761 --> 00:23:19,594
uh,

757
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,970
unproductive or unproductive African,

758
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:23,223
uh,

759
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,720
nature of,

760
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:27,360
of the,

761
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:27,581
you know,

762
00:23:27,581 --> 00:23:28,840
the federal government intervening.

763
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:30,123
Um,

764
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,083
yeah,

765
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,980
I always thought it was
kind of interesting.

766
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,433
Uh,

767
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:35,780
well,

768
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,613
not always.

769
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:40,930
I had recently started to read one
Ralph Nader's books and you know,

770
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:41,764
basically he,

771
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:42,370
you know,

772
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,203
he

773
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,520
put forth the concept of,

774
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,170
of taxing

775
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,520
that which humans like least,

776
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,060
you know,

777
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:53,630
being,

778
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:53,930
you know,

779
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:56,890
pollution companies that uh,

780
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,310
basically contribute to,

781
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,173
um,

782
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:04,790
pollution.

783
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,623
Uh,

784
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:08,960
and I think pothole or 54
had just put out a video,

785
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,130
um,

786
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:15,130
about climate change and how carbon
taxes in Australia have actually led to

787
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,650
companies in Australia innovating to
the point where they now are saving.

788
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,330
They've been able to save money,

789
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,180
more money over time than
if they had done nothing.

790
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,283
Um,

791
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,830
and uh,

792
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,880
I should have mentioned
this to you before,

793
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,030
but who knows the,

794
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,640
we'd kind of go in this direction,

795
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,190
but that would be kind
of something interesting.

796
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:37,371
So,

797
00:24:37,371 --> 00:24:38,204
you know,

798
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,073
I'm,

799
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,550
so not only did they,

800
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:41,660
are they saving money,

801
00:24:41,661 --> 00:24:45,050
but they also started
recapturing some of their,

802
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,680
uh,

803
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,060
some of their emissions and I don't
know if they were recycling them or,

804
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,733
or what,

805
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,360
but the taxes led to a in innovation,

806
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,190
which makes sense because pressure,

807
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:58,880
you know,

808
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,880
only under pressure or when someone
believes that something needs to change,

809
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:06,500
does it change?

810
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,333
And

811
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:07,880
Oh,

812
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,090
that's,

813
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:08,910
that's true.

814
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:12,300
But I mean if I hold a gun to your head
and I say like drive the car faster when

815
00:25:12,301 --> 00:25:13,134
you're driving the car,

816
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:14,850
are you going to drive the car faster?

817
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:15,661
Yeah.

818
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:16,860
But I don't necessarily know that,

819
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:17,530
that,

820
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,300
that uh,

821
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:24,500
that analogizes well with a component.

822
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,393
Yeah.

823
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,690
With saying as,

824
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:27,990
because it's a show of force,

825
00:25:27,991 --> 00:25:28,111
right?

826
00:25:28,111 --> 00:25:28,944
Like you're saying like a,

827
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,310
essentially when the state
mandates that you do something,

828
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:31,940
it's like a show.

829
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,570
It's like you're forced to do it and
if you don't do it then you're going to

830
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:36,710
experience violence.

831
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,340
So my knowledge is basically like the
government is saying do this or you're

832
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:41,850
going to be punished like someone's.

833
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:42,950
And then suddenly you're like,

834
00:25:42,951 --> 00:25:43,131
well,

835
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:45,200
I guess I have to find
a way to innovate also,

836
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:46,034
I'm going to suffer.

837
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:46,731
Um,

838
00:25:46,731 --> 00:25:49,190
it's like someone holding a gun
to your head and saying like,

839
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:49,491
you know,

840
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:51,130
drive the car faster
or something like that.

841
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:54,560
You might start driving the car faster
if you are worried about getting shot.

842
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:55,150
Yeah,

843
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:56,720
it is kind of a joke,

844
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,340
but

845
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,173
yeah,

846
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:58,900
yeah,

847
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,733
sure.

848
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,470
Go ahead.

849
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:01,730
No,

850
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:02,441
it just,

851
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:03,274
uh,

852
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,150
we,

853
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:05,530
uh,

854
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,150
we had mentioned before,

855
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:08,043
you know,

856
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:11,770
it was something that I
speculated on that maybe a,

857
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,510
and this is kind of a tangent,

858
00:26:13,511 --> 00:26:18,070
but maybe the like the Indians from India

859
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,200
who are now taking up,

860
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,183
uh,

861
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,460
not taking up but

862
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,640
kind of moving into the tech sector,

863
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:29,181
you know,

864
00:26:29,181 --> 00:26:34,181
people coming straight out of southern
Asia moving into the text tech sector,

865
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,163
um,

866
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:36,681
you know,

867
00:26:36,681 --> 00:26:41,180
maybe them having
experienced less prosperity,

868
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,770
having come from a poor area,

869
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:45,570
it really made them,

870
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,570
it was the last bit having a Indians
having come from a poor area or an area of

871
00:26:52,471 --> 00:26:54,240
less prosperity has led to them.

872
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,513
Um,

873
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,240
had lived in motivation,

874
00:26:57,330 --> 00:27:01,430
the motivation of being
coming educated and uh,

875
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:04,050
figuring things out.

876
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,800
So basically the gun to
their head was survival.

877
00:27:07,801 --> 00:27:08,520
It was nature.

878
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,353
It wasn't,

879
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,210
it was another conscious entity.

880
00:27:12,211 --> 00:27:13,290
It was just nature.

881
00:27:13,291 --> 00:27:14,124
You know,

882
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:15,600
you can,

883
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,380
you can survive in poverty or maybe die.

884
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,460
Yeah.

885
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,950
Or you can educate yourself and you know,

886
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,660
moved to the states and you know,

887
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:28,200
to what extent that is like the state,

888
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:32,130
I'm saying you need to pay up.

889
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:33,840
Uh,

890
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,920
and then thinking,

891
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:35,131
well,

892
00:27:35,131 --> 00:27:36,000
how are we going to do it?

893
00:27:36,001 --> 00:27:37,020
And an engineer,

894
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:40,950
engineers getting together and developing
these methods of recapturing the

895
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:41,490
mission,

896
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,323
emissions,

897
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,710
recycling them.

898
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,030
And then over time,

899
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:45,600
you know,

900
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,433
they kind of go,

901
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:46,840
Ooh,

902
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,673
I'm,

903
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,140
we're saving money now.

904
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,370
Are you able to make more money?

905
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,470
And Yeah.

906
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,840
Oh well that made me think of a,

907
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,660
I might be a result of the WTO,

908
00:27:56,661 --> 00:27:57,800
the World Trade Organization,

909
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,870
like allowing for the markets
to be a little more free.

910
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,220
Like for example,

911
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,250
Microsoft or a tech company is might say,

912
00:28:04,251 --> 00:28:04,431
well,

913
00:28:04,431 --> 00:28:07,220
it's cheaper to develop
this technology in Asia.

914
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:07,761
So they go,

915
00:28:07,761 --> 00:28:07,971
okay,

916
00:28:07,971 --> 00:28:12,971
well because of the WTO rules are
because of the expanded free markets.

917
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:14,030
We were going to move there.

918
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,950
And that brought opportunity,

919
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,290
uh,

920
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,410
to the poor Indian people to uh,

921
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:18,741
you know,

922
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:22,280
maybe even get educated for free or for
relatively cheap because you're going to

923
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:23,510
be working for cheap anyways.

924
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:25,280
And then the best of them say,

925
00:28:25,281 --> 00:28:26,690
well screw this,

926
00:28:26,691 --> 00:28:27,740
I'm going to go to the states,

927
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,310
right?

928
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,660
Because I can make more money there.

929
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,030
So a lot of it is just due to the
opening up markets in terms of like these

930
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:37,180
developing countries
like China for example,

931
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,103
Vietnam.

932
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:38,990
Um,

933
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,823
it Kinda reminds me,

934
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,650
I'm just gonna step
back like a stage here,

935
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,240
but if you don't mind,

936
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,470
but if you imagine a.

937
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,260
When the US started outsourcing
production to South Asian countries like

938
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,550
Malaysia and Indonesia
and stuff like clothing,

939
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,473
like clothing.

940
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,760
Oh well a lot of people say like,

941
00:28:58,761 --> 00:28:59,151
Oh man,

942
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:04,151
it's really bad that we outsourced all
our production to these countries because

943
00:29:04,671 --> 00:29:06,980
these people work in like
slave labor conditions.

944
00:29:06,981 --> 00:29:07,400
Right?

945
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,380
Or sweatshop factories and stuff.

946
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:09,621
Yeah.

947
00:29:09,621 --> 00:29:10,454
That was the big,

948
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,260
uh,

949
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:11,700
the,

950
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,350
the reason that people were protesting
in 19 ended three against the WTO,

951
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:15,920
I believe.

952
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,690
Is that those types of arguments.

953
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:18,890
Yeah.

954
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:19,810
And it's true that yeah,

955
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,550
they do suck for a little
bit under those conditions,

956
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:25,940
but the only reason they're working in
those conditions at all is because they

957
00:29:25,941 --> 00:29:28,940
would rather work in those conditions
and their previous conditions,

958
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:31,430
which was mostly subsistence farming.

959
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:32,823
Right?

960
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,880
So if you can begin to scrape a living
by with subsistence farming and your life

961
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,640
is basically like a coin toss,

962
00:29:40,641 --> 00:29:43,210
like it usually renting your
land and stuff like your surf.

963
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:45,490
But if you can get into the factory,

964
00:29:45,491 --> 00:29:48,820
you make twice as much money and it sucks
because it's like not in the West but

965
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:49,541
you know,

966
00:29:49,541 --> 00:29:52,390
and you're sweating your balls off
and whatever and you getting your arms

967
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:52,991
chopped off,

968
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:53,411
but you know,

969
00:29:53,411 --> 00:29:54,580
you make a little bit more money,

970
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:58,870
then you can send your kids to school
and gain skills and then slowly over time

971
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,500
you can start demanding more wages
and then eventually a demand.

972
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,610
So many wages that they say,

973
00:30:03,611 --> 00:30:03,980
oh,

974
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,370
we're going to pick a factory up
in this other country over here.

975
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:07,450
And uh,

976
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,200
but by that time you've already gained
those skills and your infrastructure is

977
00:30:10,201 --> 00:30:11,890
increased because factories need roads,

978
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:12,701
they need plumbing,

979
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:14,050
they need electricity,

980
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,060
they need a whole bunch
of different things.

981
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:16,901
Um,

982
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:20,170
and those are investments made by
the West that made that happen.

983
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,330
So I'll look,

984
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:22,090
people will.

985
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:25,510
There is a criticism to say that
these people suffer and producting are

986
00:30:25,511 --> 00:30:26,920
producing things for the west.

987
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,940
Um,

988
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:30,010
they also pull themselves out of poverty.

989
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:31,740
Right?

990
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:32,573
Yeah.

991
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,810
That's a largely happened,

992
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,381
right.

993
00:30:35,381 --> 00:30:36,214
As the,

994
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,380
through globalization.

995
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:42,130
The markets have opened
up around the world.

996
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:47,550
Companies have moved out and have some
would argue at the expense of people in

997
00:30:49,151 --> 00:30:50,140
the United States,

998
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:50,960
uh,

999
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,820
raised the living standard of
poor people around the world.

1000
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,603
Yeah.

1001
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,623
Yeah.

1002
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,640
Uh,

1003
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,500
I'd saw this comment
by Steve Nichols here,

1004
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,380
is this China Mobile
execution ban suicide nets.

1005
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:08,101
Yeah.

1006
00:31:08,101 --> 00:31:10,850
And I know there's a Canadian
recently that just got,

1007
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:11,040
uh,

1008
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,620
arrests or he was arrested a couple
of years ago for drug smuggling,

1009
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,370
a 200 kilograms of methamphetamines
or something like that.

1010
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:18,420
And uh,

1011
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,130
he was sentenced to 15 years originally,

1012
00:31:20,131 --> 00:31:20,580
I think.

1013
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know if,

1014
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,400
I think I heard that he
appealed the sentence,

1015
00:31:23,401 --> 00:31:27,260
but apparently it was the state that
appealed the sentence and he got retried

1016
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:30,980
and they recently sent us to death and uh,

1017
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,700
that's.

1018
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,450
They think it might be a
result of us are resting.

1019
00:31:36,451 --> 00:31:37,171
This woman,

1020
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:38,040
I remember her name.

1021
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:38,710
Oh,

1022
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:39,543
she works for.

1023
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,051
Yeah.

1024
00:31:40,051 --> 00:31:42,800
The hallway woman like Vancouver is
really close to me and then there's,

1025
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,230
I know it's funny because she owns like
a bunch of houses there and like it's

1026
00:31:46,231 --> 00:31:47,064
really a,

1027
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:50,670
it's almost like a meme that all the
houses of Vancouver owned by Chinese

1028
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:51,450
nationals.

1029
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:51,930
Yeah.

1030
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:52,291
Because,

1031
00:31:52,291 --> 00:31:52,650
uh,

1032
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,361
we just slide that.

1033
00:31:53,361 --> 00:31:54,480
Anyone buy the houses there,

1034
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,620
that's why the market.

1035
00:31:55,621 --> 00:31:58,110
So one of the reasons the
market's so crazy in Vancouver.

1036
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,730
I'll go into that later.

1037
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:00,700
But um,

1038
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,560
so they think that might be revenge
for the hallway arrest of that.

1039
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:07,530
A woman that remember going and she's
like the daughter of the founder of the

1040
00:32:07,531 --> 00:32:08,364
company.

1041
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,920
She founded the chief financial officer.

1042
00:32:10,921 --> 00:32:11,520
Anyways,

1043
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,360
that's what she is now,

1044
00:32:12,361 --> 00:32:13,194
right?

1045
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,810
Yeah,

1046
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:14,521
she's the CFO.

1047
00:32:14,521 --> 00:32:15,300
Yeah.

1048
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,133
Um,

1049
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:16,951
yeah,

1050
00:32:16,951 --> 00:32:17,220
I,

1051
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,731
I don't know,

1052
00:32:17,731 --> 00:32:18,660
I heard about that.

1053
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:19,770
Uh,

1054
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:21,660
well I read the article on Drudge,

1055
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:25,080
just pulling things up
through drudge and I'm.

1056
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:25,650
Oh,

1057
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,011
well yeah.

1058
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:31,011
And then she and they were putting a
little rice sized spy chips and all Huawei

1059
00:32:31,351 --> 00:32:32,610
products and that,

1060
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:33,800
those chips were the,

1061
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:36,780
I guess the interface with the
web and would send the data,

1062
00:32:36,781 --> 00:32:38,940
the raw data back to
China for the Internet.

1063
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:43,910
And China was getting
old and security secrets.

1064
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,900
That's way kind of like,

1065
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,340
I guess you'd call them spaceships and a,

1066
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,730
the u s is all concerned about,

1067
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,360
we call it the,

1068
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:50,571
you know,

1069
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:51,381
the five eyes.

1070
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:52,250
It's like New Zealand,

1071
00:32:52,251 --> 00:32:52,761
Australia,

1072
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:53,211
Canada,

1073
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:53,601
UK,

1074
00:32:53,601 --> 00:32:54,434
USA,

1075
00:32:55,190 --> 00:32:55,460
a,

1076
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,390
it's the anglosphere.

1077
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:56,841
Oh,

1078
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:58,310
we all share spy information.

1079
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,320
Then the US has been pressuring everyone
to stop buying qua way a technology.

1080
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:06,600
Yeah.

1081
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,433
Just they haven't been.

1082
00:33:07,510 --> 00:33:10,500
They've embedded like military
people inside the company.

1083
00:33:10,501 --> 00:33:11,334
So

1084
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,360
yeah,

1085
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,230
pretty fucked up there.

1086
00:33:15,231 --> 00:33:16,520
Could be stealing our stream right now.

1087
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:18,370
Well,

1088
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,830
probably our

1089
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,120
China.

1090
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:26,430
Yeah.

1091
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:29,790
I mean the value systems
are completely different to

1092
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:32,740
what do you know about the soldier?

1093
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,250
Those,

1094
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:33,470
uh,

1095
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:33,730
you know,

1096
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:35,410
trying to make some of
these knockoff products.

1097
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:36,770
Yes.

1098
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,250
Uh,

1099
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,130
in fact I was looking at a saxophone mute.

1100
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:44,480
It's basically a big white egg ish
looking thing that I can put my alto

1101
00:33:44,481 --> 00:33:47,720
saxophone in and pull
out and there's a $600,

1102
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:52,721
one called Esx that I think has made in
the states or Europe and then there's a

1103
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,600
$300 one now that has made in China
and is hailed as just as good.

1104
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,633
Yeah,

1105
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,693
it's pretty good.

1106
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,643
It's pretty crazy.

1107
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:11,480
It's just one of millions of
knock off things that China makes.

1108
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:13,281
Yeah.

1109
00:34:13,281 --> 00:34:16,220
Well they would make these
a retro consoles that uh,

1110
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:20,810
we can put like download every game
ever made for like in 64 [inaudible] and

1111
00:34:20,811 --> 00:34:22,520
lower and uh,

1112
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,623
and just like,

1113
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:24,463
it's like cheap.

1114
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:27,620
You can get them for like 60 bucks or
something like really cheap on Alibaba,

1115
00:34:27,621 --> 00:34:28,070
like 30,

1116
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,300
maybe 30 bucks or USA.

1117
00:34:29,930 --> 00:34:30,763
But um,

1118
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,121
they were filling.

1119
00:34:32,121 --> 00:34:32,921
Those are the Rom.

1120
00:34:32,921 --> 00:34:33,620
So like that's,

1121
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,110
that's like considered a
crime here and Soulja boy,

1122
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:36,441
you know,

1123
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,430
the rapper or whatever.

1124
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,850
He was trying to market
this soldier console,

1125
00:34:40,851 --> 00:34:44,570
which is just like you'd buy the Alibaba
version of the console and just write

1126
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,140
soulja boy on it with some sticker
and sell it for like 300 bucks.

1127
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,610
And we certainly intend to,

1128
00:34:49,611 --> 00:34:50,870
I guess that time and uh,

1129
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,083
but that's just an example.

1130
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,420
That's what we have to get rid of it.

1131
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:57,530
But there's an example of China's
meddling in our technology,

1132
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:57,800
right?

1133
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,633
They just steal it.

1134
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,223
I bet you if we,

1135
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,820
if we could cut them off for 10 years,

1136
00:35:01,821 --> 00:35:02,870
they would fall way behind.

1137
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,610
Yeah.

1138
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:08,990
A we'll of course the price,

1139
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:10,880
the price of goods would.

1140
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:16,930
If we didn't have any alternative
manufacturing could skyrocket.

1141
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,280
And who knows what type of
pressure they would put on.

1142
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:20,061
I mean,

1143
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:22,880
I don't know how big
of a player Taiwan is,

1144
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:23,714
but

1145
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:24,671
oh,

1146
00:35:24,671 --> 00:35:25,504
it would definitely be.

1147
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:28,360
We've definitely
experienced price problems,

1148
00:35:28,361 --> 00:35:29,194
but yeah,

1149
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,300
like for example,

1150
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,090
if I go sam,

1151
00:35:31,090 --> 00:35:32,500
Samsung a product,

1152
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,730
not South Korea,

1153
00:35:33,731 --> 00:35:38,310
but a lot of products that come now
only are only to last like five to 10,

1154
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,870
like five to 10 years maximum.

1155
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:41,363
I have,

1156
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:42,121
I have a,

1157
00:35:42,121 --> 00:35:44,430
a Kenmore sears brand,

1158
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,810
a washing machine,

1159
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:46,990
and it works fine.

1160
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:47,850
It's from 19,

1161
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,330
uh,

1162
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:50,930
1989 and I,

1163
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:53,130
I'm thinking of replacing it
because it's kind of ugly looking,

1164
00:35:53,131 --> 00:35:57,480
but it does the job and if I get a pay
to replace it then I'm going to get some

1165
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,130
thing that's an elastic five years,

1166
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,090
you know,

1167
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:00,923
so I'm Kinda,

1168
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,580
I'm reluctant to get rid of it.

1169
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:03,550
Yeah,

1170
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:03,770
I,

1171
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:04,110
I've,

1172
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:04,943
uh,

1173
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:05,461
this is,

1174
00:36:05,461 --> 00:36:06,294
uh,

1175
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:07,670
a bit of a tangent,

1176
00:36:07,671 --> 00:36:12,410
but I had just popped in to want to
Owen Benjamin streams and he was saying,

1177
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:12,861
Oh,

1178
00:36:12,861 --> 00:36:14,570
you wouldn't replace a,

1179
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,010
you would,

1180
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,710
I forget what he was talking about
when you said you wouldn't replace,

1181
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,220
you know,

1182
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:21,410
appliances from 50 years ago.

1183
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,461
And it's like,

1184
00:36:22,461 --> 00:36:22,850
well,

1185
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,121
you know,

1186
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:23,610
that's,

1187
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,530
I think I lost you there.

1188
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,451
Well he was saying,

1189
00:36:26,451 --> 00:36:26,601
you know,

1190
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,590
you wouldn't have place,

1191
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:31,820
you would be dumb to want to
replace appliances from 30,

1192
00:36:31,821 --> 00:36:32,361
40,

1193
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:33,350
50 years ago.

1194
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:34,750
And I thought to myself like,

1195
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,211
well no,

1196
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:39,980
that's why I think you're just a little
bit ignorant of how things have been

1197
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:42,920
made and how the quality
of things have diminished.

1198
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,113
And

1199
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,103
uh,

1200
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,481
yeah,

1201
00:36:46,481 --> 00:36:47,770
I mean that's just objective,

1202
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:48,251
really true.

1203
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:51,040
If you ask any like Hvac technician,

1204
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,333
uh,

1205
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,330
for appliance technician,

1206
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,713
um,

1207
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,050
now I wouldn't necessarily when
he mentioned his older cars,

1208
00:36:59,051 --> 00:36:59,201
yeah,

1209
00:36:59,201 --> 00:37:00,670
I wouldn't want to go with an older car.

1210
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:01,880
Um,

1211
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,260
but it depends I guess on the model.

1212
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,250
Depends on what you want,

1213
00:37:06,251 --> 00:37:08,410
but I mean for efficiency,

1214
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,541
uh,

1215
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,020
I wouldn't go with an older car,

1216
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,430
but efficiency,

1217
00:37:13,450 --> 00:37:13,960
you know,

1218
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,290
not necessarily electrical
efficiency in older appliances,

1219
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:18,071
but you know,

1220
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:20,530
you're not going to be
replacing it for 20,

1221
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:20,950
30,

1222
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:21,270
Oh,

1223
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:22,103
four years.

1224
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:27,650
Know that the whole electrical efficiency
thing is like kind of like an a is

1225
00:37:28,270 --> 00:37:28,870
weird anyways.

1226
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,703
Like you know,

1227
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:30,461
space heaters,

1228
00:37:30,461 --> 00:37:34,690
they're like 99 percent efficient so
you can't really get much more efficient

1229
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:35,524
than that.

1230
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:38,110
So when they say like an
eco friendly or whatever is,

1231
00:37:38,111 --> 00:37:39,520
it usually just means it shittier.

1232
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:39,930
I,

1233
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,763
so I found,

1234
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,383
um,

1235
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,321
I mean not for heaters,

1236
00:37:44,321 --> 00:37:45,330
but like for washing machine,

1237
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,660
I had this washing machine that was
supposed to be ecofriendly or you got like

1238
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:51,700
some kind of rebate from the
government for it and got 50 bucks off.

1239
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,890
I'm afraid to a regular one,

1240
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,560
but I just found that
didn't wash the clothes,

1241
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,140
you know,

1242
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,490
I like,

1243
00:37:57,490 --> 00:37:57,940
well,

1244
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,481
what's the point?

1245
00:37:58,481 --> 00:37:59,520
If I got to wash them twice,

1246
00:37:59,530 --> 00:37:59,750
you know,

1247
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:01,270
I'm not really being
that much more efficient,

1248
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:02,963
but

1249
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:04,120
yeah,

1250
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,380
that doesn't make sense.

1251
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,210
Yeah.

1252
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,043
Um,

1253
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,013
well,

1254
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,173
like there's this.

1255
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,140
I got this.

1256
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:13,840
Yeah.

1257
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,000
Well it's thinking of the environment.

1258
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:17,230
The thing we were talking about earlier.

1259
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:19,140
Yeah.

1260
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:19,630
Uh,

1261
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,730
and uh,

1262
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,860
people like want to like reduce
the carbon footprint and stuff.

1263
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,780
I think it was happening in Australia.

1264
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,770
I think that's where it happened.

1265
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,233
Yeah.

1266
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:29,380
Yeah.

1267
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,780
Well I've been to like,

1268
00:38:31,781 --> 00:38:33,130
I used to be on the side of like,

1269
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:33,401
okay,

1270
00:38:33,401 --> 00:38:34,211
climate change is bad.

1271
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,410
We've got to fix it like away,

1272
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:35,920
right?

1273
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,210
Like we gotta do something about it,

1274
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,470
like revolutionary style.

1275
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:41,170
Like I used to be kind of a socialist
that way and I'm not anymore at all,

1276
00:38:41,171 --> 00:38:41,880
but you know,

1277
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,713
I was young.

1278
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:43,643
Yeah.

1279
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,493
But anyways,

1280
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,400
um,

1281
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,300
I used to think that,

1282
00:38:46,301 --> 00:38:46,511
okay,

1283
00:38:46,511 --> 00:38:48,100
well the scientists are saying this,

1284
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,050
so then we should do
what the scientists say.

1285
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:54,790
But then if you look at their models
that they show for the climate change,

1286
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:58,900
it doesn't reflect what we
see in our current timeline,

1287
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,180
but maybe there's a
correlation at some level.

1288
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,250
But I have,

1289
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,700
I've actually been,

1290
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,100
I've lost my confidence in it,

1291
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,870
which is kind of crazy,

1292
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:09,970
but I've lost my confidence
in their projections.

1293
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,063
Yeah.

1294
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:11,581
Um,

1295
00:39:11,581 --> 00:39:12,130
and I,

1296
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,410
I,

1297
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,090
I talked to,

1298
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,590
I've talked to some people about it,

1299
00:39:14,591 --> 00:39:16,180
like I guess you'd call them hippies,

1300
00:39:16,181 --> 00:39:20,580
maybe the green hippie guys and uh,

1301
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:22,010
I say stuff as I was talking to him,

1302
00:39:22,011 --> 00:39:22,240
like,

1303
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:25,000
so trying to have a rational conversation
and they were saying stuff like,

1304
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:25,301
okay,

1305
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:28,390
so if we want to have a
neutral carbon impact,

1306
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,420
we have to chop down a forest the size
of the Indian subcontinent and then bury

1307
00:39:33,521 --> 00:39:34,690
that on the ground every year.

1308
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:35,860
I was like,

1309
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:38,830
that just doesn't seem like
that doesn't seem rational.

1310
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,690
Like that doesn't seem like a real thing,

1311
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,243
you know,

1312
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,560
like the,

1313
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,500
like this logistically speaking
like I wouldn't be possible to do.

1314
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,320
And I don't think it makes a lot of sense.

1315
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,990
What do you think of that?

1316
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,520
But I'm not.

1317
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:57,400
And he said just to remain
neutral as we are now,

1318
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,283
that's what we'd have to do.

1319
00:39:59,420 --> 00:39:59,901
Yeah.

1320
00:39:59,901 --> 00:40:00,700
I don't know.

1321
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:01,533
Um,

1322
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,973
you know,

1323
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,620
the whole idea of,

1324
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:07,310
you mentioned you used to be,

1325
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,030
you know,

1326
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,770
in favor of revolutionary,

1327
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,233
um,

1328
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:18,390
anthropogenic action to anthropogenic
put to what people claim is anthropogenic

1329
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,010
climate change climate,

1330
00:40:20,011 --> 00:40:20,220
you know.

1331
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:20,461
Yeah.

1332
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,040
It doesn't,

1333
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,140
doesn't necessarily.

1334
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,060
That doesn't necessarily,

1335
00:40:25,170 --> 00:40:26,003
uh,

1336
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,600
it may not necessarily work in a,

1337
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:30,960
I,

1338
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,570
I've heard from somebody that,

1339
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,081
you know,

1340
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:35,190
after nine slash 11,

1341
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:37,613
the,

1342
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:38,963
um,

1343
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,630
after the planes were grounded for
like a week or something like that,

1344
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,973
the,

1345
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,540
the average temperatures,

1346
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:49,250
the average temperature a higher,

1347
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:49,531
you know,

1348
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:52,410
it got hotter and scientists initially,

1349
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,420
if I'm remembering this correctly,

1350
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,930
were kind of panicking wondering
what the hell's going on,

1351
00:40:57,931 --> 00:40:59,100
why is it getting hotter?

1352
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,810
And then they figured out that,

1353
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:00,991
oh,

1354
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:03,000
the aerosols that we put into the air,

1355
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:06,090
the emissions from the planes was,

1356
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,590
is cooling the earth.

1357
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,300
And you know,

1358
00:41:09,301 --> 00:41:10,134
at this point,

1359
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:10,351
you know,

1360
00:41:10,351 --> 00:41:11,370
they came up with A.

1361
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:12,450
I don't know if that,

1362
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:17,370
at that point they came up with the
global masking effect of a global,

1363
00:41:17,371 --> 00:41:19,560
a global dimming or
aerosol masking effect.

1364
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:20,640
I forget which it is.

1365
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:21,690
Um,

1366
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,830
so it seems like,

1367
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:23,161
you know,

1368
00:41:23,161 --> 00:41:26,520
it's a damned if you
do damned if you don't,

1369
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:27,990
but you know,

1370
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,970
with Australia,

1371
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:30,973
you know,

1372
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,970
now this is just,

1373
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,100
it's another tangent,

1374
00:41:34,101 --> 00:41:34,970
but somebody in the chat said,

1375
00:41:34,971 --> 00:41:36,140
scientists are forced to lie.

1376
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:38,090
Carbon tax is a global theft scam.

1377
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:38,511
Well,

1378
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:43,511
I don't necessarily know that because
the Australians were forced to that,

1379
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,960
those funds that they were being taxed at,

1380
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,590
you know,

1381
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:52,430
if whoever was taxing them necessarily
thought that they were actually going to

1382
00:41:52,431 --> 00:41:53,480
get their shit together,

1383
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,200
you know,

1384
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,350
put their brain power
together and develop,

1385
00:41:57,990 --> 00:41:58,760
you know,

1386
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,750
more innovative

1387
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:04,640
technology so they could drop their costs,

1388
00:42:04,641 --> 00:42:04,940
you know,

1389
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,540
maybe the,

1390
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,270
the uh,

1391
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:07,103
uh,

1392
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:08,383
the,

1393
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,213
uh,

1394
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,240
not litigators,

1395
00:42:11,241 --> 00:42:16,241
but the legislators thought that we're
just going to get money from them now and

1396
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:18,771
you know,

1397
00:42:18,771 --> 00:42:20,150
that turned up not being true.

1398
00:42:20,151 --> 00:42:21,030
So I don't know that,

1399
00:42:21,031 --> 00:42:21,210
you know,

1400
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:21,950
it's,

1401
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,220
I don't know that it is or
isn't a global theft scam.

1402
00:42:25,221 --> 00:42:26,660
But there again,

1403
00:42:26,661 --> 00:42:26,901
you know,

1404
00:42:26,901 --> 00:42:28,730
because I don't know,

1405
00:42:28,731 --> 00:42:31,520
I think there's a country in
the world where the taxes are,

1406
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:32,630
you know,

1407
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,640
what you pay is transparent.

1408
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:36,140
I forget what country,

1409
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:36,531
I mean,

1410
00:42:36,531 --> 00:42:38,030
you can look it all up online,

1411
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:38,361
you know,

1412
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:40,160
to what extent that's truthful,

1413
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:40,611
but,

1414
00:42:40,611 --> 00:42:40,821
you know,

1415
00:42:40,821 --> 00:42:44,690
I don't know that money's
necessarily spent wisely.

1416
00:42:44,691 --> 00:42:45,290
I don't,

1417
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:48,260
I'm just ignorant of all that and
I just want to think tangents.

1418
00:42:48,261 --> 00:42:49,094
But

1419
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,670
I think that the,

1420
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:51,051
uh,

1421
00:42:51,051 --> 00:42:51,461
uh,

1422
00:42:51,461 --> 00:42:55,180
the way the carbon tax is
proposed is it's sort of like,

1423
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:56,014
um,

1424
00:42:56,170 --> 00:42:57,640
like a moral tax,

1425
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:00,670
like you're doing it
to help save something.

1426
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,610
But I think the problem with
climate change and I think that the.

1427
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:06,220
Obviously the climate is changing,

1428
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,220
it's just hard to pin
down exactly what it is.

1429
00:43:09,221 --> 00:43:13,930
Like there's these correlations and
I've heard all the arguments about like,

1430
00:43:13,931 --> 00:43:14,171
oh no,

1431
00:43:14,171 --> 00:43:15,004
it's definitely,

1432
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:15,550
um,

1433
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:16,420
humans or whatever.

1434
00:43:16,421 --> 00:43:18,520
I understand your points,

1435
00:43:18,521 --> 00:43:20,320
but it doesn't seem to,

1436
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,413
uh,

1437
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,200
it's not,

1438
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:27,640
it doesn't convince me because there's
a lot of historical records of climate

1439
00:43:27,641 --> 00:43:28,451
changing as well.

1440
00:43:28,451 --> 00:43:31,240
And we weren't burning
fossil fuels at those times,

1441
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:36,310
but all ultimately I think that the
question is just so much more complicated

1442
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,173
than,

1443
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,220
than the sort of portrayed it to be.

1444
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,030
And to me that just speaks to it being
a little bit that they're being a little

1445
00:43:43,031 --> 00:43:48,031
bit dishonest and I'd rather than be more
open about what the reality is rather

1446
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:50,014
than just saying,

1447
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:50,741
oh no,

1448
00:43:50,741 --> 00:43:51,730
just trust us,

1449
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:52,630
we're the experts.

1450
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,410
And that's the,

1451
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:54,850
if you hear someone say,

1452
00:43:54,851 --> 00:43:55,570
trust us,

1453
00:43:55,570 --> 00:43:56,500
like we're the experts.

1454
00:43:56,501 --> 00:43:58,930
That's like actually a logical fallacy,

1455
00:43:59,390 --> 00:44:00,223
argument,

1456
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:01,720
argument,

1457
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,100
argument from authority.

1458
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:04,623
And um,

1459
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:06,970
that doesn't really convince me.

1460
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,360
I mean,

1461
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,190
I would,

1462
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,030
I would like to believe them,

1463
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,893
but,

1464
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:11,560
you know,

1465
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,393
have you,

1466
00:44:13,210 --> 00:44:13,391
had,

1467
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:13,590
I,

1468
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:14,141
I had,

1469
00:44:14,141 --> 00:44:14,974
I brought up

1470
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:21,470
any assignment had I brought up any
potholer 54 his videos to you before where

1471
00:44:21,511 --> 00:44:22,344
he basically,

1472
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:24,001
I just missed that.

1473
00:44:24,001 --> 00:44:24,211
Sorry.

1474
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:25,650
It was a resolve messed up.

1475
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:27,750
Had you had,

1476
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:31,380
I brought up pot full of
potholes or 54 to you before.

1477
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,603
Um,

1478
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:38,030
and his basically debunking
of the Heritage Foundation's
that you've seen on the

1479
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,660
circuit of mainstream media.

1480
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:45,170
There's a couple of talking heads and
a Lord Monckton was one of them and he

1481
00:44:45,931 --> 00:44:47,010
basically takes,

1482
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:49,470
because he's,

1483
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,520
because he's a journalist,

1484
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,900
he does it effortlessly,

1485
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,243
um,

1486
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,840
and shows you where they're pulling
their data from and how it fits into this

1487
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:05,670
larger picture and shows you
the larger picture all on,

1488
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:06,301
you know,

1489
00:45:06,301 --> 00:45:07,134
uh,

1490
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:07,531
the,

1491
00:45:07,531 --> 00:45:08,364
uh,

1492
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,293
reference.

1493
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,653
Um,

1494
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:12,103
I don't know the term,

1495
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:16,950
but the scientific literature
literature is the right word.

1496
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:17,630
But,

1497
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,463
uh,

1498
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,870
and it just,

1499
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:23,100
I didn't have to go back over it,

1500
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:23,530
you know,

1501
00:45:23,530 --> 00:45:24,660
to be able to make an argument.

1502
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:27,000
I'm kind of ignorant so I really
shouldn't have an opinion on it.

1503
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,830
But,

1504
00:45:27,830 --> 00:45:28,663
um,

1505
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,950
it seems like to me,

1506
00:45:30,951 --> 00:45:31,220
yeah,

1507
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:32,210
I believe that,

1508
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:33,860
that,

1509
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,101
you know,

1510
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:34,390
the,

1511
00:45:34,390 --> 00:45:37,520
the projections aren't necessarily true.

1512
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,010
Uh,

1513
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:39,340
the,

1514
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:39,720
you know,

1515
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,010
the,

1516
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:44,000
I've heard Peterson say that the farther
the projections are out because they're

1517
00:45:44,001 --> 00:45:46,130
using what algorithms so using,

1518
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,220
you know,

1519
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:47,910
uh,

1520
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:48,870
estimate estimates.

1521
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:49,551
Yeah.

1522
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:54,551
They're using a basically algorithmic
models to project out and they don't.

1523
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:57,003
And the,

1524
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,260
all the data doesn't
necessarily know it's static.

1525
00:46:00,261 --> 00:46:00,591
I think.

1526
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,900
I don't necessarily know
that these algorithms,

1527
00:46:02,901 --> 00:46:03,860
they're not dynamic.

1528
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:04,330
You know,

1529
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:05,420
you put input in,

1530
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:06,380
you get output out,

1531
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:11,570
you can't put input in and then
factor in all these wherever you can.

1532
00:46:11,571 --> 00:46:11,720
I don't,

1533
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,670
maybe I don't understand
how algorithms work.

1534
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:14,853
Um,

1535
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,900
it was almost like trying
to like regulate the market,

1536
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:18,081
right?

1537
00:46:18,081 --> 00:46:20,690
Like it's just so many inputs and outputs,

1538
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:21,330
you know,

1539
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,360
you don't really know if
you've made a mistake.

1540
00:46:23,361 --> 00:46:24,410
Where did you make the mistake?

1541
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:25,243
Right.

1542
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,703
Yeah.

1543
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:30,080
I'm just knows optimistically skeptical.

1544
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:30,590
Uh,

1545
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,000
she,

1546
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:31,430
uh,

1547
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:32,990
whoever that spirit are here,

1548
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:37,190
but they mentioned the Bjorn
Lundberg's a documentary.

1549
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:42,530
I just listened to a talk a talk with
a human Jordan Peterson and it really

1550
00:46:42,531 --> 00:46:47,531
changed my perspective on the whole
climate change issue because a pound for

1551
00:46:47,991 --> 00:46:51,710
pound or dollar for dollar you
can make a lot more impact,

1552
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,730
uh,

1553
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,260
on human suffering.

1554
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,740
If you say put money in
one place versus another.

1555
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:02,300
And climate change is like one that's
way down the list that you could do to

1556
00:47:02,301 --> 00:47:03,380
make the world a better place.

1557
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,503
Yeah.

1558
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:06,710
Well,

1559
00:47:06,710 --> 00:47:07,190
so,

1560
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:07,311
uh,

1561
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:08,630
but he's,

1562
00:47:08,631 --> 00:47:09,020
he's,

1563
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:13,440
I think he's onto something there and I
think he's very convincing to a because

1564
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,200
it makes it,

1565
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,800
it's the climate change argument is,

1566
00:47:15,801 --> 00:47:16,121
Oh,

1567
00:47:16,121 --> 00:47:19,100
let's save all the poor people that
are drowning in the rising oceans,

1568
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,180
but realistically,

1569
00:47:20,181 --> 00:47:20,511
I mean,

1570
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:21,950
there's a lot more things we can do.

1571
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:22,550
Yeah.

1572
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:23,510
I don't think the,

1573
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:23,811
uh,

1574
00:47:23,811 --> 00:47:25,910
the rising oceans are too serious too.

1575
00:47:25,911 --> 00:47:27,390
Some of the climatologists like a,

1576
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:32,200
there's a climatologist Paul Beck with
out of Ottawa that I listened to whenever

1577
00:47:32,201 --> 00:47:35,770
he puts out new videos
and he has a problem with,

1578
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,100
uh,

1579
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:40,000
some of the models and the problem
that I've noticed with him.

1580
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:41,373
Um,

1581
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:45,220
the problem that he has that I've
noticed is some of the models,

1582
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:45,810
they're,

1583
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:48,520
they're not as specific
as you'd like them to be.

1584
00:47:48,521 --> 00:47:50,680
They don't go back as
many years as they should.

1585
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:51,440
Um,

1586
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,020
and because I can't reference anything,

1587
00:47:53,021 --> 00:47:53,741
what I'm saying is,

1588
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:54,574
you know,

1589
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:55,750
it doesn't even matter,

1590
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,913
but I mean,

1591
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:59,770
if you watch some of Paul beckwith's,

1592
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:01,420
a newer videos,

1593
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,560
um,

1594
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:02,891
you know,

1595
00:48:02,891 --> 00:48:03,724
it,

1596
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:08,290
he's basically talking about
these atmosphere of models and a,

1597
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:13,390
him just wishing that
they were designed better,

1598
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,880
that they should be designed better
because they would give you a better

1599
00:48:15,881 --> 00:48:18,400
indication of what they actually mean.

1600
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,583
Um,

1601
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:20,760
he,

1602
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,070
you know,

1603
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:21,220
he,

1604
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:22,053
he himself,

1605
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,820
I think he's mentioned that,

1606
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:25,450
uh,

1607
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:25,661
you know,

1608
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:29,680
he and Paul Beckwith is a firm
believer in geoengineering.

1609
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:30,683
Uh,

1610
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:31,953
and,

1611
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:32,450
you know,

1612
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:33,970
it makes sense that as,

1613
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:34,241
you know,

1614
00:48:34,241 --> 00:48:38,740
if these carbon taxes do
force companies to innovate,

1615
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:43,300
if you take out aerosols from the
air according to these climatologists

1616
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:44,134
arguments,

1617
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:44,830
uh,

1618
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:46,330
and the global,

1619
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,310
the global masking effect,

1620
00:48:48,311 --> 00:48:49,144
the Aerosol,

1621
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:53,530
the global dimming effect or
the aerosol masking effect.

1622
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:54,713
Um,

1623
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:55,001
you know,

1624
00:48:55,001 --> 00:48:58,210
you make the Earth Cooler and
if you take these aerosols out,

1625
00:48:58,240 --> 00:48:59,170
you take pollution out,

1626
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:01,510
the earth heats up.

1627
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:02,201
I mean,

1628
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:02,620
it's,

1629
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,810
that that's a and these,

1630
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:06,161
you know,

1631
00:49:06,161 --> 00:49:09,910
that wasn't necessarily a model
that it's not something that,

1632
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,300
I mean I think that
should be tested again.

1633
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:18,370
I mean to what extent it
was enough definitive proof.

1634
00:49:20,650 --> 00:49:21,400
I don't know,

1635
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,233
but I,

1636
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,440
but to scientists,

1637
00:49:23,441 --> 00:49:27,490
it was really weird after nine slash
11 when all the planes are grounded and

1638
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:27,791
then,

1639
00:49:27,791 --> 00:49:28,624
you know,

1640
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:33,630
United States that are the global
average temperature shot up and uh,

1641
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:34,521
you know,

1642
00:49:34,521 --> 00:49:34,700
they,

1643
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:37,760
they coined that I think around that time

1644
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:40,120
and he,

1645
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,080
I guess like I said,

1646
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:45,160
Paul Beck with is a firm believer in
or engineering and I don't necessarily

1647
00:49:45,161 --> 00:49:45,994
know,

1648
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:46,953
you know,

1649
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,450
what that means and you know,

1650
00:49:49,451 --> 00:49:51,730
what affects those could have,

1651
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:52,280
you know,

1652
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,690
what those,

1653
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,290
whatever particulates they,

1654
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:59,020
they plan on how they'll administer that,

1655
00:49:59,021 --> 00:49:59,291
you know,

1656
00:49:59,291 --> 00:50:01,480
it's just um,

1657
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:02,883
but there's a target,

1658
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,120
there's a lot of climatologists
I believe in June.

1659
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:06,110
It jus engineering.

1660
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:07,390
So,

1661
00:50:07,390 --> 00:50:08,223
you know.

1662
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:09,370
Yeah,

1663
00:50:09,370 --> 00:50:09,611
I mean,

1664
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:10,930
I totally understand.

1665
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:12,101
I mean,

1666
00:50:12,101 --> 00:50:17,101
I don't totally understand Bjorn
Lawnburg I didn't see the whole a video,

1667
00:50:18,790 --> 00:50:19,241
but yeah,

1668
00:50:19,241 --> 00:50:23,890
it makes sense that if you want to
improve humanity that maybe you should,

1669
00:50:24,290 --> 00:50:25,060
um,

1670
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,260
that yes,

1671
00:50:26,470 --> 00:50:28,670
other things are more
important necessarily

1672
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:32,120
than trying to deal with climate change.

1673
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:34,850
I mean it seems like we don't have a full.

1674
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,000
We don't have a full
handle on the data yet.

1675
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,140
I mean there's no,

1676
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,673
I don't know.

1677
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,910
And the funny thing too is if you had
mentioned like the fact that the data is

1678
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:48,070
not really a,

1679
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,290
I guess you could say
exclusively inconclusive,

1680
00:50:51,730 --> 00:50:54,950
then they call you some sort of a denier.

1681
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:55,784
Right.

1682
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,680
But the thing is when you seek,

1683
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:59,570
when we want to know the truth,

1684
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:00,830
they,

1685
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:02,480
I guess that's what everyone says,

1686
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:04,850
if you're denying their sort
of ideological position.

1687
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,070
And I think this climate
change things almost,

1688
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:12,280
it takes on like a flavor of like almost
like religion but not like the good

1689
00:51:12,291 --> 00:51:13,011
parts of religion,

1690
00:51:13,011 --> 00:51:13,940
just like the dogma.

1691
00:51:14,450 --> 00:51:14,921
Um,

1692
00:51:14,921 --> 00:51:15,754
so I have,

1693
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,840
so I have this theory,

1694
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,540
I kind of have to go into it to explain
what I'm getting to with this climate

1695
00:51:20,541 --> 00:51:21,320
thing.

1696
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,890
But,

1697
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:26,270
so you have it with religion and all
really ideological belief systems.

1698
00:51:26,271 --> 00:51:30,740
You have the dogmatists and he
had the spiritualists and uh,

1699
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:31,760
the spiritualists,

1700
00:51:31,850 --> 00:51:32,683
um,

1701
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,640
I guess this is kind of,

1702
00:51:34,730 --> 00:51:36,380
I kind of took this from Peterson,

1703
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:37,550
uh,

1704
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:38,300
so the documents,

1705
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,770
they really care about the structure,

1706
00:51:39,771 --> 00:51:40,160
right?

1707
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,700
And they care about order and
they care about the 10 product.

1708
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:44,651
Then you have the spiritual,

1709
00:51:44,651 --> 00:51:49,651
it's that kind of like more cared about
the trend or the metaphor or like if you

1710
00:51:50,931 --> 00:51:52,130
were to break it down politically.

1711
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:55,970
We live in a liberal society mostly,

1712
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,500
and we have liberals on the left and
we have conservatives on the right.

1713
00:52:00,530 --> 00:52:02,630
And that's the two wings of liberalism.

1714
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:03,801
The spiritual,

1715
00:52:03,801 --> 00:52:06,770
the liberals are the spiritualists
and the conservative side is the,

1716
00:52:06,771 --> 00:52:06,921
uh,

1717
00:52:06,921 --> 00:52:11,921
the dogmatist and you need
both because if you don't have,

1718
00:52:13,190 --> 00:52:14,480
if you go full spiritual,

1719
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,400
you become like fundamentalist,

1720
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,293
right?

1721
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,430
You can become so chaotic that,

1722
00:52:21,770 --> 00:52:23,480
that nothing that,

1723
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:25,490
that structure breaks down essentially.

1724
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:27,200
And if you go too dogmatic,

1725
00:52:27,201 --> 00:52:28,670
you can be freer.

1726
00:52:28,671 --> 00:52:29,390
Society.

1727
00:52:29,390 --> 00:52:30,740
So you don't adapt,

1728
00:52:30,741 --> 00:52:33,800
you're not adapting to change
and society starts changing.

1729
00:52:33,801 --> 00:52:34,634
You need to adapt.

1730
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,183
Um,

1731
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,480
so with these climate scientists,

1732
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,170
uh,

1733
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:44,170
at some point they were spiritualists
because they believed in doing something

1734
00:52:44,450 --> 00:52:45,260
to better,

1735
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:45,800
uh,

1736
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:46,633
to adapt,

1737
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:50,690
but at some point they
adopted a more dogmatic,

1738
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:52,210
a s,

1739
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:54,140
a good spirit but,

1740
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:57,890
or a dogmatic way of being a
in terms of their ideology.

1741
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,180
And now if you even doubt it,

1742
00:53:00,181 --> 00:53:03,950
it's like you're doubting the
existence of God if you're a Catholic,

1743
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:04,161
you know,

1744
00:53:04,161 --> 00:53:04,994
it's like,

1745
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:06,390
it's that,

1746
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:07,580
that intends to these people.

1747
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,880
So that's where I think they've
said at some point that happened.

1748
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:11,630
I haven't been,

1749
00:53:11,630 --> 00:53:15,140
I haven't pinpointed
down to who do you mean?

1750
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:17,000
Oh,

1751
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:17,451
who do you mean?

1752
00:53:17,451 --> 00:53:17,990
Like for who?

1753
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,610
Who would be the spiritualists?

1754
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:20,061
Yeah,

1755
00:53:20,061 --> 00:53:21,880
because the climatologists
that I listened to,

1756
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:22,820
you don't really,

1757
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:24,340
uh,

1758
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:24,990
there's only,

1759
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:25,823
if,

1760
00:53:25,860 --> 00:53:26,693
actually,

1761
00:53:26,910 --> 00:53:27,210
sorry,

1762
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:31,390
I can't say climate Tajik because not
all climatologists but the like Potholer,

1763
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:32,800
I mean they don't,

1764
00:53:33,310 --> 00:53:37,360
they just basically
Kinda will refer to the,

1765
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:40,180
refer to the literature and right off,

1766
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:41,800
you know,

1767
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:46,270
until there's evidence or until
somebody can actually make an argument.

1768
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:49,780
I'm a correct one where,

1769
00:53:49,781 --> 00:53:50,614
uh,

1770
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:51,483
because a lot of the,

1771
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,020
a lot of the people who are
claiming that it's not real

1772
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:02,900
aren't even citing the data that
is put out already properly.

1773
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:03,551
I mean,

1774
00:54:03,551 --> 00:54:08,551
the data's already being misinterpreted
and mishandled by the people when you

1775
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:10,594
see the mainstream,

1776
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:12,160
when you see it in the mainstream media,

1777
00:54:12,630 --> 00:54:13,463
um,

1778
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:17,340
immediately it's being mishandled it,

1779
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,180
so it's not even there.

1780
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:23,950
So it's like the people who
were saying that it's like flat,

1781
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:27,190
like who were saying it's not real,

1782
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,510
aren't even using the correct data.

1783
00:54:31,790 --> 00:54:32,290
Are you there?

1784
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:37,290
Straw manning what has always
been considered a climate change?

1785
00:54:38,501 --> 00:54:40,450
It was a theory that was a,

1786
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,753
it was a,

1787
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,930
a theory that was proposed I
think in the late 19th century.

1788
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:50,733
Uh,

1789
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:52,880
and so if there's just,

1790
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:54,143
it's,

1791
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:55,330
it seems like it's,

1792
00:54:55,331 --> 00:54:56,950
there's just a lot of wrong.

1793
00:55:00,690 --> 00:55:01,523
I Dunno,

1794
00:55:01,710 --> 00:55:02,300
I don't want,

1795
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:02,970
you know,

1796
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:07,680
I don't know if I wouldn't
say the scientist are
necessarily like a spiritualist

1797
00:55:07,681 --> 00:55:08,270
themselves,

1798
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:08,730
um,

1799
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:09,990
or document this,

1800
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:10,510
uh,

1801
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,010
but I think a lot of the followers grow.

1802
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:13,531
Yeah,

1803
00:55:13,531 --> 00:55:14,250
definitely.

1804
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:14,470
No,

1805
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:17,880
I agree with you wholeheartedly there.

1806
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:19,620
And that's a problem too,

1807
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,633
you know,

1808
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:21,391
I mean,

1809
00:55:21,391 --> 00:55:23,730
that's like you'd probably run in,

1810
00:55:23,790 --> 00:55:25,020
you've probably run into people like that,

1811
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:29,230
like in her daily goal in your
life or just like they were like,

1812
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:29,461
no,

1813
00:55:29,461 --> 00:55:32,790
this is the truth and this
is the truth as I see it.

1814
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,170
And if you don't agree,

1815
00:55:34,171 --> 00:55:36,120
then you're a bad person
and you're immoral.

1816
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:36,841
Honestly,

1817
00:55:36,841 --> 00:55:37,441
I don't,

1818
00:55:37,441 --> 00:55:39,010
but I don't think

1819
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:42,451
I've had that happen.

1820
00:55:42,451 --> 00:55:44,100
It's like walking on
eggshells around these people.

1821
00:55:44,101 --> 00:55:44,934
They're like,

1822
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:45,420
probably,

1823
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,580
if I was in Chicago that
would happen a whole lot more,

1824
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,473
you know what I mean?

1825
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:49,160
You don't know.

1826
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:49,321
I,

1827
00:55:49,321 --> 00:55:50,310
I take that back,

1828
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,000
you know,

1829
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:56,000
that is the case sometimes that
there's very few very few issues.

1830
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,450
I just think everything
is murky around it.

1831
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:01,691
It might happen,

1832
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,850
it might happen more to me,

1833
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,820
11 of stuff,

1834
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,043
frankly closer,

1835
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,790
but might happen more to me because
I live on Vancouver Island and it's

1836
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:10,170
notoriously full of hippies.

1837
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,450
And uh,

1838
00:56:12,450 --> 00:56:13,000
so,

1839
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,833
uh,

1840
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,730
and I think maybe that might
have had something to do with it,

1841
00:56:18,270 --> 00:56:19,800
but I was.

1842
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,900
Maybe in Florida it's
not so bad or I live,

1843
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:25,540
it's just this like hippies
and lumberjacks and then
you go like some stuff in

1844
00:56:25,541 --> 00:56:25,841
between.

1845
00:56:25,841 --> 00:56:27,340
But those are the main two populations.

1846
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:28,390
Yeah.

1847
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:28,750
Oh,

1848
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:29,021
you know,

1849
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:32,590
if you were to bring up Christianity
in any way and try and challenge that,

1850
00:56:32,591 --> 00:56:34,000
that would be a big thing in the south.

1851
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,540
You get a lot of uh,

1852
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:35,890
no.

1853
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:36,190
This,

1854
00:56:36,190 --> 00:56:38,460
the truth said,

1855
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,170
well,

1856
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:40,003
what do you mean?

1857
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:40,943
What do you.

1858
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,300
I don't want to get into all that,

1859
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:44,134
but uh,

1860
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:44,870
yeah,

1861
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:45,131
yeah,

1862
00:56:45,131 --> 00:56:45,670
for sure.

1863
00:56:45,670 --> 00:56:45,920
Yeah.

1864
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,580
Just seems like everybody's
mishandling the data.

1865
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:51,310
The scientists are too shy.

1866
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:52,661
Uh,

1867
00:56:52,661 --> 00:56:52,961
you know,

1868
00:56:52,961 --> 00:56:53,794
some of the,

1869
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,320
one of the scientists say that no,

1870
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:56,950
the,

1871
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:57,251
you know,

1872
00:56:57,251 --> 00:57:02,251
everybody's had that climatologists
err on the side of conservatism.

1873
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:03,971
I mean,

1874
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:04,570
they're,

1875
00:57:04,570 --> 00:57:06,820
they're trying to be
conservative with their,

1876
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:08,170
uh,

1877
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:08,920
their views.

1878
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,670
But then again,

1879
00:57:09,670 --> 00:57:10,960
like the models don't,

1880
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,900
don't necessarily add up.

1881
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,900
And one of the guys who was heralded the,

1882
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:17,440
uh,

1883
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,981
the most,

1884
00:57:17,981 --> 00:57:22,750
I forget who he was big in
the seventies who predicted,

1885
00:57:22,870 --> 00:57:23,830
you know,

1886
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:26,490
large scale and he's still harold,

1887
00:57:26,491 --> 00:57:29,110
that you predicted large scale famines.

1888
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,413
Uh,

1889
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:31,740
just all of this,

1890
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:33,130
this the single guy,

1891
00:57:33,131 --> 00:57:38,131
and he was like a guru to the climatology
movement and most of his stuff ended

1892
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:42,820
up not becoming true and uh,

1893
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:44,170
and there's still people who,

1894
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:45,063
you know,

1895
00:57:45,250 --> 00:57:45,590
but,

1896
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:46,870
but that's another thing is that,

1897
00:57:46,871 --> 00:57:47,110
you know,

1898
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:48,790
this kind of tologist beckwith,

1899
00:57:48,791 --> 00:57:49,121
they'll say,

1900
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:53,470
we don't know what happens when the
positive feedback loops start happening.

1901
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:57,460
Like it could be a really
slippery slope and it will be,

1902
00:57:58,030 --> 00:57:58,660
it will,

1903
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,060
it will start happening so quickly.

1904
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,170
And whether that means,

1905
00:58:02,171 --> 00:58:02,350
you know,

1906
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:03,071
within five,

1907
00:58:03,071 --> 00:58:03,904
10,

1908
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,361
20,

1909
00:58:04,361 --> 00:58:04,841
30,

1910
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:05,351
50,

1911
00:58:05,351 --> 00:58:06,220
100 years,

1912
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:08,170
whatever those timeframes are,

1913
00:58:08,171 --> 00:58:10,060
because it seems like
nobody can model this out.

1914
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:11,530
Nobody can predict.

1915
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:12,710
Well,

1916
00:58:12,710 --> 00:58:13,543
uh,

1917
00:58:14,470 --> 00:58:14,810
you know,

1918
00:58:14,810 --> 00:58:17,020
one of the guys who's a real alarmist,

1919
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:18,093
um,

1920
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:18,641
you know,

1921
00:58:18,641 --> 00:58:20,110
he's really concerned with,

1922
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:20,620
you know,

1923
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:21,730
the sea level is rising,

1924
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:22,600
not a big deal.

1925
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:23,171
You know,

1926
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:28,171
what I'm concerned with is just the
slight increase in heat changing,

1927
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,223
uh,

1928
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,640
changing the,

1929
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:31,474
uh,

1930
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,010
the,

1931
00:58:33,010 --> 00:58:33,820
uh,

1932
00:58:33,820 --> 00:58:37,260
the effects on Farnam
changing based off of,

1933
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:38,080
in our ag,

1934
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:42,430
in ag or aggregation aggregation society.

1935
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:43,593
That society.

1936
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:45,380
We don't look at Grit.

1937
00:58:45,390 --> 00:58:45,770
Yeah.

1938
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:46,090
Well,

1939
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:48,220
our agricultural being affected by a,

1940
00:58:48,870 --> 00:58:53,870
you definitely being affected by
the slight increase in heat and,

1941
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,290
and that the,

1942
00:58:56,980 --> 00:59:01,980
basically the famines will start happening
so quickly that people like myself,

1943
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:03,730
you know,

1944
00:59:03,730 --> 00:59:04,563
uh,

1945
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:05,993
you know,

1946
00:59:06,670 --> 00:59:07,570
I starve,

1947
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:08,650
you know what I mean?

1948
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,640
There's no,

1949
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:11,483
uh,

1950
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:15,630
assistance and that assistance,

1951
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:17,730
emergency support for people like me.

1952
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,790
You know what I mean?

1953
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:21,350
I'm in the states is pretty,

1954
00:59:21,410 --> 00:59:22,230
um,

1955
00:59:22,230 --> 00:59:22,920
you know,

1956
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,140
all man for himself down there,

1957
00:59:24,141 --> 00:59:24,740
it seems.

1958
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:24,951
Well,

1959
00:59:24,951 --> 00:59:25,131
yeah,

1960
00:59:25,131 --> 00:59:26,750
the state will vow will,

1961
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:29,060
Vive will vie to protect itself.

1962
00:59:29,090 --> 00:59:30,020
But you know,

1963
00:59:30,021 --> 00:59:30,261
what,

1964
00:59:30,261 --> 00:59:32,240
this guy who's saying,

1965
00:59:32,241 --> 00:59:34,790
I'm concerned about
agriculture being affected,

1966
00:59:34,791 --> 00:59:35,510
which,

1967
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:35,841
you know,

1968
00:59:35,841 --> 00:59:36,860
I immediately think of,

1969
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:36,991
well,

1970
00:59:36,991 --> 00:59:39,470
we have a company called Monsanto who,

1971
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,483
you know,

1972
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,511
of course,

1973
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:41,811
you know,

1974
00:59:41,811 --> 00:59:45,530
there's shady practices and
they've got a bad history,

1975
00:59:45,830 --> 00:59:47,000
but they've created,

1976
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:50,240
I assume they've created
drought and heat resistant

1977
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:53,430
plants are,

1978
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,480
they're doing that all the time.

1979
00:59:54,481 --> 00:59:57,840
Like I used to be one of those people
that would like maybe protest them.

1980
00:59:58,520 --> 00:59:58,830
Uh,

1981
00:59:58,830 --> 00:59:59,131
but,

1982
00:59:59,131 --> 00:59:59,790
uh,

1983
00:59:59,790 --> 01:00:01,350
but not that I ever went to a protest,

1984
01:00:01,351 --> 01:00:02,340
but they,

1985
01:00:02,370 --> 01:00:02,701
they,

1986
01:00:02,701 --> 01:00:03,210
uh,

1987
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:04,410
they've definitely changed.

1988
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,270
They definitely become more,

1989
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:07,720
um,

1990
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,100
like scientifically.

1991
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:09,550
Like,

1992
01:00:09,550 --> 01:00:10,331
people are always like worried.

1993
01:00:10,331 --> 01:00:10,551
I go,

1994
01:00:10,551 --> 01:00:11,770
what do you want the meadows,

1995
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,720
the salmon genes and the river.

1996
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:14,711
I'm just like,

1997
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:14,951
okay,

1998
01:00:14,951 --> 01:00:16,330
well I thought that might have been bad.

1999
01:00:16,331 --> 01:00:18,040
But now I looked and I looked into it.

2000
01:00:18,041 --> 01:00:18,641
The scientists,

2001
01:00:18,641 --> 01:00:19,460
I'll say,

2002
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:19,640
well,

2003
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,970
I guess actually serious,

2004
01:00:21,010 --> 01:00:21,750
no trouble at all.

2005
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:22,610
The No.

2006
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:24,873
So,

2007
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:25,861
so they,

2008
01:00:25,861 --> 01:00:26,950
they have some problems for,

2009
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:27,970
for,

2010
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:28,371
for sure.

2011
01:00:28,371 --> 01:00:29,204
Like they,

2012
01:00:29,340 --> 01:00:30,173
you know,

2013
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:32,323
one second.

2014
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,570
So the kid was crunching up a,

2015
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:39,580
a plastic bag,

2016
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:43,200
so I'll just tell him to shut up,

2017
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:43,840
shut up.

2018
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,351
But um,

2019
01:00:44,351 --> 01:00:44,661
anyways,

2020
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:44,900
so,

2021
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:45,733
uh,

2022
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:46,961
yeah.

2023
01:00:46,961 --> 01:00:47,430
So,

2024
01:00:47,430 --> 01:00:47,740
uh,

2025
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:47,960
yeah,

2026
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:48,701
things like Monsanto,

2027
01:00:48,701 --> 01:00:49,900
there's good and bad things about it,

2028
01:00:51,640 --> 01:00:54,610
but hopefully that some of the good
things were that we were able to adapt.

2029
01:00:54,790 --> 01:00:55,360
Like for instance,

2030
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:56,920
do you know anything
about the norse history?

2031
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:59,470
Like the Vikings and
stuff on the Greenland?

2032
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:00,783
No.

2033
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:02,841
Okay.

2034
01:01:02,841 --> 01:01:03,260
So,

2035
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,220
so they were in greenland,

2036
01:01:04,221 --> 01:01:04,401
right.

2037
01:01:04,401 --> 01:01:05,390
And they could grow crops.

2038
01:01:05,391 --> 01:01:07,300
At the time it was like
barley and they wrote,

2039
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,460
they were raising sheep and stuff at the
time that was like think up until 1400

2040
01:01:12,921 --> 01:01:13,581
or 1300.

2041
01:01:13,581 --> 01:01:14,630
They were doing that from around,

2042
01:01:14,631 --> 01:01:15,200
uh,

2043
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:18,100
around a thousand 80 and a,

2044
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,730
maybe slightly before that,

2045
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,320
or they have all these settlements
there and they're able to survive.

2046
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:26,510
They had like several thousand people
living in Greenland at the time,

2047
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:27,320
which,

2048
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:27,770
you know,

2049
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:29,030
I think getting greenland now,

2050
01:01:29,090 --> 01:01:30,350
even with all the modern technology,

2051
01:01:30,351 --> 01:01:33,620
that's like 40,000 people or
something across the entire,

2052
01:01:33,890 --> 01:01:34,850
the entire place.

2053
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:36,013
So there,

2054
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:40,070
but then it got too cold and by $1,400
all the settlements had to be abandoned

2055
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:41,220
because they couldn't grow anything.

2056
01:01:41,221 --> 01:01:41,851
And everyone needs,

2057
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:43,040
you're starved to death row left.

2058
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:45,710
Not that there's any written
records except for uh,

2059
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:46,400
you know,

2060
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:46,761
some,

2061
01:01:46,761 --> 01:01:47,594
uh,

2062
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:52,400
stone squares that are basically that
remain remain remainder is like arctic

2063
01:01:52,850 --> 01:01:54,470
archaeological digs,

2064
01:01:54,471 --> 01:01:55,970
but um,

2065
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:00,800
to climate change so faster in the
medieval warm period to now that like,

2066
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,720
those settlements basically got wiped out.

2067
01:02:02,750 --> 01:02:05,360
All that was left was the nun
who didn't settle anyways.

2068
01:02:05,361 --> 01:02:08,120
They're always moving around hunting
the animals that were on the move.

2069
01:02:08,121 --> 01:02:08,954
Right?

2070
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,790
So even in that short period,

2071
01:02:10,791 --> 01:02:13,550
we could see there was a
climate change and even now,

2072
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:16,580
but back then they didn't have,

2073
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:16,820
like,

2074
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:19,900
we weren't burning oil and
massive amounts of oil and thought

2075
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:21,770
it would be.

2076
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,040
It wasn't any different than it is now.

2077
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,800
So what caused it,

2078
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,693
right?

2079
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:28,470
If it wasn't those two things,

2080
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,120
it could be that,

2081
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:30,661
that's the problem.

2082
01:02:30,661 --> 01:02:32,160
It could be a myriad of other things.

2083
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,200
Uh,

2084
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,270
it's another thing is like,

2085
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:36,763
uh,

2086
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,070
when I mentioned potholders,

2087
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:39,953
like he'll,

2088
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,260
he'll go over into a lot of these
timeframes and it'll show you that,

2089
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:44,461
like this,

2090
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:49,461
the science is settled and it's
clear and this is what happened then.

2091
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:53,010
And I don't know exactly why,

2092
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:53,580
you know,

2093
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,800
I'm bringing up right right now,

2094
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:58,740
but I'm not sure that.

2095
01:02:59,040 --> 01:02:59,873
Yeah,

2096
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:00,810
well maybe,

2097
01:03:00,810 --> 01:03:01,170
maybe,

2098
01:03:01,170 --> 01:03:01,830
maybe he's right.

2099
01:03:01,830 --> 01:03:02,380
Maybe he's right.

2100
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:03,213
I don't know.

2101
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:04,970
It's weird how he just,

2102
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:05,310
like,

2103
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,090
he,

2104
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:09,830
he just fled because he's a journalist
and because he's been a journalist for

2105
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:10,773
uh,

2106
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,273
uh,

2107
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:14,980
I forget exactly what,

2108
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:16,813
um,

2109
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,390
he just comes up with this information,

2110
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,370
insights it and,

2111
01:03:20,460 --> 01:03:21,060
you know,

2112
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,530
and he timestamps,

2113
01:03:23,210 --> 01:03:23,550
you know,

2114
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:27,660
exactly every part of the video
where he mentions anything,

2115
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:32,880
he'll cite it and it's
timestamped citation and so
you can look it up and it's,

2116
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,253
it's just,

2117
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:40,850
it's really crazy because until I saw
until I saw him present some of the

2118
01:03:42,061 --> 01:03:42,960
information,

2119
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,970
it was much more.

2120
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:47,131
It's like nobody,

2121
01:03:47,131 --> 01:03:47,700
I have never,

2122
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,020
I haven't seen anybody do it.

2123
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:50,000
Uh,

2124
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:50,520
and the reason,

2125
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,780
that's the reason I bring up potholder
so much is because it's like Jesus

2126
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:54,781
Christ,

2127
01:03:54,781 --> 01:03:55,614
this guy,

2128
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:56,820
it's,

2129
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:00,660
it takes him no effort to just dispel,

2130
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:02,761
you know,

2131
01:04:02,761 --> 01:04:03,594
uh,

2132
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:05,760
the Heritage Foundation.

2133
01:04:06,770 --> 01:04:07,250
I mean,

2134
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,083
you know,

2135
01:04:08,580 --> 01:04:09,413
uh,

2136
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,190
I don't know how much money,

2137
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:11,461
you know,

2138
01:04:11,461 --> 01:04:12,690
the Heritage Foundation.

2139
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,170
I don't know what,

2140
01:04:15,170 --> 01:04:15,430
you know,

2141
01:04:15,430 --> 01:04:16,201
they're our think tank.

2142
01:04:16,201 --> 01:04:17,910
I don't know how they get your revenue.

2143
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:20,640
Maybe I would say think tank.

2144
01:04:20,641 --> 01:04:20,790
Uh,

2145
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:21,630
probably get donors.

2146
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:22,440
Yeah.

2147
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:23,220
Um,

2148
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:23,490
but,

2149
01:04:23,490 --> 01:04:23,701
you know,

2150
01:04:23,701 --> 01:04:25,530
he's dispelling a billion.

2151
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,830
Maybe it's because they don't
try so hard because it's not a,

2152
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:34,160
it's just one of the things on the agenda
to manipulate and for whatever reason,

2153
01:04:36,151 --> 01:04:36,360
you know,

2154
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,140
you don't,

2155
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:38,130
who knows why.

2156
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:39,143
Maybe it's because,

2157
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:39,830
you know what,

2158
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:44,040
we don't want to put the effort in
innovation right now that we have these

2159
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,451
things,

2160
01:04:45,451 --> 01:04:45,720
you know,

2161
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,250
I'm just speculating obviously,

2162
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:48,084
but,

2163
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:49,753
uh,

2164
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,630
I dunno if it's coherent,

2165
01:04:51,660 --> 01:04:53,850
the speculation that,

2166
01:04:53,870 --> 01:04:54,060
you know,

2167
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:57,630
maybe it's that we don't want to tackle
climate change right now because there

2168
01:04:57,631 --> 01:04:58,890
are other things are,

2169
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,053
you know,

2170
01:05:00,330 --> 01:05:00,600
are,

2171
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:00,841
you know,

2172
01:05:00,841 --> 01:05:04,510
the donors businesses are being
affected by this right now.

2173
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:05,850
Time for this.

2174
01:05:05,851 --> 01:05:06,684
You know,

2175
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:07,680
one thing,

2176
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,680
I think you're Lumberg was saying that
you can spend a dollar on a family

2177
01:05:15,871 --> 01:05:18,010
planning for third or develop women in

2178
01:05:18,010 --> 01:05:19,030
developing nations.

2179
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:23,650
I think you'd get a return of 120 bucks
every time or 60 bucks or something like

2180
01:05:23,651 --> 01:05:23,771
that.

2181
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:27,850
Every time you spend $1 on that in terms
of like overall economic value in this

2182
01:05:27,851 --> 01:05:31,210
is all done by a large group
of independent economists.

2183
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:32,693
Um,

2184
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,010
and then you get climate change and for
every dollar you spend on mitigating

2185
01:05:36,100 --> 01:05:36,641
climate change,

2186
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:39,010
now you'll get about three to $4 in value.

2187
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:40,073
Right.

2188
01:05:40,680 --> 01:05:41,513
Okay.

2189
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:44,130
So like you could do way more,

2190
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,290
have way more of an impact,

2191
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:48,540
like more bang for your buck if
you spend it in the right way.

2192
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,400
And I was thinking,

2193
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:50,791
okay,

2194
01:05:50,791 --> 01:05:51,410
well I,

2195
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:52,200
I,

2196
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:57,200
I'm gonna and they use the most
extreme climate change scenarios.

2197
01:05:57,841 --> 01:05:58,830
Like they always go when,

2198
01:05:58,890 --> 01:06:00,960
when they do those
calculations they do it,

2199
01:06:00,961 --> 01:06:01,920
but for the most extreme.

2200
01:06:02,550 --> 01:06:05,860
So I'm basically,

2201
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:09,640
it comes up all these recommendations
for like how you can spend your money

2202
01:06:09,641 --> 01:06:10,080
best.

2203
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:11,890
And after I looked at them like,

2204
01:06:11,891 --> 01:06:12,221
well,

2205
01:06:12,221 --> 01:06:12,461
okay,

2206
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:13,294
climate change,

2207
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,600
let's say it's the worst possible problem.

2208
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:16,360
There's still like,

2209
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:16,541
you know,

2210
01:06:16,541 --> 01:06:17,530
way down the list.

2211
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:19,203
And I,

2212
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:19,750
I don't,

2213
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:20,800
I would probably,

2214
01:06:20,801 --> 01:06:20,930
uh,

2215
01:06:20,930 --> 01:06:21,340
if we,

2216
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:21,610
if,

2217
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:25,210
if I thought that what if we got to do
something who would definitely fix it?

2218
01:06:25,211 --> 01:06:26,680
I would definitely be okay with that.

2219
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:30,700
The problem is I just don't feel confident
that like you can get the results

2220
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:33,660
that they say seems to be speculative.

2221
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:34,140
Yeah.

2222
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:37,740
That's the thing is that the climatologist
I listened to or this are the same

2223
01:06:37,741 --> 01:06:38,970
way they're not.

2224
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:39,930
If we,

2225
01:06:39,930 --> 01:06:41,280
if we take action,

2226
01:06:41,281 --> 01:06:42,120
it will fix it.

2227
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:42,481
It's like,

2228
01:06:42,481 --> 01:06:43,314
well,

2229
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,500
maybe we think it will.

2230
01:06:46,501 --> 01:06:48,750
We know that immediately that,

2231
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:49,230
you know,

2232
01:06:49,230 --> 01:06:50,730
we spray aerosols in the air,

2233
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:51,743
the average,

2234
01:06:51,750 --> 01:06:51,930
you know,

2235
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:53,280
the temperature will get cooler,

2236
01:06:53,281 --> 01:06:54,810
but you know,

2237
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:55,650
they don't.

2238
01:06:55,650 --> 01:06:56,940
Then they don't say that.

2239
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,220
They don't then say that.

2240
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:02,310
What we don't know if it
will always get cooler,

2241
01:07:02,311 --> 01:07:02,551
you know,

2242
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:03,980
I think the,

2243
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,340
they're conservative.

2244
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:06,450
They don't want to say that.

2245
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:08,940
I think a lot of people just are like,

2246
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:09,061
well,

2247
01:07:09,061 --> 01:07:13,530
we don't really know what is
necessarily going to happen,

2248
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:13,981
you know,

2249
01:07:13,981 --> 01:07:14,620
and what,

2250
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:16,330
and that's just you.

2251
01:07:16,580 --> 01:07:17,880
You bring down the temperature.

2252
01:07:17,881 --> 01:07:18,241
Okay,

2253
01:07:18,241 --> 01:07:23,241
so you stop a blue ocean event where and
when you stopped the permafrost melting

2254
01:07:23,581 --> 01:07:25,770
and the methane being
released into the atmosphere,

2255
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,360
you stop all these things,

2256
01:07:27,361 --> 01:07:28,160
but you know,

2257
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:29,100
what happens?

2258
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:30,583
Uh,

2259
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:31,730
no,

2260
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:32,563
I don't know.

2261
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:35,950
Can the aerosols that
the geoengineering hey,

2262
01:07:35,990 --> 01:07:37,100
have a negative effect.

2263
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,580
I mean that's a

2264
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:41,820
or what happened when all
that nothing comes out.

2265
01:07:41,821 --> 01:07:44,210
Does it have the effects that
they say it's going to have?

2266
01:07:44,280 --> 01:07:44,970
Yeah,

2267
01:07:44,970 --> 01:07:45,803
that too.

2268
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:46,650
Yeah,

2269
01:07:46,650 --> 01:07:47,370
I know,

2270
01:07:47,370 --> 01:07:47,821
you know,

2271
01:07:47,821 --> 01:07:48,630
I,

2272
01:07:48,630 --> 01:07:50,700
I mean obviously,

2273
01:07:51,450 --> 01:07:51,871
you know,

2274
01:07:51,871 --> 01:07:52,440
in a,

2275
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:52,770
in a,

2276
01:07:52,770 --> 01:07:54,600
in a micro environment,

2277
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:55,321
yeah,

2278
01:07:55,321 --> 01:07:57,570
methane will kill you.

2279
01:07:58,170 --> 01:07:58,750
But,

2280
01:07:58,750 --> 01:07:59,221
you know,

2281
01:07:59,221 --> 01:08:01,410
in the macro world,

2282
01:08:01,890 --> 01:08:02,191
you know,

2283
01:08:02,191 --> 01:08:02,830
what does,

2284
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:05,910
what effect does that have an eye and
paddle or my one over that and some of the

2285
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:09,420
other climatologists I may have went
over that and I'm not able to remember.

2286
01:08:09,860 --> 01:08:10,420
Uh,

2287
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:12,000
I'm shit at retention.

2288
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:12,910
Um,

2289
01:08:12,910 --> 01:08:13,743
but,

2290
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,633
um,

2291
01:08:15,860 --> 01:08:16,460
yeah,

2292
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,293
I just,

2293
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:18,921
I don't know,

2294
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:22,040
it's a really weird issue and uh,

2295
01:08:23,030 --> 01:08:28,030
I really had a lot of admiration
for Peterson when he said,

2296
01:08:29,440 --> 01:08:30,273
uh,

2297
01:08:30,420 --> 01:08:31,253
you know,

2298
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:33,590
we don't really know what
to do about it and even if,

2299
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:34,161
you know,

2300
01:08:34,161 --> 01:08:35,000
unless we all do,

2301
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:37,340
I don't know that it is necessarily
said unless we all do something,

2302
01:08:37,341 --> 01:08:38,174
it doesn't matter.

2303
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:39,393
Um,

2304
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:40,611
but that's the truth.

2305
01:08:40,611 --> 01:08:40,851
I mean,

2306
01:08:40,851 --> 01:08:42,800
it seems like we just don't know that,

2307
01:08:43,010 --> 01:08:43,843
you know,

2308
01:08:44,180 --> 01:08:49,180
there's like short term things
fixes that could eventually have,

2309
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:52,431
you know,

2310
01:08:52,431 --> 01:08:53,980
other problems later,

2311
01:08:53,990 --> 01:08:54,231
you know,

2312
01:08:54,231 --> 01:08:54,740
you,

2313
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,290
you trying to solve something
and you just create problems.

2314
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:57,801
You know what I mean?

2315
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:58,041
That's,

2316
01:08:58,041 --> 01:08:58,660
so,

2317
01:08:58,660 --> 01:09:00,740
that's almost always
the case with anything,

2318
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:01,570
uh,

2319
01:09:01,570 --> 01:09:02,860
you know,

2320
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:03,621
not always,

2321
01:09:03,621 --> 01:09:04,910
but in a lot of ways,

2322
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:05,211
you know,

2323
01:09:05,211 --> 01:09:09,050
you create a solution and you know,

2324
01:09:09,051 --> 01:09:10,820
you then there's unforeseen problems

2325
01:09:12,530 --> 01:09:13,510
when you impact them in.

2326
01:09:14,070 --> 01:09:14,500
Yeah,

2327
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:15,333
I dunno,

2328
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:17,460
it's like a,

2329
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,260
this is like a total sidetrack,

2330
01:09:20,261 --> 01:09:22,000
but cameras you have like immigration,

2331
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:22,860
how like there's,

2332
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:26,590
it's sort of like the view we get a bit
from one side and the other is usually

2333
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:27,573
very myopic.

2334
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:30,850
Like it just gives you sort of one,

2335
01:09:31,540 --> 01:09:32,710
one narrow view,

2336
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:33,090
uh,

2337
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:37,780
then on the right and then they have
one narrow view on the left and see,

2338
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:38,800
you don't really get the,

2339
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:41,080
you got to really narrow
view of the entire,

2340
01:09:41,110 --> 01:09:42,670
like say broad spectrum of,

2341
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:43,553
of the issue.

2342
01:09:44,070 --> 01:09:44,903
Um,

2343
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:46,121
like for example,

2344
01:09:46,121 --> 01:09:47,020
like they say,

2345
01:09:47,021 --> 01:09:47,291
okay,

2346
01:09:47,291 --> 01:09:52,291
well our population is declining so we
need immigrants to help buttress the

2347
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:54,370
engine system or something.

2348
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:56,800
That makes sense.

2349
01:09:57,220 --> 01:09:57,480
Yeah.

2350
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,530
Because there's a lot of the
left doesn't make that argument,

2351
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,300
but at the same time they'll say like,

2352
01:10:01,330 --> 01:10:01,691
okay,

2353
01:10:01,691 --> 01:10:02,410
well,

2354
01:10:02,410 --> 01:10:02,810
uh,

2355
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:04,990
to many people's bad because
it hurts the environment,

2356
01:10:05,370 --> 01:10:06,203
know.

2357
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:07,300
Um,

2358
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:07,640
uh,

2359
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:08,620
and then the right,

2360
01:10:08,621 --> 01:10:09,071
we'll say,

2361
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:09,431
okay,

2362
01:10:09,431 --> 01:10:11,760
well it also hurts Roy.

2363
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:12,340
It's waste,

2364
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:15,900
which is weird because the right also
says it hurts workers rights or workers

2365
01:10:15,910 --> 01:10:18,430
like ability to market their skills now,

2366
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:21,260
but at the same time I think,

2367
01:10:21,370 --> 01:10:24,980
I think it does in certain fields
it does definitely in the trades,

2368
01:10:25,330 --> 01:10:25,790
um,

2369
01:10:25,790 --> 01:10:27,950
because you get a lot of illegal workers.

2370
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:28,761
Uh,

2371
01:10:28,761 --> 01:10:29,594
I mean it's,

2372
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:33,830
no just said,

2373
01:10:33,830 --> 01:10:35,130
paused for a second there for some reason.

2374
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:36,673
Oh,

2375
01:10:36,730 --> 01:10:37,071
well I was,

2376
01:10:37,071 --> 01:10:40,370
I was saying that it does
affect the trades I believe,

2377
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:45,320
but it affects employees
in the trades and effects.

2378
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:46,640
Uh,

2379
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:48,110
I think people on the lower,

2380
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:52,760
a lower part of the totem pole of,

2381
01:10:53,060 --> 01:10:54,440
of income.

2382
01:10:55,310 --> 01:10:55,491
Yeah.

2383
01:10:55,491 --> 01:10:56,420
Lower income jobs,

2384
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:57,740
low lower income,

2385
01:10:57,741 --> 01:10:59,090
self employed jobs too.

2386
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:02,240
I mean it's harder to break out when,

2387
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:02,690
you know,

2388
01:11:02,690 --> 01:11:03,590
illegals are

2389
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:06,110
able to work for,

2390
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:06,981
you know,

2391
01:11:06,981 --> 01:11:10,370
so cheap under the table.

2392
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:12,081
Well that's the thing,

2393
01:11:12,081 --> 01:11:12,410
is it?

2394
01:11:12,410 --> 01:11:12,621
No,

2395
01:11:12,621 --> 01:11:13,141
that's the thing.

2396
01:11:13,141 --> 01:11:14,070
Is that illegal?

2397
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:14,311
See,

2398
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:17,190
I've had illegal friends
and they pay taxes.

2399
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,740
Taxes are taken out of their checks.

2400
01:11:19,741 --> 01:11:19,921
Yeah,

2401
01:11:19,921 --> 01:11:21,630
that's not a uh,

2402
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:21,841
oh,

2403
01:11:21,841 --> 01:11:24,450
they just don't do
their taxes or whatever.

2404
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,640
Uh,

2405
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:27,780
no,

2406
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:30,270
I think I'm pretty,

2407
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:30,631
you know,

2408
01:11:30,631 --> 01:11:30,961
that's a,

2409
01:11:30,961 --> 01:11:34,440
that's a good question because I
don't necessarily know about that,

2410
01:11:34,441 --> 01:11:35,400
but I could ask my,

2411
01:11:35,670 --> 01:11:35,911
my,

2412
01:11:35,911 --> 01:11:36,510
uh,

2413
01:11:36,510 --> 01:11:37,740
not necessarily right now,

2414
01:11:38,130 --> 01:11:39,630
I haven't spoken to him in a while.

2415
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:45,200
My friend Christian who and a Lei
Ha and I can't talk to another guy,

2416
01:11:46,441 --> 01:11:46,891
but you know,

2417
01:11:46,891 --> 01:11:50,480
I've had quite a few illegal
friends and every single.

2418
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:51,690
Yeah.

2419
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:54,360
And they pay our taxes
than I did at the same.

2420
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:56,070
It was pretty crazy.

2421
01:11:56,130 --> 01:11:56,521
Yeah.

2422
01:11:56,521 --> 01:12:00,000
And so the whole idea of illegal
is not paying taxes to me,

2423
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,590
maybe true in some,

2424
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:02,933
uh,

2425
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:04,290
in some cases,

2426
01:12:04,291 --> 01:12:07,950
but that's certainly not
true across the board.

2427
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:11,220
I mean the irs doesn't give a
shit where the money comes from,

2428
01:12:11,221 --> 01:12:12,054
but it's coming,

2429
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:12,481
you know,

2430
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:16,860
you're paying into social security and
your pain in your paying an income tax

2431
01:12:16,861 --> 01:12:17,250
and if,

2432
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:19,620
whether or not you're a federal
income tax and whether or not you,

2433
01:12:20,660 --> 01:12:21,493
uh,

2434
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,550
whether another is a state income tax,

2435
01:12:23,670 --> 01:12:25,140
you're paying that too.

2436
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:26,640
Um,

2437
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:27,300
yeah.

2438
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,133
But

2439
01:12:29,490 --> 01:12:29,940
I don't know.

2440
01:12:29,940 --> 01:12:30,151
Yeah,

2441
01:12:30,151 --> 01:12:31,260
there may be ways around it,

2442
01:12:31,261 --> 01:12:34,260
but people that I knew that it didn't,

2443
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:35,450
uh,

2444
01:12:35,450 --> 01:12:35,851
yeah.

2445
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:36,451
And yeah,

2446
01:12:36,451 --> 01:12:39,210
many also work under the
table and there's also that.

2447
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:40,073
Yeah.

2448
01:12:40,370 --> 01:12:41,203
Um,

2449
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,140
I don't necessarily know that all those,

2450
01:12:45,520 --> 01:12:46,353
that,

2451
01:12:46,870 --> 01:12:47,080
that,

2452
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:48,730
the whole trade thing is true,

2453
01:12:48,731 --> 01:12:49,630
but I know that,

2454
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:50,500
you know,

2455
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,880
illegals work for less,

2456
01:12:51,881 --> 01:12:53,560
they work longer.

2457
01:12:53,950 --> 01:12:56,680
They don't necessarily produce
the same quality of job.

2458
01:12:56,681 --> 01:12:57,910
But in the building industry,

2459
01:12:58,180 --> 01:12:58,421
you know,

2460
01:12:58,421 --> 01:12:59,254
it doesn't matter.

2461
01:12:59,290 --> 01:12:59,650
You know,

2462
01:12:59,650 --> 01:13:01,090
Dr Horton is a,

2463
01:13:03,190 --> 01:13:04,210
probably shouldn't bring that up.

2464
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:05,073
But

2465
01:13:06,430 --> 01:13:06,701
uh,

2466
01:13:06,701 --> 01:13:07,061
yeah,

2467
01:13:07,061 --> 01:13:09,870
so there's this employers,

2468
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:11,220
employers,

2469
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,053
uh,

2470
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:15,940
make a lot of money off of quick,

2471
01:13:16,750 --> 01:13:17,583
cheap,

2472
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:20,630
you know,

2473
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:22,930
acceptable work

2474
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:24,313
and uh,

2475
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:26,113
yeah,

2476
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:27,560
yeah,

2477
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:31,510
well there was going to try the companies
that I was going to try to make the

2478
01:13:31,511 --> 01:13:33,280
most amount of profit I guess they can,

2479
01:13:33,340 --> 01:13:33,680
like.

2480
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,080
And there's nothing
really wrong with that.

2481
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:35,943
It's just what they do.

2482
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:36,410
Yeah.

2483
01:13:36,410 --> 01:13:37,030
Um,

2484
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,590
so like if you can,

2485
01:13:38,860 --> 01:13:40,600
if you're just looking at it like a,

2486
01:13:40,960 --> 01:13:41,380
you know,

2487
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,213
you're trying to be,

2488
01:13:42,910 --> 01:13:45,970
I don't want to say it's hard
to put this little words,

2489
01:13:45,971 --> 01:13:48,790
but you're looking at just like
as if you're like a gray face,

2490
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:54,060
neutral vehicle of power
trying to manifest wealth,

2491
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,661
then all you're going to do to say,

2492
01:13:55,661 --> 01:13:55,931
well,

2493
01:13:55,931 --> 01:13:56,500
what,

2494
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,970
what's the input and what's the output?

2495
01:13:57,971 --> 01:14:00,850
So am I going to input five
bucks and get 10 bucks in value?

2496
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,530
I'm going to input seven bucks,

2497
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:03,041
10 bucks,

2498
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:03,940
and they don't care.

2499
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,580
They'll just go for the one that
goes to some of the most value,

2500
01:14:06,581 --> 01:14:07,000
right?

2501
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:07,833
Right.

2502
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:08,913
So,

2503
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:09,881
so they,

2504
01:14:09,881 --> 01:14:10,714
they don't,

2505
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:15,250
don't want necessarily discriminate if
they can get away from away with it.

2506
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:16,420
So whatever the,

2507
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:18,640
whatever the rules allow for,

2508
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:20,160
they're just going to go for.

2509
01:14:20,200 --> 01:14:21,340
And the rules aren't being enforced.

2510
01:14:21,341 --> 01:14:22,420
That just means the rules aren't,

2511
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:23,953
don't have to worry about them.

2512
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:27,430
There's no rules that have no
power behind them are worth plus.

2513
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,310
So if the state isn't x,

2514
01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:31,743
what do you call it?

2515
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:33,880
Deporting people that are illegal,

2516
01:14:33,881 --> 01:14:34,360
then,

2517
01:14:34,360 --> 01:14:35,260
well who cares?

2518
01:14:35,261 --> 01:14:36,090
They'll just hire them.

2519
01:14:36,090 --> 01:14:36,520
You know,

2520
01:14:36,520 --> 01:14:40,660
doesn't make a difference
to them ultimately because
ultimately they're not the

2521
01:14:40,661 --> 01:14:41,810
one that didn't think wrong.

2522
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:44,060
They're just looking at the
labor markets of free market.

2523
01:14:44,070 --> 01:14:44,331
The states,

2524
01:14:44,331 --> 01:14:45,430
it's really open that way

2525
01:14:47,110 --> 01:14:48,700
and they just hire whoever.

2526
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:50,140
Like in Iceland for example,

2527
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:52,060
in order to work at any job,

2528
01:14:52,061 --> 01:14:56,650
you need to get some like government
id and the end you need to like,

2529
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:00,820
we registered that then and then when
you get a new one join a company,

2530
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,240
you automatically joined the union
that's associated with that line of work,

2531
01:15:05,290 --> 01:15:06,940
which is another weird thing because like,

2532
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:11,850
usually unions are like free association
and all the unions are essentially a,

2533
01:15:12,460 --> 01:15:13,810
they'd negotiate separately.

2534
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:15,643
Oh,

2535
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,740
with her or like her.

2536
01:15:19,970 --> 01:15:22,710
It's like all the guys that we're going
to fast food restaurants while the,

2537
01:15:22,790 --> 01:15:23,800
not just a,

2538
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:25,550
I'm just making this up because I,

2539
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,810
I don't know the specific example.

2540
01:15:28,350 --> 01:15:29,070
For example,

2541
01:15:29,070 --> 01:15:34,070
all the plumbers will be in the same
union and everyone has to be in that union

2542
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,040
affair.

2543
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:35,873
Palmer,

2544
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:36,983
right?

2545
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:37,950
Um,

2546
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:38,330
but in,

2547
01:15:38,330 --> 01:15:39,330
in the states you can be,

2548
01:15:39,420 --> 01:15:40,440
you can be your own plumber,

2549
01:15:40,441 --> 01:15:41,670
like you can have your own business.

2550
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:42,583
Um,

2551
01:15:42,690 --> 01:15:44,680
he can be part of a
company that's unionized,

2552
01:15:44,690 --> 01:15:46,170
we part of the company
that isn't unionized,

2553
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,390
so that changes from state to state.

2554
01:15:48,391 --> 01:15:48,691
But yeah,

2555
01:15:48,691 --> 01:15:49,524
that's true.

2556
01:15:49,590 --> 01:15:51,810
Some states are full union,

2557
01:15:57,110 --> 01:15:58,980
like a

2558
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,330
in areas like,

2559
01:16:03,331 --> 01:16:04,164
uh,

2560
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:07,210
Indiana is a,

2561
01:16:09,970 --> 01:16:11,830
I'm not sure exactly how it works,

2562
01:16:11,831 --> 01:16:12,664
but it's a,

2563
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:14,830
it's not a right to work state.

2564
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,323
It's a,

2565
01:16:16,510 --> 01:16:18,460
at least for some of the trades.

2566
01:16:18,461 --> 01:16:19,294
I don't know how.

2567
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:22,240
I don't know exactly how it is now.

2568
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:24,903
It makes sense,

2569
01:16:25,150 --> 01:16:26,000
but it would,

2570
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:26,861
it would vary.

2571
01:16:26,861 --> 01:16:27,820
The states are very,

2572
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:29,620
very different between each one.

2573
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:29,921
Yeah.

2574
01:16:29,921 --> 01:16:30,754
In Florida,

2575
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:31,640
in Florida,

2576
01:16:31,640 --> 01:16:35,260
there's no unions in Illinois and Indiana.

2577
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:36,670
It's heavily unionized.

2578
01:16:36,671 --> 01:16:37,121
In Indiana,

2579
01:16:37,121 --> 01:16:37,954
especially

2580
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:41,370
for there's no unions.

2581
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:42,723
Well

2582
01:16:43,970 --> 01:16:44,803
or very few.

2583
01:16:47,150 --> 01:16:47,360
Yeah,

2584
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,410
probably very few.

2585
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:49,580
I don't know none,

2586
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:50,570
but there's no,

2587
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:51,733
there's no

2588
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:56,030
let me maybe south Florida,

2589
01:16:56,390 --> 01:16:57,170
Miami,

2590
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,020
but you know,

2591
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:01,940
some people considered south Florida be
almost a different state because of how

2592
01:17:02,410 --> 01:17:03,100
you know it,

2593
01:17:03,100 --> 01:17:05,390
it just doesn't like North Florida,

2594
01:17:05,391 --> 01:17:06,350
central Florida,

2595
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:10,160
West northwest Florida or the don't

2596
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:12,590
compare at all compared to the,

2597
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:13,453
uh,

2598
01:17:17,090 --> 01:17:19,820
we can get to the economic generation.

2599
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:24,230
Did the income generation
of south Florida.

2600
01:17:24,231 --> 01:17:26,200
None of them compare Florida carpet.

2601
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:26,781
I think there's a,

2602
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:28,690
I don't think there's a
Florida carpenters union.

2603
01:17:30,030 --> 01:17:30,381
Uh,

2604
01:17:30,381 --> 01:17:31,141
I remember the,

2605
01:17:31,141 --> 01:17:31,351
uh,

2606
01:17:31,351 --> 01:17:32,940
I'm actually a member of union myself,

2607
01:17:33,030 --> 01:17:35,190
but I don't really have
a choice as the IBW

2608
01:17:35,380 --> 01:17:38,530
that inter national brotherhood
of electrical workers.

2609
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,130
Yeah,

2610
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:40,240
they do have a union,

2611
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:41,501
but guess what?

2612
01:17:41,501 --> 01:17:42,460
It's in south Florida.

2613
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:44,470
It's in Tampa.

2614
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,453
Orlando,

2615
01:17:46,150 --> 01:17:48,220
I guess we'll land is
still considered central,

2616
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:49,480
but that's where the,

2617
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:51,100
that's where the money's at.

2618
01:17:51,101 --> 01:17:51,934
I mean,

2619
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:53,043
you don't have money.

2620
01:17:55,560 --> 01:17:56,150
Well,

2621
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:57,820
what's the penalty like anyways?

2622
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:00,640
Have heavily military.

2623
01:18:00,970 --> 01:18:01,803
I mean it's.

2624
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,041
Oh yeah,

2625
01:18:03,041 --> 01:18:03,641
it's a,

2626
01:18:03,641 --> 01:18:03,970
you know,

2627
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,640
Eggland Hurlbert with
your air force bases.

2628
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:08,410
Tyndall was an air force base,

2629
01:18:08,411 --> 01:18:11,350
but it was just destroyed
by a hurricane Michael.

2630
01:18:11,980 --> 01:18:12,813
Um,

2631
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:17,240
and then you've got duke
field which is an army a.

2632
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:18,233
Then you got it.

2633
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:20,710
You got a navy base here.

2634
01:18:20,770 --> 01:18:21,603
I mean it's

2635
01:18:23,030 --> 01:18:23,863
the majority.

2636
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:26,830
I honestly believe except for
like the resort coastline,

2637
01:18:26,831 --> 01:18:30,550
like destin 30 a Panama city,

2638
01:18:30,850 --> 01:18:32,050
parts of Pensacola,

2639
01:18:32,350 --> 01:18:32,640
you know,

2640
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,570
if it weren't for the
middle of your living in,

2641
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,950
in the areas,

2642
01:18:36,110 --> 01:18:41,110
then this wouldn't be the type of
area that it wouldn't have the same

2643
01:18:42,730 --> 01:18:44,290
development that it has,

2644
01:18:44,380 --> 01:18:45,610
like in 2008,

2645
01:18:45,630 --> 01:18:45,910
you know,

2646
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:47,140
it didn't see the same,

2647
01:18:47,540 --> 01:18:47,830
didn't.

2648
01:18:47,830 --> 01:18:49,900
I mean everybody was affected in 2008.

2649
01:18:49,990 --> 01:18:50,823
Uh,

2650
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:51,281
you know,

2651
01:18:51,281 --> 01:18:52,220
everything got tighter.

2652
01:18:52,540 --> 01:18:53,260
But,

2653
01:18:53,260 --> 01:18:54,093
you know,

2654
01:18:54,640 --> 01:18:58,630
I think the military really helped
this area kind of move forward.

2655
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:01,591
Yeah,

2656
01:19:01,591 --> 01:19:02,424
it helps.

2657
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:02,731
Oh,

2658
01:19:02,731 --> 01:19:02,970
uh,

2659
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:03,331
yeah.

2660
01:19:03,331 --> 01:19:03,610
I,

2661
01:19:03,610 --> 01:19:05,610
I have a buddy that lives in mobile.

2662
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,190
I think that's pretty close.

2663
01:19:08,340 --> 01:19:11,490
That's pretty close to the pan on Alabama.

2664
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:11,960
Yeah.

2665
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,620
I've driven through
there a couple of times.

2666
01:19:15,220 --> 01:19:16,053
That's cool.

2667
01:19:16,570 --> 01:19:17,020
I was doing.

2668
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:17,950
Do you ever do any answers?

2669
01:19:18,010 --> 01:19:20,730
The research I've ever done that A.

2670
01:19:20,731 --> 01:19:21,564
Yeah.

2671
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:21,961
Yeah,

2672
01:19:21,961 --> 01:19:22,794
a little bit.

2673
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:25,050
Not so much as submit blood
or anything like that,

2674
01:19:25,051 --> 01:19:25,830
but uh,

2675
01:19:25,830 --> 01:19:26,880
or however that works.

2676
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,890
But yeah,

2677
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,430
I know a little bit of a,

2678
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:31,940
you know,

2679
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,000
my father's side,

2680
01:19:33,260 --> 01:19:33,421
you know,

2681
01:19:33,421 --> 01:19:38,421
their family came from Italy
as dad's and mom's side.

2682
01:19:39,001 --> 01:19:39,834
It was,

2683
01:19:40,320 --> 01:19:42,310
had lived in the states here for awhile,

2684
01:19:42,330 --> 01:19:44,730
so I don't know where in
Europe they came from.

2685
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:45,590
Um,

2686
01:19:45,590 --> 01:19:48,030
and then my mom's side mom was British,

2687
01:19:48,130 --> 01:19:49,560
so maybe you brought that
up for different reasons.

2688
01:19:49,561 --> 01:19:51,420
I shouldn't just start rattling off.

2689
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:52,623
Oh no,

2690
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:53,350
it's fine.

2691
01:19:53,350 --> 01:19:53,690
Yeah.

2692
01:19:53,690 --> 01:19:53,910
Uh,

2693
01:19:53,910 --> 01:19:54,581
I just,

2694
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:54,910
uh,

2695
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:58,120
I was a lot of family
that came from the states,

2696
01:19:59,230 --> 01:20:00,520
like North Carolina,

2697
01:20:00,590 --> 01:20:04,210
like a western North Carolina
and like northern Arkansas,

2698
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,253
another origin.

2699
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:07,830
And I was because like,

2700
01:20:07,831 --> 01:20:08,664
um,

2701
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,820
apparently one of my grant,

2702
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:12,690
I got my grant,

2703
01:20:12,691 --> 01:20:13,261
my mums,

2704
01:20:13,261 --> 01:20:15,360
dads like great grandfather,

2705
01:20:15,361 --> 01:20:15,631
great,

2706
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:16,464
great grandfather.

2707
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:22,100
He was apparently like a slave
owner at some point and uh,

2708
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:27,950
he sold as slaves before the war ended
in New Orleans and then move and move

2709
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:30,320
yourself a Yellville,

2710
01:20:30,390 --> 01:20:34,800
Arkansas and buried the gold there
because you sold them for gold.

2711
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:36,391
And uh,

2712
01:20:36,391 --> 01:20:37,520
I was always a,

2713
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:41,000
I know the location of the farm and
I was always curious like is he.

2714
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:44,310
They said he forgot where he buried
it so it might still be there.

2715
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,681
So I was like,

2716
01:20:46,681 --> 01:20:46,831
oh,

2717
01:20:46,831 --> 01:20:47,300
I wonder.

2718
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:48,190
And I looked at the Va,

2719
01:20:48,270 --> 01:20:50,490
it was $30,000 of gold at the time,

2720
01:20:50,610 --> 01:20:52,020
which is like 2 million bucks now.

2721
01:20:52,410 --> 01:20:53,100
Oh Wow.

2722
01:20:53,100 --> 01:20:55,170
So I mean I feel like I'd feel,

2723
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:56,130
I feel kind of bad,

2724
01:20:56,131 --> 01:20:56,964
but

2725
01:20:58,110 --> 01:20:58,943
you should,

2726
01:20:59,970 --> 01:21:01,740
you should search it out.

2727
01:21:01,741 --> 01:21:02,574
I'd look for it.

2728
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:04,171
Yeah.

2729
01:21:04,171 --> 01:21:04,420
I,

2730
01:21:04,420 --> 01:21:04,781
I gotta,

2731
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:07,680
I gotTa kind of location by that I mean
the study looking for a needle in a

2732
01:21:07,681 --> 01:21:08,161
haystack,

2733
01:21:08,161 --> 01:21:08,990
right?

2734
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:09,823
Yeah.

2735
01:21:09,910 --> 01:21:10,980
It may be worse.

2736
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:16,710
I mean if you have excavating equipment
or the types of machines that you could

2737
01:21:17,670 --> 01:21:18,690
find things in the ground,

2738
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:19,620
you might be able to find it.

2739
01:21:19,621 --> 01:21:20,454
I don't know.

2740
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,470
Or I could buy the farm.

2741
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:26,640
I think I could buy the farm for
120 grand then just start digging.

2742
01:21:29,280 --> 01:21:30,113
But yeah,

2743
01:21:30,640 --> 01:21:33,480
I've done a lot of interesting
research to over the years.

2744
01:21:34,050 --> 01:21:35,370
I traced some of my family,

2745
01:21:35,380 --> 01:21:36,930
like I trace my family back there,

2746
01:21:36,931 --> 01:21:38,550
my dad's mother.

2747
01:21:38,551 --> 01:21:39,420
So my grandmother,

2748
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:41,430
her grant,

2749
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:43,050
her father's mother,

2750
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:47,410
I traced her family back to England king.

2751
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:48,020
Uh,

2752
01:21:48,020 --> 01:21:53,020
it was like the maternal
grandfather of a ethelred,

2753
01:21:53,251 --> 01:21:54,030
the unready.

2754
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:55,140
It was like the King of England.

2755
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:56,333
Yeah.

2756
01:21:57,120 --> 01:22:00,540
Which is pretty cool and I think if most
people were to trace their family back,

2757
01:22:00,541 --> 01:22:02,880
you'd actually find those links because

2758
01:22:05,070 --> 01:22:06,270
it really expands.

2759
01:22:06,271 --> 01:22:07,230
So for example,

2760
01:22:07,231 --> 01:22:07,411
you know,

2761
01:22:07,411 --> 01:22:09,090
you have to give to parents,

2762
01:22:09,091 --> 01:22:09,780
right?

2763
01:22:09,780 --> 01:22:11,190
Then each one of them have two parents,

2764
01:22:11,191 --> 01:22:11,610
so then,

2765
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:14,670
so you have four grandparents
and so on doubles every time,

2766
01:22:14,990 --> 01:22:19,860
10 generations and you're like a thousand
up to a thousand unique ancestors,

2767
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:21,143
which is actually really,

2768
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,170
which is really unlikely.

2769
01:22:22,171 --> 01:22:25,110
You'd probably have a lot less because
there's like some inbreeding that happens

2770
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:25,944
at that level.

2771
01:22:26,150 --> 01:22:26,983
Um,

2772
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:32,270
you'll probably find that at some point
your parents or some level of cousin.

2773
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:37,530
I'm like sixth or fifth or later,

2774
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:38,130
you know,

2775
01:22:38,130 --> 01:22:41,430
usually not closer than that unless it
was like some sort of pathology going on

2776
01:22:41,431 --> 01:22:42,264
in the area.

2777
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:43,223
But uh,

2778
01:22:43,260 --> 01:22:43,830
like I was,

2779
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:44,510
I was able to.

2780
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:45,360
So my parents,

2781
01:22:45,390 --> 01:22:48,810
they or their family's origin from
completely different parts of the gay.

2782
01:22:49,460 --> 01:22:50,160
Um,

2783
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:52,770
but I found like common
relatives between them,

2784
01:22:52,771 --> 01:22:54,780
which is really weird that I've done.

2785
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,650
I did the math on it because you can't
really locate because they show up as not

2786
01:22:58,651 --> 01:22:59,041
related.

2787
01:22:59,041 --> 01:22:59,730
Right.

2788
01:22:59,730 --> 01:23:02,430
But you can find people that
are related to a share like the,

2789
01:23:03,060 --> 01:23:05,460
like they share like a
third or fourth cousin or,

2790
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:06,383
or later.

2791
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,330
Um,

2792
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:08,410
and from there you can see like,

2793
01:23:08,411 --> 01:23:08,651
okay,

2794
01:23:08,651 --> 01:23:12,580
well if they shared just if I shared
this much with them and they share that

2795
01:23:12,581 --> 01:23:13,061
much with them,

2796
01:23:13,061 --> 01:23:16,990
that means they were related at some
point so you can kind of triangulate from

2797
01:23:16,991 --> 01:23:17,680
there.

2798
01:23:17,680 --> 01:23:18,191
So I found it.

2799
01:23:18,191 --> 01:23:21,310
My parents were like 7:38
cousins or something like that.

2800
01:23:22,180 --> 01:23:23,013
It's an estimate,

2801
01:23:23,110 --> 01:23:23,943
it's an estimate.

2802
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:25,510
But you'll find that the people are like,

2803
01:23:25,511 --> 01:23:26,440
oh that's kind of fucked up.

2804
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:31,360
But then you find out that they're
probably even closer related depending on

2805
01:23:32,510 --> 01:23:33,281
where they lived.

2806
01:23:33,281 --> 01:23:34,030
Right.

2807
01:23:34,030 --> 01:23:36,580
So like if you lived in
the same county in England,

2808
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,570
your chances of being like
third cousin or closer?

2809
01:23:39,590 --> 01:23:40,630
Actually quite high.

2810
01:23:42,820 --> 01:23:45,600
So I guess it's Kinda
Kinda get some kind of.

2811
01:23:46,970 --> 01:23:51,760
But third cousin though you're like
basically not related like a all,

2812
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,710
like you might not even match with them.

2813
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:56,770
So at that level it's not really that bad.

2814
01:23:56,890 --> 01:23:58,170
It's the main problem.

2815
01:23:58,180 --> 01:24:00,800
The major problem with a cousin,

2816
01:24:01,570 --> 01:24:03,070
I guess you call it sanguish,

2817
01:24:03,670 --> 01:24:06,210
consanguineous marriages is like,

2818
01:24:06,940 --> 01:24:07,331
for example,

2819
01:24:07,331 --> 01:24:08,170
in Muslim countries,

2820
01:24:08,171 --> 01:24:11,650
they made their cousins a lot like
first in Pakistan especially I think 50

2821
01:24:11,651 --> 01:24:15,250
percent or 40 percent of the marriages
are like second cousin or closer.

2822
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:17,293
Um,

2823
01:24:17,860 --> 01:24:19,720
so what happens is if you,

2824
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:21,090
so if you marry your cousin,

2825
01:24:21,150 --> 01:24:24,820
you have kids and your kids married
their cousin and this happens,

2826
01:24:24,821 --> 01:24:24,971
right?

2827
01:24:24,971 --> 01:24:26,170
You look a compound.

2828
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:30,340
So the regular rate of
like genetic disease,

2829
01:24:30,341 --> 01:24:31,850
I think if you just made,

2830
01:24:31,870 --> 01:24:34,630
if you have a kid with some random
person from the other side of the world,

2831
01:24:34,900 --> 01:24:35,800
it's like three percent.

2832
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:37,850
But if you're,

2833
01:24:37,850 --> 01:24:40,870
if you're like in a line of first
cousins that kept getting married,

2834
01:24:40,960 --> 01:24:43,060
it's like 12 to 13 percent.

2835
01:24:43,090 --> 01:24:43,960
I think it maxes out.

2836
01:24:44,170 --> 01:24:45,610
Maxes out ABS are at.

2837
01:24:46,150 --> 01:24:46,950
So,

2838
01:24:46,950 --> 01:24:47,141
uh,

2839
01:24:47,141 --> 01:24:48,430
with these small towns in England,

2840
01:24:48,431 --> 01:24:49,900
do you use to get a lot of these problems?

2841
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:51,760
But then when they started,

2842
01:24:51,761 --> 01:24:52,090
like,

2843
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:52,540
uh,

2844
01:24:52,540 --> 01:24:53,710
so when they went to the states,

2845
01:24:53,711 --> 01:24:55,180
there's not like a lot
of English people there.

2846
01:24:55,181 --> 01:24:56,410
So they'd have to like Mary,

2847
01:24:56,411 --> 01:25:00,640
like Spanish or French or
Italian or Irish or whatever.

2848
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:01,840
Whoever was available.

2849
01:25:01,841 --> 01:25:02,060
Right.

2850
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:03,160
The market is quite different.

2851
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:04,413
Yeah.

2852
01:25:05,230 --> 01:25:06,550
So you got like a,

2853
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:10,300
that problem sort of sort of started
to disappear in the new role.

2854
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:14,560
But in the old world that kind of still
happens like New Zealand and stuff too.

2855
01:25:16,660 --> 01:25:17,493
But uh,

2856
01:25:19,510 --> 01:25:19,820
yeah,

2857
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:20,653
it's been uh,

2858
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:21,190
it's,

2859
01:25:21,190 --> 01:25:21,440
it's,

2860
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:23,480
if you ever get the
chance to look into um,

2861
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:28,210
your ancestry is kind of interesting
because you find out a lot of stuff that

2862
01:25:28,630 --> 01:25:29,140
is,

2863
01:25:29,140 --> 01:25:31,700
if you don't find it out in sort of store,

2864
01:25:31,720 --> 01:25:33,760
it is this kind of knowledge
that gets lost forever.

2865
01:25:35,050 --> 01:25:35,830
Yeah,

2866
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:36,251
definitely.

2867
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:37,084
I didn't,

2868
01:25:37,260 --> 01:25:41,200
I hadn't ever looked into
it a to know that much.

2869
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:43,481
Well,

2870
01:25:43,481 --> 01:25:46,660
I found my great grandfather who was kind
of a strange because he had like three

2871
01:25:46,661 --> 01:25:47,530
families and my grandma,

2872
01:25:47,570 --> 01:25:50,170
my grandfather was like
in his second family,

2873
01:25:51,070 --> 01:25:52,720
he just kept like abandoning families.

2874
01:25:53,290 --> 01:25:53,740
Um,

2875
01:25:53,740 --> 01:25:55,610
but I found out that he had
like two different colored eyes.

2876
01:25:55,611 --> 01:25:55,931
So I was like,

2877
01:25:55,931 --> 01:25:56,171
okay,

2878
01:25:56,171 --> 01:25:57,004
what's up with that?

2879
01:25:57,150 --> 01:25:57,983
Apparently it's like,

2880
01:25:58,020 --> 01:25:59,430
it could be time Arizona,

2881
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:03,260
which is a think I'm going to
talk to you about this last night

2882
01:26:05,040 --> 01:26:07,070
because I have like a split
brain or something like that,

2883
01:26:07,150 --> 01:26:07,490
but I was,

2884
01:26:07,490 --> 01:26:10,190
I was curious like if you had
tried mannerism and his brain was,

2885
01:26:10,290 --> 01:26:11,360
you had a split brain,

2886
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:13,100
if that was related to the,

2887
01:26:13,101 --> 01:26:13,700
uh,

2888
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:16,150
if that might've been the reason why
I kept breaking up in this family.

2889
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:16,993
It's like leaving.

2890
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:19,003
Yeah,

2891
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:19,700
I don't,

2892
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:20,533
I don't remember.

2893
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:24,160
So I was just being often optimum and

2894
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:25,940
yeah,

2895
01:26:25,940 --> 01:26:26,421
it was just popped.

2896
01:26:26,421 --> 01:26:27,111
It popped into my head.

2897
01:26:27,111 --> 01:26:27,290
But yeah,

2898
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:28,250
I found out where he was born,

2899
01:26:28,251 --> 01:26:33,040
like within 100 meters
and a in Scotland though,

2900
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:34,180
I'm only actually a third,

2901
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:35,450
third generation Canadian.

2902
01:26:37,170 --> 01:26:37,501
Yeah.

2903
01:26:37,501 --> 01:26:38,151
I don't know.

2904
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:38,984
Uh,

2905
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:39,811
I think,

2906
01:26:39,811 --> 01:26:40,644
uh,

2907
01:26:42,490 --> 01:26:43,323
exactly.

2908
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:46,080
One,

2909
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:46,471
two,

2910
01:26:46,471 --> 01:26:51,471
three I think would the second or
third generation American from my.

2911
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:53,060
Yeah.

2912
01:26:53,060 --> 01:26:53,990
Your grandparents,

2913
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,060
your grandparents were born in the USA.

2914
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:56,894
You'd be third?

2915
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:57,691
Yeah.

2916
01:26:57,691 --> 01:26:57,871
No,

2917
01:26:57,871 --> 01:26:58,704
they were born.

2918
01:26:59,100 --> 01:26:59,933
They were born in.

2919
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:02,460
One of my grandparents were born in Italy.

2920
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:04,530
One of my grandparents
was born in England.

2921
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:09,950
One of my grandparents was born here in
the states and another one was born in

2922
01:27:10,561 --> 01:27:11,041
the states,

2923
01:27:11,041 --> 01:27:12,240
one in Illinois,

2924
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,480
close to Lincoln and one of them,

2925
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:16,140
uh,

2926
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,180
in West Virginia.

2927
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,313
That's cool.

2928
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:24,483
Uh,

2929
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:28,120
the earliest ancestor app is
like someone that was born in

2930
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:30,790
17,

2931
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:33,670
76 or something like that in Virginia.

2932
01:27:36,190 --> 01:27:38,490
So it was my earliest relative,

2933
01:27:38,550 --> 01:27:39,150
but,

2934
01:27:39,150 --> 01:27:39,310
uh,

2935
01:27:39,310 --> 01:27:39,510
in,

2936
01:27:39,510 --> 01:27:39,830
in,

2937
01:27:39,830 --> 01:27:41,020
in North America anyways.

2938
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:42,703
Yeah.

2939
01:27:43,640 --> 01:27:44,473
But no.

2940
01:27:47,460 --> 01:27:48,690
Any other topics you want to talk about?

2941
01:27:48,720 --> 01:27:50,340
I got some more if you're interested,

2942
01:27:50,341 --> 01:27:51,420
but I have to pull them up.

2943
01:27:52,470 --> 01:27:52,940
Yeah.

2944
01:27:52,940 --> 01:27:53,773
Uh,

2945
01:27:53,780 --> 01:27:54,610
if you give me a sec.

2946
01:27:54,610 --> 01:27:55,590
Are you going to use the bathroom?

2947
01:27:55,650 --> 01:27:56,483
I'm,

2948
01:27:56,990 --> 01:27:57,211
Oh yeah,

2949
01:27:57,211 --> 01:27:57,950
sure.

2950
01:27:57,950 --> 01:28:01,470
Just give me posted if I can say I'll
see if I can fill the air for you.

2951
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:01,950
Okay.

2952
01:28:01,950 --> 01:28:02,783
Just a minute.

2953
01:28:08,040 --> 01:28:08,280
Alright.

2954
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,810
So I'll just read off this thing.

2955
01:28:09,811 --> 01:28:10,644
I wrote,

2956
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:13,020
history is said to be
written by the victors,

2957
01:28:13,290 --> 01:28:14,760
but really the history is

2958
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:17,010
what?

2959
01:28:17,010 --> 01:28:17,281
Sorry,

2960
01:28:17,281 --> 01:28:18,270
I think I fucked this up.

2961
01:28:18,870 --> 01:28:20,700
History is said to be
written by the victors,

2962
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:24,810
but really history is nearly
written that history is written.

2963
01:28:25,950 --> 01:28:26,730
That history,

2964
01:28:26,730 --> 01:28:31,380
which is written is where the
sentence should end written history.

2965
01:28:31,381 --> 01:28:33,750
Can never represent exactly
how events occurred.

2966
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,210
It can never be purely objective.

2967
01:28:36,590 --> 01:28:37,321
It is instead.

2968
01:28:37,321 --> 01:28:41,100
Subjective history is in
fact written by the writers.

2969
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:46,020
It cannot be any other way and must be
considered in perspective and thought

2970
01:28:46,140 --> 01:28:47,310
about within context.

2971
01:28:47,370 --> 01:28:48,240
It's contextual.

2972
01:28:48,241 --> 01:28:53,241
Standing media as we see it today is
written in much the same manner that media

2973
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:56,880
cannot construct objective
reality through its storytelling.

2974
01:28:57,490 --> 01:29:01,740
It is only possible to construct a
subjective reality in the written word and

2975
01:29:01,741 --> 01:29:06,741
doing so creates a narrative tail which
at some points is accurate of reality,

2976
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,240
but in others less so.

2977
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:10,740
Why does this matter?

2978
01:29:11,250 --> 01:29:14,490
Because we were told that the
narrative is it self our reality

2979
01:29:15,990 --> 01:29:17,570
that is however mostly untrue.

2980
01:29:18,120 --> 01:29:22,200
It is no more true than to say that one
subjective experiences are the totality

2981
01:29:22,260 --> 01:29:23,670
of our collective experience.

2982
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:29,270
This cannot be said to be true
because each individual experience a

2983
01:29:29,370 --> 01:29:32,040
differentiates to some
degree from the collective,

2984
01:29:33,090 --> 01:29:35,550
which isn't really an experience a more.

2985
01:29:35,551 --> 01:29:38,760
It is a collectivization and
narrative retelling of a certain time.

2986
01:29:39,540 --> 01:29:43,130
You cannot have a collective objective
experience because anything you attribute

2987
01:29:43,140 --> 01:29:47,100
to a collective neither accurately
describes reality for any individual.

2988
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:51,420
Nor could it possibly described objective
reality for a group of individuals.

2989
01:29:52,350 --> 01:29:55,890
That is not to say that the narrative
narrative has no place at that.

2990
01:29:55,891 --> 01:29:58,080
The narrative cannot describe
that objective reality.

2991
01:29:58,920 --> 01:29:59,610
A narrowed,

2992
01:29:59,610 --> 01:30:00,210
however,

2993
01:30:00,210 --> 01:30:03,870
is important because it allows
us to transfer information
and knowledge into the

2994
01:30:03,871 --> 01:30:05,130
future and to have this.

2995
01:30:07,540 --> 01:30:10,680
It's whatever it gives
it gives it one weakness,

2996
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:13,920
which is the weakness we must all look
out for when we investigate and learn

2997
01:30:13,921 --> 01:30:14,754
about our history.

2998
01:30:15,780 --> 01:30:18,930
Both the strength and the weaknesses
of the written word lay in the writer.

2999
01:30:19,860 --> 01:30:21,190
The truth is that history,

3000
01:30:21,191 --> 01:30:22,860
it was never written by the victor.

3001
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:24,720
It was merely accepted by the victor.

3002
01:30:25,050 --> 01:30:26,850
It was instead written by the scribe.

3003
01:30:27,450 --> 01:30:30,900
Even though you may being
the scribe of the victor,

3004
01:30:30,901 --> 01:30:32,430
it was nevertheless written by him.

3005
01:30:33,480 --> 01:30:37,380
It is true that the victor ad been
unaccepting of described work.

3006
01:30:37,570 --> 01:30:37,960
Uh,

3007
01:30:37,960 --> 01:30:38,140
if,

3008
01:30:38,140 --> 01:30:38,550
uh,

3009
01:30:38,550 --> 01:30:42,450
if he had been unaccepting of described
where he could have altered the written

3010
01:30:42,451 --> 01:30:43,284
narrative,

3011
01:30:43,850 --> 01:30:47,700
but how could the victor possibly
understand or know or foresee the future

3012
01:30:47,730 --> 01:30:49,710
interpretations of the
narrative subscribed?

3013
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:54,480
The truth is that the victor could not
foresee how exactly future generations

3014
01:30:54,481 --> 01:30:56,070
would interpret the scribe history.

3015
01:30:56,310 --> 01:30:57,150
So it is possible.

3016
01:30:57,151 --> 01:30:58,920
We are the descendants of the history.

3017
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:01,530
It'd be interpreting it
differently than our ancestors.

3018
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:03,443
Yes.

3019
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:05,640
Especially the spirit of the written work.

3020
01:31:06,150 --> 01:31:09,750
One might try and argue that the present
narratives are more reliable than past

3021
01:31:09,751 --> 01:31:10,584
ones.

3022
01:31:10,790 --> 01:31:14,090
Not The reliability only
reduces by a narrative age.

3023
01:31:14,610 --> 01:31:16,830
I consider that this isn't the case.

3024
01:31:17,670 --> 01:31:18,510
What can we infer?

3025
01:31:18,530 --> 01:31:18,750
Homework,

3026
01:31:18,750 --> 01:31:19,770
contemporary media

3027
01:31:21,330 --> 01:31:23,160
if they're in their narratives.

3028
01:31:24,100 --> 01:31:24,270
Okay.

3029
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:24,931
That's all I wrote.

3030
01:31:24,931 --> 01:31:26,410
So a partial.

3031
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:27,810
Are you,

3032
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:28,643
are you back?

3033
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:31,893
Oh,

3034
01:31:32,440 --> 01:31:33,850
it must be just turning the knob.

3035
01:31:38,020 --> 01:31:39,820
That was kind of kind
of blabbering on there.

3036
01:31:39,821 --> 01:31:42,070
I wasn't quite finished what I was doing.

3037
01:31:45,950 --> 01:31:46,161
Yes.

3038
01:31:46,161 --> 01:31:48,020
History is definitely
rewritten for the uh,

3039
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:49,873
uh,

3040
01:31:50,550 --> 01:31:52,400
he was definitely written by.

3041
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:54,370
Well,

3042
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:55,203
it depends.

3043
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:57,170
It can be rewritten by the current victor

3044
01:31:58,980 --> 01:32:00,090
and that's certainly the case,

3045
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:00,923
but

3046
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:08,451
yeah,

3047
01:32:08,451 --> 01:32:09,284
header chromia.

3048
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,131
That's what my,

3049
01:32:10,131 --> 01:32:10,390
uh,

3050
01:32:10,390 --> 01:32:13,850
I just looking at the chat now
as what my great grandfather had,

3051
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:14,840
um,

3052
01:32:14,840 --> 01:32:15,380
he was actually,

3053
01:32:15,380 --> 01:32:15,680
he's,

3054
01:32:15,680 --> 01:32:16,460
he got sent off.

3055
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:21,460
You get registered on Vancouver island
to fight in the Canadian expeditionary

3056
01:32:21,741 --> 01:32:22,281
forces.

3057
01:32:22,281 --> 01:32:23,150
Which went to Siberia.

3058
01:32:23,151 --> 01:32:25,970
That helps stop the Russian
revolution or the assist.

3059
01:32:25,971 --> 01:32:26,810
The white army.

3060
01:32:27,740 --> 01:32:28,573
It's the ribs.

3061
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:29,151
Uh,

3062
01:32:29,151 --> 01:32:31,460
I guess I missed failed
because they came back.

3063
01:32:31,760 --> 01:32:34,550
I'm in a rush and I
have all his documents,

3064
01:32:34,620 --> 01:32:36,140
a pay stubs and stuff.

3065
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:38,510
From that time I thought
it was pretty interesting.

3066
01:32:38,511 --> 01:32:41,990
So that's the history we don't
know about a lot in Canada.

3067
01:32:42,590 --> 01:32:43,423
So

3068
01:32:46,340 --> 01:32:47,173
it was cool to see.

3069
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,690
But I found out he had three families.

3070
01:32:51,140 --> 01:32:53,120
First he that he came from Scotland.

3071
01:32:53,121 --> 01:32:57,530
He married a Mexican woman named Maria
and they moved to the Seattle area.

3072
01:32:57,600 --> 01:32:58,790
And you had two children.

3073
01:32:59,570 --> 01:32:59,751
Uh,

3074
01:32:59,751 --> 01:33:00,860
they got divorced,

3075
01:33:01,280 --> 01:33:02,180
she got the children,

3076
01:33:02,650 --> 01:33:03,740
he moved away,

3077
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:05,480
met my great grandmother and Alberta,

3078
01:33:06,890 --> 01:33:07,251
Alberta,

3079
01:33:07,251 --> 01:33:07,820
Saskatchewan.

3080
01:33:07,820 --> 01:33:08,653
Her name was Alberta.

3081
01:33:09,290 --> 01:33:10,123
And uh,

3082
01:33:10,310 --> 01:33:12,230
then he had three more kids with them.

3083
01:33:12,800 --> 01:33:13,570
Um,

3084
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:14,301
but before that happened,

3085
01:33:14,301 --> 01:33:14,900
my great,

3086
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:16,700
great grandfather who was his dad,

3087
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:18,223
uh,

3088
01:33:18,470 --> 01:33:20,720
one to know where the
hell his grandkids were.

3089
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:24,440
So he went to a Seattle and
found them in an orphanage.

3090
01:33:24,441 --> 01:33:25,310
But the sun,

3091
01:33:25,390 --> 01:33:26,223
the,

3092
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:27,063
there was two children,

3093
01:33:27,120 --> 01:33:27,861
son was younger.

3094
01:33:27,861 --> 01:33:30,410
He was adopted right
away by another family,

3095
01:33:30,620 --> 01:33:32,000
so he couldn't find them.

3096
01:33:32,370 --> 01:33:32,530
Uh,

3097
01:33:32,530 --> 01:33:37,530
but he found the daughter who is older
and he brought her back to a Saskatchewan

3098
01:33:38,401 --> 01:33:41,540
and basically just dropped them off
with my great grandfather and said,

3099
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:44,050
dropped her off my great
grandfather and said like,

3100
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:45,350
you're take your damn kid.

3101
01:33:45,950 --> 01:33:46,783
And uh,

3102
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:50,510
so that my grandfather ended
up growing up with this,

3103
01:33:50,550 --> 01:33:50,900
uh,

3104
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:55,900
his older half sister or then when
he went off to war to stop the doll,

3105
01:33:56,720 --> 01:33:59,340
I guess during the depression
slash world war two,

3106
01:33:59,730 --> 01:33:59,960
um,

3107
01:33:59,960 --> 01:34:04,960
money came back to you is she was gone
and I had divorced her husband and uh,

3108
01:34:06,200 --> 01:34:11,200
I guess taken the four boys that
she had had with him and he went to,

3109
01:34:12,380 --> 01:34:15,310
she went off to try to find
her brother in Seattle,

3110
01:34:15,311 --> 01:34:17,120
will never did married some random dude,

3111
01:34:17,300 --> 01:34:20,810
another guy and end up dying in Arizona.

3112
01:34:21,140 --> 01:34:21,973
Two thousand five,

3113
01:34:22,640 --> 01:34:23,451
the four boys.

3114
01:34:23,451 --> 01:34:26,350
I'm not sure exactly what happened to
them there from the first marriage of my,

3115
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:27,710
just my great aunt.

3116
01:34:28,690 --> 01:34:29,120
Um,

3117
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:29,953
she,

3118
01:34:30,290 --> 01:34:31,123
um,

3119
01:34:31,430 --> 01:34:35,450
I think one of them ended up fostering
a second cousin of mine that lives in my

3120
01:34:35,451 --> 01:34:38,560
town and I was able to find
her through 23 and me and um,

3121
01:34:39,190 --> 01:34:42,010
I went for coffee with her and
stuff and it's interesting.

3122
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:43,610
She didn't know she was adopted though,

3123
01:34:43,611 --> 01:34:44,444
so,

3124
01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:45,300
uh,

3125
01:34:45,300 --> 01:34:47,420
if we kind of gave her a
heads up about her family,

3126
01:34:50,280 --> 01:34:51,113
I'm back.

3127
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:52,631
Hey,

3128
01:34:52,631 --> 01:34:53,464
what's up?

3129
01:34:56,170 --> 01:34:56,620
Oh,

3130
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:57,030
so I,

3131
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:57,450
I,

3132
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:58,283
it,

3133
01:34:58,930 --> 01:35:00,070
I ran out of the thing I wrote,

3134
01:35:00,090 --> 01:35:00,600
but uh,

3135
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:01,433
it wasn't,

3136
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:02,990
I didn't realize I hadn't finished it,

3137
01:35:02,991 --> 01:35:05,000
so when I got to the end to
just kind of trailed off,

3138
01:35:07,330 --> 01:35:07,601
but,

3139
01:35:07,601 --> 01:35:08,434
uh,

3140
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:10,850
so exactly a what.

3141
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:16,320
So how do you know that
your dread third generation,

3142
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:17,430
third generation?

3143
01:35:17,431 --> 01:35:18,264
Does it?

3144
01:35:18,360 --> 01:35:20,760
Do you have to consider
all your grandparents or,

3145
01:35:20,761 --> 01:35:21,594
or is it just.

3146
01:35:23,030 --> 01:35:23,640
Yeah,

3147
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:27,060
traditionally you go by your father's
father's father sort of thing.

3148
01:35:27,120 --> 01:35:29,970
You kind of go down the a paternal line.

3149
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:31,740
So whatever your name is,

3150
01:35:31,820 --> 01:35:32,020
Becky,

3151
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:32,853
whatever you.

3152
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:34,410
It wouldn't have to be your
father's line neighbor.

3153
01:35:34,470 --> 01:35:35,303
Like you could,

3154
01:35:35,310 --> 01:35:36,510
if you had your mother's last name,

3155
01:35:36,511 --> 01:35:36,991
for example,

3156
01:35:36,991 --> 01:35:37,711
you could go by that,

3157
01:35:37,711 --> 01:35:39,780
but it says generally by
what your last name is,

3158
01:35:40,270 --> 01:35:41,103
because I mean otherwise,

3159
01:35:41,310 --> 01:35:43,230
otherwise you'd have
10,000 different origins,

3160
01:35:43,231 --> 01:35:44,064
right?

3161
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:44,850
Yeah.

3162
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:45,920
But that was different.

3163
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:47,153
Yeah.

3164
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:48,720
It depends on the tradition though.

3165
01:35:48,900 --> 01:35:49,730
So,

3166
01:35:49,730 --> 01:35:50,280
um,

3167
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:50,790
but my,

3168
01:35:50,790 --> 01:35:53,940
I know my family's tradition
as a is a patriarchal.

3169
01:35:53,941 --> 01:35:54,261
So.

3170
01:35:54,261 --> 01:35:55,081
But you'd go by the,

3171
01:35:55,081 --> 01:35:55,390
uh,

3172
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:56,850
father's last name,

3173
01:35:57,240 --> 01:35:59,370
most western societies or anything?

3174
01:36:00,660 --> 01:36:01,290
Yeah.

3175
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:01,720
Oh,

3176
01:36:01,720 --> 01:36:02,070
uh,

3177
01:36:02,070 --> 01:36:02,251
like,

3178
01:36:02,251 --> 01:36:02,701
for example,

3179
01:36:02,701 --> 01:36:03,580
Jewish society is,

3180
01:36:03,581 --> 01:36:04,890
I think they go by the mother.

3181
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:05,491
Oh,

3182
01:36:05,491 --> 01:36:06,324
okay.

3183
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:08,220
There's a good reason for that too,

3184
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:09,030
because if,

3185
01:36:09,030 --> 01:36:09,863
you know,

3186
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:10,200
if you're,

3187
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:10,720
if you,

3188
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:14,240
the reason why the juice side is
filled by the mothers because uh,

3189
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:15,873
um,

3190
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:16,201
you know,

3191
01:36:16,201 --> 01:36:18,540
for sure that you're Jewish
if your mother was Jewish,

3192
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:21,120
but you could be fathered
by some random dude.

3193
01:36:21,121 --> 01:36:21,301
Right.

3194
01:36:21,301 --> 01:36:25,080
So if they don't think that
they traditionally they
don't see the father as the

3195
01:36:25,081 --> 01:36:26,220
reliable progenitor.

3196
01:36:26,760 --> 01:36:27,593
Yeah.

3197
01:36:28,470 --> 01:36:29,330
So that's why you get these,

3198
01:36:29,590 --> 01:36:30,510
like these memes,

3199
01:36:30,511 --> 01:36:34,470
or like a Jewish mother is always want
their sons to marry a Jewish woman so

3200
01:36:34,471 --> 01:36:35,730
they're can have Jewish grandkids.

3201
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,033
That's what,

3202
01:36:38,360 --> 01:36:39,180
that's what that's all about,

3203
01:36:39,180 --> 01:36:39,331
right?

3204
01:36:39,331 --> 01:36:39,750
It's just,

3205
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:41,670
it's kind of like we
all make jokes about it.

3206
01:36:41,880 --> 01:36:42,713
Yeah.

3207
01:36:45,050 --> 01:36:46,910
Why don't you marry Nice Jewish girl.

3208
01:36:48,420 --> 01:36:49,800
Oh yeah.

3209
01:36:50,300 --> 01:36:50,871
It's interesting.

3210
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:52,550
Or at least different
traditions that people have.

3211
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,690
Like the native Americans.

3212
01:36:53,691 --> 01:36:55,100
I think they have a different one as well.

3213
01:36:57,230 --> 01:36:59,330
They're more about like
the grandparents parents.

3214
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:01,810
Yes.

3215
01:37:01,810 --> 01:37:02,140
My,

3216
01:37:02,140 --> 01:37:03,760
my great grandfather,

3217
01:37:03,761 --> 01:37:04,730
he would be from a.

3218
01:37:05,560 --> 01:37:06,490
you'd be from Italy,

3219
01:37:06,910 --> 01:37:07,750
Bari Italy.

3220
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:10,120
Do you know which part?

3221
01:37:10,390 --> 01:37:10,811
Yeah,

3222
01:37:10,811 --> 01:37:13,500
a Bari Aria.

3223
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:16,010
Which is that the north or South or south.

3224
01:37:16,130 --> 01:37:17,270
And it's on the,

3225
01:37:17,271 --> 01:37:18,104
uh,

3226
01:37:18,990 --> 01:37:20,460
east coast line.

3227
01:37:21,860 --> 01:37:22,211
Okay.

3228
01:37:22,211 --> 01:37:23,050
So the opposite.

3229
01:37:23,051 --> 01:37:23,261
Okay.

3230
01:37:23,261 --> 01:37:25,630
So my wife's family's from Calabria,

3231
01:37:27,950 --> 01:37:28,970
which is like or Calabria.

3232
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,920
It's like the one that's
like the toe of the boot.

3233
01:37:32,330 --> 01:37:33,163
Yeah.

3234
01:37:33,650 --> 01:37:34,190
Okay.

3235
01:37:34,190 --> 01:37:35,420
I guess here's the heel,

3236
01:37:35,510 --> 01:37:36,343
right?

3237
01:37:36,410 --> 01:37:37,243
Yeah.

3238
01:37:37,710 --> 01:37:38,543
Okay.

3239
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:39,771
Yeah.

3240
01:37:39,771 --> 01:37:42,350
The east side of east,

3241
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:42,740
south,

3242
01:37:42,740 --> 01:37:43,620
east side of it

3243
01:37:43,670 --> 01:37:47,660
for south east side of Italy.

3244
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:48,494
Yeah.

3245
01:37:49,910 --> 01:37:50,743
That's cool.

3246
01:37:51,630 --> 01:37:52,970
Do you know how long
they had been there for?

3247
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:54,760
No.

3248
01:37:54,760 --> 01:37:55,230
Uh,

3249
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:57,480
I don't know how long
they had been in Bari.

3250
01:37:58,590 --> 01:37:59,760
I've wondered about that,

3251
01:38:00,630 --> 01:38:02,190
but that's irrelevant.

3252
01:38:02,191 --> 01:38:02,660
Hey Kid,

3253
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:06,180
probably you could probably figure
it out if you went to a church there,

3254
01:38:06,760 --> 01:38:09,090
contribute visit about the
church that your family went to.

3255
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:11,730
They probably have records if any
warehouse then it would be there.

3256
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:12,793
Really?

3257
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,123
Yeah.

3258
01:38:14,290 --> 01:38:15,620
I'm like,

3259
01:38:15,780 --> 01:38:17,010
if I go back to the Netherlands,

3260
01:38:17,011 --> 01:38:18,070
I can in Scotland,

3261
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:21,960
I can get records for my family as far
back as I said there's a written record

3262
01:38:21,961 --> 01:38:23,310
anyways unless there's a fire.

3263
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:24,750
Um,

3264
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:25,583
but uh,

3265
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,900
I just don't have the
money to go to Scotland.

3266
01:38:27,901 --> 01:38:28,930
Just know.

3267
01:38:29,690 --> 01:38:30,060
Yeah,

3268
01:38:30,060 --> 01:38:30,721
I didn't know that.

3269
01:38:30,721 --> 01:38:32,100
I'm glad you told me about that.

3270
01:38:32,990 --> 01:38:34,320
I don't have the money to do that,

3271
01:38:34,321 --> 01:38:36,300
but it's kind of Nice to know that.

3272
01:38:37,900 --> 01:38:38,200
Yeah,

3273
01:38:38,200 --> 01:38:39,033
that

3274
01:38:39,530 --> 01:38:43,590
that's available or possibly available
if it hasn't been destroyed or discard it

3275
01:38:43,591 --> 01:38:47,540
or it'd probably be there like if it's
your grandparents that were born there

3276
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,510
and if you have their
full names or something,

3277
01:38:50,511 --> 01:38:52,190
you could probably any
knew where they lived.

3278
01:38:52,200 --> 01:38:54,740
You could probably figure it
out like within a day or two.

3279
01:38:55,070 --> 01:38:55,670
But uh,

3280
01:38:55,670 --> 01:38:56,100
it just,

3281
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:58,550
it depends if they're a
registered and all that stuff.

3282
01:38:58,551 --> 01:38:59,600
But yeah,

3283
01:38:59,601 --> 01:39:00,261
that's crazy thing.

3284
01:39:00,261 --> 01:39:01,260
Like so much history.

3285
01:39:01,261 --> 01:39:05,870
It just wasn't written down like
there's so much missing now,

3286
01:39:05,970 --> 01:39:06,980
like nowadays,

3287
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:10,970
like you're going to have pictures of
yourself when I at every stage of your

3288
01:39:10,971 --> 01:39:12,620
life and your great,

3289
01:39:12,621 --> 01:39:12,951
great,

3290
01:39:12,951 --> 01:39:14,290
great grandkids might be able to like,

3291
01:39:14,291 --> 01:39:15,124
look at it.

3292
01:39:15,350 --> 01:39:16,183
Right?

3293
01:39:17,110 --> 01:39:18,320
The way records are kept.

3294
01:39:19,030 --> 01:39:19,863
Yup.

3295
01:39:20,510 --> 01:39:23,930
Assuming the survey result don't get wiped

3296
01:39:27,540 --> 01:39:29,750
barrier than underground under
a sheet a lead or something.

3297
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,023
Um,

3298
01:39:35,010 --> 01:39:36,620
I forgot what I was going to say.

3299
01:39:42,120 --> 01:39:42,953
Can't remember.

3300
01:39:47,120 --> 01:39:48,690
We got to check the chat.

3301
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:49,910
Any questions here?

3302
01:39:51,250 --> 01:39:51,901
A picture?

3303
01:39:51,901 --> 01:39:52,734
Who else do you?

3304
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,633
Um,

3305
01:39:57,060 --> 01:39:57,900
basically the goat.

3306
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:02,680
It's not my daughter again,

3307
01:40:07,440 --> 01:40:08,273
like this.

3308
01:40:10,110 --> 01:40:10,943
Uh,

3309
01:40:12,350 --> 01:40:12,520
yeah.

3310
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:15,220
I'll take any questions you got
or what questions do you want?

3311
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,073
Want me to answer?

3312
01:40:20,420 --> 01:40:21,520
I'm reloading my page.

3313
01:40:21,521 --> 01:40:22,920
I think it froze on me.

3314
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:24,893
Oh yeah,

3315
01:40:25,340 --> 01:40:26,173
same thing.

3316
01:40:27,110 --> 01:40:27,430
Alright.

3317
01:40:27,430 --> 01:40:28,061
Steve Nichols.

3318
01:40:28,061 --> 01:40:28,870
What do you got for me?

3319
01:40:28,870 --> 01:40:30,370
Anybody who's got a question?

3320
01:40:35,350 --> 01:40:35,671
Thinking.

3321
01:40:35,671 --> 01:40:36,504
Okay.

3322
01:40:36,570 --> 01:40:37,403
Uh,

3323
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:40,530
on the meantime I'll try to
find something that I wrote.

3324
01:40:41,090 --> 01:40:41,923
Uh,

3325
01:40:43,900 --> 01:40:44,820
I wrote this a

3326
01:40:46,420 --> 01:40:46,720
thing.

3327
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:48,640
I guess I could maybe
pull something from it.

3328
01:40:50,020 --> 01:40:50,853
Um,

3329
01:40:56,690 --> 01:40:56,901
okay.

3330
01:40:56,901 --> 01:40:57,651
So I read this thing.

3331
01:40:57,651 --> 01:41:00,170
I could give you the first paragraph
or whatever and see what you think

3332
01:41:01,890 --> 01:41:03,000
we did discuss it or whatever.

3333
01:41:03,210 --> 01:41:03,720
Yeah,

3334
01:41:03,720 --> 01:41:03,871
yeah,

3335
01:41:03,871 --> 01:41:04,704
go ahead.

3336
01:41:04,770 --> 01:41:05,550
Okay.

3337
01:41:05,550 --> 01:41:06,383
Alright.

3338
01:41:06,660 --> 01:41:09,990
So I'll just read the paragraph and
then I'll say it's done or whatever.

3339
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:10,870
Uh,

3340
01:41:10,870 --> 01:41:14,730
I often consider certain prescribed
ideas which counter orthodoxy.

3341
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:17,190
I'm not certain why I do so,

3342
01:41:17,191 --> 01:41:21,540
but I think it's because they used to
fall into such orthodox will thinking to

3343
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:22,620
some degree anyways,

3344
01:41:23,550 --> 01:41:27,070
the questioning alleged authority
figures seems to be a part of my being is

3345
01:41:27,090 --> 01:41:27,923
fiber.

3346
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:29,850
Perhaps I speak truth,

3347
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:32,070
but that would seem to
sell for grandizing.

3348
01:41:32,250 --> 01:41:36,210
So best to avoid believing that holy as
it risks falling into similar modes of

3349
01:41:36,211 --> 01:41:41,211
thinking in regards to truly knowing that
is to say overconfidence towards one's

3350
01:41:41,821 --> 01:41:46,590
limited knowledge for as a rule once
knowledge is by definition very limited.

3351
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,200
That was the first paragraph anyways.

3352
01:41:49,980 --> 01:41:50,813
Um,

3353
01:41:50,910 --> 01:41:51,231
so what,

3354
01:41:51,231 --> 01:41:52,620
what I was trying to get up there was

3355
01:41:53,190 --> 01:41:54,023
um,

3356
01:41:54,830 --> 01:41:59,240
I come across people that have
these sort of stone ideas and

3357
01:42:00,830 --> 01:42:03,530
Orthodox Orthodox ideas and they don't,

3358
01:42:03,590 --> 01:42:04,423
uh,

3359
01:42:04,890 --> 01:42:06,140
they're kinda like in movable.

3360
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:08,330
And I find that.

3361
01:42:08,620 --> 01:42:09,230
What was,

3362
01:42:09,230 --> 01:42:10,730
I wrote this because I started thinking,

3363
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:11,510
well,

3364
01:42:11,510 --> 01:42:12,290
why,

3365
01:42:12,290 --> 01:42:17,240
why are they these kinds of people that
don't want to learn new things or why

3366
01:42:17,241 --> 01:42:20,870
don't they want to consider even just
entertain the possibility of a different

3367
01:42:20,871 --> 01:42:21,704
idea?

3368
01:42:22,190 --> 01:42:23,510
So I started writing about that.

3369
01:42:24,010 --> 01:42:25,580
Maybe have you come across this,

3370
01:42:26,570 --> 01:42:27,403
uh,

3371
01:42:28,350 --> 01:42:28,690
you know,

3372
01:42:28,690 --> 01:42:29,470
I,

3373
01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:29,780
you know,

3374
01:42:29,780 --> 01:42:31,100
somewhat with the whole

3375
01:42:32,660 --> 01:42:33,060
dose,

3376
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:33,891
the Truth Candle.

3377
01:42:33,891 --> 01:42:34,161
I mean,

3378
01:42:34,161 --> 01:42:35,990
I thought the name when I picked it up,

3379
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,183
it really didn't.

3380
01:42:37,910 --> 01:42:39,350
It really wasn't like,

3381
01:42:39,410 --> 01:42:39,621
oh,

3382
01:42:39,621 --> 01:42:41,050
it's not really my dosage route.

3383
01:42:41,130 --> 01:42:42,710
The dose of truth is Jordan Peterson,

3384
01:42:42,711 --> 01:42:43,251
you know what I mean?

3385
01:42:43,251 --> 01:42:43,611
It was,

3386
01:42:43,611 --> 01:42:44,300
uh,

3387
01:42:44,300 --> 01:42:44,700
this,

3388
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:45,533
uh,

3389
01:42:45,730 --> 01:42:46,563
uh,

3390
01:42:49,110 --> 01:42:52,050
like he was the one who is
shedding new perspectives and then,

3391
01:42:52,850 --> 01:42:53,191
you know,

3392
01:42:53,191 --> 01:42:54,030
then I got into,

3393
01:42:54,031 --> 01:42:54,600
you know,

3394
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:55,980
with titling videos,

3395
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:57,973
um,

3396
01:42:58,430 --> 01:43:02,330
Peterson would meet something and then I
would take some interpretation and then

3397
01:43:02,331 --> 01:43:05,450
unfortunately not provide any commentary
to be able to explain what I meant.

3398
01:43:06,160 --> 01:43:06,440
Um,

3399
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:06,980
so,

3400
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:07,221
you know,

3401
01:43:07,221 --> 01:43:08,150
people be like,

3402
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:08,361
oh,

3403
01:43:08,361 --> 01:43:09,350
this is not that,

3404
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:10,640
this is what this means.

3405
01:43:11,420 --> 01:43:11,991
And,

3406
01:43:11,991 --> 01:43:12,824
uh,

3407
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:14,840
but I mean in everyday life,

3408
01:43:15,690 --> 01:43:16,523
uh,

3409
01:43:19,540 --> 01:43:19,751
yeah,

3410
01:43:19,751 --> 01:43:19,961
I,

3411
01:43:19,961 --> 01:43:20,794
you know,

3412
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:26,760
I certainly try and stay
open about everything,

3413
01:43:27,120 --> 01:43:27,361
you know,

3414
01:43:27,361 --> 01:43:31,120
I just assume most of the
time that I don't know.

3415
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:34,563
No,

3416
01:43:36,830 --> 01:43:38,960
I just assume most of the time
that I don't know what the hell.

3417
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:42,813
Yeah.

3418
01:43:43,340 --> 01:43:44,260
Well if you're open to learning,

3419
01:43:44,270 --> 01:43:48,560
that's always the best way that I
approach things because otherwise you just

3420
01:43:48,561 --> 01:43:49,520
become too uh,

3421
01:43:50,190 --> 01:43:51,023
oh,

3422
01:43:51,080 --> 01:43:52,340
you liked the humility,

3423
01:43:52,341 --> 01:43:52,820
right?

3424
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:53,653
To learn?

3425
01:43:55,530 --> 01:43:56,363
Yeah.

3426
01:43:59,080 --> 01:43:59,913
Yeah.

3427
01:44:00,250 --> 01:44:01,083
Uh,

3428
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:06,341
yeah,

3429
01:44:06,341 --> 01:44:07,240
I come across

3430
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:08,383
people.

3431
01:44:13,340 --> 01:44:13,670
Yep.

3432
01:44:13,670 --> 01:44:15,920
Who Do you have for who definitely
like dead set in their beliefs.

3433
01:44:15,970 --> 01:44:16,610
Um,

3434
01:44:16,610 --> 01:44:21,560
but you try and ask them why
and they'll try and argue from

3435
01:44:23,470 --> 01:44:25,930
like a moral standpoint
rather than any type of,

3436
01:44:26,520 --> 01:44:26,910
you know,

3437
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:27,743
rational

3438
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,273
standpoint.

3439
01:44:32,940 --> 01:44:33,773
Yeah.

3440
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:37,440
Oh,

3441
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:39,320
want me to go into a second paragraph?

3442
01:44:39,380 --> 01:44:39,860
Yeah,

3443
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:40,041
yeah,

3444
01:44:40,041 --> 01:44:40,874
sure.

3445
01:44:41,100 --> 01:44:42,020
All no problem.

3446
01:44:42,021 --> 01:44:42,660
I got like,

3447
01:44:42,660 --> 01:44:43,101
it's like,

3448
01:44:43,101 --> 01:44:44,600
I think there's five paragraphs.

3449
01:44:44,601 --> 01:44:45,434
I don't read them all and this,

3450
01:44:45,790 --> 01:44:49,970
I will work through respond anyways if
we even do they get boring world to stop

3451
01:44:50,180 --> 01:44:51,013
because I don't want to.

3452
01:44:51,020 --> 01:44:52,000
Definitely not boring.

3453
01:44:52,010 --> 01:44:52,730
If anybody's boring,

3454
01:44:52,730 --> 01:44:53,563
it's okay.

3455
01:44:55,730 --> 01:44:59,720
So the difference then between arrogance
and wisdom and and also when I'm

3456
01:44:59,721 --> 01:45:00,231
writing this,

3457
01:45:00,231 --> 01:45:00,530
I'm like,

3458
01:45:00,530 --> 01:45:01,730
just like thinking out loud,

3459
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:06,850
like reading without like really I'm
kind of rewriting this without really was

3460
01:45:07,191 --> 01:45:07,971
kind of rough draft.

3461
01:45:07,971 --> 01:45:08,804
Right?

3462
01:45:08,850 --> 01:45:11,120
I just want to say that
before I start going off,

3463
01:45:11,810 --> 01:45:13,530
I'm sorry I said that I.

3464
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:18,020
I go on the difference then
between arrogance and the
wisdom is both in at least

3465
01:45:18,030 --> 01:45:21,520
some part wisdom that is to say
experience and landscape passage.

3466
01:45:21,521 --> 01:45:22,730
You have to think about that.

3467
01:45:22,730 --> 01:45:25,640
I mean to filtered biases in
a truthful and honest manner.

3468
01:45:26,660 --> 01:45:26,781
Now,

3469
01:45:26,781 --> 01:45:30,110
removing biases or biases
may not be possible,

3470
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:34,310
but it is possible to be thoughtful about
them and perhaps experiment with one's

3471
01:45:34,311 --> 01:45:36,860
capacity to hold a thought in one's mind,

3472
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:40,460
in which one does not necessarily hold
as part of their personal philosophy of

3473
01:45:40,461 --> 01:45:41,294
life.

3474
01:45:41,690 --> 01:45:43,690
Perhaps this capacity to emphasize,

3475
01:45:44,900 --> 01:45:48,560
empathize with others is what allows
one to really understand other ways of

3476
01:45:48,561 --> 01:45:53,330
thinking and in order to truly see
them as valid or invalid based on their

3477
01:45:53,331 --> 01:45:55,280
genuine merits rather than rhetoric.

3478
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:57,360
I currently have you rhetoric as a co,

3479
01:45:57,470 --> 01:46:02,470
as comforting lies rather than what
purposes are what their purpose does are

3480
01:46:02,721 --> 01:46:03,554
supposed to be.

3481
01:46:03,770 --> 01:46:06,290
That is to convince
people using information,

3482
01:46:06,920 --> 01:46:09,830
whether the information is valid
or invalid doesn't seem to matter.

3483
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:12,170
Some believe in very wrongly,

3484
01:46:12,171 --> 01:46:13,004
in my opinion,

3485
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:17,720
that data recorded can be pure rational
evidence of a known problem and thus

3486
01:46:17,820 --> 01:46:19,880
guide us toward the
solution to solve problems.

3487
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:22,400
That's my second paragraph there.

3488
01:46:23,150 --> 01:46:24,710
Can you repeat the last sentence?

3489
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:26,413
Oh sure.

3490
01:46:26,680 --> 01:46:27,740
But you're back there.

3491
01:46:27,770 --> 01:46:30,440
Some belief and very
wrongly in my opinion,

3492
01:46:30,770 --> 01:46:35,770
that data recorded and be pure rational
evidence of a known problem and thus

3493
01:46:36,381 --> 01:46:39,020
guide us towards a
solution to those problems.

3494
01:46:41,510 --> 01:46:42,290
So what do you.

3495
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:43,850
What exactly do you mean by that?

3496
01:46:44,060 --> 01:46:45,050
That data recorded?

3497
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:46,690
Well,

3498
01:46:46,690 --> 01:46:51,660
I think that some people see like they
pick like a say two plus two equals four,

3499
01:46:51,690 --> 01:46:54,510
therefore that means this,

3500
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:55,110
right?

3501
01:46:55,110 --> 01:46:58,050
And they think they're being objective.

3502
01:46:58,140 --> 01:46:58,973
So

3503
01:47:00,450 --> 01:47:00,910
that's hard.

3504
01:47:00,910 --> 01:47:01,743
The

3505
01:47:02,670 --> 01:47:04,630
they think they believe
that they're there.

3506
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:09,780
They're subjective interpretation
of data is objective because they.

3507
01:47:09,830 --> 01:47:11,320
Because the data's objective itself,

3508
01:47:11,330 --> 01:47:12,260
like Duplos do,

3509
01:47:12,270 --> 01:47:13,080
does he go for it?

3510
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,930
But that doesn't mean that when
you apply it to real world,

3511
01:47:16,420 --> 01:47:17,070
um,

3512
01:47:17,070 --> 01:47:17,940
that means that like,

3513
01:47:17,941 --> 01:47:21,310
I know a goat's milk is better than
cow's milk or something like that.

3514
01:47:21,420 --> 01:47:23,610
This is some random example,

3515
01:47:24,450 --> 01:47:29,450
but they might see that the actual raw
data as the proof of bias of their bias.

3516
01:47:31,091 --> 01:47:31,924
Yeah.

3517
01:47:33,420 --> 01:47:33,871
Yeah.

3518
01:47:33,871 --> 01:47:34,321
I'm here.

3519
01:47:34,321 --> 01:47:35,400
I've probably done it.

3520
01:47:35,520 --> 01:47:35,760
I mean,

3521
01:47:35,760 --> 01:47:40,760
I'm not that I'm not intelligent and
certainly not edgy and educated very well.

3522
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:43,140
So I think,

3523
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,850
I think everybody does even like,

3524
01:47:45,090 --> 01:47:45,810
you know.

3525
01:47:45,810 --> 01:47:47,060
Oh yeah,

3526
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:48,540
the most elegant of this.

3527
01:47:49,560 --> 01:47:49,981
Yeah.

3528
01:47:49,981 --> 01:47:50,311
I don't,

3529
01:47:50,311 --> 01:47:53,130
I don't know that biases by Caesar,

3530
01:47:54,870 --> 01:47:56,630
you're a

3531
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,250
can be eradicated.

3532
01:47:59,251 --> 01:48:00,760
IREC edible here

3533
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:04,353
can be.

3534
01:48:05,980 --> 01:48:09,670
I can renew it reconcilable
now that irreconcilable

3535
01:48:10,120 --> 01:48:11,950
you do eradicate,

3536
01:48:12,730 --> 01:48:13,563
eradicate.

3537
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:16,010
Is that your radical?

3538
01:48:16,340 --> 01:48:16,611
Yeah.

3539
01:48:16,611 --> 01:48:20,360
You're asking eradicable that
sounds good to me is a tough word.

3540
01:48:20,600 --> 01:48:21,080
Yeah.

3541
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:25,970
Well it shouldn't be unless
it was a fucked up language

3542
01:48:29,110 --> 01:48:30,470
is I think era era.

3543
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:31,110
And that's like,

3544
01:48:31,110 --> 01:48:31,430
uh,

3545
01:48:31,430 --> 01:48:31,710
the,

3546
01:48:31,710 --> 01:48:32,660
the uh,

3547
01:48:32,810 --> 01:48:36,380
the first part of that word is more of
a little Latin or Greek origin in the

3548
01:48:36,410 --> 01:48:38,030
second half of that word is not,

3549
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:39,850
it's like a dramatic origins.

3550
01:48:39,851 --> 01:48:40,684
So it's like,

3551
01:48:41,080 --> 01:48:43,970
it's almost a Portmanteau oh,

3552
01:48:43,971 --> 01:48:45,410
that's another thing I'm
really interested in too.

3553
01:48:45,411 --> 01:48:47,810
I'm interested in etymology
and like different languages.

3554
01:48:48,710 --> 01:48:49,400
Yeah.

3555
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,710
The origin of words.

3556
01:48:52,250 --> 01:48:53,083
Etymology.

3557
01:48:54,630 --> 01:48:54,901
Yeah.

3558
01:48:54,901 --> 01:48:56,610
Entomology is like the
origin of words and how,

3559
01:48:56,690 --> 01:48:58,080
how they're formed or the,

3560
01:48:58,130 --> 01:48:59,750
the how are they came to,

3561
01:48:59,940 --> 01:49:01,120
they came to be a,

3562
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:04,680
their origins and like other
languages and such like that.

3563
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:05,933
Yeah.

3564
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:07,003
Like a,

3565
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:09,990
like English is only like 10
percent norse for example,

3566
01:49:09,991 --> 01:49:11,550
like based off old norse languages,

3567
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:14,790
but like the words that we most
commonly use are all norse.

3568
01:49:15,570 --> 01:49:18,840
So like what are words or pronouns?

3569
01:49:18,841 --> 01:49:19,674
Most of the are,

3570
01:49:20,210 --> 01:49:21,043
um,

3571
01:49:21,740 --> 01:49:22,573
which I thought were

3572
01:49:23,440 --> 01:49:26,230
they say 50,000 of our
birds are French in origin.

3573
01:49:26,231 --> 01:49:30,380
But like that's just kind of a
stupid thing to say because I'm,

3574
01:49:31,210 --> 01:49:35,260
a lot of the endings are the same like
reception is of French origin work,

3575
01:49:35,270 --> 01:49:35,930
right?

3576
01:49:35,930 --> 01:49:38,500
So it's perception when a exception,

3577
01:49:38,501 --> 01:49:39,700
they're all French origin.

3578
01:49:40,090 --> 01:49:40,923
So,

3579
01:49:41,390 --> 01:49:41,890
I mean,

3580
01:49:41,890 --> 01:49:44,260
they're not words that we
use everyday or not everyday,

3581
01:49:44,261 --> 01:49:45,370
but in every sentence,

3582
01:49:45,640 --> 01:49:45,881
like,

3583
01:49:45,881 --> 01:49:49,720
although words are used in every or from
like the Nordic languages in Germanic

3584
01:49:49,721 --> 01:49:50,554
languages,

3585
01:49:52,900 --> 01:49:53,530
you know,

3586
01:49:53,530 --> 01:49:54,780
despite the fact that we're,

3587
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:56,710
we're still largely
influenced by the French,

3588
01:49:57,040 --> 01:49:59,470
the normans invading
England back in like 10,

3589
01:49:59,471 --> 01:50:00,304
66.

3590
01:50:02,890 --> 01:50:03,723
Yeah.

3591
01:50:05,110 --> 01:50:06,730
Lacking when it comes to history.

3592
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:08,920
I know one thing is,

3593
01:50:08,921 --> 01:50:09,754
uh,

3594
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:12,790
when I took German in high
school all four years,

3595
01:50:13,490 --> 01:50:14,323
uh,

3596
01:50:15,010 --> 01:50:15,843
I remember

3597
01:50:16,660 --> 01:50:17,710
my first year,

3598
01:50:18,790 --> 01:50:22,720
probably within the first couple
of weeks I thought to myself like,

3599
01:50:22,721 --> 01:50:23,021
man,

3600
01:50:23,021 --> 01:50:23,854
you didn't,

3601
01:50:24,700 --> 01:50:27,880
you didn't pick up
anything as far as like,

3602
01:50:28,250 --> 01:50:29,083
yeah,

3603
01:50:29,470 --> 01:50:33,850
you didn't pick up much as far as grammar
goes because I basically relearned

3604
01:50:35,830 --> 01:50:40,830
grammar in high school
through a foreign language.

3605
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:42,693
Like I.

3606
01:50:42,700 --> 01:50:43,330
Yeah.

3607
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:44,880
And it was weird.

3608
01:50:44,910 --> 01:50:45,160
Yeah,

3609
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:45,993
it was like,

3610
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:46,181
man,

3611
01:50:46,181 --> 01:50:49,870
I'm so dumb and I didn't pay
attention or for whatever the reason.

3612
01:50:50,290 --> 01:50:51,160
But no,

3613
01:50:51,570 --> 01:50:53,230
it's actually like the
philosophy that they,

3614
01:50:53,260 --> 01:50:54,190
how they teach English.

3615
01:50:54,250 --> 01:50:54,980
No.

3616
01:50:54,980 --> 01:50:55,720
Uh,

3617
01:50:55,720 --> 01:50:56,290
what your,

3618
01:50:56,290 --> 01:50:57,123
what your rebar?

3619
01:50:58,150 --> 01:50:58,983
80 seven.

3620
01:50:59,820 --> 01:51:00,341
[inaudible] 88.

3621
01:51:00,341 --> 01:51:01,340
So we're pretty much,

3622
01:51:01,360 --> 01:51:02,193
we're in the same era.

3623
01:51:02,380 --> 01:51:02,741
So,

3624
01:51:02,741 --> 01:51:03,400
uh,

3625
01:51:03,400 --> 01:51:07,840
but they did back in the nineties
or maybe it's the late eighties,

3626
01:51:08,110 --> 01:51:09,190
it started teaching English.

3627
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:10,060
They used to teach English,

3628
01:51:10,630 --> 01:51:11,590
German and French now,

3629
01:51:12,010 --> 01:51:15,820
and they decide to say English
has two artistic of a language.

3630
01:51:15,821 --> 01:51:18,190
So they don't want you
to learn inorganically.

3631
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,840
They want you to learn it like naturally.

3632
01:51:20,200 --> 01:51:21,430
So they took away all the,

3633
01:51:21,710 --> 01:51:22,543
all the pointless,

3634
01:51:23,410 --> 01:51:23,831
pointless,

3635
01:51:23,831 --> 01:51:27,130
but all the structural grammar stuff
like you learned in weight when you're

3636
01:51:27,220 --> 01:51:30,610
learning Spanish or French or
German because we learned French

3637
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:33,093
and Spanish.

3638
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:34,030
Uh,

3639
01:51:34,030 --> 01:51:34,331
but,

3640
01:51:34,331 --> 01:51:35,164
uh,

3641
01:51:36,160 --> 01:51:36,461
yeah,

3642
01:51:36,461 --> 01:51:40,000
I had to learn all that stuff again
in French and French is like at way

3643
01:51:40,001 --> 01:51:41,200
different language than German.

3644
01:51:41,350 --> 01:51:42,430
Like the way they structure it,

3645
01:51:43,180 --> 01:51:45,940
they don't use case cases
and such a big deal.

3646
01:51:46,540 --> 01:51:47,350
Um,

3647
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:48,970
so when I tried to learn an Icelandic,

3648
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,620
they have case just like in German,

3649
01:51:50,621 --> 01:51:51,454
then it's like,

3650
01:51:51,670 --> 01:51:53,890
it's like it's just as
complicated as the German one,

3651
01:51:54,370 --> 01:51:55,121
but we never,

3652
01:51:55,121 --> 01:51:56,280
we never think about that in English.

3653
01:51:56,290 --> 01:51:56,650
We just,

3654
01:51:56,650 --> 01:51:57,483
we just do it,

3655
01:51:57,520 --> 01:51:58,050
you know,

3656
01:51:58,050 --> 01:51:58,883
like you don't think,

3657
01:51:59,230 --> 01:52:01,450
you don't think about pushing the
gas pedal really when you're driving,

3658
01:52:01,451 --> 01:52:02,284
you just do it.

3659
01:52:02,460 --> 01:52:03,131
It's like that,

3660
01:52:03,131 --> 01:52:05,120
but in German it's like you,

3661
01:52:05,240 --> 01:52:06,130
you need to know that shit.

3662
01:52:06,131 --> 01:52:07,360
Otherwise you don't know
what the fuck are you doing?

3663
01:52:07,780 --> 01:52:08,141
Yeah.

3664
01:52:08,141 --> 01:52:08,620
You don't.

3665
01:52:08,620 --> 01:52:09,450
Yeah.

3666
01:52:09,450 --> 01:52:10,283
Uh,

3667
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:12,860
genitive dative.

3668
01:52:12,890 --> 01:52:15,550
Nominative accusative.

3669
01:52:15,600 --> 01:52:16,433
Yeah.

3670
01:52:16,910 --> 01:52:18,010
I'm forgetting all.

3671
01:52:18,011 --> 01:52:18,950
Would they finished?

3672
01:52:19,180 --> 01:52:19,630
Finished?

3673
01:52:19,630 --> 01:52:20,840
Has 14 cases.

3674
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:23,030
Well,

3675
01:52:23,030 --> 01:52:23,730
something like that.

3676
01:52:23,730 --> 01:52:24,563
Yeah.

3677
01:52:25,180 --> 01:52:25,720
I,

3678
01:52:25,720 --> 01:52:27,160
my whole thing was like,

3679
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:29,213
uh,

3680
01:52:30,520 --> 01:52:32,500
I don't think languages
are very hard to learn,

3681
01:52:33,550 --> 01:52:34,091
but then again,

3682
01:52:34,091 --> 01:52:35,140
I don't think anything's

3683
01:52:36,570 --> 01:52:38,180
necessarily difficult to learn this.

3684
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:42,130
You just put time and effort
and that's unused move.

3685
01:52:42,170 --> 01:52:42,961
If you never use it,

3686
01:52:42,961 --> 01:52:43,794
you lose it.

3687
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:44,581
Yeah.

3688
01:52:44,581 --> 01:52:45,860
That's like my brain.

3689
01:52:45,960 --> 01:52:46,930
I

3690
01:52:47,010 --> 01:52:50,350
kind of wonder sometimes about A.

3691
01:52:50,350 --> 01:52:51,590
I kind of wonder sometimes about,

3692
01:52:52,060 --> 01:52:52,340
you know,

3693
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:55,880
what people mean maybe because they
hadn't ever learned the language when they

3694
01:52:55,881 --> 01:52:56,714
were younger.

3695
01:52:56,870 --> 01:52:59,420
I'm like learning language.

3696
01:52:59,421 --> 01:53:00,770
I couldn't imagine doing that now.

3697
01:53:00,771 --> 01:53:01,640
Or people say that,

3698
01:53:01,641 --> 01:53:01,821
you know,

3699
01:53:01,821 --> 01:53:02,601
when you get older,

3700
01:53:02,601 --> 01:53:03,434
you know,

3701
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:09,540
I don't know how old or what people would
age people are necessarily referring

3702
01:53:09,541 --> 01:53:09,781
to,

3703
01:53:09,781 --> 01:53:11,120
but you know,

3704
01:53:11,970 --> 01:53:15,570
I guess I'm fortunate now that I think
even if I was to try and learn language

3705
01:53:15,571 --> 01:53:16,770
now I,

3706
01:53:17,020 --> 01:53:18,210
I still could manage.

3707
01:53:18,211 --> 01:53:19,170
It may not be as easy,

3708
01:53:19,171 --> 01:53:20,004
but

3709
01:53:22,040 --> 01:53:22,873
yeah.

3710
01:53:23,670 --> 01:53:23,870
Oh,

3711
01:53:23,870 --> 01:53:24,461
I think,

3712
01:53:24,461 --> 01:53:25,870
I think actually as I've gotten older,

3713
01:53:25,871 --> 01:53:26,470
I think I've,

3714
01:53:26,470 --> 01:53:28,120
I could probably learn it easier.

3715
01:53:28,210 --> 01:53:29,080
It's February,

3716
01:53:29,440 --> 01:53:30,730
I never got a chance to use it.

3717
01:53:31,210 --> 01:53:33,580
Like I can say some things and
a lot of different languages,

3718
01:53:33,581 --> 01:53:37,780
but like the fact that I speak basically
exclusively English and just a little

3719
01:53:37,781 --> 01:53:38,620
bit of Portuguese.

3720
01:53:39,280 --> 01:53:41,440
I'm a real shame because like,

3721
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:42,680
but that's the thing,

3722
01:53:42,680 --> 01:53:44,890
what if I started using
Portuguese all the time,

3723
01:53:44,891 --> 01:53:47,950
like I'm not going to use the Icelandic
and if I use Icelandic all the time,

3724
01:53:47,951 --> 01:53:49,300
not going to use the
Portuguese all the time,

3725
01:53:49,301 --> 01:53:50,290
so I'm going to lose something.

3726
01:53:50,530 --> 01:53:51,070
Yeah.

3727
01:53:51,070 --> 01:53:51,740
So I,

3728
01:53:51,740 --> 01:53:52,750
I just consider it like,

3729
01:53:52,751 --> 01:53:53,584
um,

3730
01:53:53,740 --> 01:53:57,120
something I just do just to be just a,

3731
01:53:57,550 --> 01:53:59,500
it kinda gives you a different
way of thinking too if you,

3732
01:53:59,501 --> 01:54:02,090
if you can learn a little bit about
another language and if you don't like

3733
01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:02,800
become,

3734
01:54:02,800 --> 01:54:03,730
if you can read a little bit,

3735
01:54:03,731 --> 01:54:04,564
that's good too.

3736
01:54:04,930 --> 01:54:06,220
I think it just gives me like a different,

3737
01:54:06,310 --> 01:54:07,143
another brain,

3738
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:07,401
you know,

3739
01:54:07,401 --> 01:54:07,770
you're,

3740
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:08,380
you're not,

3741
01:54:08,380 --> 01:54:09,940
you're certainly right about that.

3742
01:54:09,941 --> 01:54:10,774
I mean,

3743
01:54:11,030 --> 01:54:11,863
uh,

3744
01:54:13,270 --> 01:54:13,541
okay.

3745
01:54:13,541 --> 01:54:18,541
So I worked for a metal fabricator for
awhile who was from Poland and the way

3746
01:54:19,931 --> 01:54:24,040
that he would sometimes structure
sentences or say things like,

3747
01:54:25,260 --> 01:54:30,260
and I don't know exactly how they're help
Polish or whether it comes from or how

3748
01:54:30,371 --> 01:54:31,121
it's structured,

3749
01:54:31,121 --> 01:54:31,900
but I think,

3750
01:54:31,900 --> 01:54:34,810
I think you've been frozen
or quiet that I missed.

3751
01:54:34,811 --> 01:54:35,501
I missed the last,

3752
01:54:35,501 --> 01:54:36,190
like three,

3753
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:37,210
three or four seconds that.

3754
01:54:38,170 --> 01:54:39,003
Can you hear me now?

3755
01:54:39,580 --> 01:54:40,350
I can hear you now.

3756
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:41,890
Just say it went okay.

3757
01:54:42,160 --> 01:54:42,790
It went.

3758
01:54:42,790 --> 01:54:43,450
Yeah.

3759
01:54:43,450 --> 01:54:43,721
Yeah.

3760
01:54:43,721 --> 01:54:44,230
So,

3761
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:45,063
uh,

3762
01:54:45,590 --> 01:54:46,271
so yeah,

3763
01:54:46,271 --> 01:54:51,271
I think that in interacting with
people from foreign countries,

3764
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:52,270
uh,

3765
01:54:52,270 --> 01:54:55,750
that I've been able to understand
them better based off of

3766
01:54:57,330 --> 01:54:57,880
or.

3767
01:54:57,880 --> 01:54:58,190
Yeah,

3768
01:54:58,190 --> 01:55:00,420
for my learning of German.

3769
01:55:01,060 --> 01:55:01,893
Um,

3770
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:03,721
yeah,

3771
01:55:03,721 --> 01:55:04,554
I totally agree.

3772
01:55:04,770 --> 01:55:06,000
When you learn another language,

3773
01:55:06,001 --> 01:55:07,740
it provides a new perspective.

3774
01:55:08,120 --> 01:55:09,450
You think of thing,

3775
01:55:09,550 --> 01:55:11,670
you think things differently.

3776
01:55:12,390 --> 01:55:14,430
I mean these are all things that
I've thought about in the past,

3777
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:15,570
uh,

3778
01:55:15,570 --> 01:55:15,871
you know,

3779
01:55:15,871 --> 01:55:20,871
as pluses to having learned German and
it's got to be pluses of just learning

3780
01:55:21,270 --> 01:55:22,290
languages in general.

3781
01:55:23,500 --> 01:55:24,333
Yeah.

3782
01:55:28,100 --> 01:55:28,311
Yeah.

3783
01:55:28,311 --> 01:55:28,581
Like,

3784
01:55:28,581 --> 01:55:29,414
um,

3785
01:55:30,420 --> 01:55:30,960
uh,

3786
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:31,570
I think you,

3787
01:55:31,570 --> 01:55:32,241
are you still there?

3788
01:55:32,241 --> 01:55:33,210
I think I'm going to have.

3789
01:55:33,890 --> 01:55:34,071
Yeah,

3790
01:55:34,071 --> 01:55:34,904
I'm still here.

3791
01:55:35,110 --> 01:55:35,400
Okay,

3792
01:55:35,400 --> 01:55:36,233
just making sure,

3793
01:55:36,340 --> 01:55:37,173
um,

3794
01:55:38,150 --> 01:55:40,130
I think for me,

3795
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:43,320
like I went to Iceland so I was okay.

3796
01:55:43,321 --> 01:55:44,160
Well now

3797
01:55:44,590 --> 01:55:45,371
that made me interest.

3798
01:55:45,371 --> 01:55:45,661
I went to,

3799
01:55:45,661 --> 01:55:46,650
for all my first trip I went to,

3800
01:55:46,651 --> 01:55:49,470
I went to Russia and I tried to learn
some of the Russian language when I went

3801
01:55:49,471 --> 01:55:50,340
there I was a student,

3802
01:55:50,870 --> 01:55:51,490
uh,

3803
01:55:51,490 --> 01:55:53,490
I think it was like 17 and it was,

3804
01:55:53,600 --> 01:55:54,750
it was really awesome because like,

3805
01:55:54,751 --> 01:55:58,110
you've got to meet all these Russian
kid like kids my age and they really

3806
01:55:58,111 --> 01:55:59,480
appreciated the fact that I give,

3807
01:55:59,530 --> 01:56:00,050
uh,

3808
01:56:00,050 --> 01:56:00,881
gave her a whirl,

3809
01:56:00,881 --> 01:56:01,510
you know,

3810
01:56:01,510 --> 01:56:04,470
so like I worked so
hard on this one phrase,

3811
01:56:04,471 --> 01:56:05,790
I can actually still remember it.

3812
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,230
It's like I can say like,

3813
01:56:07,231 --> 01:56:08,550
do you understand Russian or,

3814
01:56:08,740 --> 01:56:09,573
or uh,

3815
01:56:09,920 --> 01:56:10,340
I,

3816
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:11,173
I can say,

3817
01:56:11,340 --> 01:56:14,850
do you understand Russian or I going to
say I understand Russia and then I get

3818
01:56:14,851 --> 01:56:17,300
to the negatives of those so
I don't understand Russian.

3819
01:56:18,380 --> 01:56:19,213
And so,

3820
01:56:19,290 --> 01:56:21,270
but I really worked on those.

3821
01:56:21,271 --> 01:56:21,621
So I,

3822
01:56:21,621 --> 01:56:23,490
I still remember him
today and I'm like 30.

3823
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:25,830
So 13 years later I still haven't had.

3824
01:56:26,160 --> 01:56:26,840
Um,

3825
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:27,960
and then Icelandic,

3826
01:56:27,961 --> 01:56:30,150
I learned a bunch of different phrases,

3827
01:56:30,270 --> 01:56:33,420
but the weird thing is when you're trying
to learn language on your own is like

3828
01:56:33,421 --> 01:56:34,050
the sound,

3829
01:56:34,050 --> 01:56:36,990
you always have the sound off because
you don't have any way to bounce it off

3830
01:56:36,991 --> 01:56:37,800
of.

3831
01:56:37,800 --> 01:56:40,740
So when I got there I was trying
to tell them where we're at,

3832
01:56:40,741 --> 01:56:42,780
my hotel or hotel,

3833
01:56:42,781 --> 01:56:43,200
but like,

3834
01:56:43,200 --> 01:56:45,480
like an airbnb or whatever it was.

3835
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:46,913
And uh,

3836
01:56:47,460 --> 01:56:49,460
I was saying like loud good deller,

3837
01:56:49,710 --> 01:56:50,543
which is like,

3838
01:56:51,020 --> 01:56:54,160
that's Nice logo there and uh,

3839
01:56:54,270 --> 01:56:55,103
that's how you say it.

3840
01:56:55,200 --> 01:56:55,800
So,

3841
01:56:55,800 --> 01:56:56,310
but,

3842
01:56:56,310 --> 01:56:56,910
but the,

3843
01:56:56,910 --> 01:57:00,270
it was interesting for me because
in English it's like very simple.

3844
01:57:00,271 --> 01:57:02,460
Like the pronunciation for
me is like really easy.

3845
01:57:02,461 --> 01:57:03,960
Even if someone has a different accent,

3846
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:05,130
I could understand what you're saying.

3847
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:05,970
Yeah.

3848
01:57:05,970 --> 01:57:07,140
But for this guy,

3849
01:57:07,141 --> 01:57:08,760
because it's a totally different language,

3850
01:57:08,820 --> 01:57:12,720
I don't know what the different accents
are and he doesn't know what my accent

3851
01:57:12,721 --> 01:57:13,554
is really.

3852
01:57:13,590 --> 01:57:16,270
So I have to say it like
15 different ways to.

3853
01:57:16,280 --> 01:57:16,620
He's like,

3854
01:57:16,620 --> 01:57:17,453
oh,

3855
01:57:17,700 --> 01:57:18,420
lower there.

3856
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:18,901
And then I'm like,

3857
01:57:18,901 --> 01:57:19,291
okay.

3858
01:57:19,291 --> 01:57:24,291
So it just was unexpected things
to happen with the colloquialisms.

3859
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:27,480
Yeah.

3860
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:28,800
So if anybody wants to know how to say,

3861
01:57:28,801 --> 01:57:29,240
uh,

3862
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:29,610
uh,

3863
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:31,790
I understand Russian and Russian,

3864
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:33,180
you say you have putting me up.

3865
01:57:33,330 --> 01:57:33,550
Yup.

3866
01:57:33,550 --> 01:57:37,510
One Mile public want to say I don't
understand Russian is young attorney of

3867
01:57:37,511 --> 01:57:40,860
myopathy skew and say.

3868
01:57:40,940 --> 01:57:43,780
Do you understand Russian has
been funding mates it school.

3869
01:57:44,220 --> 01:57:45,620
If you say you don't understand Russian,

3870
01:57:45,630 --> 01:57:47,640
we say when the Aponte mice you posted.

3871
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:50,650
So no bravo.

3872
01:57:50,670 --> 01:57:51,540
Learn something new

3873
01:57:54,320 --> 01:57:55,950
on the pod podcast.

3874
01:57:58,450 --> 01:57:58,970
Yeah,

3875
01:57:58,970 --> 01:57:59,803
it's pretty cool.

3876
01:57:59,940 --> 01:58:00,320
But yeah,

3877
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,050
Iceland,

3878
01:58:01,050 --> 01:58:01,471
Iceland,

3879
01:58:01,471 --> 01:58:01,721
exit.

3880
01:58:01,721 --> 01:58:05,160
Cool language to originally the
vikings apparently would just like,

3881
01:58:05,880 --> 01:58:06,870
there was no word order.

3882
01:58:06,871 --> 01:58:11,040
I guess there was no official word order
so you could say it like as long as you

3883
01:58:11,041 --> 01:58:12,480
have the words in the right case,

3884
01:58:12,481 --> 01:58:14,760
you could say you could
say the sentence any way,

3885
01:58:14,820 --> 01:58:18,180
which I guess helped when they
were writing like poetry and stuff.

3886
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:19,693
Um,

3887
01:58:20,460 --> 01:58:21,293
but

3888
01:58:22,100 --> 01:58:22,840
so I could take,

3889
01:58:22,840 --> 01:58:24,100
I could say a couple things and I sign it.

3890
01:58:24,101 --> 01:58:25,870
I just can't think of
something to say right now.

3891
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:27,630
I'm like,

3892
01:58:27,650 --> 01:58:28,290
it's a big.

3893
01:58:28,290 --> 01:58:29,620
If I could say my name is.

3894
01:58:29,621 --> 01:58:29,920
So is he.

3895
01:58:29,920 --> 01:58:30,753
If Haiti,

3896
01:58:31,080 --> 01:58:32,050
if Haiti liquid,

3897
01:58:32,160 --> 01:58:32,993
you know,

3898
01:58:33,010 --> 01:58:33,810
or uh,

3899
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:34,360
uh,

3900
01:58:34,360 --> 01:58:35,620
go on to say what's your name?

3901
01:58:35,630 --> 01:58:38,040
It's a native food.

3902
01:58:38,310 --> 01:58:39,143
What are you called?

3903
01:58:41,630 --> 01:58:42,100
Both,

3904
01:58:42,100 --> 01:58:45,490
but I think it was English is so
close to Atlanta because like through,

3905
01:58:45,520 --> 01:58:45,880
right.

3906
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:48,520
That's for us the you a success,

3907
01:58:48,660 --> 01:58:51,600
the second person a single and if,

3908
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:52,690
if it's English.

3909
01:58:52,691 --> 01:58:53,500
So you would say though,

3910
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:53,800
right?

3911
01:58:53,800 --> 01:58:55,380
That's what the original one was out.

3912
01:58:55,630 --> 01:58:59,260
So that one through or visit the same
word and you can find once you know that

3913
01:58:59,261 --> 01:59:00,250
there's all these cognates,

3914
01:59:00,251 --> 01:59:02,050
it's like way easier
to learn that language.

3915
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:06,340
It's very hard to pronounce a lot of the
words because sometimes the words are

3916
01:59:06,341 --> 01:59:07,390
like German where that's like,

3917
01:59:07,450 --> 01:59:08,050
you know,

3918
01:59:08,050 --> 01:59:09,340
16 characters long.

3919
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:10,510
But uh,

3920
01:59:10,510 --> 01:59:10,750
you know,

3921
01:59:10,750 --> 01:59:11,590
eventually figured out what.

3922
01:59:11,591 --> 01:59:13,510
That's just a bunch of
compound words put together.

3923
01:59:14,220 --> 01:59:15,053
Yeah,

3924
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:16,080
yeah,

3925
01:59:16,080 --> 01:59:16,240
yeah.

3926
01:59:16,240 --> 01:59:17,440
German borrows from

3927
01:59:19,000 --> 01:59:20,500
Spanish French.

3928
01:59:22,810 --> 01:59:23,081
Sorry,

3929
01:59:23,081 --> 01:59:23,914
I missed that.

3930
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:27,580
German has words that borrowed
from Spanish and French.

3931
01:59:29,500 --> 01:59:29,890
Oh yeah,

3932
01:59:29,890 --> 01:59:30,723
for sure.

3933
01:59:30,900 --> 01:59:31,733
Right.

3934
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:33,871
Actually,

3935
01:59:33,871 --> 01:59:34,200
I tried,

3936
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:37,560
I tried to learn German while
when I was a kid because my dad's,

3937
01:59:37,620 --> 01:59:40,440
one of my dad's girlfriends
was Germanic and origin.

3938
01:59:40,600 --> 01:59:42,270
She was from like West Germany.

3939
01:59:43,010 --> 01:59:43,843
Um,

3940
01:59:44,790 --> 01:59:45,031
but,

3941
01:59:45,031 --> 01:59:45,540
uh,

3942
01:59:45,540 --> 01:59:46,320
I can't remember.

3943
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,690
I can't remember much else.

3944
01:59:47,700 --> 01:59:49,140
I was like 11 or something.

3945
01:59:49,141 --> 01:59:52,020
So I've been really absorb it very well.

3946
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:54,061
Yeah,

3947
01:59:54,061 --> 01:59:54,271
I,

3948
01:59:54,271 --> 01:59:54,480
I,

3949
01:59:54,480 --> 01:59:55,313
uh,

3950
01:59:55,710 --> 01:59:56,690
so uh,

3951
01:59:57,870 --> 02:00:01,440
I always found it interesting like a,

3952
02:00:02,070 --> 02:00:04,020
if you're from northern Germany,

3953
02:00:04,510 --> 02:00:05,200
you know,

3954
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:09,170
more posture and it
would be like your eyes,

3955
02:00:09,870 --> 02:00:11,100
like if you were to say a

3956
02:00:13,490 --> 02:00:13,790
like,

3957
02:00:13,790 --> 02:00:14,910
I am German,

3958
02:00:14,920 --> 02:00:15,753
isn't it?

3959
02:00:15,980 --> 02:00:16,701
If you're north,

3960
02:00:16,701 --> 02:00:17,610
Jeremy is eat,

3961
02:00:18,480 --> 02:00:18,980
eat,

3962
02:00:18,980 --> 02:00:19,813
eat,

3963
02:00:19,820 --> 02:00:20,653
eat,

3964
02:00:20,750 --> 02:00:22,770
and it fits in South Carolina itch.

3965
02:00:24,160 --> 02:00:24,510
Uh,

3966
02:00:24,510 --> 02:00:25,290
so you got time.

3967
02:00:25,290 --> 02:00:26,130
You can kind of tell,

3968
02:00:26,180 --> 02:00:31,180
you know where a person's from based off
of how they just say their eye or you

3969
02:00:32,081 --> 02:00:32,190
know,

3970
02:00:32,190 --> 02:00:32,510
c,

3971
02:00:32,510 --> 02:00:32,811
c,

3972
02:00:32,811 --> 02:00:33,190
h,

3973
02:00:33,190 --> 02:00:34,023
you know.

3974
02:00:34,040 --> 02:00:34,640
Yeah.

3975
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:34,810
Yeah.

3976
02:00:34,810 --> 02:00:35,490
That's an issue.

3977
02:00:35,490 --> 02:00:36,030
It's if,

3978
02:00:36,030 --> 02:00:38,900
if it had been or if,

3979
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:39,973
if,

3980
02:00:40,320 --> 02:00:41,420
if an unbeliever.

3981
02:00:42,060 --> 02:00:42,893
Yeah.

3982
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:47,763
Yeah.

3983
02:00:49,190 --> 02:00:49,311
Oh,

3984
02:00:49,311 --> 02:00:53,660
so I didn't get notifications
for dose of truth and Youtube,

3985
02:00:53,930 --> 02:00:54,763
son of a bitch.

3986
02:00:55,490 --> 02:00:58,730
I kind of wished that I would
in my third year German,

3987
02:00:58,760 --> 02:01:01,400
my junior year we were,

3988
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:04,760
our final was to create a,

3989
02:01:06,520 --> 02:01:08,140
because we were reading the brothers

3990
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,953
grim.

3991
02:01:11,570 --> 02:01:11,971
Oh really?

3992
02:01:11,971 --> 02:01:14,540
You're reading the
brothers Karamazov no care.

3993
02:01:14,600 --> 02:01:14,930
Uh,

3994
02:01:14,930 --> 02:01:19,360
the brothers Grimm fairytales
that the groups were,

3995
02:01:19,370 --> 02:01:21,110
all the fairytales
actually originated from,

3996
02:01:21,111 --> 02:01:26,111
from the graphic gruesome tales
that were told to the grim grim.

3997
02:01:28,041 --> 02:01:28,730
They like,

3998
02:01:28,730 --> 02:01:31,610
they wanted them down too because they
were even more gruesome than they wrote.

3999
02:01:32,240 --> 02:01:33,020
Yeah.

4000
02:01:33,020 --> 02:01:33,853
And uh,

4001
02:01:34,700 --> 02:01:36,920
so yeah,

4002
02:01:36,921 --> 02:01:39,140
so our thing was we'll create a fairytale.

4003
02:01:39,230 --> 02:01:40,160
It doesn't matter.

4004
02:01:40,640 --> 02:01:45,260
You can make it as graphic as you want
and I can't remember what I made mine,

4005
02:01:45,261 --> 02:01:50,261
but I wish I still had that so I
could know so I could bring that up.

4006
02:01:51,831 --> 02:01:52,161
But.

4007
02:01:52,161 --> 02:01:55,310
So sometimes I try and remember words or

4008
02:01:57,250 --> 02:01:57,460
you know,

4009
02:01:57,460 --> 02:01:57,920
I'm not,

4010
02:01:57,920 --> 02:01:58,640
I can't,

4011
02:01:58,640 --> 02:02:00,140
as far as the grammar goes,

4012
02:02:01,310 --> 02:02:05,390
now I would have a hard time remembering,

4013
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:06,171
but it was like,

4014
02:02:06,171 --> 02:02:07,004
um,

4015
02:02:09,130 --> 02:02:09,963
like

4016
02:02:11,030 --> 02:02:12,170
the window is black.

4017
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:13,633
Uh,

4018
02:02:13,990 --> 02:02:17,660
the window is a feminine defense.

4019
02:02:17,661 --> 02:02:21,020
The defensive shots don't know.

4020
02:02:21,140 --> 02:02:23,210
There's just like people,

4021
02:02:23,211 --> 02:02:27,620
like you have to kind of say something
like asked me how to say a sentence and

4022
02:02:27,621 --> 02:02:28,050
maybe,

4023
02:02:28,050 --> 02:02:28,490
you know,

4024
02:02:28,490 --> 02:02:30,440
I'm just coming up with
things off the top of my head.

4025
02:02:30,441 --> 02:02:31,820
Don't work that well.

4026
02:02:32,650 --> 02:02:34,400
I'm Canadian and I ride on a boat.

4027
02:02:34,710 --> 02:02:35,543
Uh,

4028
02:02:40,480 --> 02:02:43,290
soup is to train a

4029
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:46,011
boat,

4030
02:02:46,011 --> 02:02:51,011
is a skip or shift been als Canada wound

4031
02:02:54,440 --> 02:02:57,020
each have an end and I wrote on a boat

4032
02:02:58,570 --> 02:02:59,403
or I.

4033
02:03:00,130 --> 02:03:00,620
well,

4034
02:03:00,620 --> 02:03:02,120
I wrote it down.

4035
02:03:02,450 --> 02:03:03,283
Yeah,

4036
02:03:03,590 --> 02:03:05,990
you should have an I'm each Hubba.

4037
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:07,460
I'm on nine

4038
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:09,413
boat.

4039
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:10,870
Uh,

4040
02:03:12,580 --> 02:03:15,220
what would be the past for a,

4041
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:19,260
you're a

4042
02:03:19,990 --> 02:03:21,920
good riding sacred,

4043
02:03:21,921 --> 02:03:22,350
right?

4044
02:03:22,350 --> 02:03:22,660
Yeah.

4045
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:23,130
Good ride.

4046
02:03:23,130 --> 02:03:25,650
And even then it's not a verb

4047
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:30,341
isn't past tense.

4048
02:03:30,341 --> 02:03:30,820
I was like,

4049
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:31,231
uh,

4050
02:03:31,231 --> 02:03:33,880
then then the verb and then
Ian or something like that.

4051
02:03:33,940 --> 02:03:34,121
Well,

4052
02:03:34,121 --> 02:03:35,010
it's a,

4053
02:03:37,020 --> 02:03:37,853
I think we'd be like,

4054
02:03:37,980 --> 02:03:38,980
have a on.

4055
02:03:38,990 --> 02:03:39,821
I'm something.

4056
02:03:39,821 --> 02:03:41,300
Something good,

4057
02:03:41,750 --> 02:03:43,090
get in the verb,

4058
02:03:43,120 --> 02:03:43,953
gift far and,

4059
02:03:44,080 --> 02:03:44,910
or,

4060
02:03:44,910 --> 02:03:45,743
uh,

4061
02:03:46,230 --> 02:03:49,370
give live in or a need or a

4062
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:52,053
uh,

4063
02:03:53,820 --> 02:03:54,181
yeah,

4064
02:03:54,181 --> 02:03:58,530
it always comes at the end of the gift
slash verb always comes at the end when

4065
02:03:58,531 --> 02:04:03,210
you were asking or when you're talking
about past participle or past tense shit.

4066
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:03,451
Yeah.

4067
02:04:03,451 --> 02:04:04,284
Past tense.

4068
02:04:04,780 --> 02:04:05,470
Yeah.

4069
02:04:05,470 --> 02:04:05,551
Yeah,

4070
02:04:05,551 --> 02:04:06,384
that makes sense.

4071
02:04:07,510 --> 02:04:08,343
Uh,

4072
02:04:09,620 --> 02:04:10,280
yeah.

4073
02:04:10,280 --> 02:04:14,090
I was good at at one
time and I spoke it well.

4074
02:04:14,091 --> 02:04:14,361
Do.

4075
02:04:14,361 --> 02:04:15,194
But

4076
02:04:16,130 --> 02:04:16,760
man,

4077
02:04:16,760 --> 02:04:17,670
it's so,

4078
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:21,460
it's worthwhile looking into once in a
while I'll just refresh your mind to it.

4079
02:04:21,560 --> 02:04:22,393
I think it kind of,

4080
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:24,320
it keeps your brain thinking.

4081
02:04:25,300 --> 02:04:26,133
Yeah.

4082
02:04:27,100 --> 02:04:28,070
I'm not going to ever hurt,

4083
02:04:28,071 --> 02:04:28,904
right?

4084
02:04:29,380 --> 02:04:29,730
No,

4085
02:04:29,730 --> 02:04:30,563
it can.

4086
02:04:32,340 --> 02:04:33,200
You don't do it enough.

4087
02:04:33,201 --> 02:04:33,520
Yeah.

4088
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:34,353
Can hurt.

4089
02:04:36,200 --> 02:04:37,110
It can hurt a little bit.

4090
02:04:37,111 --> 02:04:37,944
Yeah.

4091
02:04:39,350 --> 02:04:39,780
No,

4092
02:04:39,780 --> 02:04:40,250
but you're right.

4093
02:04:40,250 --> 02:04:40,710
It,

4094
02:04:40,710 --> 02:04:43,650
we can never hurt to keep learning.

4095
02:04:43,780 --> 02:04:44,613
Um,

4096
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:48,513
yeah.

4097
02:04:50,790 --> 02:04:51,050
Okay.

4098
02:04:51,050 --> 02:04:53,870
So I could bring up the number of the
idea I was talking about yesterday about

4099
02:04:54,070 --> 02:04:54,270
the,

4100
02:04:54,270 --> 02:04:54,561
uh,

4101
02:04:54,561 --> 02:04:59,561
a resentment towards people with
massive wealth and the isn't,

4102
02:05:00,780 --> 02:05:03,310
it's not something I wrote about it,

4103
02:05:03,311 --> 02:05:04,960
but I just want to make sure it's a.

4104
02:05:05,870 --> 02:05:06,270
okay.

4105
02:05:06,270 --> 02:05:07,700
I'll just read it from the start.

4106
02:05:08,160 --> 02:05:09,140
There's a snobbery long.

4107
02:05:09,650 --> 02:05:10,483
Um,

4108
02:05:11,090 --> 02:05:11,691
so everybody,

4109
02:05:11,691 --> 02:05:12,770
this is just an idea that like,

4110
02:05:12,771 --> 02:05:15,680
resentment towards people
that hold a massive wealth,

4111
02:05:16,050 --> 02:05:16,883
uh,

4112
02:05:17,390 --> 02:05:19,170
the people that are mad
that rich people are,

4113
02:05:19,390 --> 02:05:19,760
they are,

4114
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:20,593
they got nothing.

4115
02:05:20,900 --> 02:05:21,441
Fair enough.

4116
02:05:21,441 --> 02:05:22,280
I understand that.

4117
02:05:22,281 --> 02:05:24,980
But here's something I
wrote about that idea.

4118
02:05:25,850 --> 02:05:28,610
Let's think about some guy
who has made something useful.

4119
02:05:28,850 --> 02:05:29,683
If you want to give me,

4120
02:05:29,780 --> 02:05:30,860
if you want an example,

4121
02:05:31,440 --> 02:05:32,850
I'll use sit,

4122
02:05:32,870 --> 02:05:35,400
say Bill Gates because it's easy now.

4123
02:05:35,401 --> 02:05:37,730
A bill didn't really do a whole
lot according to the cynics,

4124
02:05:37,731 --> 02:05:42,020
but as well with a his boss would
show otherwise for what it's worth.

4125
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:46,100
He revolutionized personal computing even
though he just reebok's other people's

4126
02:05:46,101 --> 02:05:46,934
shit together.

4127
02:05:47,150 --> 02:05:48,280
Built becomes a billionaire,

4128
02:05:48,290 --> 02:05:48,441
blah,

4129
02:05:48,441 --> 02:05:48,561
blah,

4130
02:05:48,561 --> 02:05:48,980
blah,

4131
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:49,880
and here we are today.

4132
02:05:50,660 --> 02:05:54,290
Why was he allowed to accumulate all
that wealth so much wealth in fact,

4133
02:05:54,350 --> 02:05:58,670
that it'd be impossible for him to spend
it in his lifetime and his own anyways,

4134
02:05:58,730 --> 02:06:00,440
that seems unfair and it maybe it is,

4135
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:06,140
but he was the one who was
initially rewarded for this
innovation over the whole

4136
02:06:06,141 --> 02:06:06,561
society,

4137
02:06:06,561 --> 02:06:09,470
benefits from his innovation
regardless and over time,

4138
02:06:09,471 --> 02:06:12,380
the entirety of his wealth and
return to the entirety of society.

4139
02:06:12,890 --> 02:06:15,560
Eighty percent of inherited wealth
is gone by the third generation.

4140
02:06:15,940 --> 02:06:16,970
It could be up to 90 percent,

4141
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:22,100
so now with the amount of relative
freedom compared to the past,

4142
02:06:22,130 --> 02:06:25,900
we can see a huge gap between
the richest and the rest below,

4143
02:06:26,200 --> 02:06:29,480
but all those rich people have created
their fortunes by developing new ideas

4144
02:06:29,481 --> 02:06:30,590
and tools and whatnot.

4145
02:06:31,190 --> 02:06:35,090
That's the infrastructure over time that
just becomes part of everyone's living

4146
02:06:35,091 --> 02:06:35,924
standards.

4147
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:37,460
And so and so,

4148
02:06:37,461 --> 02:06:39,110
they rise in totality over time.

4149
02:06:39,650 --> 02:06:40,310
However,

4150
02:06:40,310 --> 02:06:41,450
there is a delay issue.

4151
02:06:41,870 --> 02:06:46,040
It takes a few generations for
that totality to accumulate
in the bottom portion

4152
02:06:46,130 --> 02:06:47,570
of wealth distribution.

4153
02:06:48,860 --> 02:06:49,790
A good example,

4154
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:53,380
another one might be Isaac
Newton's Principia Mathematica,

4155
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:57,890
no one you or I know is making
money off of that information,

4156
02:06:57,980 --> 02:07:02,450
which is just book he wrote on physics
because it was so long ago that the

4157
02:07:02,451 --> 02:07:05,300
knowledge has become part of the
overall societal infrastructure.

4158
02:07:06,140 --> 02:07:08,240
So when we're speaking
of wealth redistribution,

4159
02:07:08,780 --> 02:07:11,570
we're really speaking about doing a boat,

4160
02:07:11,571 --> 02:07:14,360
doing so about doing so more quickly,

4161
02:07:15,310 --> 02:07:16,610
but that creates a huge problem.

4162
02:07:17,060 --> 02:07:18,380
By doing so more quickly,

4163
02:07:18,410 --> 02:07:21,440
you might end up removing that
incentive to do things at all.

4164
02:07:21,920 --> 02:07:22,221
You might,

4165
02:07:22,221 --> 02:07:22,881
for example,

4166
02:07:22,881 --> 02:07:25,580
see the lack of development
in places like the SSR,

4167
02:07:26,180 --> 02:07:29,660
which really began to lag behind
the west quite dramatically.

4168
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,480
If we removed the ice,

4169
02:07:31,660 --> 02:07:32,510
that incentive,

4170
02:07:33,140 --> 02:07:34,820
which if you look at it generationally,

4171
02:07:35,480 --> 02:07:36,313
uh,

4172
02:07:38,710 --> 02:07:40,210
is a very low price to pay,

4173
02:07:40,730 --> 02:07:44,200
we might end up removing the increase
in living standards over time,

4174
02:07:44,350 --> 02:07:47,950
which of course will only be harvested
fully after three generations,

4175
02:07:48,910 --> 02:07:49,690
three generations.

4176
02:07:49,690 --> 02:07:53,650
Which if you remember approximately
how long the ceasar lasted.

4177
02:07:54,110 --> 02:07:54,550
That was,

4178
02:07:54,550 --> 02:07:55,361
that was the end of that one.

4179
02:07:55,361 --> 02:07:56,560
I have nothing else.

4180
02:07:56,830 --> 02:07:57,420
Yeah.

4181
02:07:57,420 --> 02:07:57,710
What do you,

4182
02:07:57,710 --> 02:07:58,543
what do you think of that?

4183
02:07:59,400 --> 02:07:59,731
Yeah,

4184
02:07:59,731 --> 02:08:00,120
I,

4185
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:01,980
I find it more interesting that you type.

4186
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:02,850
I mean,

4187
02:08:02,850 --> 02:08:03,111
you,

4188
02:08:03,111 --> 02:08:04,590
you kind of talked about it yet,

4189
02:08:04,610 --> 02:08:04,890
you,

4190
02:08:04,890 --> 02:08:06,270
you did mention it yesterday.

4191
02:08:06,690 --> 02:08:07,523
Uh,

4192
02:08:07,890 --> 02:08:08,723
the,

4193
02:08:09,450 --> 02:08:10,470
the idea that,

4194
02:08:10,620 --> 02:08:11,453
you know,

4195
02:08:11,610 --> 02:08:15,530
you have someone that comes
from someplace or you know,

4196
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:16,920
wealth is generated,

4197
02:08:17,660 --> 02:08:17,870
you know,

4198
02:08:17,870 --> 02:08:18,180
you have

4199
02:08:18,180 --> 02:08:19,440
migrants that come over,

4200
02:08:19,470 --> 02:08:20,490
they work hard,

4201
02:08:21,050 --> 02:08:21,450
you know,

4202
02:08:21,450 --> 02:08:23,610
typically three generations down the line,

4203
02:08:23,611 --> 02:08:24,391
wealth is lost.

4204
02:08:24,391 --> 02:08:28,680
I was only applying that to a immigrants,

4205
02:08:28,681 --> 02:08:29,100
but I,

4206
02:08:29,100 --> 02:08:29,731
but you know,

4207
02:08:29,731 --> 02:08:34,731
you helped me realize that that's a.

4208
02:08:35,280 --> 02:08:36,570
am I right in thinking that that's,

4209
02:08:36,670 --> 02:08:39,190
it's true across the board
that typically when a,

4210
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:42,010
when wealth is created
within three generations,

4211
02:08:42,011 --> 02:08:42,844
it's lost.

4212
02:08:43,320 --> 02:08:45,220
Like just doesn't have to be an immigrant.

4213
02:08:46,460 --> 02:08:47,293
Yeah.

4214
02:08:48,160 --> 02:08:49,390
So I didn't know that.

4215
02:08:49,600 --> 02:08:50,080
Um,

4216
02:08:50,080 --> 02:08:50,913
so,

4217
02:08:51,460 --> 02:08:52,293
you know,

4218
02:08:52,300 --> 02:08:53,140
when you mentioned,

4219
02:08:53,550 --> 02:08:54,383
uh,

4220
02:08:55,230 --> 02:08:55,540
you know,

4221
02:08:55,540 --> 02:08:57,760
Russia's a,

4222
02:08:57,820 --> 02:08:58,900
the USSR,

4223
02:08:59,410 --> 02:08:59,800
you know,

4224
02:08:59,800 --> 02:09:00,633
falling,

4225
02:09:01,310 --> 02:09:02,143
you know,

4226
02:09:03,070 --> 02:09:03,281
yeah.

4227
02:09:03,281 --> 02:09:03,521
Their,

4228
02:09:03,521 --> 02:09:03,791
their,

4229
02:09:03,791 --> 02:09:07,180
their economy was the size of
California in the 19 eighties.

4230
02:09:07,850 --> 02:09:09,370
That was before the tech boom and stuff.

4231
02:09:09,371 --> 02:09:12,910
And then even now Russia's economy
is the size of a New York state,

4232
02:09:14,290 --> 02:09:16,660
which is quite dramatically
different than the USA

4233
02:09:18,160 --> 02:09:22,030
and that they only lasted
for about three generations.

4234
02:09:23,050 --> 02:09:26,020
Meaning that the meaning that they will

4235
02:09:26,090 --> 02:09:30,200
probably a feasting on the wealth that

4236
02:09:30,550 --> 02:09:31,383
had been,

4237
02:09:32,990 --> 02:09:33,200
you know,

4238
02:09:33,200 --> 02:09:34,310
previously created

4239
02:09:36,750 --> 02:09:41,750
as a new scenario in a creation myth
where the Anunnaki feast upon the body of

4240
02:09:42,321 --> 02:09:43,154
absolute.

4241
02:09:43,210 --> 02:09:43,850
Yeah.

4242
02:09:43,850 --> 02:09:44,683
That was interesting.

4243
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:46,520
Yeah.

4244
02:09:46,520 --> 02:09:48,410
It can't be done in perpetuity because,

4245
02:09:48,770 --> 02:09:49,270
uh,

4246
02:09:49,270 --> 02:09:51,680
and this is obviously from Peterson
because he talks about this,

4247
02:09:52,400 --> 02:09:53,233
but um,

4248
02:09:53,300 --> 02:09:55,820
so if people are familiar,

4249
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:59,800
a Marta is the one who
eventually overcomes time at.

4250
02:09:59,810 --> 02:10:03,830
But in the beginning there's absolute
and time at and the children and they're

4251
02:10:03,831 --> 02:10:08,831
called the Anunnaki and they kill a
absolute of boredom and feast upon his

4252
02:10:12,080 --> 02:10:13,370
corpse and party and stuff.

4253
02:10:13,371 --> 02:10:15,820
And that pisses off time at obviously,

4254
02:10:15,830 --> 02:10:16,521
and then you know,

4255
02:10:16,521 --> 02:10:17,354
the story,

4256
02:10:18,020 --> 02:10:22,190
eventually they come to the trend defeat
time and the only one that eventually

4257
02:10:22,191 --> 02:10:26,030
does is martech and he creates
the world out of her pieces,

4258
02:10:26,031 --> 02:10:27,380
which is a story,

4259
02:10:27,700 --> 02:10:28,533
uh,

4260
02:10:28,750 --> 02:10:29,583
renewal.

4261
02:10:29,930 --> 02:10:33,050
And one thing we see with the baby boomer,

4262
02:10:33,090 --> 02:10:34,640
maybe not all baby boomers,

4263
02:10:35,660 --> 02:10:37,370
baby boomers and millennials,

4264
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:40,570
is they want to feast upon
the corpse of absolute buy in.

4265
02:10:40,650 --> 02:10:43,940
And they symbolize this through
the idea of eating the rich.

4266
02:10:44,000 --> 02:10:46,400
And this is often seen
in communist ideals.

4267
02:10:47,060 --> 02:10:51,190
And the problem with it is that you end
up at the same issue in this scenario

4268
02:10:51,210 --> 02:10:53,570
mythology where if you

4269
02:10:55,710 --> 02:10:57,800
try to feast upon what exists now,

4270
02:10:57,830 --> 02:11:00,650
you'll eventually run out and then
you won't have innovated and in your

4271
02:11:00,651 --> 02:11:02,930
solutions to your problem of starvation.

4272
02:11:03,450 --> 02:11:04,283
Um,

4273
02:11:04,530 --> 02:11:05,363
no

4274
02:11:06,490 --> 02:11:08,720
a metaphor that one,

4275
02:11:09,080 --> 02:11:09,351
but,

4276
02:11:09,351 --> 02:11:09,770
uh,

4277
02:11:09,770 --> 02:11:13,310
you end up at the same problem that the
Anunnaki came work we're going to face,

4278
02:11:13,311 --> 02:11:15,410
which was the chaos dragon,

4279
02:11:16,340 --> 02:11:20,170
which is symbolized by tying
that in the scenario and myth.

4280
02:11:20,670 --> 02:11:21,440
Um,

4281
02:11:21,440 --> 02:11:26,420
so what is wrong is they
try to feast upon the,

4282
02:11:26,421 --> 02:11:27,254
uh,

4283
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:28,220
that.

4284
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:29,053
Well,

4285
02:11:29,490 --> 02:11:33,580
I guess there's ours and that wealth
dependency runs out at for some time.

4286
02:11:33,610 --> 02:11:34,770
The USSR did grow,

4287
02:11:34,771 --> 02:11:37,200
but they're not at the
pace of the USA then.

4288
02:11:37,620 --> 02:11:37,891
Sorry,

4289
02:11:37,891 --> 02:11:38,724
go ahead.

4290
02:11:39,490 --> 02:11:39,641
No,

4291
02:11:39,641 --> 02:11:40,520
I was going to ask you,

4292
02:11:40,550 --> 02:11:42,490
why do you think that that's.

4293
02:11:42,790 --> 02:11:44,150
You already mentioned that it,

4294
02:11:44,151 --> 02:11:44,350
you know,

4295
02:11:44,350 --> 02:11:49,350
it's among the baby boomers and
other generations in between even,

4296
02:11:49,780 --> 02:11:50,121
I mean,

4297
02:11:50,121 --> 02:11:51,430
you didn't say gen x,

4298
02:11:51,431 --> 02:11:52,110
but,

4299
02:11:52,110 --> 02:11:52,460
uh,

4300
02:11:52,460 --> 02:11:53,320
the millennials to,

4301
02:11:53,321 --> 02:11:53,531
you know,

4302
02:11:53,531 --> 02:11:56,380
do you think that that's
kind of happening?

4303
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:59,360
That's happening now?

4304
02:12:00,560 --> 02:12:00,920
You know,

4305
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:01,753
obviously,

4306
02:12:01,820 --> 02:12:02,151
you know,

4307
02:12:02,151 --> 02:12:04,160
it's a generalization
that is happening now.

4308
02:12:06,290 --> 02:12:06,511
Well,

4309
02:12:06,511 --> 02:12:06,591
if,

4310
02:12:06,591 --> 02:12:09,010
it's kind of funny because if
you look at a concierge test,

4311
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:12,080
she is like symbolically the Anunnaki,

4312
02:12:12,490 --> 02:12:15,580
like she's like the mouthpiece
of the Anunnaki and what,

4313
02:12:15,581 --> 02:12:17,210
she doesn't realize
this because she's not,

4314
02:12:17,220 --> 02:12:17,790
well,

4315
02:12:17,790 --> 02:12:18,860
she's not well educated

4316
02:12:20,420 --> 02:12:24,050
or at least in terms of like mythology.

4317
02:12:24,051 --> 02:12:25,040
She's not well educated,

4318
02:12:25,220 --> 02:12:26,630
which is a huge mistake by the way.

4319
02:12:26,631 --> 02:12:27,320
Everyone should,

4320
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:27,500
like,

4321
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:29,570
that's a mistake I
definitely made growing up.

4322
02:12:29,571 --> 02:12:30,890
I should have learned more about this.

4323
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:31,900
But,

4324
02:12:31,900 --> 02:12:32,590
um,

4325
02:12:32,590 --> 02:12:34,460
she's not well educated
in these mythologies,

4326
02:12:34,461 --> 02:12:39,461
which is a very big detriment because
you can learn so many things are so deep.

4327
02:12:40,910 --> 02:12:41,560
But yeah,

4328
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:45,170
she is the mouthpiece of the
Anunnaki side of that story.

4329
02:12:45,770 --> 02:12:46,603
Um,

4330
02:12:47,690 --> 02:12:48,523
so,

4331
02:12:48,760 --> 02:12:53,270
which unfortunately she probably won't
be alive long enough to learn because it

4332
02:12:53,271 --> 02:12:57,710
takes several generations to
devour a course metaphorically.

4333
02:12:59,760 --> 02:13:04,580
She might not be around to even see
the damage she's going to cause moving

4334
02:13:04,581 --> 02:13:05,210
forward.

4335
02:13:05,210 --> 02:13:06,440
Everyone else has moving forward.

4336
02:13:06,441 --> 02:13:06,591
Right?

4337
02:13:06,591 --> 02:13:07,700
So you're going to be behind,

4338
02:13:08,280 --> 02:13:08,671
right?

4339
02:13:08,671 --> 02:13:09,480
Yeah.

4340
02:13:09,480 --> 02:13:10,313
And uh,

4341
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:11,820
you know,

4342
02:13:11,820 --> 02:13:13,020
who knows what,

4343
02:13:13,360 --> 02:13:14,193
um,

4344
02:13:14,610 --> 02:13:15,443
you know,

4345
02:13:17,240 --> 02:13:18,290
who knows what,

4346
02:13:20,490 --> 02:13:21,810
how China feels about

4347
02:13:22,080 --> 02:13:23,550
no her and

4348
02:13:25,630 --> 02:13:26,460
what China.

4349
02:13:26,460 --> 02:13:28,710
It's like they're eventually,

4350
02:13:29,130 --> 02:13:30,450
because I know they're close,

4351
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:32,670
they're much closely tied to us then,

4352
02:13:33,090 --> 02:13:33,600
you know,

4353
02:13:33,600 --> 02:13:34,433
then a lot of people,

4354
02:13:36,030 --> 02:13:37,140
I see a lot of people who do,

4355
02:13:37,141 --> 02:13:37,471
I mean,

4356
02:13:37,471 --> 02:13:38,304
I don't know.

4357
02:13:41,070 --> 02:13:41,540
Well,

4358
02:13:41,540 --> 02:13:44,820
what's the problem with China is like
they have to spend so much money on

4359
02:13:44,821 --> 02:13:45,840
enforcement cost,

4360
02:13:46,750 --> 02:13:47,583
um,

4361
02:13:48,240 --> 02:13:49,980
though they are extremely
highly productive.

4362
02:13:50,100 --> 02:13:51,630
But I think eventually they lose.

4363
02:13:51,660 --> 02:13:56,220
They're going to lose that momentum and
people are going to start wanting more

4364
02:13:56,221 --> 02:13:57,054
freedom.

4365
02:13:57,110 --> 02:13:57,871
It might not happen,

4366
02:13:57,871 --> 02:13:59,760
but that's my guess.

4367
02:13:59,960 --> 02:14:00,411
Yeah.

4368
02:14:00,411 --> 02:14:00,780
I mean,

4369
02:14:00,780 --> 02:14:02,270
you know,

4370
02:14:02,271 --> 02:14:04,280
I've just kind of derailed the thing,

4371
02:14:04,281 --> 02:14:05,600
but I definitely think that,

4372
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:05,900
you know,

4373
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:08,660
they'll lose productivity at some point.

4374
02:14:08,770 --> 02:14:09,200
I mean,

4375
02:14:09,200 --> 02:14:10,850
if people don't stand up then that,

4376
02:14:10,940 --> 02:14:13,530
then this is then you could just

4377
02:14:13,620 --> 02:14:14,770
see soon as rope.

4378
02:14:15,430 --> 02:14:16,510
What as robots come in,

4379
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:19,840
they're done like as soon
as the robots are really.

4380
02:14:20,500 --> 02:14:21,520
They're pretty widespread now,

4381
02:14:21,521 --> 02:14:24,070
but as soon as they're like
the main productive capacity,

4382
02:14:24,071 --> 02:14:26,110
like you can build them in your backyard.

4383
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:27,910
Like China's going to have no,

4384
02:14:28,540 --> 02:14:29,373
no economy.

4385
02:14:31,030 --> 02:14:33,070
I mean not any more than we go.

4386
02:14:33,160 --> 02:14:33,430
What,

4387
02:14:33,430 --> 02:14:37,180
what do you mean as far as
manufacturing or doing anything?

4388
02:14:39,460 --> 02:14:39,680
Sorry,

4389
02:14:39,680 --> 02:14:40,513
sorry,

4390
02:14:40,630 --> 02:14:41,311
I missed the first.

4391
02:14:41,311 --> 02:14:42,480
After the first.

4392
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:45,180
The first part of that
question is blanked out in,

4393
02:14:45,181 --> 02:14:45,310
uh,

4394
02:14:45,310 --> 02:14:46,440
in what capacity?

4395
02:14:46,441 --> 02:14:49,850
In every capacity a well,

4396
02:14:49,980 --> 02:14:50,890
in terms of like,

4397
02:14:51,180 --> 02:14:52,340
like right now what?

4398
02:14:52,370 --> 02:14:52,561
You know,

4399
02:14:52,561 --> 02:14:54,000
how they make all the consumer goods?

4400
02:14:54,130 --> 02:14:54,540
Yeah.

4401
02:14:54,540 --> 02:14:56,340
In manufacturing cars.

4402
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:57,700
Imagine if you had.

4403
02:14:58,050 --> 02:15:01,410
Imagine if everybody knew what
a three d printer like never.

4404
02:15:01,420 --> 02:15:05,070
I need to buy any like dollar stores
spatulas you make one at home.

4405
02:15:05,970 --> 02:15:06,631
Then eventually,

4406
02:15:06,631 --> 02:15:07,860
I don't know if everyone will have on,

4407
02:15:07,861 --> 02:15:12,240
but eventually they're going to be so
cheap that almost everyone's going to have

4408
02:15:12,241 --> 02:15:12,720
one.

4409
02:15:12,720 --> 02:15:14,730
So maybe you won't have a three d printer,

4410
02:15:14,731 --> 02:15:15,564
but your neighbor will.

4411
02:15:15,600 --> 02:15:16,100
Yup.

4412
02:15:16,100 --> 02:15:16,650
Yup.

4413
02:15:16,650 --> 02:15:16,771
Hey,

4414
02:15:16,771 --> 02:15:17,790
can you make me a special though?

4415
02:15:17,880 --> 02:15:18,270
Just like,

4416
02:15:18,270 --> 02:15:18,560
you know,

4417
02:15:18,560 --> 02:15:20,430
in the old days you'd ask for
a cup of milk or something.

4418
02:15:20,940 --> 02:15:21,660
Yeah.

4419
02:15:21,660 --> 02:15:22,470
Okay.

4420
02:15:22,470 --> 02:15:23,840
So that's a special something.

4421
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:25,260
What about in

4422
02:15:25,350 --> 02:15:26,280
terms of like,

4423
02:15:26,281 --> 02:15:27,114
um,

4424
02:15:28,020 --> 02:15:28,230
no,

4425
02:15:28,230 --> 02:15:30,510
I think that drivers will be replaced.

4426
02:15:30,511 --> 02:15:32,790
I mean most of the drivers.

4427
02:15:32,850 --> 02:15:33,570
Yeah.

4428
02:15:33,570 --> 02:15:34,470
Every everyday.

4429
02:15:34,510 --> 02:15:35,610
Almost every day I'm on the road.

4430
02:15:35,611 --> 02:15:37,200
I mean I drive pretty conservatively.

4431
02:15:37,440 --> 02:15:41,700
I drive with a decent length among the
next car and it's always paid off in

4432
02:15:41,701 --> 02:15:44,040
terms of me getting through lights easier.

4433
02:15:44,041 --> 02:15:46,840
Being able to maneuver
around car is easier.

4434
02:15:46,841 --> 02:15:50,520
Like writing a person's ass is
bad many more ways than just,

4435
02:15:50,780 --> 02:15:50,901
Oh,

4436
02:15:50,901 --> 02:15:54,780
it's stupid as fuck in many
more ways than just being a,

4437
02:15:56,440 --> 02:15:58,680
the opening yourself up to a car accident.

4438
02:15:58,980 --> 02:16:01,650
It's just so much more
efficient to leave room.

4439
02:16:01,651 --> 02:16:02,340
But I mean,

4440
02:16:02,340 --> 02:16:02,941
well anyway,

4441
02:16:02,941 --> 02:16:04,020
and then when I saw that,

4442
02:16:04,080 --> 02:16:04,680
you know,

4443
02:16:04,680 --> 02:16:07,140
computers have a,

4444
02:16:07,770 --> 02:16:12,570
have analyzed exactly what
the most efficient traffic,

4445
02:16:12,580 --> 02:16:15,360
pat the most efficient traffic,

4446
02:16:15,900 --> 02:16:20,640
what the most efficient traffic flows
would look like in the United States if

4447
02:16:20,641 --> 02:16:22,740
cars follows a certain pattern.

4448
02:16:22,740 --> 02:16:26,760
And it was typically the length that
I leave and I'm thinking myself like,

4449
02:16:26,761 --> 02:16:26,971
yeah,

4450
02:16:26,971 --> 02:16:27,210
you,

4451
02:16:27,210 --> 02:16:29,530
I mean people are always driving.

4452
02:16:29,531 --> 02:16:30,910
So anyway,

4453
02:16:30,911 --> 02:16:31,990
so what I'm thinking is like,

4454
02:16:32,120 --> 02:16:36,370
I pray to God every day that it
maybe not commercial drivers,

4455
02:16:36,371 --> 02:16:39,850
but people just have more
cars taken away from them.

4456
02:16:40,080 --> 02:16:40,650
I mean just,

4457
02:16:40,650 --> 02:16:45,650
it's because it's so inefficient because
people lose hours and days just driving

4458
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:47,861
cars.

4459
02:16:47,861 --> 02:16:48,490
I mean,

4460
02:16:48,490 --> 02:16:49,330
thank God,

4461
02:16:49,420 --> 02:16:50,080
you know,

4462
02:16:50,080 --> 02:16:54,820
Elon musk is digging tunnels
to help at some point,

4463
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:56,320
alleviate traffic.

4464
02:16:56,760 --> 02:16:57,593
Uh,

4465
02:16:57,870 --> 02:16:58,390
but yeah,

4466
02:16:58,390 --> 02:16:58,930
so,

4467
02:16:58,930 --> 02:17:00,940
but I mean as far as truck drivers go,

4468
02:17:00,941 --> 02:17:04,180
like that's not really a good thing.

4469
02:17:04,181 --> 02:17:04,511
I mean,

4470
02:17:04,511 --> 02:17:05,530
truck drivers,

4471
02:17:05,690 --> 02:17:06,120
you know,

4472
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:09,820
I don't always understand
how they're doing things.

4473
02:17:09,821 --> 02:17:11,780
I mean sometimes it seems
like to be an assholes,

4474
02:17:11,781 --> 02:17:12,040
you know,

4475
02:17:12,040 --> 02:17:12,281
you know,

4476
02:17:12,281 --> 02:17:13,300
they're communicating,

4477
02:17:13,301 --> 02:17:14,890
it's hard to really know.

4478
02:17:15,350 --> 02:17:16,030
Um,

4479
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:17,110
but you know,

4480
02:17:17,111 --> 02:17:18,220
to take their work away,

4481
02:17:18,221 --> 02:17:19,150
that'd be terrible.

4482
02:17:19,151 --> 02:17:19,984
I mean that's

4483
02:17:21,880 --> 02:17:23,820
either reminds me,

4484
02:17:25,510 --> 02:17:26,210
uh,

4485
02:17:26,210 --> 02:17:26,610
uh,

4486
02:17:26,610 --> 02:17:28,160
so yeah,

4487
02:17:29,090 --> 02:17:30,790
I just meant in what capacity.

4488
02:17:30,791 --> 02:17:31,301
Exactly.

4489
02:17:31,301 --> 02:17:33,040
Because like robots,

4490
02:17:33,290 --> 02:17:33,540
I've,

4491
02:17:33,540 --> 02:17:35,620
I've heard people say if
you can keep that thought,

4492
02:17:35,621 --> 02:17:36,730
I've heard people say that

4493
02:17:38,350 --> 02:17:38,930
the,

4494
02:17:38,930 --> 02:17:39,763
uh,

4495
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:42,250
are the hockey stick,

4496
02:17:42,320 --> 02:17:47,320
is the hockey stick effect as it has
been applied technology over the last

4497
02:17:49,430 --> 02:17:50,940
uh Huh.

4498
02:17:51,570 --> 02:17:52,810
Last 10 years or so.

4499
02:17:54,040 --> 02:17:57,880
Like with computers and everything
is not going to resemble

4500
02:18:01,140 --> 02:18:01,950
well,

4501
02:18:01,950 --> 02:18:02,360
like,

4502
02:18:02,360 --> 02:18:07,360
like robots do not learn on the same way
that the humans develop computer chips.

4503
02:18:07,820 --> 02:18:10,010
That's what I've heard technologists,

4504
02:18:10,011 --> 02:18:12,580
scientists say that it's,

4505
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:13,010
no,

4506
02:18:13,010 --> 02:18:14,690
you're not gonna have the same.

4507
02:18:15,260 --> 02:18:15,591
Oh,

4508
02:18:15,591 --> 02:18:16,060
you know,

4509
02:18:16,060 --> 02:18:19,040
in 1990 year playing shit.

4510
02:18:19,041 --> 02:18:19,290
I don't know.

4511
02:18:19,290 --> 02:18:20,123
Wow.

4512
02:18:21,190 --> 02:18:21,491
Well,

4513
02:18:21,491 --> 02:18:22,290
with the,

4514
02:18:22,290 --> 02:18:24,520
with what I've heard from some people,

4515
02:18:24,550 --> 02:18:25,383
they say that like,

4516
02:18:25,590 --> 02:18:25,930
yeah,

4517
02:18:25,930 --> 02:18:30,160
events chair at some point the algorithms
are going to be developing ways of

4518
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:34,240
improving themselves without our knowledge
or like in ways that we won't be able

4519
02:18:34,241 --> 02:18:39,241
to comprehend or lex faster than
we're able to catch up in terms of our

4520
02:18:39,341 --> 02:18:40,174
comprehension.

4521
02:18:40,540 --> 02:18:41,570
So I'm not,

4522
02:18:41,580 --> 02:18:42,460
I'm not quite sure.

4523
02:18:42,461 --> 02:18:43,181
I think eventually,

4524
02:18:43,181 --> 02:18:46,360
unfortunately almost all trucking
jobs are going to be automated.

4525
02:18:46,650 --> 02:18:47,200
Yeah.

4526
02:18:47,200 --> 02:18:50,770
Which is like so many people
are employed in that sector.

4527
02:18:50,950 --> 02:18:51,251
Yeah.

4528
02:18:51,251 --> 02:18:55,600
But I don't necessarily think
that's true fully because I.

4529
02:18:55,690 --> 02:18:56,890
because again,

4530
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:02,280
like they're saying that robots are so
bad at pattern recognition right now and

4531
02:19:02,321 --> 02:19:04,670
it's not this like the,

4532
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:09,840
the scientists don't see
it as this effect where,

4533
02:19:10,270 --> 02:19:10,511
oh,

4534
02:19:10,511 --> 02:19:15,511
we're suddenly going to know how to make
them more efficient or better pattern

4535
02:19:16,901 --> 02:19:17,950
recognizers.

4536
02:19:18,570 --> 02:19:21,730
This is what I've heard that yeah,

4537
02:19:21,731 --> 02:19:25,150
the trucks will drive
themselves up to a building,

4538
02:19:25,151 --> 02:19:27,890
but then somebody with
the capacity with the UN,

4539
02:19:28,460 --> 02:19:32,480
with the skill set of backing a truck
up to the loading dock is gonna have the

4540
02:19:32,481 --> 02:19:36,380
takeover because right now robots don't
have that capacity because they don't

4541
02:19:36,381 --> 02:19:38,990
have that ability to do that effectively.

4542
02:19:39,980 --> 02:19:41,180
They're not able to

4543
02:19:42,830 --> 02:19:45,230
basically doc

4544
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:50,620
with the traffic and so I think that's
the thing that will eventually solve that

4545
02:19:50,621 --> 02:19:50,921
issue,

4546
02:19:50,921 --> 02:19:52,970
but I don't know.

4547
02:19:52,980 --> 02:19:54,520
I don't know enough about it to be honest.

4548
02:19:54,600 --> 02:19:54,961
Yeah.

4549
02:19:54,961 --> 02:19:57,030
But I wonder if that'll
leave in our lifetime.

4550
02:19:57,031 --> 02:19:57,271
I mean,

4551
02:19:57,271 --> 02:19:58,710
I don't necessarily know that that's.

4552
02:19:58,890 --> 02:19:59,651
I don't think we'll see.

4553
02:19:59,651 --> 02:20:01,410
We'll see that in our lifetime.

4554
02:20:01,710 --> 02:20:02,450
I mean,

4555
02:20:02,450 --> 02:20:03,283
may see,

4556
02:20:03,320 --> 02:20:04,420
I think on the highway.

4557
02:20:05,490 --> 02:20:05,871
Yeah.

4558
02:20:05,871 --> 02:20:07,210
I think on the highways you'll start,

4559
02:20:07,330 --> 02:20:09,170
you'll start seeing like automatic trucks.

4560
02:20:09,171 --> 02:20:09,971
Do you remember that movie,

4561
02:20:09,971 --> 02:20:10,804
Logan?

4562
02:20:13,000 --> 02:20:13,480
No,

4563
02:20:13,480 --> 02:20:14,600
that's the wolverine movie.

4564
02:20:14,601 --> 02:20:17,760
It'll last for the last war room.

4565
02:20:17,890 --> 02:20:18,723
Okay.

4566
02:20:18,730 --> 02:20:21,730
Well there's like this in
the future and they're like,

4567
02:20:21,940 --> 02:20:22,773
I made a comment.

4568
02:20:22,930 --> 02:20:23,021
Oh,

4569
02:20:23,021 --> 02:20:25,330
I hate these auto trucks because
they're just driving around like not.

4570
02:20:25,420 --> 02:20:26,253
They don't really care.

4571
02:20:26,320 --> 02:20:28,120
I don't pay enough attention to the road.

4572
02:20:28,121 --> 02:20:32,110
I guess they're just doing the
transportation job and they have no cab.

4573
02:20:32,111 --> 02:20:32,944
It's just like a,

4574
02:20:33,130 --> 02:20:34,750
almost like a big box on wheels.

4575
02:20:35,220 --> 02:20:35,640
Yeah.

4576
02:20:35,640 --> 02:20:36,190
Um,

4577
02:20:36,190 --> 02:20:36,971
but I saw that.

4578
02:20:36,971 --> 02:20:37,241
I'm like,

4579
02:20:37,241 --> 02:20:37,391
yeah,

4580
02:20:37,391 --> 02:20:38,800
I guess I saw that and I was like,

4581
02:20:38,801 --> 02:20:39,071
oh,

4582
02:20:39,071 --> 02:20:44,071
well I guess that looks pretty real as
stick when that could happen really soon,

4583
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:45,101
unfortunately.

4584
02:20:45,101 --> 02:20:45,280
Because,

4585
02:20:45,280 --> 02:20:46,600
I mean my brother,

4586
02:20:46,650 --> 02:20:47,790
a driver and a,

4587
02:20:48,240 --> 02:20:50,710
well you don't want to see them at work,

4588
02:20:50,711 --> 02:20:51,401
but will,

4589
02:20:51,401 --> 02:20:53,530
you may still have it.

4590
02:20:53,980 --> 02:20:56,410
You may still see people
travel with the truck,

4591
02:20:56,680 --> 02:21:01,680
but they may just be maintainers rather
than drivers and they may be emergency

4592
02:21:01,721 --> 02:21:02,461
drivers too.

4593
02:21:02,461 --> 02:21:03,294
I mean

4594
02:21:04,420 --> 02:21:08,150
because one guy or one guy's
in charge of driving 10 inch,

4595
02:21:08,190 --> 02:21:10,490
like making sure 10 trucks make it across.

4596
02:21:10,491 --> 02:21:10,731
Right.

4597
02:21:10,731 --> 02:21:12,530
Instead of just having one eye,

4598
02:21:12,600 --> 02:21:14,000
I can see that happening for sure.

4599
02:21:14,510 --> 02:21:15,770
I think it will be a gradual thing.

4600
02:21:18,110 --> 02:21:22,970
I didn't mean that we won't see
trucks automated on the road.

4601
02:21:22,971 --> 02:21:23,270
I met,

4602
02:21:23,270 --> 02:21:23,840
I don't,

4603
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:25,490
we won't see widespread,

4604
02:21:26,100 --> 02:21:26,933
uh,

4605
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,830
enough for automation is already there.

4606
02:21:29,850 --> 02:21:30,810
Pretty much widespread.

4607
02:21:30,960 --> 02:21:35,080
Like there is one area that
I don't agree with a c,

4608
02:21:35,140 --> 02:21:40,140
so I grew up in the Chicago land area
and Mcdonald's headquarters in Oakbrook,

4609
02:21:40,200 --> 02:21:43,530
Illinois and in Bolingbrook,

4610
02:21:43,531 --> 02:21:43,901
Illinois,

4611
02:21:43,901 --> 02:21:45,270
a town over from where I lived.

4612
02:21:45,920 --> 02:21:46,753
I'm not,

4613
02:21:49,090 --> 02:21:50,740
I don't know about this
restaurant specifically,

4614
02:21:50,741 --> 02:21:51,380
but

4615
02:21:51,380 --> 02:21:52,213
it,

4616
02:21:52,370 --> 02:21:53,203
they,

4617
02:21:53,590 --> 02:21:54,423
they would,

4618
02:21:54,590 --> 02:21:55,730
it got to a point.

4619
02:21:55,790 --> 02:21:58,940
It was the same Mcdonald's
for years and years and years.

4620
02:21:58,941 --> 02:22:02,030
And then one day they decided to make
it one of the flagship restaurants,

4621
02:22:02,031 --> 02:22:06,950
meaning that they will tear
that restaurant down sometimes.

4622
02:22:08,040 --> 02:22:08,873
I think

4623
02:22:09,590 --> 02:22:12,020
one time they did it six months apart,

4624
02:22:12,021 --> 02:22:13,190
so they tore it down,

4625
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:14,910
not for nothing.

4626
02:22:14,990 --> 02:22:15,860
They didn't get the whole,

4627
02:22:15,890 --> 02:22:17,840
they didn't demolish the building,

4628
02:22:17,841 --> 02:22:20,630
but they gutted almost everything
in the inside the exterior.

4629
02:22:21,290 --> 02:22:23,960
And then six months later they did it
again and all of a sudden you've got

4630
02:22:23,961 --> 02:22:25,290
kiosks where you just,

4631
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:27,030
you don't have to go up to a person.

4632
02:22:27,330 --> 02:22:29,430
They had automatic cheeseburger makers.

4633
02:22:29,790 --> 02:22:30,211
I mean,

4634
02:22:30,211 --> 02:22:30,710
so,

4635
02:22:30,710 --> 02:22:30,930
you know,

4636
02:22:30,930 --> 02:22:33,630
there are already automating things and
I heard someone say that you can't do

4637
02:22:33,631 --> 02:22:35,190
that and it's already been done.

4638
02:22:35,191 --> 02:22:37,230
I mean it's already a.

4639
02:22:38,700 --> 02:22:39,640
So you know,

4640
02:22:39,660 --> 02:22:42,180
to the extent that I think you
can phase all the people out,

4641
02:22:42,280 --> 02:22:43,800
I don't know enough about that,

4642
02:22:43,801 --> 02:22:45,930
but I just don't think we'll see it,

4643
02:22:45,990 --> 02:22:46,680
you know,

4644
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:47,970
as widespread.

4645
02:22:49,670 --> 02:22:50,990
And then if there's other problems,

4646
02:22:50,991 --> 02:22:51,190
you know,

4647
02:22:51,190 --> 02:22:51,840
you know,

4648
02:22:51,840 --> 02:22:53,240
you start putting people out of work,

4649
02:22:54,300 --> 02:22:59,300
will that have a negative effect
on technology and progress?

4650
02:23:00,091 --> 02:23:02,310
And I don't know,

4651
02:23:02,490 --> 02:23:04,740
there's some crazy like a for sure.

4652
02:23:07,760 --> 02:23:08,593
That's nice.

4653
02:23:08,900 --> 02:23:10,850
Maybe like the first area they'll uh,

4654
02:23:12,620 --> 02:23:13,330
the

4655
02:23:13,330 --> 02:23:16,900
really get down as in warfare that wave.

4656
02:23:16,960 --> 02:23:18,910
So when people do get out of work,

4657
02:23:19,150 --> 02:23:19,421
you know,

4658
02:23:19,421 --> 02:23:20,200
you're not,

4659
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:21,610
you don't have to put boots on the ground.

4660
02:23:21,611 --> 02:23:23,500
You got robots that are policing people.

4661
02:23:23,620 --> 02:23:24,453
I don't know,

4662
02:23:26,600 --> 02:23:27,780
it's a

4663
02:23:29,390 --> 02:23:30,550
go full skynet,

4664
02:23:30,551 --> 02:23:30,951
I hope.

4665
02:23:30,951 --> 02:23:33,110
I don't hope they keep
their shit together.

4666
02:23:33,620 --> 02:23:34,150
Oh,

4667
02:23:34,150 --> 02:23:36,540
another one thing I'm seeing yet,

4668
02:23:37,250 --> 02:23:40,400
that starship troopers book that
we're talking about earlier,

4669
02:23:41,010 --> 02:23:43,670
I'm part of the history is that they,

4670
02:23:43,730 --> 02:23:44,563
uh,

4671
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:46,423
earth is like,

4672
02:23:47,120 --> 02:23:50,290
there's this big war between the
West and China because trying to get,

4673
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:51,890
get so powerful economically.

4674
02:23:52,030 --> 02:23:53,180
And this was written in the sixties.

4675
02:23:53,181 --> 02:23:54,800
So this guy was pretty oppression.

4676
02:23:55,470 --> 02:23:56,060
Um,

4677
02:23:56,060 --> 02:23:56,893
but,

4678
02:23:57,570 --> 02:23:58,070
uh,

4679
02:23:58,070 --> 02:23:59,600
so for anyone who doesn't know,

4680
02:23:59,650 --> 02:24:01,670
a starship troopers is
written by Robert Heinlein.

4681
02:24:02,120 --> 02:24:04,300
I highly recommend reading
the book and Washington movie.

4682
02:24:04,760 --> 02:24:05,121
But anyway,

4683
02:24:05,121 --> 02:24:07,540
so there was a war with China and uh,

4684
02:24:08,210 --> 02:24:10,850
I think they don't really go into details,

4685
02:24:10,880 --> 02:24:13,150
but it sounds like the west won that war,

4686
02:24:14,420 --> 02:24:16,670
but it was against this totalitarian.

4687
02:24:16,720 --> 02:24:19,220
I'm sort of robot sort of ideal.

4688
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:22,070
I'm sorta like how China
is doing now with their,

4689
02:24:22,071 --> 02:24:22,904
uh,

4690
02:24:23,330 --> 02:24:27,090
their morality system with
like the points black,

4691
02:24:27,370 --> 02:24:28,610
like the Black Mirror episode,

4692
02:24:30,080 --> 02:24:31,910
which is kind of fucked
up because that's like,

4693
02:24:32,050 --> 02:24:34,630
that's 1984 is something
that you could kind of.

4694
02:24:34,700 --> 02:24:36,140
Everyone was guessing
I was going to happen,

4695
02:24:36,141 --> 02:24:38,120
but this is almost like
brave new world style.

4696
02:24:38,870 --> 02:24:41,510
Like in China you can go around
talking about tenement square,

4697
02:24:41,511 --> 02:24:44,870
but it's just only if you start like
doing big speeches and in influencing

4698
02:24:44,871 --> 02:24:49,871
people then it's a problem which
is not completely totalitarian,

4699
02:24:50,001 --> 02:24:52,100
but it's just to tell Terry
enough to keep things,

4700
02:24:52,330 --> 02:24:52,670
you know,

4701
02:24:52,670 --> 02:24:53,503
the way it is.

4702
02:24:53,710 --> 02:24:53,961
Yeah.

4703
02:24:53,961 --> 02:24:58,961
And when you mentioned brave new worlds
board that know people accept and

4704
02:24:59,980 --> 02:25:00,813
uh,

4705
02:25:01,240 --> 02:25:02,320
uh,

4706
02:25:02,660 --> 02:25:05,840
accepted and well too preoccupied.

4707
02:25:05,841 --> 02:25:06,171
Yeah.

4708
02:25:06,171 --> 02:25:08,330
And there will be welcoming the uh,

4709
02:25:09,220 --> 02:25:10,670
the social credit system.

4710
02:25:10,970 --> 02:25:11,480
I mean,

4711
02:25:11,480 --> 02:25:12,950
I don't know that everybody does in China,

4712
02:25:12,951 --> 02:25:17,170
but I'm sure there's quite a bit of
people don't know I'm talking about.

4713
02:25:17,180 --> 02:25:18,410
I don't really know anything about it.

4714
02:25:18,520 --> 02:25:23,520
I just know that it
sounds scary and to that,

4715
02:25:24,310 --> 02:25:24,611
I mean,

4716
02:25:24,611 --> 02:25:25,660
you kinda got it here.

4717
02:25:25,661 --> 02:25:26,080
You know,

4718
02:25:26,080 --> 02:25:28,060
Alex Jones can't say
the shit that he says.

4719
02:25:28,061 --> 02:25:29,890
So are guns gone off Patrion?

4720
02:25:30,240 --> 02:25:34,270
I mean we don't know really how far
this goes as far as I understand.

4721
02:25:35,250 --> 02:25:39,220
I think as long as there's free people
willing to stand up and say things,

4722
02:25:39,221 --> 02:25:40,054
I think we're probably,

4723
02:25:40,130 --> 02:25:41,800
we're going to be okay for a long time,

4724
02:25:42,130 --> 02:25:45,640
but we definitely have to like keep
raising the issue of being able to say

4725
02:25:45,641 --> 02:25:47,840
things because uh,

4726
02:25:48,020 --> 02:25:48,550
for example,

4727
02:25:48,550 --> 02:25:50,800
I find myself censoring
myself on reddit because I'll,

4728
02:25:50,950 --> 02:25:51,400
I'll,

4729
02:25:51,400 --> 02:25:52,300
if you try to pose,

4730
02:25:52,301 --> 02:25:54,550
if you're not a left wing person,

4731
02:25:54,551 --> 02:25:54,700
right?

4732
02:25:54,700 --> 02:25:55,040
Because right.

4733
02:25:55,040 --> 02:26:00,040
It's like 10 to one left wing and you go
on like our politics or like one of the

4734
02:26:00,071 --> 02:26:01,630
main world news or something like that.

4735
02:26:01,930 --> 02:26:04,960
And you say anything that's
outside of the left is orthodoxy.

4736
02:26:05,260 --> 02:26:08,000
You're just downward you
downloaded out of existence like.

4737
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:13,590
So you Kinda have a reluctance to say
those things then because the more you

4738
02:26:13,691 --> 02:26:15,240
downloaded it down with a lot,

4739
02:26:15,280 --> 02:26:17,740
eventually you just can't post at all.

4740
02:26:17,980 --> 02:26:18,400
Yeah.

4741
02:26:18,400 --> 02:26:19,300
So it,

4742
02:26:19,600 --> 02:26:23,830
it creates like this fucked up system
or things kind of need to be said like,

4743
02:26:23,831 --> 02:26:25,000
you know this like Oh,

4744
02:26:25,001 --> 02:26:29,610
trump's going to be indicted because
of this guy said something disguised

4745
02:26:29,650 --> 02:26:34,650
cousin's barber brother said something
and trump's definitely gonna get caught

4746
02:26:35,621 --> 02:26:36,041
this time.

4747
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:36,191
Right.

4748
02:26:36,191 --> 02:26:37,450
And it's been going on for two years.

4749
02:26:38,020 --> 02:26:42,820
Every single posts like that gets like
30,000 or more votes and it's like it's

4750
02:26:42,821 --> 02:26:44,780
complete garbage because like it's Oh,

4751
02:26:44,850 --> 02:26:45,431
maybe it isn't,

4752
02:26:45,431 --> 02:26:47,380
but it looks every single
time it's the wrong.

4753
02:26:47,380 --> 02:26:47,621
Right.

4754
02:26:47,621 --> 02:26:51,190
So I've basically filtered it
out in my mind is pure garbage,

4755
02:26:51,340 --> 02:26:51,851
but it's still good,

4756
02:26:51,851 --> 02:26:52,690
like $30,000.

4757
02:26:53,170 --> 02:26:55,180
But that's because it meets
the leftist orthodoxy.

4758
02:26:55,450 --> 02:26:56,050
They've actually,

4759
02:26:56,050 --> 02:26:56,410
they're like,

4760
02:26:56,410 --> 02:26:58,090
well this maybe it's exactly how I think.

4761
02:26:58,091 --> 02:26:59,330
So I'm an upload it.

4762
02:26:59,980 --> 02:27:00,810
But if you make,

4763
02:27:00,810 --> 02:27:02,230
if you'd comment on there like,

4764
02:27:02,380 --> 02:27:03,101
come on guys.

4765
02:27:03,101 --> 02:27:07,000
Like really this is like the 400th
fucking article you've uploaded to 30,000

4766
02:27:07,001 --> 02:27:10,210
votes and it's never worked
out to be what it says.

4767
02:27:10,690 --> 02:27:12,240
And you just get down with it out of,

4768
02:27:12,370 --> 02:27:13,990
out of the thread basically.

4769
02:27:13,991 --> 02:27:16,870
Like you'd be right at the
bottom of my minus 900 downloads,

4770
02:27:16,871 --> 02:27:17,830
which is like crazy.

4771
02:27:18,430 --> 02:27:18,970
Um,

4772
02:27:18,970 --> 02:27:22,000
but it just sad because you can't
have an honest conversation.

4773
02:27:22,001 --> 02:27:25,450
You can have a genuine conversation
with anybody from the left right now.

4774
02:27:26,800 --> 02:27:27,700
Very few people.

4775
02:27:29,640 --> 02:27:31,150
So I just got to say,

4776
02:27:31,151 --> 02:27:32,890
it makes me think about the essay or the,

4777
02:27:32,891 --> 02:27:33,724
uh,

4778
02:27:33,880 --> 02:27:36,310
what you had wrote in red earlier about,

4779
02:27:36,311 --> 02:27:36,940
uh,

4780
02:27:36,940 --> 02:27:41,940
how do you talk to people who are so
ingrained in their own biases or like he

4781
02:27:43,001 --> 02:27:43,290
said,

4782
02:27:43,290 --> 02:27:44,123
you know,

4783
02:27:44,260 --> 02:27:45,490
their own orthodoxy,

4784
02:27:46,200 --> 02:27:47,033
uh,

4785
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:49,651
if I'm using that.

4786
02:27:49,651 --> 02:27:50,484
Right?

4787
02:27:50,630 --> 02:27:50,820
Yeah,

4788
02:27:50,820 --> 02:27:51,653
that's fine.

4789
02:27:52,860 --> 02:27:53,131
Yeah.

4790
02:27:53,131 --> 02:27:53,700
How do you,

4791
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:54,900
how do you get through to people?

4792
02:27:54,910 --> 02:27:57,540
Like how do you get through people
that are at Peterson says they're

4793
02:27:57,541 --> 02:27:58,710
ideologically possessed,

4794
02:27:58,711 --> 02:28:02,610
which I think is a really good way to
put it because that's really what it is.

4795
02:28:02,611 --> 02:28:04,080
I remember kind of being,

4796
02:28:04,380 --> 02:28:07,380
I'd never really don't think I was
ever really ideologically possessed,

4797
02:28:07,770 --> 02:28:12,770
but I remember definitely pushing the
left sort of leftist agenda because I

4798
02:28:13,291 --> 02:28:14,430
really thought it was like,

4799
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:15,301
you know,

4800
02:28:15,301 --> 02:28:16,200
I thought it was a good thing.

4801
02:28:16,201 --> 02:28:16,430
You know,

4802
02:28:16,430 --> 02:28:20,550
you're helping people by taking rich
bastards money and given it to the four

4803
02:28:20,551 --> 02:28:20,851
people,

4804
02:28:20,851 --> 02:28:21,050
right?

4805
02:28:21,050 --> 02:28:21,883
Like Robin Hood,

4806
02:28:21,950 --> 02:28:23,570
Robin Hood is always seen as a good guy.

4807
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:24,920
Uh,

4808
02:28:24,920 --> 02:28:27,140
but I really thought about it for awhile.

4809
02:28:27,170 --> 02:28:27,441
I'm like,

4810
02:28:27,441 --> 02:28:28,220
well,

4811
02:28:28,220 --> 02:28:32,090
what really matters is that we make life
as good as possible for the most amount

4812
02:28:32,091 --> 02:28:36,560
of people possible and the system
that's done that is capitalism.

4813
02:28:37,040 --> 02:28:39,920
And if we are going to suck it up that
there's some rich guys and there's some

4814
02:28:39,921 --> 02:28:40,754
poor guy's,

4815
02:28:41,090 --> 02:28:43,130
then it's all going to
be better in the end.

4816
02:28:43,940 --> 02:28:47,180
But there's just this resentment
people have just to have it now.

4817
02:28:47,300 --> 02:28:47,720
You know,

4818
02:28:47,720 --> 02:28:48,370
they,

4819
02:28:48,370 --> 02:28:51,890
they would kind of cut off
their nose to spite your face.

4820
02:28:52,810 --> 02:28:53,643
Hmm.

4821
02:28:55,140 --> 02:28:57,480
So getting back to China real quick,

4822
02:28:57,990 --> 02:28:58,823
uh,

4823
02:28:59,850 --> 02:29:00,940
we're exactly where we,

4824
02:29:01,140 --> 02:29:03,240
you were talking about
highlands book in the uh.

4825
02:29:03,810 --> 02:29:04,310
Oh yeah.

4826
02:29:04,310 --> 02:29:04,650
So yeah,

4827
02:29:04,650 --> 02:29:08,390
so there's like a battle ideological
battle between like authoritarian

4828
02:29:08,430 --> 02:29:10,140
collectivism and uh,

4829
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:15,800
I guess the starship troopers
version of liberalism as Sargon this,

4830
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:18,620
I'm a

4831
02:29:19,880 --> 02:29:20,570
show,

4832
02:29:20,570 --> 02:29:21,403
or what do you call it?

4833
02:29:22,250 --> 02:29:23,630
It's this little video he wrote,

4834
02:29:23,631 --> 02:29:25,250
he did about starship troopers.

4835
02:29:25,760 --> 02:29:27,980
It's like the Jordan Peterson a utopia.

4836
02:29:29,810 --> 02:29:30,191
Oh yeah,

4837
02:29:30,191 --> 02:29:30,590
yeah,

4838
02:29:30,590 --> 02:29:30,890
yeah,

4839
02:29:30,890 --> 02:29:31,290
yeah.

4840
02:29:31,290 --> 02:29:32,123
I mentioned,

4841
02:29:32,590 --> 02:29:32,870
uh,

4842
02:29:32,870 --> 02:29:33,640
this is really a,

4843
02:29:33,640 --> 02:29:34,473
a Peterson Ism.

4844
02:29:35,790 --> 02:29:36,540
Yeah.

4845
02:29:36,540 --> 02:29:36,820
And,

4846
02:29:36,820 --> 02:29:37,170
and,

4847
02:29:37,170 --> 02:29:37,670
and the,

4848
02:29:37,670 --> 02:29:39,680
the counter so happens the,

4849
02:29:39,681 --> 02:29:40,401
the feet China,

4850
02:29:40,401 --> 02:29:40,521
right?

4851
02:29:40,521 --> 02:29:42,500
So the human collective wisdom is gone,

4852
02:29:42,501 --> 02:29:43,760
but then when they come across the,

4853
02:29:43,761 --> 02:29:48,761
enact a Arachnids they are collectivists
like the way they think is the,

4854
02:29:51,680 --> 02:29:53,690
there's no difference in the
individual and the whole.

4855
02:29:53,691 --> 02:29:56,330
So they don't care if
they lose the individuals.

4856
02:29:56,331 --> 02:29:56,841
Nobody be like,

4857
02:29:56,841 --> 02:29:58,010
as a whole still exists.

4858
02:29:58,480 --> 02:29:59,313
Um,

4859
02:30:00,200 --> 02:30:01,610
but humans aren't like that at all,

4860
02:30:01,611 --> 02:30:05,000
like they're way more individual.

4861
02:30:05,600 --> 02:30:08,870
So when bugs destroy the
entire planet of humans,

4862
02:30:08,871 --> 02:30:09,704
just like whatever,

4863
02:30:09,750 --> 02:30:13,400
it's like killing one bug them and
they don't care about the one bug.

4864
02:30:13,401 --> 02:30:18,020
So why would they care about killing 8
million individuals or however millions

4865
02:30:18,021 --> 02:30:21,400
of individuals because they just think
about themselves as the collective,

4866
02:30:21,420 --> 02:30:22,040
as long as,

4867
02:30:22,040 --> 02:30:23,410
as long as the collective survives,

4868
02:30:23,411 --> 02:30:24,244
they don't care.

4869
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:25,130
Um,

4870
02:30:25,130 --> 02:30:27,170
so there's like that contrast between,

4871
02:30:27,850 --> 02:30:28,683
um,

4872
02:30:28,730 --> 02:30:33,210
so that's the weird thing with
the Russos and Marxist and

4873
02:30:34,790 --> 02:30:38,000
communist ideals of the collective will,

4874
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:39,713
um,

4875
02:30:40,070 --> 02:30:44,840
Russo goes into this idea that if you're
a person that kills another person,

4876
02:30:44,841 --> 02:30:49,550
if you kill an individualist and
collectivist because you're working,

4877
02:30:50,240 --> 02:30:51,073
uh,

4878
02:30:51,470 --> 02:30:55,130
in favor of the collective goal
or collective will he called it,

4879
02:30:55,490 --> 02:30:56,323
um,

4880
02:30:57,200 --> 02:31:00,050
it doesn't matter that you killed the
person because the individual doesn't

4881
02:31:00,051 --> 02:31:00,740
matter.

4882
02:31:00,740 --> 02:31:03,690
And I just think that's kind
of disturbing because I mean,

4883
02:31:03,700 --> 02:31:04,340
if you apply,

4884
02:31:04,340 --> 02:31:05,630
it sounds all good in theory,

4885
02:31:05,631 --> 02:31:06,890
but if you apply that in real life,

4886
02:31:06,920 --> 02:31:09,170
like you could kill anybody,

4887
02:31:09,230 --> 02:31:09,501
you know,

4888
02:31:09,501 --> 02:31:11,870
that you could justify it for that reason.

4889
02:31:12,560 --> 02:31:14,780
And I think most people,

4890
02:31:14,781 --> 02:31:15,280
if they,

4891
02:31:15,280 --> 02:31:16,640
I think most people look at the,

4892
02:31:17,060 --> 02:31:19,440
sort of like the fluffy parts
of communism and they think,

4893
02:31:19,441 --> 02:31:19,711
okay,

4894
02:31:19,711 --> 02:31:19,980
it's not

4895
02:31:19,980 --> 02:31:20,760
so bad,

4896
02:31:20,760 --> 02:31:23,310
but when you really dig
down to what it leads to,

4897
02:31:23,880 --> 02:31:24,660
um,

4898
02:31:24,660 --> 02:31:26,730
if people are actually
bothered to look at it,

4899
02:31:26,731 --> 02:31:27,840
which I don't think most do,

4900
02:31:28,280 --> 02:31:28,600
um,

4901
02:31:28,600 --> 02:31:29,281
they would see that.

4902
02:31:29,281 --> 02:31:30,600
It's like disgusting.

4903
02:31:31,230 --> 02:31:31,620
No,

4904
02:31:31,620 --> 02:31:33,030
it's worse than baby killers.

4905
02:31:34,770 --> 02:31:35,250
That's why.

4906
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:36,420
That's why they get the helicopter.

4907
02:31:39,820 --> 02:31:40,170
Yeah,

4908
02:31:40,170 --> 02:31:41,003
yeah,

4909
02:31:44,640 --> 02:31:45,473
yeah.

4910
02:31:45,720 --> 02:31:46,231
I just saw,

4911
02:31:46,231 --> 02:31:47,920
I just read an article on

4912
02:31:48,240 --> 02:31:49,780
dredge recently about a,

4913
02:31:50,630 --> 02:31:50,970
uh,

4914
02:31:50,970 --> 02:31:52,800
serial killings,

4915
02:31:52,830 --> 02:31:56,520
a possible serial killing
sell in the states.

4916
02:31:57,180 --> 02:31:58,013
Um,

4917
02:31:58,060 --> 02:31:59,910
but yeah,

4918
02:31:59,940 --> 02:32:00,090
I,

4919
02:32:00,090 --> 02:32:00,361
you know,

4920
02:32:00,361 --> 02:32:01,194
I don't know,

4921
02:32:02,220 --> 02:32:03,420
I had never heard of it,

4922
02:32:03,421 --> 02:32:03,710
but,

4923
02:32:03,710 --> 02:32:03,930
you know,

4924
02:32:03,930 --> 02:32:08,040
they were this group basically
where they were finding these,

4925
02:32:08,041 --> 02:32:08,874
uh,

4926
02:32:09,060 --> 02:32:13,700
what they thought were suicide
or possibly suicides are they,

4927
02:32:13,780 --> 02:32:14,131
you know,

4928
02:32:14,131 --> 02:32:15,680
they have found all this,

4929
02:32:15,690 --> 02:32:15,960
uh,

4930
02:32:15,960 --> 02:32:20,960
the smiley face artwork and they're
thinking it might be a cell of serial

4931
02:32:21,031 --> 02:32:21,864
killers,

4932
02:32:21,960 --> 02:32:22,793
um,

4933
02:32:23,220 --> 02:32:23,401
you know,

4934
02:32:23,401 --> 02:32:25,840
rather than just
individuals that you know,

4935
02:32:26,050 --> 02:32:29,250
are linked that use the dark web.

4936
02:32:29,251 --> 02:32:30,150
And I thought that dark.

4937
02:32:30,330 --> 02:32:35,330
I thought that the dark web was largely
already infiltrated by the federal

4938
02:32:35,431 --> 02:32:39,000
government and it was near impossible
to stay anonymous at this point.

4939
02:32:39,670 --> 02:32:40,503
Um,

4940
02:32:41,690 --> 02:32:46,690
if not impossible because of the way
things are stamped through the internet

4941
02:32:47,361 --> 02:32:48,320
protocol system.

4942
02:32:48,970 --> 02:32:49,803
Um,

4943
02:32:49,970 --> 02:32:51,950
I thought that was gone.

4944
02:32:51,980 --> 02:32:52,211
I mean,

4945
02:32:52,211 --> 02:32:54,710
I thought the federal government
and had a complete hold,

4946
02:32:55,070 --> 02:32:56,990
so it makes me wonder about this story,

4947
02:32:56,991 --> 02:32:57,770
but,

4948
02:32:57,770 --> 02:33:02,770
and so the people that are being targeted
supposedly are the best of the best

4949
02:33:03,260 --> 02:33:04,041
college kids.

4950
02:33:04,041 --> 02:33:04,874
Like,

4951
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:06,833
uh,

4952
02:33:07,220 --> 02:33:08,053
very bright,

4953
02:33:08,300 --> 02:33:08,570
you know,

4954
02:33:08,570 --> 02:33:09,530
very athletic,

4955
02:33:09,830 --> 02:33:12,470
very good looking kids.

4956
02:33:13,070 --> 02:33:15,140
All these kids were found to have Ghb,

4957
02:33:15,141 --> 02:33:16,940
which is the date rape
drug in their system.

4958
02:33:17,960 --> 02:33:19,400
And yeah,

4959
02:33:19,401 --> 02:33:20,720
so it's a.

4960
02:33:21,110 --> 02:33:21,943
So basically,

4961
02:33:21,950 --> 02:33:22,783
you know,

4962
02:33:23,280 --> 02:33:24,113
um,

4963
02:33:24,830 --> 02:33:27,150
people take Ghb to uh,

4964
02:33:27,170 --> 02:33:28,580
I don't know how familiar
you are with drugs.

4965
02:33:28,790 --> 02:33:30,050
Individuals take dhb.

4966
02:33:30,051 --> 02:33:30,890
It's just a,

4967
02:33:31,070 --> 02:33:31,401
you know,

4968
02:33:31,401 --> 02:33:32,234
it's like a,

4969
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:34,220
like it makes me feel good.

4970
02:33:34,340 --> 02:33:35,210
It makes you feel good.

4971
02:33:35,240 --> 02:33:37,310
I mean it's not just a date rape drug.

4972
02:33:37,311 --> 02:33:38,780
There's individuals that take it to

4973
02:33:39,200 --> 02:33:40,033
um,

4974
02:33:41,260 --> 02:33:42,810
so it was a guy in high school,

4975
02:33:42,811 --> 02:33:43,644
I took it,

4976
02:33:43,860 --> 02:33:44,740
he took it so much,

4977
02:33:44,760 --> 02:33:45,740
the old and we were,

4978
02:33:46,010 --> 02:33:47,880
it was kind of just kind of a funny guy,

4979
02:33:47,881 --> 02:33:49,590
but we've got all set
your date rapes himself.

4980
02:33:50,140 --> 02:33:50,973
Was this kind of

4981
02:33:53,520 --> 02:33:53,930
like,

4982
02:33:53,930 --> 02:33:55,170
it was such a loser here that day.

4983
02:33:55,171 --> 02:33:55,950
Pray for himself.

4984
02:33:55,950 --> 02:33:56,783
But

4985
02:33:59,070 --> 02:33:59,840
anyways.

4986
02:33:59,840 --> 02:34:00,241
But yeah,

4987
02:34:00,241 --> 02:34:00,620
so,

4988
02:34:00,620 --> 02:34:00,871
you know,

4989
02:34:00,871 --> 02:34:02,100
it's just a weird thing and I'm,

4990
02:34:02,490 --> 02:34:02,701
you know,

4991
02:34:02,701 --> 02:34:03,630
it makes me think that,

4992
02:34:03,690 --> 02:34:04,080
you know,

4993
02:34:04,080 --> 02:34:05,010
who could be doing it,

4994
02:34:05,040 --> 02:34:05,760
you know,

4995
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:08,140
you know people who are collectivists,

4996
02:34:08,141 --> 02:34:08,340
you know,

4997
02:34:08,340 --> 02:34:09,480
they don't like the individual.

4998
02:34:09,481 --> 02:34:10,130
I don't like the,

4999
02:34:10,130 --> 02:34:11,160
if it's even real,

5000
02:34:11,430 --> 02:34:12,060
you know,

5001
02:34:12,060 --> 02:34:13,480
who knows if I think,

5002
02:34:14,780 --> 02:34:14,940
well,

5003
02:34:14,940 --> 02:34:16,510
I think they're probably just like,

5004
02:34:16,530 --> 02:34:18,250
they're probably like no

5005
02:34:18,550 --> 02:34:20,110
pathological individuals,

5006
02:34:20,430 --> 02:34:21,263
uh,

5007
02:34:21,420 --> 02:34:21,970
you know,

5008
02:34:21,970 --> 02:34:26,970
so I think we should just shoot
this pupil up to be honest.

5009
02:34:27,470 --> 02:34:27,960
Um,

5010
02:34:27,960 --> 02:34:29,080
and it reminds me of the,

5011
02:34:29,081 --> 02:34:29,770
uh,

5012
02:34:29,770 --> 02:34:31,450
I can't remember Peterson said this,

5013
02:34:31,570 --> 02:34:34,990
but it was between the wild
hundreds and the 16 hundreds.

5014
02:34:34,991 --> 02:34:35,710
The,

5015
02:34:35,710 --> 02:34:40,000
I think the violent death rate in
Europe went down by like an order of

5016
02:34:40,001 --> 02:34:40,571
magnitude.

5017
02:34:40,571 --> 02:34:42,670
So I think it was like $1,000.

5018
02:34:42,671 --> 02:34:45,940
There was no one for 10,000
and that's because they,

5019
02:34:46,360 --> 02:34:49,180
the law and order started coming into
effect and he basically started killing

5020
02:34:49,181 --> 02:34:50,170
all the criminals off.

5021
02:34:50,730 --> 02:34:51,280
Um,

5022
02:34:51,280 --> 02:34:52,040
so,

5023
02:34:52,040 --> 02:34:52,630
but I mean,

5024
02:34:52,630 --> 02:34:55,030
I think that when in our society,

5025
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:57,400
the crime like that is so rare.

5026
02:34:57,401 --> 02:35:00,670
It might just be that this
person's just a genetic,

5027
02:35:01,580 --> 02:35:01,931
you know,

5028
02:35:01,931 --> 02:35:05,270
you can't really eliminate it because
it just pops up once in a while.

5029
02:35:05,280 --> 02:35:06,550
Sort of like a rare disease.

5030
02:35:07,000 --> 02:35:07,570
So.

5031
02:35:07,570 --> 02:35:07,691
Well,

5032
02:35:07,691 --> 02:35:09,190
it's hundreds of murders now.

5033
02:35:10,110 --> 02:35:10,943
Yeah.

5034
02:35:10,950 --> 02:35:15,500
Hundreds of hundreds of
suspected murders in all,

5035
02:35:15,760 --> 02:35:17,770
in different cities in the United States.

5036
02:35:17,771 --> 02:35:18,970
All bearing the same,

5037
02:35:20,260 --> 02:35:21,093
not all,

5038
02:35:21,160 --> 02:35:22,420
many bearing the same.

5039
02:35:23,230 --> 02:35:25,150
A toxicology reports,

5040
02:35:25,640 --> 02:35:26,473
uh,

5041
02:35:26,560 --> 02:35:28,000
finding the,

5042
02:35:29,170 --> 02:35:30,250
if I can remember correctly,

5043
02:35:30,251 --> 02:35:31,540
finding the graffiti,

5044
02:35:31,541 --> 02:35:33,670
the similar graffiti in the same areas.

5045
02:35:34,250 --> 02:35:35,083
Uh,

5046
02:35:35,560 --> 02:35:36,460
and they think that it,

5047
02:35:36,520 --> 02:35:37,031
like I said,

5048
02:35:37,031 --> 02:35:37,864
it's a cell,

5049
02:35:37,960 --> 02:35:41,260
it's a group of individuals
that can change,

5050
02:35:41,261 --> 02:35:44,920
like there might be so many individuals
that they can just basically like

5051
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:49,150
interchange themselves in him,

5052
02:35:49,420 --> 02:35:49,691
you know,

5053
02:35:49,691 --> 02:35:50,780
at any given will.

5054
02:35:50,820 --> 02:35:51,760
And that's the thing.

5055
02:35:51,761 --> 02:35:52,594
It's like,

5056
02:35:52,910 --> 02:35:53,743
it just,

5057
02:35:53,840 --> 02:35:55,580
it's really fucking suspect.

5058
02:35:55,581 --> 02:35:57,370
Do you know what I just heard about it.

5059
02:35:57,371 --> 02:35:57,731
I mean,

5060
02:35:57,731 --> 02:35:58,564
I just read it on.

5061
02:35:59,230 --> 02:35:59,921
I forget that,

5062
02:35:59,921 --> 02:36:00,131
you know,

5063
02:36:00,131 --> 02:36:01,570
I should try and pull it up.

5064
02:36:01,571 --> 02:36:02,404
I don't know that,

5065
02:36:02,530 --> 02:36:02,820
you know,

5066
02:36:02,820 --> 02:36:03,050
drugs,

5067
02:36:03,050 --> 02:36:04,930
just an aggregate of news sources.

5068
02:36:04,931 --> 02:36:06,310
I always hate dimension drudge,

5069
02:36:06,340 --> 02:36:11,340
but I almost never remember the actual
which matters where I'm getting the,

5070
02:36:12,580 --> 02:36:13,930
who's putting out the story.

5071
02:36:14,570 --> 02:36:15,403
Um,

5072
02:36:16,750 --> 02:36:17,820
I haven't seen it yet,

5073
02:36:18,190 --> 02:36:18,940
but I,

5074
02:36:18,940 --> 02:36:19,773
I,

5075
02:36:19,920 --> 02:36:22,420
I go by this mantra that
the truth is the truth,

5076
02:36:22,421 --> 02:36:23,500
no matter what the source.

5077
02:36:23,590 --> 02:36:24,460
So if it's true,

5078
02:36:24,461 --> 02:36:25,750
then I don't care about the source.

5079
02:36:26,830 --> 02:36:27,610
Yeah,

5080
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:28,480
I mean that's the thing.

5081
02:36:28,481 --> 02:36:29,750
How do you find out if it's true or not?

5082
02:36:29,760 --> 02:36:30,593
Right?

5083
02:36:30,940 --> 02:36:31,211
Yeah.

5084
02:36:31,211 --> 02:36:31,371
I mean,

5085
02:36:31,371 --> 02:36:32,290
I never even heard about it.

5086
02:36:32,291 --> 02:36:35,710
I don't ever hear about it in the
mainstream media or anything like that.

5087
02:36:35,711 --> 02:36:36,544
This,

5088
02:36:36,730 --> 02:36:39,100
I mean a group of serial
killers rather than,

5089
02:36:40,840 --> 02:36:41,673
uh,

5090
02:36:41,950 --> 02:36:42,161
well,

5091
02:36:42,161 --> 02:36:42,400
the,

5092
02:36:42,400 --> 02:36:42,730
the,

5093
02:36:42,730 --> 02:36:46,300
the thing with the conspiracies as
the more people that are involved,

5094
02:36:46,450 --> 02:36:50,620
some moral likely or the less likely
it's going to remain a conspiracy is the

5095
02:36:50,621 --> 02:36:53,020
more mouths and more
ears than more mistakes.

5096
02:36:54,100 --> 02:36:55,630
So if it is,

5097
02:36:55,631 --> 02:36:58,240
a lot of it is a lot of people
hopefully will be found out.

5098
02:36:58,720 --> 02:36:59,553
Yeah,

5099
02:37:00,970 --> 02:37:01,631
fucked up.

5100
02:37:01,631 --> 02:37:03,130
I'm trying to find just to post it.

5101
02:37:10,880 --> 02:37:11,190
Oh yeah.

5102
02:37:11,190 --> 02:37:11,931
Hey Joshua.

5103
02:37:11,931 --> 02:37:12,651
I've read 19,

5104
02:37:12,651 --> 02:37:13,484
84,

5105
02:37:13,730 --> 02:37:14,630
three times.

5106
02:37:15,770 --> 02:37:16,603
Um,

5107
02:37:16,990 --> 02:37:17,640
it's,

5108
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:18,730
it's a good [inaudible] do you know,

5109
02:37:18,731 --> 02:37:19,460
it's funny as I.

5110
02:37:19,460 --> 02:37:20,960
every time I read it again,

5111
02:37:21,000 --> 02:37:21,860
it got better.

5112
02:37:21,890 --> 02:37:23,090
Like I got more from it.

5113
02:37:23,920 --> 02:37:24,753
Um,

5114
02:37:25,760 --> 02:37:26,050
yeah,

5115
02:37:26,050 --> 02:37:26,281
yeah.

5116
02:37:26,281 --> 02:37:27,270
The Brotherhood school.

5117
02:37:27,271 --> 02:37:27,650
Yeah.

5118
02:37:27,650 --> 02:37:28,860
That in brave new world.

5119
02:37:29,250 --> 02:37:29,761
It was funny.

5120
02:37:29,761 --> 02:37:30,110
My,

5121
02:37:30,110 --> 02:37:31,770
the AP English 12 teacher,

5122
02:37:32,310 --> 02:37:32,901
he's like,

5123
02:37:32,901 --> 02:37:33,250
uh,

5124
02:37:33,250 --> 02:37:34,190
so I got to,

5125
02:37:34,260 --> 02:37:35,670
you guys got to read this.

5126
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:36,331
He's like,

5127
02:37:36,331 --> 02:37:37,980
I don't know why they want you to read 19,

5128
02:37:37,981 --> 02:37:39,530
84 was like,

5129
02:37:39,560 --> 02:37:40,920
I don't know where the world's going,

5130
02:37:40,921 --> 02:37:44,310
but it's required reading
now that brave new world.

5131
02:37:44,940 --> 02:37:45,301
He's like,

5132
02:37:45,301 --> 02:37:46,860
so not going to be,

5133
02:37:47,220 --> 02:37:48,840
not going to get around to
some of the other books.

5134
02:37:48,841 --> 02:37:49,471
I like the teacher,

5135
02:37:49,471 --> 02:37:50,650
but nothing.

5136
02:37:51,550 --> 02:37:52,680
It was just kind of interesting.

5137
02:37:52,681 --> 02:37:53,514
He was making sense.

5138
02:37:57,260 --> 02:38:01,170
I came across this a thing of the day
on reddit and it was someone that was

5139
02:38:01,180 --> 02:38:01,290
like,

5140
02:38:01,290 --> 02:38:03,000
it was like a probable,

5141
02:38:03,001 --> 02:38:06,810
not see a guy like a
neofascist or whatever.

5142
02:38:07,350 --> 02:38:12,350
And there's a reddit called 1984 and
the guy made a post like detailing about

5143
02:38:12,361 --> 02:38:13,550
how 1984,

5144
02:38:13,551 --> 02:38:17,160
it's actually left pick a
leftist collectivism rather
than write collectivism.

5145
02:38:17,400 --> 02:38:18,420
Which is actually,

5146
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:19,380
I think that's true.

5147
02:38:19,650 --> 02:38:20,483
Um,

5148
02:38:20,940 --> 02:38:21,773
and uh,

5149
02:38:22,200 --> 02:38:27,180
I got down voted for agreeing with a
Nazi about something that was true.

5150
02:38:27,450 --> 02:38:27,800
I thought,

5151
02:38:27,800 --> 02:38:28,170
I agree,

5152
02:38:28,170 --> 02:38:30,140
but just be agreeing that
what he said was true.

5153
02:38:30,160 --> 02:38:31,510
Doesn't mean I agree with Nazi-ism,

5154
02:38:31,511 --> 02:38:33,220
which just disagreed with the,

5155
02:38:33,590 --> 02:38:33,790
you know,

5156
02:38:33,790 --> 02:38:34,623
his assessment.

5157
02:38:34,820 --> 02:38:35,653
Yeah.

5158
02:38:36,050 --> 02:38:36,601
I was trying to,

5159
02:38:36,601 --> 02:38:36,811
like,

5160
02:38:36,811 --> 02:38:37,500
they like,

5161
02:38:37,500 --> 02:38:39,570
and the guys were like looking
through his post history,

5162
02:38:39,571 --> 02:38:40,404
I think his name was,

5163
02:38:41,280 --> 02:38:42,113
um,

5164
02:38:42,330 --> 02:38:43,740
something white,

5165
02:38:43,741 --> 02:38:47,430
something four slash four slash
2014 year years or something.

5166
02:38:47,610 --> 02:38:48,361
So I was just like,

5167
02:38:48,361 --> 02:38:48,511
well,

5168
02:38:48,511 --> 02:38:50,850
obviously he's a Nazi but I don't
care because that's not what,

5169
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,230
that's not what the argument is.

5170
02:38:52,260 --> 02:38:53,130
That's not what he's saying.

5171
02:38:54,270 --> 02:38:57,270
The argument is that it's
a leftist collectivism.

5172
02:38:57,480 --> 02:38:58,051
And I was like,

5173
02:38:58,051 --> 02:38:58,141
oh,

5174
02:38:58,141 --> 02:38:58,740
that's true.

5175
02:38:58,740 --> 02:38:59,610
But a lot of people are like,

5176
02:38:59,820 --> 02:39:00,361
get out of here.

5177
02:39:00,361 --> 02:39:01,290
You're not see like,

5178
02:39:01,350 --> 02:39:02,640
I don't want to hear your opinion.

5179
02:39:02,940 --> 02:39:04,140
And you know,

5180
02:39:04,890 --> 02:39:06,620
I just thought that was
stupid because like,

5181
02:39:06,840 --> 02:39:07,561
it doesn't matter.

5182
02:39:07,561 --> 02:39:07,920
You know,

5183
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:09,720
Santa Claus said it
doesn't make a difference.

5184
02:39:09,960 --> 02:39:10,321
Right?

5185
02:39:10,321 --> 02:39:11,154
Yeah.

5186
02:39:11,980 --> 02:39:12,300
Yeah.

5187
02:39:12,300 --> 02:39:14,790
I just think it's a bad rhetoric
on the front of the left.

5188
02:39:14,840 --> 02:39:15,673
They,

5189
02:39:15,760 --> 02:39:17,010
you the MPC meme.

5190
02:39:17,190 --> 02:39:18,023
Yeah.

5191
02:39:18,420 --> 02:39:18,631
Yeah.

5192
02:39:18,631 --> 02:39:19,530
It's like that whole thing,

5193
02:39:19,560 --> 02:39:20,220
you know,

5194
02:39:20,220 --> 02:39:25,220
they've got a limited set of responses
and the run through them and then after a

5195
02:39:25,251 --> 02:39:26,084
while they just,

5196
02:39:26,170 --> 02:39:26,821
you're just like,

5197
02:39:26,821 --> 02:39:28,230
what the fuck do I even
say to you anymore?

5198
02:39:28,231 --> 02:39:28,370
You,

5199
02:39:28,370 --> 02:39:29,620
are you even a human being,

5200
02:39:29,760 --> 02:39:30,593
do you think?

5201
02:39:32,990 --> 02:39:33,240
Yeah.

5202
02:39:33,240 --> 02:39:33,560
Um,

5203
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:33,771
I've,

5204
02:39:33,771 --> 02:39:34,110
I,

5205
02:39:34,110 --> 02:39:34,380
I've,

5206
02:39:34,380 --> 02:39:35,210
I've had a lot of,

5207
02:39:35,210 --> 02:39:36,410
I actually quit facebook,

5208
02:39:36,490 --> 02:39:40,490
I got rid of my facebook because I was
having these conversations with people

5209
02:39:40,491 --> 02:39:42,020
that were just completely retarded.

5210
02:39:42,350 --> 02:39:42,750
Like you,

5211
02:39:42,750 --> 02:39:45,920
you talked to people
they don't like consider

5212
02:39:47,710 --> 02:39:48,710
consider what you have to say.

5213
02:39:49,120 --> 02:39:49,460
No,

5214
02:39:49,460 --> 02:39:49,950
they just,

5215
02:39:49,950 --> 02:39:50,783
they have their,

5216
02:39:51,950 --> 02:39:53,050
they have their spiel.

5217
02:39:53,440 --> 02:39:54,090
Orange Man,

5218
02:39:54,090 --> 02:39:54,923
dad,

5219
02:39:55,890 --> 02:39:56,723
yeah,

5220
02:39:57,080 --> 02:39:58,100
I have facebook,

5221
02:39:58,101 --> 02:39:59,540
but I never interact,

5222
02:40:00,200 --> 02:40:01,430
never post anything.

5223
02:40:01,431 --> 02:40:02,264
I mean it's,

5224
02:40:04,650 --> 02:40:05,483
yeah,

5225
02:40:06,000 --> 02:40:06,751
well I have this,

5226
02:40:06,751 --> 02:40:07,230
uh,

5227
02:40:07,230 --> 02:40:09,960
I have a fake facebook account
that I use once in a while.

5228
02:40:10,080 --> 02:40:10,411
Um,

5229
02:40:10,411 --> 02:40:10,981
it's called,

5230
02:40:10,981 --> 02:40:11,814
uh,

5231
02:40:13,200 --> 02:40:15,600
I joined this group called
left versus right or whatever,

5232
02:40:15,690 --> 02:40:16,830
and it says I can pull a group.

5233
02:40:17,290 --> 02:40:18,123
Um,

5234
02:40:18,630 --> 02:40:22,440
but at the beginning it was like shit
posting and then it became political than

5235
02:40:22,441 --> 02:40:23,520
it was more shit posting.

5236
02:40:24,150 --> 02:40:26,790
But now it's a very often.

5237
02:40:26,791 --> 02:40:30,840
But I think the trumps is basically
divided between trump and anti trump now,

5238
02:40:31,050 --> 02:40:32,340
which is kind of lame.

5239
02:40:32,640 --> 02:40:33,630
But I did.

5240
02:40:33,700 --> 02:40:38,160
Anti-Trump guys are guys I used to
argue with a lot because I used to be a

5241
02:40:38,161 --> 02:40:38,701
socialist.

5242
02:40:38,701 --> 02:40:39,270
Right.

5243
02:40:39,270 --> 02:40:39,890
So I've,

5244
02:40:39,890 --> 02:40:41,160
I've been the things I've,

5245
02:40:41,280 --> 02:40:43,260
I've changed and adapted and I've learned,

5246
02:40:43,470 --> 02:40:44,740
I'm different,

5247
02:40:45,390 --> 02:40:46,680
not really learn different ideas,

5248
02:40:46,681 --> 02:40:50,730
I've absorbed different ideas and now
I just think completely differently,

5249
02:40:51,230 --> 02:40:51,780
you know,

5250
02:40:51,780 --> 02:40:52,613
so,

5251
02:40:53,310 --> 02:40:54,143
but it took me,

5252
02:40:54,780 --> 02:40:58,620
it took me listening to people with
different views and taking their thoughts

5253
02:40:58,621 --> 02:41:00,000
genuinely rather than just,

5254
02:41:00,001 --> 02:41:00,590
uh,

5255
02:41:00,590 --> 02:41:01,423
you know,

5256
02:41:01,740 --> 02:41:04,340
ignoring them because they
think differently than me.

5257
02:41:04,341 --> 02:41:05,174
And you know,

5258
02:41:05,490 --> 02:41:06,001
orange man.

5259
02:41:06,001 --> 02:41:06,470
Good.

5260
02:41:06,470 --> 02:41:07,303
Yeah.

5261
02:41:10,990 --> 02:41:11,480
Yeah.

5262
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:11,680
I don't,

5263
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,640
I don't know what,

5264
02:41:14,760 --> 02:41:15,593
you know,

5265
02:41:16,340 --> 02:41:17,330
for people who

5266
02:41:18,580 --> 02:41:19,850
don't necessarily like a.

5267
02:41:20,050 --> 02:41:23,590
So I listened to a Jimmy Dore quite a bit,

5268
02:41:24,060 --> 02:41:24,280
you know,

5269
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,570
I like June cleaver.

5270
02:41:25,930 --> 02:41:26,760
He's good.

5271
02:41:26,760 --> 02:41:27,460
But you know,

5272
02:41:27,460 --> 02:41:28,080
he had,

5273
02:41:28,080 --> 02:41:28,460
you know,

5274
02:41:28,460 --> 02:41:29,293
he,

5275
02:41:29,590 --> 02:41:30,180
he's a,

5276
02:41:30,180 --> 02:41:31,510
he's a comedian so,

5277
02:41:31,690 --> 02:41:32,260
you know,

5278
02:41:32,260 --> 02:41:33,090
and he,

5279
02:41:33,090 --> 02:41:35,980
maybe it might've been a
talk show host or talent.

5280
02:41:36,620 --> 02:41:36,971
I mean he,

5281
02:41:36,971 --> 02:41:37,180
uh,

5282
02:41:37,180 --> 02:41:38,680
he talks sometimes like he's a,

5283
02:41:39,820 --> 02:41:42,170
like he's a baseball announcer or a news

5284
02:41:42,210 --> 02:41:44,010
announcer for the Midwest.

5285
02:41:44,210 --> 02:41:44,671
Jimmy Dore,

5286
02:41:44,671 --> 02:41:46,920
the Jamie door from the young Turks,

5287
02:41:46,921 --> 02:41:47,754
right?

5288
02:41:47,870 --> 02:41:48,621
Yeah,

5289
02:41:48,621 --> 02:41:50,540
I didn't know him when he
was at the young Turks.

5290
02:41:50,541 --> 02:41:53,690
I just a found him

5291
02:41:55,250 --> 02:41:56,083
piper.

5292
02:41:56,690 --> 02:41:56,841
Oh,

5293
02:41:56,841 --> 02:41:57,674
do they?

5294
02:41:58,670 --> 02:41:59,000
Cause he,

5295
02:41:59,000 --> 02:41:59,270
uh,

5296
02:41:59,270 --> 02:42:02,770
he was like yelling at Alex Jones and
you're like it on the and so the column,

5297
02:42:02,780 --> 02:42:06,230
the spitting viper a that
was door that spit on him.

5298
02:42:06,930 --> 02:42:07,280
Yeah.

5299
02:42:07,280 --> 02:42:08,001
I don't think he meant to.

5300
02:42:08,001 --> 02:42:10,880
I think it was just like he
was just excited or something.

5301
02:42:11,180 --> 02:42:11,451
Yeah.

5302
02:42:11,451 --> 02:42:12,680
Maybe it's just Chicago.

5303
02:42:12,681 --> 02:42:13,514
He's a,

5304
02:42:13,970 --> 02:42:14,840
I mean it's like,

5305
02:42:16,290 --> 02:42:16,561
you know,

5306
02:42:16,561 --> 02:42:17,490
people from Chicago,

5307
02:42:17,491 --> 02:42:18,480
people from New York,

5308
02:42:18,510 --> 02:42:20,490
hockey fans,

5309
02:42:20,850 --> 02:42:21,121
you know,

5310
02:42:21,121 --> 02:42:22,650
they all kind of similar,

5311
02:42:23,250 --> 02:42:23,521
you know,

5312
02:42:23,521 --> 02:42:25,980
it's like you don't
take shit from anybody.

5313
02:42:26,630 --> 02:42:26,821
You know,

5314
02:42:26,821 --> 02:42:31,580
I heard Jimmy Dore just like fucking
ripping into somebody and uh,

5315
02:42:32,770 --> 02:42:35,550
I mean one time I heard him
kind of go off on somebody.

5316
02:42:35,551 --> 02:42:35,851
I'm like,

5317
02:42:35,851 --> 02:42:36,684
man,

5318
02:42:37,620 --> 02:42:39,330
I feel like I know that guy is.

5319
02:42:39,331 --> 02:42:39,900
And then he's like,

5320
02:42:39,900 --> 02:42:40,091
oh,

5321
02:42:40,091 --> 02:42:40,161
I,

5322
02:42:40,161 --> 02:42:40,411
you know,

5323
02:42:40,411 --> 02:42:41,244
he was,

5324
02:42:41,340 --> 02:42:42,750
he lived in the Chicago land area.

5325
02:42:42,751 --> 02:42:43,170
And I'm like,

5326
02:42:43,170 --> 02:42:43,681
oh,

5327
02:42:43,681 --> 02:42:44,514
that's why.

5328
02:42:44,610 --> 02:42:44,950
Because I,

5329
02:42:44,950 --> 02:42:45,281
you know,

5330
02:42:45,281 --> 02:42:46,080
I,

5331
02:42:46,080 --> 02:42:46,913
it,

5332
02:42:47,060 --> 02:42:49,440
it's kind of a cliche thing,

5333
02:42:49,441 --> 02:42:49,981
but you know,

5334
02:42:49,981 --> 02:42:51,240
when you grow up in Chicago land area,

5335
02:42:51,241 --> 02:42:55,710
you run into certain people who have
the same attitudes and you know,

5336
02:42:55,720 --> 02:42:56,553
it just,

5337
02:42:58,590 --> 02:43:01,390
he's actually like a
relatively reasonable,

5338
02:43:01,391 --> 02:43:02,200
like leftist.

5339
02:43:02,200 --> 02:43:02,650
Like he,

5340
02:43:02,650 --> 02:43:03,820
I don't think he's as great.

5341
02:43:04,060 --> 02:43:06,790
I think the pro like crazy,

5342
02:43:07,030 --> 02:43:07,630
funnily enough,

5343
02:43:07,630 --> 02:43:10,850
I think he's more reasonable than
like [inaudible] and like an,

5344
02:43:11,050 --> 02:43:11,883
I guess

5345
02:43:12,380 --> 02:43:14,080
just casper the friendly ghost.

5346
02:43:14,160 --> 02:43:16,500
I've got a in,

5347
02:43:16,720 --> 02:43:18,760
which is weird because
he's kind of the crazy one,

5348
02:43:18,790 --> 02:43:22,420
but I think it's just probably where
he's from as he said northeastern over

5349
02:43:23,260 --> 02:43:23,801
Chicago,

5350
02:43:23,801 --> 02:43:24,580
Midwest yet.

5351
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:25,413
But uh,

5352
02:43:25,640 --> 02:43:25,880
oh,

5353
02:43:25,880 --> 02:43:27,460
maybe he went a.

5354
02:43:27,690 --> 02:43:28,160
all right,

5355
02:43:28,160 --> 02:43:29,050
get you to fair.

5356
02:43:29,090 --> 02:43:29,340
Come on,

5357
02:43:29,340 --> 02:43:29,830
get down.

5358
02:43:29,830 --> 02:43:30,131
He,

5359
02:43:30,131 --> 02:43:30,964
uh,

5360
02:43:31,090 --> 02:43:31,923
he was talking to,

5361
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:34,050
they had done a funny thing again,

5362
02:43:34,110 --> 02:43:34,770
let's back up.

5363
02:43:34,770 --> 02:43:39,770
And they were talking about immigration
and trump made the remark and I don't

5364
02:43:42,251 --> 02:43:43,570
know why he made the remark.

5365
02:43:43,571 --> 02:43:44,080
I mean,

5366
02:43:44,080 --> 02:43:46,510
I guess he just does it because he's
just going to talk and say whatever he

5367
02:43:46,511 --> 02:43:46,781
wants,

5368
02:43:46,781 --> 02:43:47,560
which is fine.

5369
02:43:47,560 --> 02:43:48,020
Uh,

5370
02:43:48,020 --> 02:43:49,160
but he was like,

5371
02:43:49,300 --> 02:43:50,133
the uh,

5372
02:43:50,230 --> 02:43:53,410
immigrants have the best cars
and he didn't say Emirates,

5373
02:43:53,411 --> 02:43:53,591
sorry.

5374
02:43:53,591 --> 02:43:54,424
He's like,

5375
02:43:54,970 --> 02:43:55,810
the kind of,

5376
02:43:55,870 --> 02:43:58,780
it seemed to be taken out of context
and it was like they've got the best

5377
02:43:58,781 --> 02:44:03,540
vehicles and then Jimmy Dore and
then his wife and Ron Falconi,

5378
02:44:03,590 --> 02:44:04,960
they kind of going off and they're like,

5379
02:44:05,080 --> 02:44:05,481
what do you mean,

5380
02:44:05,481 --> 02:44:06,670
think of the best cars,

5381
02:44:06,790 --> 02:44:07,091
you know?

5382
02:44:07,091 --> 02:44:07,924
And it's like,

5383
02:44:08,340 --> 02:44:13,030
like I didn't see anything before it and
I don't catch the live shows because he

5384
02:44:13,031 --> 02:44:13,631
only cuts,

5385
02:44:13,631 --> 02:44:17,180
clips of his shows and then you,

5386
02:44:17,230 --> 02:44:20,520
you don't get to see the full live
show unless you're a supporter,

5387
02:44:20,530 --> 02:44:22,780
a Patriot supporter or
wherever that works.

5388
02:44:23,830 --> 02:44:24,590
Yeah.

5389
02:44:24,590 --> 02:44:26,110
I don't support them because I don't,

5390
02:44:26,290 --> 02:44:29,160
it's not in because I like them comes
because they don't have enough money now.

5391
02:44:31,210 --> 02:44:32,043
But uh,

5392
02:44:33,110 --> 02:44:34,360
because I liked their content,

5393
02:44:34,361 --> 02:44:35,620
but I mean he was totally,

5394
02:44:35,650 --> 02:44:37,810
they're totally taken
trump out of context.

5395
02:44:38,170 --> 02:44:39,640
But then I just stepped back for a second.

5396
02:44:39,641 --> 02:44:40,474
I'm like,

5397
02:44:41,260 --> 02:44:42,370
he's a fucking comedian.

5398
02:44:42,371 --> 02:44:42,581
I mean,

5399
02:44:42,581 --> 02:44:43,414
it's not,

5400
02:44:45,990 --> 02:44:46,823
but you know,

5401
02:44:47,230 --> 02:44:48,330
I guess it depends.

5402
02:44:48,331 --> 02:44:48,661
You know,

5403
02:44:48,661 --> 02:44:48,821
it,

5404
02:44:48,821 --> 02:44:49,654
you know,

5405
02:44:49,810 --> 02:44:50,350
you,

5406
02:44:50,350 --> 02:44:51,183
you,

5407
02:44:51,330 --> 02:44:53,550
you really shouldn't get a free pass.

5408
02:44:54,030 --> 02:44:54,271
You know,

5409
02:44:54,271 --> 02:44:55,290
no matter who you are,

5410
02:44:55,830 --> 02:44:57,840
if you're trying to influence
the political process.

5411
02:44:57,841 --> 02:44:58,674
I guess that's,

5412
02:44:58,860 --> 02:45:02,260
it comes down to like
a duty responsibility,

5413
02:45:02,540 --> 02:45:03,030
you know,

5414
02:45:03,030 --> 02:45:07,980
who am I affecting a WHO's going
to believe the shit that I say?

5415
02:45:08,040 --> 02:45:08,341
Anyway,

5416
02:45:08,341 --> 02:45:11,730
so I mentioned this because I made
a comment in the section like,

5417
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:14,960
I believe it was the
coyotes and of course I got

5418
02:45:18,070 --> 02:45:20,260
probably 20 comments down and people just,

5419
02:45:20,620 --> 02:45:21,453
you know,

5420
02:45:21,580 --> 02:45:21,970
you,

5421
02:45:21,970 --> 02:45:24,190
I guess you believe what you believe.

5422
02:45:24,191 --> 02:45:24,911
A lot of bullshit,

5423
02:45:24,911 --> 02:45:25,481
I'm sure.

5424
02:45:25,481 --> 02:45:28,540
And just all this shit and
they're thinking about it.

5425
02:45:28,541 --> 02:45:28,781
I'm like,

5426
02:45:28,781 --> 02:45:28,991
man,

5427
02:45:28,991 --> 02:45:33,991
these people do not like trump and
they definitely don't like to be a

5428
02:45:36,040 --> 02:45:36,791
put on the spot,

5429
02:45:36,791 --> 02:45:37,301
I guess.

5430
02:45:37,301 --> 02:45:38,134
I Dunno.

5431
02:45:38,200 --> 02:45:38,930
Yeah,

5432
02:45:38,930 --> 02:45:39,170
yeah,

5433
02:45:39,170 --> 02:45:40,003
that's true.

5434
02:45:40,100 --> 02:45:40,691
If they don't like,

5435
02:45:40,691 --> 02:45:41,290
um,

5436
02:45:41,290 --> 02:45:43,120
they don't like conflict
with their ideology,

5437
02:45:43,121 --> 02:45:43,954
that's for sure.

5438
02:45:44,200 --> 02:45:45,033
Yeah.

5439
02:45:45,210 --> 02:45:45,910
If,

5440
02:45:45,910 --> 02:45:46,740
uh,

5441
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:50,860
a son that's seems to be common
amongst most of the leftist ideologue.

5442
02:45:57,960 --> 02:45:58,793
Yeah.

5443
02:45:59,820 --> 02:46:00,601
But yeah,

5444
02:46:00,601 --> 02:46:01,434
so I don't know,

5445
02:46:01,610 --> 02:46:02,443
I'm,

5446
02:46:03,550 --> 02:46:04,590
I'm starting to get like the.

5447
02:46:05,430 --> 02:46:05,671
Sorry,

5448
02:46:05,671 --> 02:46:06,504
go ahead.

5449
02:46:07,050 --> 02:46:07,270
Uh,

5450
02:46:07,270 --> 02:46:08,103
the young,

5451
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:08,971
the young Turks,

5452
02:46:08,971 --> 02:46:10,220
I find them to be pretty,

5453
02:46:10,610 --> 02:46:11,510
pretty crazy.

5454
02:46:11,630 --> 02:46:14,000
Like I used to actually
be a subscriber to them.

5455
02:46:14,370 --> 02:46:14,640
They,

5456
02:46:14,640 --> 02:46:16,430
I thought they were kind of
reasonable back in the day,

5457
02:46:16,820 --> 02:46:17,360
but now,

5458
02:46:17,360 --> 02:46:18,920
but now that they've kind of gone,

5459
02:46:19,040 --> 02:46:24,040
I guess for the last couple of years I
eventually decided subscribed like this

5460
02:46:24,411 --> 02:46:24,920
whole sites,

5461
02:46:24,920 --> 02:46:26,990
like this little group is bullshit.

5462
02:46:26,991 --> 02:46:27,760
Like they,

5463
02:46:27,760 --> 02:46:29,270
they just make shit up half the time.

5464
02:46:29,271 --> 02:46:30,950
Are they there are so slanted,

5465
02:46:32,860 --> 02:46:33,270
you know,

5466
02:46:33,270 --> 02:46:35,490
like it's hard to explain that.

5467
02:46:36,030 --> 02:46:36,351
I don't know,

5468
02:46:36,351 --> 02:46:36,711
I just,

5469
02:46:36,711 --> 02:46:37,401
I'm totally lost.

5470
02:46:37,401 --> 02:46:38,240
I lost faith in them,

5471
02:46:38,241 --> 02:46:42,140
so I just unsubscribed and
they've gotten worse since.

5472
02:46:42,141 --> 02:46:43,970
So I guess it was a good idea.

5473
02:46:44,410 --> 02:46:45,243
Yeah.

5474
02:46:45,840 --> 02:46:46,490
Uh,

5475
02:46:46,490 --> 02:46:48,540
I've never really watched
the young Turks infective,

5476
02:46:48,560 --> 02:46:50,900
watched them more just to hear them,

5477
02:46:50,960 --> 02:46:51,860
what they're saying

5478
02:46:52,520 --> 02:46:54,020
a w

5479
02:46:54,340 --> 02:46:55,061
recently.

5480
02:46:55,061 --> 02:46:55,481
But I mean,

5481
02:46:55,481 --> 02:46:56,314
I don't,

5482
02:46:56,950 --> 02:46:58,570
I never think would go like,

5483
02:46:58,571 --> 02:46:59,404
yeah,

5484
02:47:00,730 --> 02:47:02,560
like just Kinda,

5485
02:47:02,561 --> 02:47:02,861
you know,

5486
02:47:02,861 --> 02:47:04,210
I kinda want to observe,

5487
02:47:04,870 --> 02:47:05,703
you know,

5488
02:47:05,830 --> 02:47:07,060
what they're talking about,

5489
02:47:07,061 --> 02:47:08,440
the stories that they're talking about,

5490
02:47:08,441 --> 02:47:09,490
how they're framing it,

5491
02:47:10,660 --> 02:47:12,430
how the framing certain stories.

5492
02:47:12,440 --> 02:47:13,273
Uh,

5493
02:47:13,560 --> 02:47:16,000
it's just really interesting to me.

5494
02:47:17,180 --> 02:47:18,013
Uh,

5495
02:47:19,770 --> 02:47:20,603
no.

5496
02:47:22,610 --> 02:47:23,030
Well,

5497
02:47:23,030 --> 02:47:23,661
who else do you,

5498
02:47:23,661 --> 02:47:24,050
uh,

5499
02:47:24,050 --> 02:47:25,250
do you ever listen to v?

5500
02:47:26,710 --> 02:47:26,900
No,

5501
02:47:26,900 --> 02:47:27,320
that's.

5502
02:47:27,320 --> 02:47:27,800
Yeah,

5503
02:47:27,800 --> 02:47:28,633
see,

5504
02:47:29,070 --> 02:47:31,660
I know there's a lot of
good youtube youtubers.

5505
02:47:31,700 --> 02:47:32,533
A,

5506
02:47:33,040 --> 02:47:33,970
I don't know how old

5507
02:47:35,490 --> 02:47:36,990
the has been on Youtube,

5508
02:47:38,610 --> 02:47:43,500
but I've always kind of associated
Sargon the thunder foot probably from,

5509
02:47:43,750 --> 02:47:46,790
from like 2013 from
when I first heard her.

5510
02:47:46,800 --> 02:47:48,750
I don't know if these have
been around since then,

5511
02:47:49,530 --> 02:47:53,880
but I don't know that many that
I would find more interesting,

5512
02:47:54,540 --> 02:47:55,280
you know?

5513
02:47:55,280 --> 02:47:56,040
Uh,

5514
02:47:56,040 --> 02:47:56,970
there's a couple,

5515
02:47:57,000 --> 02:47:58,980
there's a couple I've
been listening to lately.

5516
02:47:58,990 --> 02:47:59,820
Um,

5517
02:47:59,820 --> 02:48:00,800
count Denckla.

5518
02:48:00,920 --> 02:48:01,380
Uh,

5519
02:48:01,380 --> 02:48:02,213
it was one,

5520
02:48:02,680 --> 02:48:03,370
um,

5521
02:48:03,370 --> 02:48:04,230
Sargon was,

5522
02:48:04,530 --> 02:48:09,240
I think it started with Sargon and then
from there I got to dangle a because of

5523
02:48:09,241 --> 02:48:13,410
the Nazi punk thing and then I think I
then eventually it was like I would hear

5524
02:48:13,411 --> 02:48:14,530
v quite a bit of a star events.

5525
02:48:14,531 --> 02:48:14,821
I was like,

5526
02:48:14,821 --> 02:48:15,000
oh,

5527
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:15,880
check out with V and e.

5528
02:48:15,920 --> 02:48:17,160
he's actually pretty interesting.

5529
02:48:17,220 --> 02:48:18,053
He has like a,

5530
02:48:18,360 --> 02:48:21,600
I like b because he's a little bit unique.

5531
02:48:21,650 --> 02:48:24,330
Like he has different
views from eastern Europe.

5532
02:48:24,620 --> 02:48:26,280
It was like a completely different view.

5533
02:48:27,030 --> 02:48:27,863
Um,

5534
02:48:29,100 --> 02:48:31,650
so he kind of gives me some
good arguments and points.

5535
02:48:31,651 --> 02:48:31,980
I mean,

5536
02:48:31,980 --> 02:48:32,450
I don't,

5537
02:48:32,450 --> 02:48:32,730
I don't,

5538
02:48:32,730 --> 02:48:35,460
I try to take anybody as orthodoxy,

5539
02:48:35,461 --> 02:48:39,870
but I find that he's open enough and
he's also a lawyer and a doctor too,

5540
02:48:39,880 --> 02:48:41,100
like he's trained to be both,

5541
02:48:41,101 --> 02:48:42,540
so he's pretty smart.

5542
02:48:43,050 --> 02:48:43,710
Um,

5543
02:48:43,710 --> 02:48:47,650
so I like to Dab a devil in his,

5544
02:48:47,680 --> 02:48:51,060
his work and same with
Sargon and a contact lead.

5545
02:48:51,120 --> 02:48:53,070
Then there's this guy just
started listening to a shirt,

5546
02:48:53,310 --> 02:48:53,641
shirt,

5547
02:48:53,641 --> 02:48:54,560
fat attackers,

5548
02:48:54,570 --> 02:48:55,403
a Canadian guy.

5549
02:48:56,220 --> 02:48:56,710
Um,

5550
02:48:56,710 --> 02:48:57,630
he mostly does gaming,

5551
02:48:57,631 --> 02:49:00,960
but he does like a at d and
d stream with a v and Sargon.

5552
02:49:00,961 --> 02:49:05,490
So I listened to that too because
now he usually has stuff inside this.

5553
02:49:05,491 --> 02:49:06,324
Interesting.

5554
02:49:07,750 --> 02:49:07,990
But,

5555
02:49:07,990 --> 02:49:08,780
um,

5556
02:49:08,780 --> 02:49:08,950
yeah,

5557
02:49:08,950 --> 02:49:09,783
so those are,

5558
02:49:09,800 --> 02:49:11,890
some of the guys listen to
also listen to Owen Benjamin,

5559
02:49:11,891 --> 02:49:14,260
who's kind of been a weird lately.

5560
02:49:14,620 --> 02:49:15,453
Um,

5561
02:49:15,940 --> 02:49:16,773
I found him,

5562
02:49:17,200 --> 02:49:18,340
I love his comedy.

5563
02:49:18,341 --> 02:49:19,930
I think he's fucking hilarious,

5564
02:49:20,110 --> 02:49:22,540
but he's got a little bit weird with the,

5565
02:49:23,170 --> 02:49:24,060
the uh,

5566
02:49:24,100 --> 02:49:24,933
what is it

5567
02:49:26,140 --> 02:49:27,580
about the moon landing stuff?

5568
02:49:27,581 --> 02:49:28,620
And now he's onto him.

5569
02:49:28,690 --> 02:49:30,820
I think he's six months from flat earth,

5570
02:49:30,821 --> 02:49:31,840
but who knows?

5571
02:49:32,000 --> 02:49:32,570
Oh,

5572
02:49:32,570 --> 02:49:33,250
it's just my,

5573
02:49:33,250 --> 02:49:33,721
my guest.

5574
02:49:33,721 --> 02:49:34,554
I could be wrong.

5575
02:49:34,720 --> 02:49:34,950
Uh,

5576
02:49:34,950 --> 02:49:37,840
you also could just be fucking with
everybody because that's the way it is.

5577
02:49:37,950 --> 02:49:38,350
Yeah,

5578
02:49:38,350 --> 02:49:40,120
I've thought that for a little while.

5579
02:49:40,121 --> 02:49:40,390
I don't know.

5580
02:49:40,390 --> 02:49:40,830
I mean,

5581
02:49:40,830 --> 02:49:43,650
we never know really exactly
what anybody's doing a.

5582
02:49:43,920 --> 02:49:44,291
I mean,

5583
02:49:44,291 --> 02:49:46,140
you got youtube and you know,

5584
02:49:46,330 --> 02:49:49,510
don't ever know what direction
they're moving in and a,

5585
02:49:50,740 --> 02:49:52,300
he could be totally different person and

5586
02:49:52,880 --> 02:49:55,180
no in real life.

5587
02:49:55,290 --> 02:49:56,123
Uh,

5588
02:49:56,380 --> 02:49:58,720
well not what I mean

5589
02:49:59,730 --> 02:50:02,040
when you're not around a
camera and an audience.

5590
02:50:02,340 --> 02:50:03,173
I don't know.

5591
02:50:05,030 --> 02:50:05,863
I Dunno,

5592
02:50:05,990 --> 02:50:06,970
I've listened to it.

5593
02:50:08,710 --> 02:50:13,710
I've listened to probably a few hours
worth of his last few streams and uh,

5594
02:50:17,680 --> 02:50:18,700
I've always thought like,

5595
02:50:18,730 --> 02:50:19,563
you know,

5596
02:50:20,390 --> 02:50:23,500
I don't necessarily think
the moon landing was faked,

5597
02:50:23,501 --> 02:50:24,940
but even if it was,

5598
02:50:26,050 --> 02:50:26,883
you know,

5599
02:50:27,120 --> 02:50:28,000
if it was,

5600
02:50:28,001 --> 02:50:28,570
it wasn't,

5601
02:50:28,570 --> 02:50:31,540
it wouldn't give me any more faith

5602
02:50:32,470 --> 02:50:33,303
in,

5603
02:50:35,020 --> 02:50:35,591
excuse me,

5604
02:50:35,591 --> 02:50:40,300
in the intelligence agencies or the
federal government telling you the truth.

5605
02:50:41,260 --> 02:50:42,610
I mean already,

5606
02:50:42,670 --> 02:50:43,001
you know,

5607
02:50:43,001 --> 02:50:43,834
the,

5608
02:50:44,560 --> 02:50:46,030
the state is there to,

5609
02:50:46,190 --> 02:50:47,023
you know,

5610
02:50:48,450 --> 02:50:50,820
in its capacity now is there to deceive.

5611
02:50:50,910 --> 02:50:51,743
I mean,

5612
02:50:52,140 --> 02:50:55,920
doesn't want people to
know the state of war.

5613
02:50:56,520 --> 02:50:57,353
The state of,

5614
02:50:57,440 --> 02:50:58,230
you know,

5615
02:50:58,230 --> 02:50:59,940
made that mistake in Vietnam.

5616
02:51:00,870 --> 02:51:01,280
I mean,

5617
02:51:01,280 --> 02:51:01,650
uh,

5618
02:51:01,650 --> 02:51:06,210
showing the effects of a war on TV,

5619
02:51:06,211 --> 02:51:06,510
you know,

5620
02:51:06,510 --> 02:51:07,550
won't happen now,

5621
02:51:09,930 --> 02:51:11,150
but you never hear anything.

5622
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:12,013
So,

5623
02:51:12,580 --> 02:51:13,413
I mean,

5624
02:51:13,690 --> 02:51:14,523
not that

5625
02:51:14,740 --> 02:51:16,870
that's what he's constantly railing about.

5626
02:51:16,930 --> 02:51:17,290
Oh,

5627
02:51:17,290 --> 02:51:17,561
you know,

5628
02:51:17,561 --> 02:51:21,850
the federal government or the intelligence
agencies are lying to people in the

5629
02:51:21,851 --> 02:51:22,271
military.

5630
02:51:22,271 --> 02:51:23,650
Industrial Complex is lying.

5631
02:51:23,651 --> 02:51:24,484
That's not what he's going.

5632
02:51:24,570 --> 02:51:27,190
He's going on specifically
about the moon landing,

5633
02:51:27,191 --> 02:51:27,910
being fake,

5634
02:51:27,910 --> 02:51:28,091
but,

5635
02:51:28,091 --> 02:51:28,924
you know,

5636
02:51:30,150 --> 02:51:31,300
I don't really care how.

5637
02:51:32,240 --> 02:51:32,510
Yeah,

5638
02:51:32,510 --> 02:51:33,350
I don't really care you.

5639
02:51:33,470 --> 02:51:34,530
I don't really care either.

5640
02:51:34,610 --> 02:51:34,970
A,

5641
02:51:34,970 --> 02:51:37,440
if you've ever seen
the movie interstellar.

5642
02:51:38,530 --> 02:51:39,363
Yeah.

5643
02:51:39,890 --> 02:51:41,420
Was it the

5644
02:51:43,060 --> 02:51:43,731
Mcconnell here?

5645
02:51:43,731 --> 02:51:44,090
River?

5646
02:51:44,090 --> 02:51:44,301
Yeah.

5647
02:51:44,301 --> 02:51:44,750
Okay.

5648
02:51:44,750 --> 02:51:44,961
They,

5649
02:51:44,961 --> 02:51:45,794
uh,

5650
02:51:46,010 --> 02:51:49,250
they say in school there that the moon
landing was faked just so that they could

5651
02:51:49,251 --> 02:51:52,960
defeat the Russians would expend so
many resources that it would cause the

5652
02:51:53,160 --> 02:51:55,220
article apps to try to catch up.

5653
02:51:57,590 --> 02:51:58,423
Yeah.

5654
02:52:01,680 --> 02:52:03,780
Uh Huh.

5655
02:52:08,050 --> 02:52:08,291
But,

5656
02:52:08,291 --> 02:52:08,711
uh,

5657
02:52:08,711 --> 02:52:09,191
I mean,

5658
02:52:09,191 --> 02:52:10,320
I think that's probably bullshit,

5659
02:52:10,360 --> 02:52:10,920
but I,

5660
02:52:10,920 --> 02:52:11,753
I think,

5661
02:52:11,860 --> 02:52:12,693
uh,

5662
02:52:12,850 --> 02:52:15,220
I think there's enough evidence
that we went to the moon to make it.

5663
02:52:16,150 --> 02:52:16,440
I mean,

5664
02:52:16,440 --> 02:52:16,891
I'm,

5665
02:52:16,891 --> 02:52:17,130
I'm,

5666
02:52:17,130 --> 02:52:20,860
I'm willing to entertain the idea that
it didn't happen just because I'm open

5667
02:52:20,861 --> 02:52:21,221
minded,

5668
02:52:21,221 --> 02:52:22,160
but um,

5669
02:52:22,690 --> 02:52:24,610
I'm not convinced that it didn't happen,

5670
02:52:24,611 --> 02:52:25,660
so yeah,

5671
02:52:27,070 --> 02:52:28,480
I'm pretty convinced to happens.

5672
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:31,270
But if something popped up and it was,

5673
02:52:31,330 --> 02:52:33,850
I thought it was reasonable
evidence and I've considered it.

5674
02:52:33,920 --> 02:52:34,550
No,

5675
02:52:34,550 --> 02:52:34,750
no,

5676
02:52:34,750 --> 02:52:35,583
I'm not close minded.

5677
02:52:36,440 --> 02:52:37,273
Yeah.

5678
02:52:38,150 --> 02:52:39,830
Ultimately I think that's all fine.

5679
02:52:39,890 --> 02:52:40,723
I think it's pointless though.

5680
02:52:40,950 --> 02:52:41,783
Gutierrez.

5681
02:52:42,470 --> 02:52:43,303
Yeah.

5682
02:52:43,310 --> 02:52:43,970
Well,

5683
02:52:43,970 --> 02:52:44,271
yeah,

5684
02:52:44,271 --> 02:52:45,200
I think there's enough.

5685
02:52:52,250 --> 02:52:53,100
You went blank there,

5686
02:52:53,700 --> 02:52:54,380
you know,

5687
02:52:54,380 --> 02:52:55,820
Benjamin brings up the.

5688
02:52:56,460 --> 02:52:56,920
Oh,

5689
02:52:56,920 --> 02:52:58,490
all the telemetry data is

5690
02:52:58,800 --> 02:52:59,633
in

5691
02:53:01,560 --> 02:53:02,181
erased,

5692
02:53:02,181 --> 02:53:02,821
deleted.

5693
02:53:02,821 --> 02:53:04,590
The tapes have been written over.

5694
02:53:05,490 --> 02:53:05,731
It's like,

5695
02:53:05,731 --> 02:53:05,881
well,

5696
02:53:05,881 --> 02:53:07,620
I don't necessarily think that's true.

5697
02:53:07,710 --> 02:53:11,730
I mean I've definitely
found that it is true.

5698
02:53:11,731 --> 02:53:14,070
It's like it could just
be like a stupid accident.

5699
02:53:14,071 --> 02:53:19,071
Like I wouldn't put up to malice what
can be excused this stupid or it's just

5700
02:53:19,200 --> 02:53:20,130
hired the intern.

5701
02:53:20,131 --> 02:53:21,840
The intern works for free,

5702
02:53:21,860 --> 02:53:23,130
doesn't know what the fuck he's doing.

5703
02:53:23,460 --> 02:53:24,900
Someone tells them to go do something.

5704
02:53:24,901 --> 02:53:26,310
He does it and it's like,

5705
02:53:26,311 --> 02:53:26,491
wait,

5706
02:53:26,491 --> 02:53:27,324
what did you do?

5707
02:53:30,220 --> 02:53:30,521
Oh,

5708
02:53:30,521 --> 02:53:31,001
fuck,

5709
02:53:31,001 --> 02:53:32,100
you know,

5710
02:53:32,101 --> 02:53:32,934
is the moon

5711
02:53:34,710 --> 02:53:35,750
or a portion of it.

5712
02:53:35,770 --> 02:53:36,160
Yeah.

5713
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:36,430
Yeah.

5714
02:53:36,430 --> 02:53:38,020
Or a portion of it and it's like,

5715
02:53:38,021 --> 02:53:38,410
well,

5716
02:53:38,410 --> 02:53:40,220
let's just say it's all gone now.

5717
02:53:40,360 --> 02:53:41,193
That,

5718
02:53:42,000 --> 02:53:42,910
that wasn't my 19,

5719
02:53:42,911 --> 02:53:46,890
96 Christmas recording on
the vcr of home alone too.

5720
02:53:47,060 --> 02:53:47,670
It was,

5721
02:53:47,670 --> 02:53:49,720
it was the fucking moon landing.

5722
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:50,620
No.

5723
02:53:50,620 --> 02:53:51,453
Yeah,

5724
02:53:51,550 --> 02:53:51,881
yeah.

5725
02:53:51,881 --> 02:53:54,730
And that's the thing is that the right
hand never knows what the left hand's

5726
02:53:54,731 --> 02:53:55,540
doing it in,

5727
02:53:55,540 --> 02:53:55,781
you know,

5728
02:53:55,781 --> 02:53:57,010
when it comes to the federal government.

5729
02:53:57,250 --> 02:53:58,120
So it's like,

5730
02:53:58,600 --> 02:54:02,140
it's like don't think for
a second that you can put,

5731
02:54:02,940 --> 02:54:03,580
you know,

5732
02:54:03,580 --> 02:54:06,160
government and competency in the same,

5733
02:54:07,180 --> 02:54:08,013
uh,

5734
02:54:08,080 --> 02:54:10,240
in the same sentence.

5735
02:54:10,450 --> 02:54:11,283
You know what I mean?

5736
02:54:12,270 --> 02:54:13,060
It,

5737
02:54:13,060 --> 02:54:13,590
it's,

5738
02:54:13,590 --> 02:54:14,000
it's,

5739
02:54:14,000 --> 02:54:14,833
it's like

5740
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:15,230
I,

5741
02:54:15,230 --> 02:54:19,680
I work for the government and we
order like gloves that are there.

5742
02:54:20,300 --> 02:54:21,430
They are come with a number,

5743
02:54:21,431 --> 02:54:21,641
right.

5744
02:54:21,641 --> 02:54:23,200
So you write down the number,

5745
02:54:23,620 --> 02:54:23,861
you say,

5746
02:54:23,861 --> 02:54:25,810
I need this club from this company,

5747
02:54:26,010 --> 02:54:28,090
this number because it
meets all the standards.

5748
02:54:28,110 --> 02:54:28,943
Right.

5749
02:54:29,200 --> 02:54:31,330
And then they bring in these
clubs and the guidance.

5750
02:54:31,710 --> 02:54:33,330
You just looked at a picture or something.

5751
02:54:33,340 --> 02:54:35,620
Then you've got the goals that weren't
met or didn't meet the standard.

5752
02:54:35,621 --> 02:54:36,790
So I got my work,

5753
02:54:36,791 --> 02:54:38,800
puts his hands in chromic acid,

5754
02:54:39,220 --> 02:54:42,310
it leaks through and gets all over his
skin and burns the shit out of his hand

5755
02:54:43,150 --> 02:54:46,510
and it's because of the day went and
bought the glove that looked like it,

5756
02:54:46,511 --> 02:54:47,344
but it's not the,

5757
02:54:47,370 --> 02:54:48,640
it's not the specific number,

5758
02:54:48,760 --> 02:54:50,050
but we told them which one to get,

5759
02:54:50,140 --> 02:54:54,310
but they go ahead and pass down through
like four more people before it.

5760
02:54:54,311 --> 02:54:54,641
Finally,

5761
02:54:54,641 --> 02:54:55,960
the guy that actually orders it,

5762
02:54:56,500 --> 02:55:00,850
then he doesn't eat so disconnected from
the bottom of the pyramid there that he

5763
02:55:00,851 --> 02:55:01,810
doesn't know the difference.

5764
02:55:01,811 --> 02:55:04,010
So we end up getting fucked over a lot.

5765
02:55:04,170 --> 02:55:08,960
That's the procurement of basic supplies
with the government is ridiculously

5766
02:55:09,950 --> 02:55:10,783
convoluted.

5767
02:55:10,910 --> 02:55:12,380
Like it shouldn't be,

5768
02:55:12,500 --> 02:55:13,070
but it is.

5769
02:55:13,070 --> 02:55:14,600
It's funny because I was thinking,

5770
02:55:15,100 --> 02:55:15,710
uh,

5771
02:55:15,710 --> 02:55:16,010
you know,

5772
02:55:16,010 --> 02:55:19,670
it's still in the back of my mind going
into the air force into a contracting,

5773
02:55:19,910 --> 02:55:21,560
which is basically the guy who.

5774
02:55:22,010 --> 02:55:22,221
I mean,

5775
02:55:22,221 --> 02:55:25,970
that's what I would want to do because
it has the best when you get out of the

5776
02:55:26,210 --> 02:55:27,890
military as one of the best.

5777
02:55:29,490 --> 02:55:30,323
Yeah.

5778
02:55:31,270 --> 02:55:33,370
Returns I guess in the civilian world.

5779
02:55:33,371 --> 02:55:33,611
I mean,

5780
02:55:33,611 --> 02:55:33,790
you,

5781
02:55:33,790 --> 02:55:38,650
you can walk out of the military
Friday and on Monday walk in as a,

5782
02:55:39,280 --> 02:55:41,770
basically you have a job almost
immediately in contracting,

5783
02:55:42,970 --> 02:55:43,311
but yeah,

5784
02:55:43,311 --> 02:55:44,350
it was one of the same thing.

5785
02:55:44,910 --> 02:55:46,120
But um,

5786
02:55:47,500 --> 02:55:48,333
yeah,

5787
02:55:48,730 --> 02:55:52,900
so that sucks that because you know,

5788
02:55:52,901 --> 02:55:53,734
there's,

5789
02:55:54,550 --> 02:55:56,410
it has to go through so many people that,

5790
02:55:56,460 --> 02:55:56,860
you know,

5791
02:55:56,860 --> 02:55:58,870
people end up getting hurt over it.

5792
02:56:02,170 --> 02:56:03,003
Yeah,

5793
02:56:03,420 --> 02:56:04,253
exactly.

5794
02:56:04,870 --> 02:56:05,703
That's,

5795
02:56:08,200 --> 02:56:09,033
but you know.

5796
02:56:10,150 --> 02:56:10,983
Yeah.

5797
02:56:11,280 --> 02:56:12,070
What,

5798
02:56:12,070 --> 02:56:12,500
how,

5799
02:56:12,500 --> 02:56:13,030
how are you,

5800
02:56:13,030 --> 02:56:14,830
how are your drinking laws in Florida?

5801
02:56:14,850 --> 02:56:17,620
Like do you like to walk around with
a beer in hand or how's that work?

5802
02:56:19,050 --> 02:56:19,883
Uh,

5803
02:56:21,460 --> 02:56:24,860
I don't know if you got to grab a beer
and walk down the street and a cop sees

5804
02:56:24,861 --> 02:56:24,980
you,

5805
02:56:24,980 --> 02:56:25,820
they're not going to care.

5806
02:56:25,821 --> 02:56:26,654
They're going to care.

5807
02:56:27,740 --> 02:56:28,071
Yeah.

5808
02:56:28,071 --> 02:56:29,690
I think you're going to care.

5809
02:56:30,010 --> 02:56:30,740
Um,

5810
02:56:30,740 --> 02:56:34,700
and there are actually some dry.

5811
02:56:36,300 --> 02:56:38,600
There are some dry counties,

5812
02:56:38,840 --> 02:56:39,980
I think there in Alabama,

5813
02:56:39,990 --> 02:56:40,823
not too far from it

5814
02:56:41,110 --> 02:56:41,943
here.

5815
02:56:44,160 --> 02:56:45,630
It means he can't even
have a beer at home.

5816
02:56:46,440 --> 02:56:46,741
Yeah,

5817
02:56:46,741 --> 02:56:48,300
it means you can't buy alcohol.

5818
02:56:48,370 --> 02:56:49,210
Uh Oh,

5819
02:56:51,310 --> 02:56:51,980
at all.

5820
02:56:51,980 --> 02:56:52,390
Uh,

5821
02:56:52,390 --> 02:56:53,223
I believe,

5822
02:56:53,930 --> 02:56:54,710
um,

5823
02:56:54,710 --> 02:56:55,730
when I looked at it,

5824
02:56:55,750 --> 02:56:57,340
it might just be on the weekends,

5825
02:56:57,341 --> 02:56:58,174
but I,

5826
02:56:58,210 --> 02:56:59,920
for some reason I remember that actually.

5827
02:57:00,310 --> 02:57:03,130
I mean it may be that there's
dry counties for some reason.

5828
02:57:03,131 --> 02:57:07,570
I'm remembering having the conversations
with some coworkers because,

5829
02:57:07,600 --> 02:57:07,811
you know,

5830
02:57:07,811 --> 02:57:08,860
I'm kind of new here.

5831
02:57:08,861 --> 02:57:13,390
I mean the part of the reason that I've
not necessarily just doing the youtube

5832
02:57:13,391 --> 02:57:17,950
thing but kind of on here is I haven't
really made that many friends here,

5833
02:57:17,951 --> 02:57:18,281
you know,

5834
02:57:18,281 --> 02:57:20,590
I don't really go out and do that much.

5835
02:57:20,591 --> 02:57:23,280
So that's tough when
he moved to a new area.

5836
02:57:23,430 --> 02:57:23,920
Yeah,

5837
02:57:23,920 --> 02:57:27,480
I'm on the Internet a
whole lot more and uh,

5838
02:57:28,000 --> 02:57:28,211
you know,

5839
02:57:28,211 --> 02:57:31,310
so they're telling me about some
of these areas and yet I don't,

5840
02:57:31,340 --> 02:57:32,500
I think in this town,

5841
02:57:32,960 --> 02:57:33,793
crestview,

5842
02:57:34,270 --> 02:57:35,440
and I think maybe in,

5843
02:57:35,530 --> 02:57:36,730
I don't know if it's all Florida,

5844
02:57:36,731 --> 02:57:40,870
that probably just the county
that you can't buy alcohol

5845
02:57:42,830 --> 02:57:47,830
past a certain time and you
can't buy alcohol on Sundays.

5846
02:57:53,560 --> 02:57:54,393
I don't know.

5847
02:57:54,580 --> 02:57:55,340
Yeah,

5848
02:57:55,340 --> 02:57:56,021
I don't care.

5849
02:57:56,021 --> 02:57:57,190
I don't drink that much anyway.

5850
02:57:57,191 --> 02:57:57,460
You know,

5851
02:57:57,460 --> 02:58:00,550
like every once in awhile
when I was in Chicago,

5852
02:58:00,551 --> 02:58:00,810
you know,

5853
02:58:00,810 --> 02:58:03,450
we'd to nice restaurants and they'd serve,

5854
02:58:03,500 --> 02:58:04,050
you know,

5855
02:58:04,050 --> 02:58:09,050
nice craft beer and you drink a pint of
something that's $20 and you think it's

5856
02:58:10,441 --> 02:58:12,180
overpriced and then you
taste it and it's like,

5857
02:58:12,181 --> 02:58:12,850
oh my God,

5858
02:58:12,850 --> 02:58:14,130
turn hardly tastes like beer.

5859
02:58:14,131 --> 02:58:18,660
And it's like the $20 was worth it
and you never tasted that again.

5860
02:58:18,690 --> 02:58:18,901
You know,

5861
02:58:18,901 --> 02:58:22,820
you definitely not going to
get any domestic shit that.

5862
02:58:24,190 --> 02:58:24,330
Well,

5863
02:58:24,330 --> 02:58:26,410
I don't really integrate too much.

5864
02:58:27,160 --> 02:58:27,330
Yeah,

5865
02:58:27,330 --> 02:58:27,640
I don't.

5866
02:58:27,640 --> 02:58:29,350
I usually just have a beer.

5867
02:58:29,351 --> 02:58:30,610
It's like after the hockey game,

5868
02:58:30,720 --> 02:58:32,230
here's a beer after a game,

5869
02:58:32,270 --> 02:58:34,450
like it's like drinking gold to say,

5870
02:58:35,900 --> 02:58:37,130
I kind of described under the word.

5871
02:58:37,140 --> 02:58:39,850
I remember the first time
I played a soccer game,

5872
02:58:40,480 --> 02:58:41,440
they had a beer after,

5873
02:58:41,441 --> 02:58:43,370
it was like Canadian Molson Canadian.

5874
02:58:43,490 --> 02:58:44,620
It's absolute garbage.

5875
02:58:44,980 --> 02:58:47,020
And it tasted like heaven.

5876
02:58:47,021 --> 02:58:47,830
Like I was,

5877
02:58:47,830 --> 02:58:50,260
I was drinking like the series of angels,

5878
02:58:50,261 --> 02:58:51,094
you know,

5879
02:58:51,120 --> 02:58:53,800
and it was so fucking refreshing.

5880
02:58:54,240 --> 02:58:54,840
Um,

5881
02:58:54,840 --> 02:58:57,160
and then so now I appear
after every hockey game.

5882
02:58:57,280 --> 02:58:57,850
It makes it,

5883
02:58:57,850 --> 02:59:00,700
makes the game even if you
lose or you lose or win,

5884
02:59:00,701 --> 02:59:00,891
it's,

5885
02:59:00,891 --> 02:59:01,724
it's still good.

5886
02:59:01,800 --> 02:59:02,633
Yeah.

5887
02:59:03,050 --> 02:59:03,350
Yeah.

5888
02:59:03,350 --> 02:59:05,320
Beard does taste like socks wet sometimes,

5889
02:59:05,321 --> 02:59:06,430
but if you have some,

5890
02:59:06,490 --> 02:59:07,960
if you have good beer that's not so bad.

5891
02:59:08,220 --> 02:59:08,820
Yeah.

5892
02:59:08,820 --> 02:59:10,050
Light Beers,

5893
02:59:10,070 --> 02:59:10,590
you know,

5894
02:59:10,590 --> 02:59:13,200
domestic beers tastes like sex wet.

5895
02:59:13,201 --> 02:59:17,190
But I mean you start getting
into the high end craft beer and

5896
02:59:18,370 --> 02:59:19,203
uh,

5897
02:59:19,330 --> 02:59:24,330
like you get three floyds which is a
company out of Indiana and I think they

5898
02:59:25,001 --> 02:59:30,001
have a festival once a year and they
serve a beer at that festival and you have

5899
02:59:31,751 --> 02:59:33,700
to buy tickets to.

5900
02:59:34,960 --> 02:59:39,960
You have to buy a Stein and tickets just
to drink the beer and it's dark horse

5901
02:59:40,481 --> 02:59:42,280
or something like that or dark Lord.

5902
02:59:42,910 --> 02:59:43,743
Um,

5903
02:59:44,350 --> 02:59:46,630
but then three floyds makes
other like they make a pint,

5904
02:59:46,631 --> 02:59:47,500
I forget what it was,

5905
02:59:47,501 --> 02:59:48,334
but my buddy,

5906
02:59:48,660 --> 02:59:52,090
we were leaving Koumas which
is this metal bar they have.

5907
02:59:52,680 --> 02:59:53,980
It's a gourmet food,

5908
02:59:53,981 --> 02:59:58,420
like really high end food
burgers really high in Burgers.

5909
02:59:58,720 --> 02:59:59,553
Um,

5910
02:59:59,770 --> 03:00:03,100
and they're named after metal
bands like led Zeppelin,

5911
03:00:03,140 --> 03:00:04,090
Judas priest,

5912
03:00:04,700 --> 03:00:06,790
a ghost,

5913
03:00:06,791 --> 03:00:07,624
you know?

5914
03:00:08,940 --> 03:00:09,240
Yeah.

5915
03:00:09,240 --> 03:00:09,730
Anyway,

5916
03:00:09,730 --> 03:00:10,050
so,

5917
03:00:10,050 --> 03:00:10,920
and then they also serve,

5918
03:00:10,921 --> 03:00:15,921
they've got a whiskey bar and then
they also have a beer selection and as

5919
03:00:16,320 --> 03:00:16,561
leaving,

5920
03:00:16,561 --> 03:00:16,880
what time?

5921
03:00:16,880 --> 03:00:17,281
Everybody's like,

5922
03:00:17,281 --> 03:00:17,491
man,

5923
03:00:17,491 --> 03:00:18,220
you,

5924
03:00:18,220 --> 03:00:19,770
you want to try a $20 beer?

5925
03:00:20,500 --> 03:00:20,731
I'm like,

5926
03:00:20,731 --> 03:00:21,020
what,

5927
03:00:21,020 --> 03:00:21,480
what,

5928
03:00:21,480 --> 03:00:22,590
what are you talking about?

5929
03:00:23,250 --> 03:00:24,420
20 bucks man,

5930
03:00:24,421 --> 03:00:25,254
what the fuck?

5931
03:00:25,470 --> 03:00:26,070
And I,

5932
03:00:26,070 --> 03:00:27,400
and this is just before,

5933
03:00:27,510 --> 03:00:28,900
like a group of us were leaving.

5934
03:00:29,890 --> 03:00:31,350
I'm drinking it and I'm like,

5935
03:00:31,410 --> 03:00:32,101
oh my God,

5936
03:00:32,101 --> 03:00:33,330
this is so good.

5937
03:00:33,600 --> 03:00:33,961
And I,

5938
03:00:33,961 --> 03:00:34,620
I,

5939
03:00:34,620 --> 03:00:35,910
I can find out what that was.

5940
03:00:35,911 --> 03:00:36,744
But I mean,

5941
03:00:37,170 --> 03:00:39,640
once you have a real decent flavor,

5942
03:00:39,740 --> 03:00:41,830
a decent beer,

5943
03:00:41,860 --> 03:00:42,693
it's like,

5944
03:00:42,960 --> 03:00:43,261
yeah,

5945
03:00:43,261 --> 03:00:43,620
it's,

5946
03:00:43,620 --> 03:00:44,370
it's worth it.

5947
03:00:44,370 --> 03:00:45,203
But

5948
03:00:47,580 --> 03:00:47,791
that's,

5949
03:00:47,791 --> 03:00:48,624
it's a,

5950
03:00:49,840 --> 03:00:50,673
we have this,

5951
03:00:50,780 --> 03:00:54,010
we have this kind of cheap used to be
really cheap brand called Lucky Logger

5952
03:00:54,350 --> 03:00:55,060
[inaudible],

5953
03:00:55,060 --> 03:00:55,820
uh,

5954
03:00:55,820 --> 03:00:56,660
which we still have,

5955
03:00:56,661 --> 03:00:58,910
but it's just now it's more like a,

5956
03:00:59,740 --> 03:01:00,640
it's been,

5957
03:01:01,160 --> 03:01:04,360
it got so popular that it kind of
moved into the medium price bracket.

5958
03:01:04,361 --> 03:01:05,194
So,

5959
03:01:05,470 --> 03:01:08,020
but that's what we have at our
games basically every time.

5960
03:01:11,770 --> 03:01:15,070
I mean if I was at a party
or is I post playing a sport,

5961
03:01:15,071 --> 03:01:15,221
yeah,

5962
03:01:15,221 --> 03:01:16,900
I would have no problem drinking whatever,

5963
03:01:16,930 --> 03:01:17,763
you know,

5964
03:01:18,500 --> 03:01:21,010
for the longest time we drank keystones,

5965
03:01:21,040 --> 03:01:22,390
30 racks keystones,

5966
03:01:22,391 --> 03:01:23,224
you know,

5967
03:01:23,940 --> 03:01:25,530
I mean is what you do at colleges,

5968
03:01:25,570 --> 03:01:25,790
you know,

5969
03:01:25,790 --> 03:01:29,860
you go to a big college parties
and do the cheapest shit you can.

5970
03:01:29,980 --> 03:01:30,431
Yeah.

5971
03:01:30,431 --> 03:01:32,230
Kegs full of the cheapest shit possible.

5972
03:01:32,231 --> 03:01:34,990
Keystone now I used to,

5973
03:01:34,991 --> 03:01:35,550
uh,

5974
03:01:35,550 --> 03:01:36,400
but I'm,

5975
03:01:36,910 --> 03:01:38,020
I'm two years older than my brother,

5976
03:01:38,021 --> 03:01:43,021
so when I turned 19 I forget for him
for high school and I'd get like the

5977
03:01:43,841 --> 03:01:44,674
cheapest,

5978
03:01:44,680 --> 03:01:47,740
the cheapest beer with the highest
alcohol content and it's called the lucky

5979
03:01:47,741 --> 03:01:48,574
force eight.

5980
03:01:48,630 --> 03:01:49,463
It was like the,

5981
03:01:49,830 --> 03:01:52,240
it was so disgusting like the.

5982
03:01:52,370 --> 03:01:56,620
But he'd bring them to school to the
parties and he'd sell them two for five

5983
03:01:56,621 --> 03:01:56,981
bucks,

5984
03:01:56,981 --> 03:02:01,981
which is like if he sold I think 18 of
them and the 24 you could get six if you

5985
03:02:03,401 --> 03:02:05,830
had six TV smashed and uh,

5986
03:02:05,950 --> 03:02:08,950
and you could sell the rest and make
you pay for all the theory part.

5987
03:02:09,880 --> 03:02:11,560
Have two for five bucks though.

5988
03:02:11,561 --> 03:02:14,080
Is highway a fucking
robbery for those beers?

5989
03:02:14,081 --> 03:02:15,370
But I mean the kids,

5990
03:02:15,371 --> 03:02:16,151
they can't get the beer.

5991
03:02:16,151 --> 03:02:17,230
So it's like you.

5992
03:02:18,110 --> 03:02:18,943
Yeah.

5993
03:02:21,170 --> 03:02:21,750
And uh,

5994
03:02:21,750 --> 03:02:22,320
yeah,

5995
03:02:22,320 --> 03:02:24,270
it was kind of funny
but I remember whenever,

5996
03:02:24,370 --> 03:02:26,100
I think I tried one once and it was like,

5997
03:02:26,620 --> 03:02:27,940
like regular lucky,

5998
03:02:28,510 --> 03:02:28,871
you know,

5999
03:02:28,871 --> 03:02:29,561
it's definitely,

6000
03:02:29,561 --> 03:02:30,550
it tastes like beer,

6001
03:02:30,780 --> 03:02:33,970
but like lucky for say like
it tastes like horse piss.

6002
03:02:34,100 --> 03:02:34,990
Was it like,

6003
03:02:35,200 --> 03:02:36,200
was it a uh,

6004
03:02:36,400 --> 03:02:37,233
I know we had,

6005
03:02:37,300 --> 03:02:38,770
I don't know about what
you're talking about,

6006
03:02:38,771 --> 03:02:40,690
but then we had like
steel reserve which was a

6007
03:02:41,620 --> 03:02:42,453
uh,

6008
03:02:43,870 --> 03:02:45,680
steel reserve was um,

6009
03:02:46,200 --> 03:02:47,390
was the percentage of,

6010
03:02:48,430 --> 03:02:48,970
I dunno,

6011
03:02:48,970 --> 03:02:51,220
but it super cheap.

6012
03:02:51,610 --> 03:02:53,230
I don't know that it was that much higher.

6013
03:02:55,480 --> 03:02:56,290
Oh yeah.

6014
03:02:56,290 --> 03:02:58,120
Well I think there's more liquor.

6015
03:02:58,121 --> 03:02:58,954
We have that too.

6016
03:02:59,170 --> 03:03:02,050
They always get sold out because I'm
really close to a native reserve,

6017
03:03:02,530 --> 03:03:02,951
but the,

6018
03:03:02,951 --> 03:03:03,820
so the malt liquor,

6019
03:03:03,821 --> 03:03:08,200
but then there's like the highest beer
was the highest grade that was like mass

6020
03:03:08,270 --> 03:03:10,270
produces eight percent here.

6021
03:03:10,690 --> 03:03:11,050
Um,

6022
03:03:11,050 --> 03:03:13,120
you can get like higher
but they're more expensive.

6023
03:03:13,660 --> 03:03:14,493
Um,

6024
03:03:14,620 --> 03:03:16,630
but just for like the
shit beer eight percent.

6025
03:03:16,690 --> 03:03:17,523
And it was like,

6026
03:03:19,310 --> 03:03:21,340
the reserve is like between,

6027
03:03:21,341 --> 03:03:23,740
I'm looking at Google page six and eight,

6028
03:03:23,860 --> 03:03:24,191
and it,

6029
03:03:24,191 --> 03:03:24,880
man,

6030
03:03:24,880 --> 03:03:25,510
I had it,

6031
03:03:25,510 --> 03:03:26,343
I tried it,

6032
03:03:26,700 --> 03:03:27,820
we went down to Carbondale,

6033
03:03:27,821 --> 03:03:30,200
which is a huge party college.

6034
03:03:30,201 --> 03:03:30,430
And

6035
03:03:30,430 --> 03:03:31,263
uh,

6036
03:03:31,710 --> 03:03:32,543
Elena and

6037
03:03:33,100 --> 03:03:34,050
it is terrible.

6038
03:03:34,580 --> 03:03:35,760
It was awful.

6039
03:03:37,890 --> 03:03:38,850
And there's nothing else.

6040
03:03:38,851 --> 03:03:39,511
It's whatever.

6041
03:03:39,511 --> 03:03:40,344
So

6042
03:03:44,540 --> 03:03:45,373
I,

6043
03:03:45,500 --> 03:03:47,540
you've got to do

6044
03:03:49,270 --> 03:03:52,920
a 1000 miles in Russia when I was like 17,

6045
03:03:52,930 --> 03:03:53,763
there was like,

6046
03:03:53,990 --> 03:03:57,110
if you're thinking you had to be 13 to
have fear or something like that when in

6047
03:03:57,120 --> 03:03:57,500
the restroom.

6048
03:03:57,500 --> 03:03:58,430
So I was like 17.

6049
03:03:58,431 --> 03:03:58,970
So it was totally,

6050
03:03:58,970 --> 03:04:01,230
I was like getting an hour and a,

6051
03:04:02,150 --> 03:04:06,950
it's a in this under or in Moscow
and it's like this underground pub,

6052
03:04:07,110 --> 03:04:10,250
just like you have to go down into the
basement or whatever and it's in there.

6053
03:04:10,790 --> 03:04:11,880
And everyone's smoking,

6054
03:04:11,910 --> 03:04:12,950
like assuming I don't smoke,

6055
03:04:12,951 --> 03:04:14,330
but everyone was smoking like a chimney.

6056
03:04:14,840 --> 03:04:18,380
So the entire place is just absolutely
filled with smoke from one end to the

6057
03:04:18,381 --> 03:04:18,740
other.

6058
03:04:18,740 --> 03:04:19,131
You couldn't,

6059
03:04:19,131 --> 03:04:19,330
like,

6060
03:04:19,330 --> 03:04:20,210
there's a big long table.

6061
03:04:20,211 --> 03:04:23,180
They were all sitting at
the public 20 of us and uh,

6062
03:04:23,181 --> 03:04:24,410
you couldn't see the other end of it.

6063
03:04:24,410 --> 03:04:24,891
And everyone's like,

6064
03:04:24,891 --> 03:04:25,730
smoking like crazy.

6065
03:04:26,180 --> 03:04:26,301
Oh.

6066
03:04:26,301 --> 03:04:27,860
And I went to the Moscow,

6067
03:04:28,640 --> 03:04:29,171
Moscow,

6068
03:04:29,171 --> 03:04:32,000
a circus and the same.

6069
03:04:32,030 --> 03:04:32,601
Same thing.

6070
03:04:32,601 --> 03:04:34,250
You can't smoke inside the building.

6071
03:04:34,460 --> 03:04:35,330
You can only smoke inside.

6072
03:04:35,380 --> 03:04:37,130
The people would ever want
to go to the bathrooms.

6073
03:04:37,580 --> 03:04:38,413
And uh,

6074
03:04:38,620 --> 03:04:39,453
you,

6075
03:04:39,540 --> 03:04:39,801
you know,

6076
03:04:39,801 --> 03:04:42,770
how like you go to the bathroom and it's
like a physical last story you can see

6077
03:04:42,771 --> 03:04:43,490
through it.

6078
03:04:43,490 --> 03:04:44,510
But this was a glass door,

6079
03:04:44,511 --> 03:04:45,470
but you couldn't see through it.

6080
03:04:45,500 --> 03:04:48,500
It looked like frosted glass
because everyone would go
in there and smoked their

6081
03:04:48,501 --> 03:04:49,334
brains out.

6082
03:04:49,430 --> 03:04:50,020
So,

6083
03:04:50,020 --> 03:04:50,320
uh,

6084
03:04:50,320 --> 03:04:51,290
and there's no events.

6085
03:04:51,440 --> 03:04:51,920
So you go,

6086
03:04:51,920 --> 03:04:52,910
I had to take a piss.

6087
03:04:52,911 --> 03:04:57,911
So I like fucking held my breath ran in
and I went in like showered and cleaned

6088
03:04:58,341 --> 03:04:59,780
and I came out just like Rican,

6089
03:04:59,781 --> 03:05:00,614
like cigarettes.

6090
03:05:00,920 --> 03:05:02,960
And I couldn't hold my
breath the whole time.

6091
03:05:02,961 --> 03:05:03,490
I had to,

6092
03:05:03,490 --> 03:05:05,090
I had to take one breath walls in there.

6093
03:05:05,420 --> 03:05:05,931
Oh God.

6094
03:05:05,931 --> 03:05:06,764
It was like roads,

6095
03:05:07,200 --> 03:05:07,950
like sucking,

6096
03:05:07,950 --> 03:05:08,960
sucking on a chimney.

6097
03:05:10,380 --> 03:05:13,070
That was pretty funny.

6098
03:05:14,740 --> 03:05:15,011
Yeah.

6099
03:05:15,011 --> 03:05:16,930
It's one thing I kind of don't mind.

6100
03:05:16,931 --> 03:05:17,590
I mean,

6101
03:05:17,590 --> 03:05:18,850
in the Chicago land area,

6102
03:05:18,851 --> 03:05:19,091
you know,

6103
03:05:19,091 --> 03:05:19,870
you can't smoke.

6104
03:05:19,870 --> 03:05:20,081
I mean,

6105
03:05:20,081 --> 03:05:22,330
it's gotten worse and worse
and for people who smoked,

6106
03:05:22,331 --> 03:05:22,901
they ate it,

6107
03:05:22,901 --> 03:05:23,734
but it was,

6108
03:05:23,980 --> 03:05:25,480
you can't smoke inside of a building,

6109
03:05:25,481 --> 03:05:27,660
you can't smoke within
20 feet of the building.

6110
03:05:27,661 --> 03:05:31,540
You can't smoke within 50 or
100 because buildings are like,

6111
03:05:31,890 --> 03:05:32,081
well,

6112
03:05:32,081 --> 03:05:32,251
not,

6113
03:05:32,251 --> 03:05:37,250
you just can't smoke in Chicago because
buildings are only 50 feet from you.

6114
03:05:38,640 --> 03:05:39,230
Same here.

6115
03:05:39,230 --> 03:05:43,400
You can't smoke within
10 feet of a 30 feet.

6116
03:05:43,401 --> 03:05:45,920
Now have like a door or
an entrance or a window.

6117
03:05:46,300 --> 03:05:46,760
Yeah.

6118
03:05:46,760 --> 03:05:51,350
So that basically you have to stand on
the yellow line in the middle of the road

6119
03:05:51,440 --> 03:05:52,273
if you want to smoke.

6120
03:05:52,280 --> 03:05:53,113
Oh,

6121
03:05:54,170 --> 03:05:54,500
I mean,

6122
03:05:54,500 --> 03:05:55,333
I'm not,

6123
03:05:55,910 --> 03:05:57,310
I shouldn't be against it.

6124
03:05:57,470 --> 03:05:59,360
You principle of freedom,

6125
03:05:59,361 --> 03:06:00,620
but I hate smoking.

6126
03:06:02,120 --> 03:06:02,953
Oh yeah.

6127
03:06:05,580 --> 03:06:07,860
It's just like a weird.

6128
03:06:07,930 --> 03:06:08,431
I don't care,

6129
03:06:08,431 --> 03:06:10,730
but like tobacco and it
seems pointless to me.

6130
03:06:10,740 --> 03:06:11,530
It's just like,

6131
03:06:11,530 --> 03:06:12,410
it smells bad,

6132
03:06:12,430 --> 03:06:13,380
makes you smell bad.

6133
03:06:13,980 --> 03:06:14,813
Um,

6134
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:16,350
it gives you cancer.

6135
03:06:16,380 --> 03:06:18,710
I've had family members die
of cancer and just like a,

6136
03:06:18,840 --> 03:06:19,673
it's.

6137
03:06:19,830 --> 03:06:20,640
And they all smoke.

6138
03:06:20,640 --> 03:06:21,060
They usually,

6139
03:06:21,060 --> 03:06:22,350
they smoke the most of their lives.

6140
03:06:23,490 --> 03:06:24,750
It's just watching that.

6141
03:06:24,751 --> 03:06:25,321
It's just brutal.

6142
03:06:25,321 --> 03:06:26,154
So I don't know.

6143
03:06:26,760 --> 03:06:31,200
It'd be one thing if people grew tobacco
theirself and then dried it and rolled

6144
03:06:31,201 --> 03:06:31,321
it,

6145
03:06:31,321 --> 03:06:32,071
but who does that?

6146
03:06:32,071 --> 03:06:34,120
Nobody knows.

6147
03:06:34,140 --> 03:06:36,210
Illegal for too much.

6148
03:06:36,211 --> 03:06:37,340
A pain in the ass to Bravo.

6149
03:06:37,350 --> 03:06:38,183
Yeah.

6150
03:06:38,730 --> 03:06:40,740
It'd probably be a whole
lot more healthy for you,

6151
03:06:40,741 --> 03:06:41,491
but you did it that way.

6152
03:06:41,491 --> 03:06:41,940
I mean,

6153
03:06:41,940 --> 03:06:42,773
combusting,

6154
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:44,101
combusting,

6155
03:06:44,101 --> 03:06:45,180
any plant matter,

6156
03:06:45,510 --> 03:06:46,020
you know,

6157
03:06:46,020 --> 03:06:48,690
cannabis or tobacco is bad,

6158
03:06:48,750 --> 03:06:49,583
you know,

6159
03:06:49,870 --> 03:06:50,340
uh,

6160
03:06:50,340 --> 03:06:54,960
we'll combine that physical
process of burning.

6161
03:06:55,740 --> 03:06:56,310
Is

6162
03:06:56,310 --> 03:06:56,480
it,

6163
03:06:56,480 --> 03:06:56,730
you know,

6164
03:06:56,730 --> 03:06:59,600
there's carcinogens in cannabis
and this carcinogens in,

6165
03:07:00,230 --> 03:07:01,063
uh,

6166
03:07:02,660 --> 03:07:03,493
uh,

6167
03:07:03,770 --> 03:07:03,950
well,

6168
03:07:03,950 --> 03:07:04,940
anything that's been radiated,

6169
03:07:04,941 --> 03:07:05,774
it's going to have like,

6170
03:07:05,940 --> 03:07:06,640
you know,

6171
03:07:06,640 --> 03:07:08,030
Carson agenda basically.

6172
03:07:08,180 --> 03:07:09,230
Is it tobacco?

6173
03:07:09,770 --> 03:07:10,970
Is it a rick irradiated?

6174
03:07:11,280 --> 03:07:12,560
Oh No,

6175
03:07:12,561 --> 03:07:12,801
it's not,

6176
03:07:12,801 --> 03:07:13,400
it's just that because,

6177
03:07:13,400 --> 03:07:13,630
uh,

6178
03:07:13,630 --> 03:07:14,080
I guess,

6179
03:07:14,080 --> 03:07:14,913
um,

6180
03:07:15,610 --> 03:07:18,780
like when you break those
carbon bonds and burning it.

6181
03:07:19,300 --> 03:07:19,470
Oh,

6182
03:07:19,470 --> 03:07:20,130
you see,

6183
03:07:20,130 --> 03:07:20,990
you're explaining to me.

6184
03:07:21,140 --> 03:07:21,291
Oh,

6185
03:07:21,291 --> 03:07:24,800
would I didn't understand what
happens through the admission process.

6186
03:07:24,920 --> 03:07:25,753
Okay.

6187
03:07:26,720 --> 03:07:26,990
Yeah.

6188
03:07:26,990 --> 03:07:31,990
The carbon bonds break and
I'm at reaction creates like,

6189
03:07:33,770 --> 03:07:35,900
it releases carcinogens basically.

6190
03:07:36,270 --> 03:07:39,050
But that's how I felt.

6191
03:07:39,051 --> 03:07:39,980
That's what I was told anyways.

6192
03:07:40,020 --> 03:07:40,670
I don't know if I could,

6193
03:07:40,670 --> 03:07:41,420
I could be wrong.

6194
03:07:41,420 --> 03:07:42,180
I could be bullshitting.

6195
03:07:42,180 --> 03:07:42,391
No,

6196
03:07:42,391 --> 03:07:42,710
no,

6197
03:07:42,710 --> 03:07:43,120
but I,

6198
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:43,953
I'm not trying to,

6199
03:07:44,090 --> 03:07:44,641
like if I,

6200
03:07:44,641 --> 03:07:44,990
if I'm,

6201
03:07:44,990 --> 03:07:45,531
if I'm lying.

6202
03:07:45,531 --> 03:07:46,370
So I guess

6203
03:07:48,030 --> 03:07:48,920
that's what I was told.

6204
03:07:48,980 --> 03:07:49,813
I could be wrong.

6205
03:07:50,570 --> 03:07:51,403
I hate,

6206
03:07:51,410 --> 03:07:53,660
I hate cold and things where
I'm not completely sure,

6207
03:07:53,661 --> 03:07:54,680
but I know.

6208
03:07:55,230 --> 03:07:55,500
Yeah.

6209
03:07:55,500 --> 03:07:55,910
Well,

6210
03:07:55,910 --> 03:07:59,000
I mean if I didn't do that I
probably wouldn't have said it

6211
03:08:00,770 --> 03:08:03,770
more than just my own personal
stories during this whole thing.

6212
03:08:03,771 --> 03:08:04,250
I mean,

6213
03:08:04,250 --> 03:08:04,820
you,

6214
03:08:04,820 --> 03:08:07,850
you've contributed probably
90 percent of this,

6215
03:08:09,050 --> 03:08:09,883
but uh,

6216
03:08:09,900 --> 03:08:10,733
oh,

6217
03:08:11,760 --> 03:08:12,593
I'll try,

6218
03:08:12,650 --> 03:08:13,520
I'll try my best,

6219
03:08:15,520 --> 03:08:16,940
but I don't know.

6220
03:08:16,941 --> 03:08:17,180
Yeah,

6221
03:08:17,180 --> 03:08:19,100
he's not upset about smoking.

6222
03:08:19,340 --> 03:08:22,340
I mean I find it kind of
interesting that Nazi Germany band,

6223
03:08:23,210 --> 03:08:24,860
I mean obviously the SS and

6224
03:08:25,180 --> 03:08:26,013
yeah,

6225
03:08:26,460 --> 03:08:28,320
probably they kinda didn't care.

6226
03:08:28,321 --> 03:08:31,350
So in the beginning didn't care
so much about their own smoking,

6227
03:08:31,351 --> 03:08:32,184
but

6228
03:08:33,540 --> 03:08:33,891
yeah,

6229
03:08:33,891 --> 03:08:35,400
I thought it was banned in Germany.

6230
03:08:36,520 --> 03:08:38,700
I'm not sure I've been reading
too that I think they did.

6231
03:08:38,970 --> 03:08:39,790
I think the worst.

6232
03:08:39,790 --> 03:08:42,270
There's videos or movies
that have them smoking,

6233
03:08:42,271 --> 03:08:44,010
so maybe they're not accurate,

6234
03:08:44,011 --> 03:08:44,970
but I don't know.

6235
03:08:45,660 --> 03:08:46,493
I haven't looked into it.

6236
03:08:46,710 --> 03:08:47,543
Yeah,

6237
03:08:48,510 --> 03:08:51,270
I wouldn't doubt like those
people with those ideas,

6238
03:08:51,530 --> 03:08:53,610
but back then they thought
smoking was healthy for,

6239
03:08:53,611 --> 03:08:54,440
you know,

6240
03:08:54,440 --> 03:08:54,830
I,

6241
03:08:54,830 --> 03:08:55,090
I,

6242
03:08:55,090 --> 03:08:55,923
I think that,

6243
03:08:56,010 --> 03:09:01,010
I think that there were studies done a
clear clinical trials that doctors had

6244
03:09:03,631 --> 03:09:05,730
done and they had determined that it was,

6245
03:09:06,710 --> 03:09:07,370
uh,

6246
03:09:07,370 --> 03:09:09,860
that it was unhealthy and
then it was just band.

6247
03:09:11,720 --> 03:09:12,050
Oh,

6248
03:09:12,050 --> 03:09:12,740
okay.

6249
03:09:12,740 --> 03:09:17,240
Well I know what I mean in the 19 fifties
they would like tell my grandmother

6250
03:09:17,360 --> 03:09:20,890
that smoking was good for
the baby because what it was,

6251
03:09:20,891 --> 03:09:21,500
was he like,

6252
03:09:21,500 --> 03:09:21,920
or no,

6253
03:09:21,920 --> 03:09:22,731
not when they're pregnant,

6254
03:09:22,731 --> 03:09:26,000
but it was good to smoke when you weren't
pregnant because you'd be breathing in

6255
03:09:26,001 --> 03:09:29,600
the smoke and then when you breathe out
it would take their theory was that it

6256
03:09:29,601 --> 03:09:31,820
would take all the bad
bugs and stuff with it,

6257
03:09:31,821 --> 03:09:32,900
like the viruses and stuff.

6258
03:09:33,110 --> 03:09:34,040
But it's total bullshit.

6259
03:09:34,041 --> 03:09:35,250
But um,

6260
03:09:35,530 --> 03:09:35,750
the,

6261
03:09:35,750 --> 03:09:37,010
the idea is kind of funny,

6262
03:09:37,070 --> 03:09:40,580
like it would use to recommend
smoking the people for their health.

6263
03:09:40,850 --> 03:09:41,650
Yeah.

6264
03:09:41,650 --> 03:09:42,483
Yeah.

6265
03:09:44,090 --> 03:09:46,970
I guess because maybe because they would
get so sick when they stopped that they

6266
03:09:47,030 --> 03:09:47,990
think maybe that was like,

6267
03:09:48,040 --> 03:09:51,680
and they were just like
desperately clinging to life
because of the cigarettes.

6268
03:09:55,290 --> 03:09:56,770
It's definitely a possibility,

6269
03:09:58,540 --> 03:09:59,860
a cursory.

6270
03:10:02,270 --> 03:10:07,210
But I'm going to have to get going here
because it's 2:00 now and I'm getting

6271
03:10:07,211 --> 03:10:08,044
pretty tired.

6272
03:10:08,380 --> 03:10:08,701
Yes.

6273
03:10:08,701 --> 03:10:09,940
Twelve o'clock here.

6274
03:10:10,530 --> 03:10:11,560
I'm pretty tired too.

6275
03:10:11,561 --> 03:10:12,180
So.

6276
03:10:12,180 --> 03:10:12,530
Oh,

6277
03:10:12,530 --> 03:10:13,960
it was good chocolate talking with you,

6278
03:10:13,961 --> 03:10:14,794
man.

6279
03:10:15,010 --> 03:10:15,580
You do?

6280
03:10:15,580 --> 03:10:16,150
Oh,

6281
03:10:16,150 --> 03:10:17,470
I'm down for doing it again if you're,

6282
03:10:17,650 --> 03:10:18,820
if you still want to do it again,

6283
03:10:18,860 --> 03:10:21,040
so let me know and I'll definitely,

6284
03:10:21,041 --> 03:10:21,720
uh,

6285
03:10:21,720 --> 03:10:23,800
try and construct more,

6286
03:10:24,120 --> 03:10:24,760
um,

6287
03:10:24,760 --> 03:10:26,470
for next time.

6288
03:10:27,120 --> 03:10:27,953
Um,

6289
03:10:28,350 --> 03:10:29,183
so I kinda know,

6290
03:10:31,150 --> 03:10:31,480
so.

6291
03:10:31,480 --> 03:10:32,160
No,

6292
03:10:32,160 --> 03:10:32,993
no,

6293
03:10:33,130 --> 03:10:33,310
no,

6294
03:10:33,310 --> 03:10:34,060
no worries at.

6295
03:10:34,060 --> 03:10:37,990
All I do is just read all the
time and read random random shit.

6296
03:10:37,991 --> 03:10:38,500
I try to,

6297
03:10:38,500 --> 03:10:40,030
I try to focus more now.

6298
03:10:40,420 --> 03:10:43,750
I'm basically because of the
things I've learned from Peterson,

6299
03:10:43,751 --> 03:10:44,690
but um,

6300
03:10:44,700 --> 03:10:44,980
I,

6301
03:10:44,980 --> 03:10:46,670
I just try to read as much as I can.

6302
03:10:47,380 --> 03:10:48,213
Um,

6303
03:10:49,080 --> 03:10:49,610
no

6304
03:10:49,610 --> 03:10:51,320
try to metabolize it I suppose.

6305
03:10:51,321 --> 03:10:52,940
But that's the key.

6306
03:10:52,941 --> 03:10:53,810
I think just reading,

6307
03:10:53,870 --> 03:10:55,250
reading classic literature,

6308
03:10:55,251 --> 03:10:55,610
reading,

6309
03:10:55,610 --> 03:10:55,851
reading,

6310
03:10:55,851 --> 03:10:57,440
things that are popular like in,

6311
03:10:57,500 --> 03:10:58,311
in the past.

6312
03:10:58,311 --> 03:10:59,570
I like op stuff.

6313
03:10:59,571 --> 03:11:00,351
I don't really care for her,

6314
03:11:00,351 --> 03:11:05,000
but like stuff that's rated as
good by like really smart people.

6315
03:11:05,060 --> 03:11:06,230
That's a good way to start.

6316
03:11:06,870 --> 03:11:07,703
Yeah.

6317
03:11:08,780 --> 03:11:11,150
So that's why I recommend
even even fiction.

6318
03:11:11,310 --> 03:11:12,143
This all good

6319
03:11:14,430 --> 03:11:15,350
because it gets fixed.

6320
03:11:15,390 --> 03:11:15,990
It's fixed.

6321
03:11:15,990 --> 03:11:17,060
It's kind of like a time capsule.

6322
03:11:17,061 --> 03:11:17,271
Right.

6323
03:11:17,271 --> 03:11:18,710
So you learn a little
bit about history too.

6324
03:11:21,120 --> 03:11:21,953
Yeah.

6325
03:11:24,980 --> 03:11:25,813
Yeah.

6326
03:11:26,250 --> 03:11:27,270
If you got anything,

6327
03:11:27,810 --> 03:11:28,230
uh,

6328
03:11:28,230 --> 03:11:28,550
that.

6329
03:11:28,550 --> 03:11:30,100
If you've got anything
you want me to talk to,

6330
03:11:30,140 --> 03:11:31,940
to maybe bring up next time,

6331
03:11:31,970 --> 03:11:33,770
I'm just to let me know.

6332
03:11:33,840 --> 03:11:34,130
I'll,

6333
03:11:34,130 --> 03:11:34,870
I'll look up,

6334
03:11:34,870 --> 03:11:35,150
I'll,

6335
03:11:35,150 --> 03:11:40,150
I'll try to see what I can learn about
it if I get a chance and then we'll have

6336
03:11:40,930 --> 03:11:41,763
to talk about next time

6337
03:11:43,350 --> 03:11:43,631
if I,

6338
03:11:43,631 --> 03:11:44,060
if I,

6339
03:11:44,060 --> 03:11:44,871
if I got anything else,

6340
03:11:44,871 --> 03:11:45,920
I'll just pass it on to you.

6341
03:11:46,640 --> 03:11:47,473
Please do.

6342
03:11:48,610 --> 03:11:49,020
Alright.

6343
03:11:49,020 --> 03:11:49,500
Alright,

6344
03:11:49,500 --> 03:11:50,333
I'll talk to you later.

6345
03:11:51,970 --> 03:11:52,220
Alright.

6346
03:11:52,220 --> 03:11:52,790
Degrees man.

6347
03:11:52,790 --> 03:11:53,570
Have a good weekend.

6348
03:11:53,570 --> 03:11:53,811
Okay.

6349
03:11:53,811 --> 03:11:55,430
You do see you guys.

6350
03:11:55,490 --> 03:11:56,323
Here's my.

6351
03:11:56,810 --> 03:11:57,643
Yep.

6352
03:11:58,090 --> 03:11:58,923
Thank you.

6353
03:12:29,640 --> 03:12:29,850
Right.
