1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:08,370
For San Juan and say thank you so much.

2
00:00:08,371 --> 00:00:09,450
Those an amazing talk.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,060
And I was wondering if
you could elaborate.

4
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:12,960
What I notice a lot,

5
00:00:12,961 --> 00:00:15,930
I go here to EBC is that a lot
of students and young people,

6
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,390
they're often desensitized to,

7
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:18,871
for example,

8
00:00:18,871 --> 00:00:23,250
the atrocities that communism or
ideologies that forge terrorism.

9
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:27,450
And maybe it's some sort of Stockholm
syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like

10
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:29,640
people are just there,

11
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:31,920
they're like trapped and they can't do,

12
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:34,620
they feel in a way they
can't do anything about it.

13
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:37,790
And then they start to like la,

14
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,430
like like communism or they start to
see more social sort of adopt socialist

15
00:00:41,431 --> 00:00:44,010
policies that in the end
we'll get them killed,

16
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,844
we'll get them hurt.

17
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,690
I was wonder if you kind of like elaborate
on what you think can be done about

18
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:51,750
that or even if something
can be done in that respect.

19
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:52,341
Well,

20
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:53,840
I think something can be done.

21
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:57,560
I mean I've been trying to educate
people about the horrors of

22
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,010
the Nazi regime and,

23
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,920
and the Soviet regime in particular,

24
00:01:03,921 --> 00:01:05,560
I've concentrated mostly
on those two cars,

25
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:06,560
but that's good enough.

26
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:12,340
And trying to let people know that
it was through the fault of people,

27
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:15,080
much like them,

28
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:16,920
that those systems are rows and,

29
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:23,530
and that there are steps you can take
to limit the probability that you would

30
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:28,220
participate in such a thing and that
those steps are associated with trying to

31
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,810
be truthful in your speech and actions
because the stability of those systems

32
00:01:32,811 --> 00:01:36,890
depends on the willingness
of individuals to lie and,

33
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:42,080
and also on your willingness to take
responsibility for the malevolence in your

34
00:01:42,081 --> 00:01:42,914
own heart.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:45,650
That manifests itself in
those social movements.

36
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,910
And so that when I've done,

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,450
when I do my lectures,

38
00:01:53,451 --> 00:01:54,530
when I do talks like this,

39
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,760
when I put them on Youtube,

40
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:00,820
what I'm trying to do is exactly that
because that was the best pathway forward

41
00:02:01,731 --> 00:02:05,630
through such things that I could think
up over 20 years of thinking about it.

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,333
Um,

43
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,840
no one is so habituated to suffering
that they can read the Gulag archipelago,

44
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,840
which is actually quite hard to read
without having an effect them like your

45
00:02:23,841 --> 00:02:24,740
psychopathic.

46
00:02:24,741 --> 00:02:26,080
If that book doesn't affect you,

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:26,960
you know,

48
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,740
it should,

49
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,150
if you read it properly,

50
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,070
it affects you deeply.

51
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,670
And it's not the only example
of that kind of literature.

52
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:37,640
So the people who are habituated aren't,

53
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:41,510
they've just been shown low resolution
representations of things they don't

54
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:44,210
understand that looked vaguely bad.

55
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:45,890
They don't know a damn thing about them.

56
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:51,520
And our education system has done a
tremendously appalling job of educating

57
00:02:52,221 --> 00:02:55,940
young people about the absolute
catastrophe of radical leftism.

58
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,550
Now it's not much better with regards
to say the actions of the Nazis,

59
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:03,730
although I would say on average
people are more aware of that,

60
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:04,623
but they don't.

61
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:05,650
But it's shallow,

62
00:03:05,651 --> 00:03:06,820
shallow knowledge.

63
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,310
So you make the knowledge deep and deep
knowledge changes people and wakes them

64
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:12,940
up.

65
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,151
You know?

66
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
I mean,

67
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:17,500
the only reason that I ever got convinced
that they're that good and evil were

68
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,363
real,

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:18,760
more,

70
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,200
more real than anything else,

71
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,660
wasn't because I learned
that God was real.

72
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:24,693
That's hard.

73
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,280
That's,

74
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,960
that's hard.

75
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,250
It's hard to learn that you have to
find examples of transcendent good.

76
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:30,670
You know,

77
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:31,720
they're rare,

78
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:32,800
evil.

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,930
All you have to do is look,

80
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,550
read history a bit and read
it like it's about you.

81
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:45,010
And there's no way that you can
do that without a transformation.

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,780
But people won't do it was like,

83
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,000
do you want to imagine
yourself as an Auschwitz guard?

84
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,360
That's a rough thing you see
because you have to figure out,

85
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:53,981
see young said,

86
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,300
if you confronted the shadow,

87
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,890
which is the dark side of people,

88
00:03:56,891 --> 00:03:57,880
the aggressive side,

89
00:03:57,881 --> 00:03:59,860
the malevolent side that it,

90
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,260
it really reaches all
the way down to hell.

91
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:07,180
And Dante sort of was trying to put
four of the same thing when he wrote the

92
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:07,870
inferno,

93
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,140
right?

94
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,310
With the levels of evil.

95
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:09,611
Right?

96
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:11,830
Cause it was a voyage
through the levels of evil,

97
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:12,561
right to the bottom.

98
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,170
And he thought the bottom was betrayal.

99
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
It's pretty good.

100
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,040
The most.

101
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,270
The,

102
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,330
the center of malevolence is betrayal.

103
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,790
I liked that because to be traced someone,

104
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,110
you have to get them to trust you.

105
00:04:23,111 --> 00:04:24,640
And Trust is a moral virtue.

106
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:24,851
Right?

107
00:04:24,851 --> 00:04:26,020
Especially if it's courageous.

108
00:04:26,021 --> 00:04:26,960
Trust cause it,

109
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,520
it,

110
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,490
it puts you in alignment with other
people in Lousy and to move forward into

111
00:04:30,491 --> 00:04:30,791
life.

112
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:32,320
And if you'd be trained that you really,

113
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:33,370
it's like a knife in the,

114
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,830
it's like a knife in the
heart through the back.

115
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,810
Especially if it's someone who loves,

116
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,501
loves you,

117
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:39,334
betrays you,

118
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,070
and especially if they
betray you for your virtues.

119
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,660
That's a really nice twist.

120
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,033
So

121
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,160
I believe because I think that
people are capable of good,

122
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:54,970
that if they know enough about evil
that that will straighten them out.

123
00:04:55,690 --> 00:04:56,523
So,

124
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,970
but who wants that?

125
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:58,511
You know,

126
00:04:58,511 --> 00:05:00,610
this is one of the things
I really like about young.

127
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,100
He's often regarded as a new age thinker.

128
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,690
That's wrong.

129
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,850
He's no new age thinker.

130
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:08,760
He knew that the,

131
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:14,150
the pathway to enlightenment was barred
by the necessity of a passage through

132
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:18,280
hell and that no one was going to do that.

133
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,940
That's why there isn't a world
full of enlightened people.

134
00:05:21,941 --> 00:05:26,170
You might say like if it was just
a matter of doing nice things,

135
00:05:26,171 --> 00:05:27,400
following your blessed,

136
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:30,040
let's say however you might put it,

137
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,020
then why wouldn't everyone
walk up the stairway to heaven?

138
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,820
That isn't how it works.

139
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:38,950
That's not how it works at all.

140
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,550
I don't think you can be convinced of
the necessity for moral action until you

141
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:47,230
understand exactly how dark and terrible
things can get and that it's your fault

142
00:05:47,231 --> 00:05:48,400
that they're getting that way.

143
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,770
Who wants to think that.
