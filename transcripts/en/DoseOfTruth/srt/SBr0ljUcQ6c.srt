Hi,

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:11,730
I'm currently going through a hard time
as a first time mum was a nine month

3
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:12,330
old.

4
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,550
I feel depressed and anxious
and I'm highly neurotic.

5
00:00:14,551 --> 00:00:15,384
Invalid title.

6
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,150
Can you suggest anything
to help me be a better mom?

7
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:18,991
Well,

8
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:19,261
you know,

9
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,270
lots of people have a hard time with,

10
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:22,200
they're nine months old.

11
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:23,970
I guess the first question would be,

12
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,500
are you getting enough sleep?

13
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:26,760
Do you have enough help?

14
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:28,050
Are you eating enough?

15
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:29,250
Especially in the morning,

16
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,300
you know,

17
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,050
and you're going to feel highly neurotic
and volatile to some degree because

18
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,530
while you've been through
quite a physiological trauma
and it's very demanding

19
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:39,300
to have a newborn baby,

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,620
so the,

21
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:42,000
the best thing I could say,

22
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:42,840
not knowing you,

23
00:00:42,841 --> 00:00:46,500
is to make sure that you
have people around that you
can talk to about your baby

24
00:00:46,501 --> 00:00:51,501
and that you can and that you can take a
break when you need to and have someone

25
00:00:52,561 --> 00:00:53,394
spell you.

26
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,940
I mean that's often the role that a
husband plays in the first year of,

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,220
of a baby's life is that he can,

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,120
he's supposed to watch the mother to make
sure that she doesn't get overwhelmed

29
00:01:03,121 --> 00:01:04,380
by the demands of the baby.

30
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:09,800
And so I would hope that you're able to
ask for support when you need it and not

31
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,670
to be afraid of asking for support,

32
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:15,330
especially to get arrest and to get
something to eat because that's really

33
00:01:15,331 --> 00:01:15,811
important,

34
00:01:15,811 --> 00:01:16,830
especially in the morning.

35
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,383
Um,

36
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,381
other than that,

37
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:21,300
I can't tell you anything really specific,

38
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,111
unfortunately,

39
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:25,380
given that I don't know anything
about the specifics of your situation.

40
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:26,873
Um,

41
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,650
if it gets out of hand,

42
00:01:28,651 --> 00:01:29,100
you know,

43
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,000
you should go.

44
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,190
The other thing I should say
is if it gets out of hand,

45
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,360
you should go speak with your,

46
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,261
with your doctor,

47
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,130
with a professional,

48
00:01:35,131 --> 00:01:37,940
because you might have
postpartum depression.

49
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,260
There's some dispute about whether that
exists and as an independent diagnostic

50
00:01:43,261 --> 00:01:43,681
entity.

51
00:01:43,681 --> 00:01:46,290
But you can certainly be
physiologically stressed.

52
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,660
And if you have a
predisposition to depression,

53
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:52,470
then that kind of physiological stress
and sleep disruption can bring it on.

54
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,710
So I would say if it
really gets out of hand,

55
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,090
don't hesitate to go talk
to someone professional.

56
00:01:57,091 --> 00:01:57,830
You know?

57
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:58,240
It did.

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,710
It's,

59
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,070
it may be necessary to do that because
you don't want to fall too far down the

60
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:03,660
hole and that's for sure.
