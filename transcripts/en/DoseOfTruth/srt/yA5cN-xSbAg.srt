1
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,550
Is there something,

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,930
this is the main question,

3
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:11,010
is there something,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
is there a set of ideas
that Western civilization is
predicated on that are more

5
00:00:17,941 --> 00:00:19,680
than just bloody opinion?

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,390
That's the question.

7
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,490
Because if there isn't,

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:25,980
well then what do you,

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,970
what do you do about that?

10
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:28,290
It's arbitrary.

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,930
You're just holding it
for no reason whatsoever.

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,850
It could be a different system.

13
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:34,650
There's no reason to stick with it.

14
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,610
All of those things,

15
00:00:35,611 --> 00:00:36,450
like it takes the,

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,220
it takes the core out of it.

17
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,390
When that was niches claim,

18
00:00:39,391 --> 00:00:39,631
right?

19
00:00:39,631 --> 00:00:44,631
He said you take the core metaphysical
presupposition out from underneath

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:49,860
Western civilization or any civilization
for that matter and the whole thing

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,950
loosens shakings shakes and
crumbles while for nature,

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,720
the metaphysical presupposition was God.

23
00:00:58,830 --> 00:00:59,360
Well,

24
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,510
and then the question of course,

25
00:01:00,511 --> 00:01:01,960
well what even does that mean?

26
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:05,250
And it on one hand it means,

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:08,610
I suppose adherence to a
dogmatic set of beliefs,

28
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,290
but then you might ask yourself,

29
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:10,411
well,

30
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:12,690
is there something else that it means?

31
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:16,530
It means at least the hypothesis
of some transcendent value.

32
00:01:16,531 --> 00:01:17,880
It means at least that.

33
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:18,880
Yeah.

34
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,713
Oh,

35
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,660
so you know,

36
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,940
Nietzsche announced the death of God.

37
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:30,690
And so one of the consequences of that
dusty Husky was working on exactly the

38
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,780
same set of ideas and in crime
and punishment in particular,

39
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,900
which is a book could
gets a necessary book.

40
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,990
That's the thing is there's a number
of books that were written in the last

41
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:43,500
hundred and 20 years that you really
have to read and crime and punishment is

42
00:01:43,501 --> 00:01:44,011
one of them.

43
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:47,790
And I think the Gulag archipelago is
another and probably beyond good and evil

44
00:01:47,791 --> 00:01:48,624
is another.

45
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,321
But you know,

46
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,480
Dostoyevsky and Nichi
we're writing in parallel.

47
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:53,430
It's remarkable how much their,

48
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,560
their lives intertwined.

49
00:01:55,561 --> 00:02:00,180
And Nisha knew more about Dostoyevsky
then that is generally don't,

50
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,490
there's been some recent
scholarship indicating that,

51
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:05,520
but in Dostoyevsky's crime and punishment,

52
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:06,923
he has a,

53
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,430
his main character,

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,990
a risk call Nikolov decides that he's
going to commit a murder and he has very

55
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:14,400
good justification for the murder.

56
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,990
And Dusty Yefsky is very good at this.

57
00:02:15,991 --> 00:02:16,470
He,

58
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,240
he puts his characters into very,

59
00:02:18,241 --> 00:02:23,241
very difficult moral situations and gives
them full justification for pursuing

60
00:02:23,941 --> 00:02:24,774
the,

61
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,291
the,

62
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,124
uh,

63
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,620
pursuing the pathway
that they're pursuing.

64
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,820
And so risk golden cove,

65
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,310
he's broke and starving.

66
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:43,510
He wants to go to law school.

67
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:45,610
His sister's about to
prostitute herself rough,

68
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,421
roughly speaking,

69
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,250
by marrying a guy that hates her,

70
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,300
that she hates and that,

71
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,890
and he has contempt for her,

72
00:02:50,891 --> 00:02:52,180
at least acts in that manner.

73
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,070
He's trying to rescue his mother as well,

74
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,110
who's also in dire financial straits.

75
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,220
He,

76
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,820
he,

77
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,470
he goes to a pawnbroker to pawn his
meager position so that he can continue to

78
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,700
scrape by.

79
00:03:03,701 --> 00:03:05,830
And she has this nice,

80
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,530
I believe it's her niece
that's not very bright,

81
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,890
who she basically treats as an,

82
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,680
as a slave and his horrible too.

83
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:11,890
And,

84
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:16,890
and so the carrot that the pawnbroker has
this money risk Niqab is in dire need.

85
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,633
He thinks,

86
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,151
look,

87
00:03:19,151 --> 00:03:22,330
I'll just kill her
because why the hell not?

88
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:24,400
I'll take her money.

89
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:25,780
She's not doing any good with it.

90
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,410
Anyways.

91
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,690
I'll free your niece who's
just working as a slave.

92
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,650
She's got all these other people
tangled up in her pawnbroker schemes.

93
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:35,350
All that'll happen is the
world will be a better place.

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,540
And the only thing that's holding me
back is conventional moral cowardice.

95
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:41,921
And you know,

96
00:03:41,921 --> 00:03:46,921
Dostoyevsky has his character in
crime and punishment go through days,

97
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:47,630
hours,

98
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,630
hours and days and weeks of intense
imagination about this rationalization,

99
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:54,124
about this,

100
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,140
trying to justify himself,

101
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:57,550
placing a metal outside,

102
00:03:57,551 --> 00:04:02,320
placing him self outside the law so that
he can perpetrate this act and telling

103
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,580
him self with all the best nihilistic
arguments that the only possible thing

104
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:11,020
that could be holding them back is an
an arbitrary sense of indoctrinated

105
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:11,854
morality.

106
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,640
And so dusty Esky explores that he does
commit the murder and then of course all

107
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:18,640
hell breaks loose because things don't
necessarily turn out the way that you

108
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:18,850
want.

109
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:19,661
He gets away with it.

110
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,494
However,

111
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:23,290
while he gets away with it technically
because no one knows he did it,

112
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,710
but he doesn't get away with it in
relationship to his own conscience.

113
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:30,010
And so that the rest of
the book explores that.

114
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,980
Well Dostoyevsky I believe it
was in crime and punishment.

115
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,680
Although he makes the same
point in many of his books.

116
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,750
He makes a very fundamental point,

117
00:04:37,751 --> 00:04:41,830
and this is the kind of point that
that I think that people who haven't

118
00:04:41,831 --> 00:04:45,740
investigated these matters
down this particularly lid,

119
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,520
particular literary and
philosophical pathway,

120
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:53,260
never grappled with dusty Esky said
straightforwardly if there's no god.

121
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,880
So if there is no higher value,

122
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:56,410
let's say if there's
no transcendent value,

123
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:58,750
then you can do whatever you want.

124
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:01,930
And that's the question
that he's investigating.

125
00:05:01,931 --> 00:05:02,740
And you see,

126
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:06,400
this is why I have such frustration
say with people like Sam Harris,

127
00:05:06,401 --> 00:05:07,780
the sort of radical atheists,

128
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:11,950
because they seem to think that
once human beings abandoned their,

129
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,050
their grounding in the transcendent,

130
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,070
that the,

131
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,840
the plausible way forward is with
a kind of purest rationality that

132
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:23,140
automatically attributes to
other people equivalent value.

133
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:27,220
It's like I just don't understand that
they believe that that's the rational

134
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:28,000
pathway.

135
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,840
What the hell is irrational about me
getting exactly what I want from every one

136
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:34,810
of you whenever I want it
at every possible second.

137
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:39,990
Why is that a irrational and how
possibly is that more irrational than us

138
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:43,990
cooperating so we can both
have a good time of it?

139
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,850
I don't understand that.

140
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,040
I mean it's as if the psychopathic
tendency is irrational.

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,990
There's nothing irrational about it.

142
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,090
It's pure naked self interest.

143
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,440
How is that irrational?

144
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,190
I don't understand that.

145
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:58,750
Where,

146
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,250
where's the pathway from rationality to,

147
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,550
to an egalitarian virtue and why the
hell not every man for himself and the

148
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,970
devil take the hindmost.

149
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,710
It's a perfectly coherent philosophy and
is actually one that you can institute

150
00:06:12,711 --> 00:06:15,680
in the world with a fair bit of
material success if you want to do it.

151
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:18,110
So I don't see,

152
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,681
to me,

153
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:23,681
I think that that the universe that people
like Dorkins and Harris inhabit is so

154
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,520
intensely conditioned by mythological
presuppositions that they take for granted

155
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,010
the they ethic that emerges out
of that as if it's just a given,

156
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,060
a rational given.

157
00:06:38,061 --> 00:06:40,160
And this of course precisely not niches,

158
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,190
observation as well as dusty
huskies are snitches observation.

159
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,480
You don't get it.

160
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:49,810
The ethic that you think is normative is
a consequence of its of its rate of its

161
00:06:50,061 --> 00:06:53,330
nesting inside this
tremendously lengthy history,

162
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,870
much of which was expressed
in mythological formulation.

163
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,250
You wipe that out.

164
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,300
You don't get to keep all
the presuppositions and
just assume that they're

165
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:04,100
rationally axiomatic there.

166
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,420
The rational,

167
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,490
to make a rational argument,

168
00:07:07,491 --> 00:07:10,370
you have to start with
an initial proposition.

169
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:14,900
While the proposition that underlies
western culture is that there's a

170
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,580
transcendent morality.

171
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:17,301
Now,

172
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:21,110
you could say that's a
transcendent morality
instantiated in the finger of God.

173
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:21,741
That's fine.

174
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,520
You could even call that a personification
of the morality if you want to,

175
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,310
if you don't want to move
into a metaphysical space.

176
00:07:28,311 --> 00:07:30,680
I'm not arguing for the existence of God.

177
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:36,220
I'm arguing that the ethic that drives
our culture is predicated on the idea of

178
00:07:38,901 --> 00:07:43,610
God and that you can't just take that
idea away and expect the thing to remain

179
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:46,400
intact midair without
any foundational support.

180
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:46,791
Now,

181
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:47,930
you don't have to buy that,

182
00:07:47,931 --> 00:07:49,940
but if you're interested in the idea,

183
00:07:49,941 --> 00:07:53,350
then you can read Nicha because
that's what he was trying to sort out.
