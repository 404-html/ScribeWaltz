1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,113
Okay.

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,153
Yeah,

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,340
there's all this Lindsay
shepherd that you're,

4
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:14,630
you're,

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,240
uh,

6
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:15,690
you know,

7
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:19,290
trans folk I a lot about
these issues in Sweden.

8
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:22,820
This one of the few that's sweetness
about it to slaughter activists.

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:28,580
And recently I wrote about how it
coincides with the autism diagnosis.

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,810
And I think it's the same
in the United States.

11
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:33,644
And it's,

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:34,950
I mean,

13
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,930
the number of,

14
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,660
especially young women who's never
had any doubts about their sexual,

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,320
about their gender identity,

16
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,760
but then they file,

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:49,790
find the like minded people with problems
connecting socially on the Internet.

18
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:52,260
And then all of a sudden
they decide that I'm,

19
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,550
I'm another woman,

20
00:00:53,551 --> 00:00:54,384
I'm a man.

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,321
And they,

22
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:59,280
most of them have a diagnosis
within the autism spectrum.

23
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,850
And to even say this and say that this
is something we need to investigate is

24
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,480
sort of transphobia,

25
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:08,680
because then you're,

26
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:09,440
uh,

27
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,950
you're questioning the motives,

28
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:12,940
uh,

29
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,140
within the person.

30
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:15,523
So you,

31
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:16,510
you,

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,100
you're basically saying that it's not,

33
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,750
maybe it's not an gender
identity or feeling that full.

34
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:23,440
Well,

35
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,730
it's like maybe it's going to be worse.

36
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:28,601
Yeah,

37
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:28,960
well,

38
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,170
it's going to get worse because look like,

39
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:31,630
here's,

40
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,130
here's the logical fallacy.

41
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,130
Not all transsexuals have mental illness,

42
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,140
but many people with mental illness
are going to be confused about their

43
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:41,974
identity,

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,121
right?

45
00:01:43,121 --> 00:01:46,780
So that the pool of people confused
about their identity is extraordinarily

46
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:47,614
large.

47
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:48,371
Now,

48
00:01:48,371 --> 00:01:51,880
if you produce a social fad,

49
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:55,060
which is exactly what we're
doing with gender transformation,

50
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,100
then everyone who's unstable is going to
gravitate very rapidly towards that fat

51
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,340
that's happened many times with
different forms of pathology.

52
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:04,210
So for example,

53
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:09,780
there's a book called the discovery of
the unconscious by an existentialist

54
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:12,280
psychotherapist named Henri Aliber Shay,

55
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:13,240
which is a great book,

56
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,133
Great Book,

57
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:19,320
and he tracks the cyclical recurrence of
multiple personality disorder over the

58
00:02:20,991 --> 00:02:22,460
last 300 years.

59
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,540
So a case will be reported
after everyone forgets about it.

60
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:27,530
For a generation or two,

61
00:02:27,531 --> 00:02:30,380
a case will be reported and
then it spreads like wildfire.

62
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,990
And there's multiple
personality everywhere.

63
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:38,290
And then people get skeptical about it
and the reports dropoff to zero and it

64
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,430
goes underground again.

65
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,200
And then three generations again,

66
00:02:41,201 --> 00:02:43,570
somebody reports a case history and Poof,

67
00:02:43,571 --> 00:02:44,440
up it comes again.

68
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,920
And so the there,

69
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,420
there are these in Carl
Jung wrote about this a lot.

70
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:54,100
There are these psychic epidemics
that occur from time to time.

71
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,061
And,

72
00:02:55,061 --> 00:02:55,360
uh,

73
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,830
the same thing happened for example,

74
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:58,050
in the 1980s when,

75
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:58,330
um,

76
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:01,930
there was a huge in the United
States in particular about,

77
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,823
uh,

78
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,830
satanistic ritual abuse in daycares and
that that produced an absolute uproar

79
00:03:09,741 --> 00:03:13,760
for like five years and
many did you have that?

80
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,520
Yeah.

81
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,760
One of the professors
here at hope Sola tubes,

82
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,601
so university,

83
00:03:18,601 --> 00:03:23,570
she wrote a book about
most of them men of power.

84
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,900
We're in Arlington Hospital.

85
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,290
Right,

86
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,123
right.

87
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,330
Uh,

88
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,380
even though it was,

89
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,120
I mean it's blatantly,

90
00:03:31,121 --> 00:03:31,391
it's,

91
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:31,720
it's,

92
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,553
it's crazy.

93
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:32,910
Yeah.

94
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,340
But it wasn't gender scientists

95
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,870
because he would criticize
it was sort of a,

96
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,620
okay.

97
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:41,820
Yeah.

98
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,030
She,

99
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,351
she,

100
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:43,184
she,

101
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:43,790
she,

102
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,230
he's actually one of the
architects behind our,

103
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:47,620
uh,

104
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,500
how we view men's violence against women.

105
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,430
But you also wrote about this satanic
rituals that men in power had against

106
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,743
children,

107
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,820
but it wasn't in daycare.

108
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:03,370
It was just like against
children everywhere.

109
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,040
Ah,

110
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,500
AH,

111
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:04,990
yeah.

112
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,140
Yeah.

113
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:05,261
Well,

114
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,650
there's a great book written in the
United States called saint silence by a

115
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,230
social worker and the lawyer
that investigated that,

116
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,550
ah,

117
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:15,130
satanic ritual abuse epidemic.

118
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,220
And it makes the Salem witch
hunts looked like nothing.

119
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:18,940
I mean,

120
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:21,040
the longest prison sentence is in history,

121
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:25,660
were handed out for the
hypothetical perpetrators of
these satanic ritual abuse.

122
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:30,280
They dug under whole towns in places
looking for the tunnels where the,

123
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,800
where the sacrifices were being performed.

124
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:33,700
I mean,

125
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,490
they invented a whole new
categories of clinical diagnosis,

126
00:04:36,491 --> 00:04:37,540
late onset,

127
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,100
female sexual predator,

128
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,020
of whom there are zero.

129
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,320
Right.

130
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,510
That is a category that does not exist.

131
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,193
Unbelievable.

132
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,420
It sounds like a great book.

133
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:47,781
I mean,

134
00:04:47,781 --> 00:04:51,830
like a great horror horror movie or
something like be satanic circles,

135
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,390
but to actually believe in it,

136
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:53,930
this is,

137
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,980
it's really crazy.

138
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:55,330
Yep.
