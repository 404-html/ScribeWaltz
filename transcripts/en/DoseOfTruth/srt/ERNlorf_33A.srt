1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:03,011
There was,

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:03,844
uh,

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:04,141
uh,

4
00:00:04,141 --> 00:00:06,740
daddy known as Marduk and Martech.

5
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,820
He was a Mesopotamian Daddy.

6
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,900
And imagine this is sorta what happened
is that as an empire grew out of the

7
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:15,960
post ice age age,

8
00:00:15,961 --> 00:00:17,640
say 15,000 years ago,

9
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:18,720
10,000 years ago,

10
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,440
all these tribes came together and
these tribes each had their own daddy,

11
00:00:22,441 --> 00:00:24,330
their own image of the ideal.

12
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,610
But then they started talking
about it the same territory,

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,420
right?

14
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,580
And so then one tribe had gone,

15
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:29,821
hey,

16
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:33,960
in one tribe had God be and no
one could wipe the other one out.

17
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,120
And then it would just be God a who wins.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,690
But that's not so good because well maybe
you want to trade with those people or

19
00:00:39,691 --> 00:00:42,480
maybe you don't want to lose
half of your population in a war,

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:43,380
something like that.

21
00:00:43,381 --> 00:00:48,381
So then you have to have an argument
about whose God is going to take priority,

22
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,280
which ideal is going to take priority.

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,720
And what seems to happen
is that's represented in
mythology is a battle of the

24
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,820
gods in sort of celestial space.

25
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:58,740
But from a practical perspective,

26
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:00,570
it's more like an ongoing dialogue.

27
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,501
You believe this,

28
00:01:01,501 --> 00:01:02,430
I believe this.

29
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,181
You believe that,

30
00:01:03,181 --> 00:01:04,080
I believe this.

31
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,180
How are we going to Meld that together?

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,060
So you take God a and you take God be
and maybe what you do is extract God,

33
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:13,140
see from them and you say,

34
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:13,621
well God,

35
00:01:13,621 --> 00:01:18,270
see now has the attributes of a and B
and then some other tribes come in and

36
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:19,980
then see takes them over to,

37
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,560
and so you get like
with Marduk for example,

38
00:01:22,561 --> 00:01:24,270
he has a multitude of names,

39
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,560
50 different names.

40
00:01:25,561 --> 00:01:26,520
While those are names,

41
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,980
at least in part of the subordinate,

42
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:32,910
God's that represented the tribes that
came together to make the civilization.

43
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,930
That's part of the process by which
that abstracted ideal is abstracted.

44
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,040
You think this is important and it works
cause your tribe's alive and you think

45
00:01:41,041 --> 00:01:44,790
this is important and it works because
your tribe is alive and so we'll take the

46
00:01:44,791 --> 00:01:47,970
best of both if we could
manage it and extract,

47
00:01:47,971 --> 00:01:51,480
extract out something that's even
more abstract that covers both of us.

48
00:01:51,481 --> 00:01:52,410
If we can do it.

49
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:55,230
One of the things that's really
interesting about Marduk,

50
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,840
I'll just give you a
couple of of his features,

51
00:01:57,841 --> 00:02:00,780
but he has eyes all the
way around his head.

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,510
He's elected by all the
other gods to be King God.

53
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:05,400
So that's the first
thing that's quite cool.

54
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,200
And they elect him because they're,

55
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,970
they're facing a terrible threat,

56
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,370
sort of like a flood
and a monster combined,

57
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:12,181
something like that.

58
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:15,630
And martech basically says that
if they elect him talk God,

59
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,350
then he'll go out and stop
the flood monster and,

60
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:18,910
and,

61
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,520
and they won't all get wiped out.

62
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,570
It's a serious threat.

63
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,890
It's chaos itself,

64
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,540
making its comeback.

65
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,680
And so all the Gods agree and
Marta has a new manifestation.

66
00:02:28,681 --> 00:02:32,310
He's got eyes all the way around
his head and he speaks magic words.

67
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,130
And then he also goes
out and when he fights,

68
00:02:35,131 --> 00:02:37,110
he fights this daddy called Taya Mat.

69
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,820
And we need to know that because the
word tie Matt is associated with the word

70
00:02:41,821 --> 00:02:42,654
take home.

71
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,870
T h o m and tail is the chaos that God
makes order out of at the beginning of

72
00:02:48,181 --> 00:02:49,800
time in genesis.

73
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,510
So it's linked very tightly to this
story and Martech with his eyes and his

74
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,470
capacity to speak.

75
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,690
Magic words goes out to
confront tie Amat Matt,

76
00:02:57,691 --> 00:03:00,880
who's like a watery see drag
and something like that.

77
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,800
It's a classic.

78
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,180
It's a classic St George Story.

79
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,740
Go out and wreak havoc on the dragon.

80
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,790
He cuts her into pieces and he
makes the world out of her pieces.

81
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,650
And that's the world that
human beings live in.

82
00:03:14,651 --> 00:03:17,800
And the Mesopotamian
emperor acted out Marduk.

83
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:20,680
He was allowed to be emperor in
so far as he was a good Marduk.

84
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:23,800
And so that meant that he had eyes all
the way around his head and he could

85
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:25,000
speak magic,

86
00:03:25,001 --> 00:03:26,590
he could speak properly.

87
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,680
And so that we're starting to
understand they're at that point,

88
00:03:29,681 --> 00:03:30,910
the essence of leadership,

89
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,181
right?

90
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:32,410
Because what's leadership?

91
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:36,340
It's the capacity to see what the hell
is in front of your face and maybe in

92
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,150
every direction and then the capacity
to use your language properly in a

93
00:03:40,151 --> 00:03:43,780
transformative manner and to
transform chaos into order.

94
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,520
And God only know how those,

95
00:03:45,521 --> 00:03:47,950
how long it took the
Mesopotamians to figure that out.

96
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:50,200
And the best they could
do is dramatize it,

97
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:52,660
but it's staggeringly brilliant.
