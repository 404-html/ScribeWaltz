1
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:08,453
Okay.

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:10,200
So that's the coat of many colors.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,270
So it's an estimation of what Joseph is
like and what we're seeing with all of

4
00:00:15,271 --> 00:00:20,271
these patriarchal figures is the
continual realization of the ideal person,

5
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,120
right?

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,650
You could think about it as success
of approximations of the ideal person.

7
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,520
And the story is exploring all
sorts of different possibilities,

8
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:33,180
including ones that are very violent
and catastrophic and malevolent.

9
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:33,380
It's,

10
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:33,660
it's,

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,660
it's trying to cover the entire territory
and to focus in on what's the proper

12
00:00:39,431 --> 00:00:40,660
way through the maze,

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:41,620
the maze of life,

14
00:00:41,621 --> 00:00:42,454
the labyrinth.

15
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,630
And the hint here is that while
you should be multidimensional,

16
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,300
these are the generations of Jacob.

17
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:53,190
Joseph being 17 years old was feeding
the flock with his brother and allowed,

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,480
was with the sons of Bilhah
and with the sons of Zilpah,

19
00:00:55,481 --> 00:00:56,380
his father's wives.

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,520
And Joseph brought unto his
father they're evil report.

21
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,983
Well,

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,040
we already know that Joseph has Jacob's
favorite and so that doesn't make him

23
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,620
very popular among his brothers.

24
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,670
He's younger.

25
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:13,420
And now we also find out that
he's being set up more or less,

26
00:01:13,421 --> 00:01:15,160
as you might say,

27
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:15,994
a snitch,

28
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,360
because that's what this phrase means
is that he goes out and watch us,

29
00:01:19,361 --> 00:01:20,021
his older brothers.

30
00:01:20,021 --> 00:01:21,940
And if they do something
they shouldn't do that.

31
00:01:21,941 --> 00:01:25,420
He comes trotting back
to Jacob and reports,

32
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:27,370
well that's not going to make you popular.

33
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:28,630
So,

34
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,261
and you would say,

35
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:29,411
well,

36
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:30,760
is that Joseph's problem

37
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,310
or Jacob's problem.

38
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,721
And I would say,

39
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,640
and this is something I learned
from reading dealing too,

40
00:01:37,641 --> 00:01:39,830
is that that's a conspiratorial problem,

41
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,190
right?

42
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,660
Is it's the parents at fault,

43
00:01:42,661 --> 00:01:45,900
but so is the child who agrees to do that.

44
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,250
They've got a little cabal
going and you might say,

45
00:01:51,251 --> 00:01:51,401
well,

46
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:52,570
it's only the parents' fault,

47
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:57,571
but the sun will be taking advantage
of every advantage that offers him.

48
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,820
Because he could say no to.

49
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:00,660
I won't do that.

50
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:01,781
So anyways,

51
00:02:01,781 --> 00:02:04,950
so Joseph is the favorite.

52
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,230
He's a bit of a teacher's pet.

53
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,310
That's what it looks like.

54
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:09,841
Now,

55
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:12,900
Israel loved Joseph more than all his
colors because he was the son of his old

56
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:14,730
age and he made him a coat of many colors.

57
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,630
And when his brethren saw that their
father loved him more than all his

58
00:02:18,631 --> 00:02:19,020
brothers,

59
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,240
they hated him and could not
speak peaceably unto him.

60
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:25,560
So let's say you have a child or number
of children and one of them is your

61
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:25,951
favorite.

62
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,510
How should you treat that child?

63
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:28,860
Well,

64
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,850
it isn't obvious that you do them any
favors by overtly making them be your

65
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:33,684
favorite,

66
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,471
right?

67
00:02:34,471 --> 00:02:34,681
I mean,

68
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:35,514
first of all,

69
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,620
maybe you don't challenge
them as much as you should.

70
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:38,460
And second of all,

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,620
you definitely set up a cane,

72
00:02:40,621 --> 00:02:43,800
enable like scenario in
the household and that,

73
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:47,040
or maybe it's an edible situation too
because you happen to love your child more

74
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:47,874
than you love your,

75
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:48,930
your spouse,

76
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:49,800
which is,

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,320
that's not a recipe for familial harmony.

78
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,660
So it's,

79
00:02:54,661 --> 00:02:56,220
it seems to be a bad idea.

80
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:56,551
Okay.

81
00:02:56,551 --> 00:03:01,270
So now we have two reasons that Joseph
is not liked by his brothers is,

82
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:02,104
one is,

83
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:06,310
well he's a bit of a rat Fink
and the other is that he's the,

84
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,970
he's the favorite and he's playing that
to the hilt by the looks of things.

85
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,300
And when his brethren saw
that their father loved him
more than all his brethren

86
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,681
and all his brothers,

87
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:17,800
and they hated him and could
not speak peaceably unto him,

88
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,803
okay.

89
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,650
And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told
it to his brethren and they hated him.

90
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:24,430
The more.
