1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,670
Dr peterson was the party.
Thank you both for being here today.

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,240
Um,
when political scientists have studied

3
00:00:07,241 --> 00:00:08,710
is to solitary and regimes.
I'm sorry,

4
00:00:08,711 --> 00:00:10,120
I'm going to move this a little bit.
Just feel weird.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,040
Totalitarian regimes.
I've studied.

6
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:15,700
I tried to look at the Iranian
revolution and the Islamic Republic of

7
00:00:15,701 --> 00:00:20,280
Iran and I've argued how the Shia Islam
that is teached in the Islamic republic

8
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:24,610
is very close to a totalitarian regime,
but now I live in a country where my

9
00:00:24,611 --> 00:00:28,060
ideas are considered controversial.
If you believe in God,

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,270
if you believe in family,
if you believe in having responsibility

11
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:34,720
and traditional values,
I feel ostracized by the community here.

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,090
I came from UC University of Calgary
over there.

13
00:00:37,091 --> 00:00:39,070
I didn't feel this way.
There was more welcoming.

14
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:43,570
Here I feel marginalized and I do feel
alone and when I see this,

15
00:00:43,571 --> 00:00:45,610
it disgusts me that here they can do
this,

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,680
but I couldn't go to their events,
do anything.

17
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,410
I'd have to shut up the disciplinary
committee for me,

18
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:54,310
but for them they can break windows to
God knows how old this building is and

19
00:00:54,311 --> 00:00:58,060
it's okay for them to do that.
So my question to you is now being here,

20
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:01,360
experiencing this,
I'm starting to second guess that maybe

21
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,360
the totalitarian Islamic regime that I
was so,

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,820
you know,
talking about and critical of back in

23
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:10,270
Iran isn't so bad when I have a choice
between having to be here and be

24
00:01:10,271 --> 00:01:14,740
oppressed and be there and at least have
my ideas be okay with the regime.

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:19,540
So my argument is if this free speech
and the arguments you guys are making

26
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:21,100
here,
it doesn't work,

27
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:24,700
would that not be the next step for
people to go towards totalitarianism?

28
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,640
If dialogue fails,
then isn't force of arms the only thing

29
00:01:27,641 --> 00:01:29,920
left?
How can people compromise when they

30
00:01:29,921 --> 00:01:31,750
don't want to talk,
when they want to yell?

31
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,773
Thank you.

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:40,570
Thank you.

33
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,640
I think you make a very good point.
I don't think we should fool ourselves.

34
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:52,150
This is about force and it is a.
it's almost a dare to suggest that that

35
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,450
certain elements are not allowed to
enforce their view of the world and that

36
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:05,930
speaking contrary to it,
isn't that a front to those values and

37
00:02:05,931 --> 00:02:07,250
they won't shut you down.
I mean that,

38
00:02:07,251 --> 00:02:08,930
that,
that is what is at stake.

39
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:10,490
We,
we are,

40
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,300
we are,
we are no longer really in a situation

41
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:18,860
where this will all be resolved through
sort of gentle,

42
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:23,861
reasonable civil dialogue that,
that happens on the side,

43
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:26,600
but it's not real anymore.
It's not really where the fight is

44
00:02:26,601 --> 00:02:27,980
happening.
This is a,

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,510
an imposition of the force of the state
and it is skewed,

46
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,600
it is skewed a certain way and we are
getting to the point where a certain

47
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:39,520
kind of language or certain kinds of
dialogue is,

48
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,890
is approved and all right and a certain
kind is not.

49
00:02:42,891 --> 00:02:44,930
And that is the campaign that is going
on to,

50
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:49,070
this is all part of.
And I have to say that,

51
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:54,071
that your presence here and your
endorsement of this kind of event is the

52
00:02:54,621 --> 00:02:59,560
kind of thing that has the major
pushback to trend,

53
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,160
but the trend

54
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,680
is continuing and is a very dangerous
one.

55
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,050
And uh,
this is,

56
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:08,740
uh,
a difficult moment in the life of this

57
00:03:08,741 --> 00:03:09,574
country.
Would you,

58
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,140
would you say Jordan?
So,

59
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:14,320
so some,
some comments about,

60
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,730
about your career.
Let's say.

61
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:17,090
Okay,
so you're a young mountain.

62
00:03:17,091 --> 00:03:18,640
And you've got lots of years ahead of
you,

63
00:03:18,641 --> 00:03:21,100
so you know,
you want to prepare for the war,

64
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,020
not the battle,
right,

65
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,420
okay.
Because there's going to be many battles

66
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,210
for you personally and perhaps
politically and all of that.

67
00:03:28,211 --> 00:03:31,570
And so you want to make yourself as
articulate and educated as you can and

68
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:34,720
you want to have patients.
I would say that there is no cause for

69
00:03:34,721 --> 00:03:36,730
despair,
you know,

70
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,870
I believe that the,
the,

71
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:41,950
the people who are attempting to
radicalize our society and to transform

72
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:45,760
it into a battleground of identity
politics are in the distinct minority.

73
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:51,130
And I think that I think that there is
no reason to assume that we can't push

74
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:53,590
the devil back into the,
into the bottle,

75
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,290
so to speak,
to push the genie back into the bottle.

76
00:03:56,740 --> 00:04:00,820
And so don't despair.
Now from a personal perspective,

77
00:04:00,821 --> 00:04:04,690
it's like we've got lots of things to
learn and you've got lots of things to

78
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:08,830
say and to write and you're going to
find now and then that you were imposed

79
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,290
upon in a manner that you don't find
tolerable,

80
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,071
right?
You think,

81
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:13,450
I can't live like this,
right?

82
00:04:13,451 --> 00:04:15,550
It's going to distress you in,
well then,

83
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,220
then you've come across your moral
conundrum,

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,160
right?
It's specific to you and then you have

85
00:04:21,161 --> 00:04:24,100
to.
That's when you have to grow up and

86
00:04:24,101 --> 00:04:27,070
think strategically.
It's like you decide,

87
00:04:27,071 --> 00:04:29,260
are you willing to live under those
conditions?

88
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:32,470
If you're not,
then you develop a strategy.

89
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,550
It's like,
okay,

90
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,610
I'm going to.
I'm going to fight this.

91
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:40,930
I'm going to fight it carefully,
intelligently,

92
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,970
thoughtfully on multiple fronts and I'm
not going to back down and you don't

93
00:04:45,971 --> 00:04:47,410
make that decision lightly.

94
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,670
You know most things you should let blow
by you because there's not that much of

95
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:55,120
you and there's lots of things,
but now and then you'll find a stumbling

96
00:04:55,121 --> 00:04:57,550
block that you can't get over it because
it hurts you.

97
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,030
It damages your soul.
That's the right way to think about it.

98
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:04,630
Well then that's the time for you to put
your education to use.

99
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,610
No,
and you'll be able to do that.

100
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,650
I mean,
you don't want to underestimate the

101
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:12,460
utility of of deep,
forthright speech.

102
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,280
I don't believe that anything can stand
in its way.

103
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:20,020
It have the courage of your convictions,
but don't give way to despair like this

104
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,180
battle is by no means over.
No,

105
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,660
I know meets and it isn't even obvious
that the bad guys are winning,

106
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:27,310
so to speak.
You know?

107
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,490
I mean here we are,
we're having this talk.

108
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,270
The university came out forthrightly in
favor of free speech for.

109
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:43,860
Thank you.

110
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,500
No one so far.
All the questions today have been

111
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:58,250
thoughtful and intelligent.
You seem like informed so like don't

112
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:01,100
underestimate your strength.
And so,

113
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:05,450
and mcmaster just published a set of
guidelines governing this sort of

114
00:06:05,451 --> 00:06:10,451
behavior so that it will no longer be
acceptable to disrupt perfectly

115
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:14,000
reasonable proceedings on university
campuses

116
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,830
in the.
And so the,

117
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,450
so the discussions like this can
continue properly.

118
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,190
I mean there's definitely a place for a
give and take and for informed

119
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:28,670
opposition let's say,
but there's a difference between

120
00:06:28,671 --> 00:06:32,060
informed opposition in child childish
grandstanding.

121
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,040
And I think people know the difference
between that.

122
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,890
So don't,
don't be desperate about it.

123
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,970
Pick your battles.
A little courage goes a long way,

124
00:06:40,971 --> 00:06:43,270
right?
Because other people see it and

125
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,960
there's a.
There is I think a silent majority out

126
00:06:47,961 --> 00:06:52,961
there that is silence and is scared,
but if they see courage from somebody,

127
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:57,110
they responded to it.
Well,

128
00:06:57,111 --> 00:07:01,070
I think you described lawyers in a way
that appealed to me once.

129
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,530
He said,
I think I know that's rare,

130
00:07:03,531 --> 00:07:07,100
but
you said lawyers.

131
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:11,930
I think these are the words you said
lawyers are difficult and emotionally

132
00:07:11,931 --> 00:07:15,650
stable and is the combination of those
two things.

133
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:20,000
The willingness to be difficult but not
to be emotional about it.

134
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:20,721
Don't,
don't,

135
00:07:20,721 --> 00:07:24,470
don't wear your emotions to the fight.
Take a step back,

136
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,660
engage in it.
Say what you think.

137
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:29,480
Be Courageous,
but don't get wrapped up in it.

138
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,980
Don't be emotional about it,
but you know,

139
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,510
retain your strength for the long haul.

140
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,980
Well,
you know,

141
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,840
one of the things I've learned
strategically,

142
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,520
and this is really worth thinking about
too,

143
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:44,780
is that when you're engaged in a public
dispute like this,

144
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,540
it's not obvious when things are going
your way.

145
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,311
You know,
you think,

146
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:51,410
well,
this protest is not such a good thing.

147
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:53,810
It's like,
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

148
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,630
You know,
what's happened to me in the last 18

149
00:07:56,631 --> 00:08:00,830
months is that virtually every time that
I've been attacked and some of the

150
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:04,100
attacks have been quite well,
I wouldn't say brutal because we haven't

151
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:07,100
got to that thank God,
but they've certainly been,

152
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,760
um,
they've taken me aback.

153
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,623
You know,
it's not,

154
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,920
it's not a straightforward thing to be
in a hall with this happened at mcmaster

155
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:20,810
with 100 people yelling at you and
blaring air horns and all of that.

156
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,140
But that wasn't a bad thing as it turned
out because it was filmed and it was put

157
00:08:27,351 --> 00:08:31,730
on Youtube and it was terrible for the
people who protested,

158
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,860
you know,
it wasn't good.

159
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:37,400
And so you got to detach yourself to,
you know,

160
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,990
if,
if you say what you think and you're

161
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:41,360
careful about it,
it's going to have some short term

162
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:44,240
effects and it's gonna have some medium
term effects and it's going to have some

163
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:46,940
longterm effects.
And one of the things that you need to

164
00:08:46,941 --> 00:08:47,840
do,
I would say,

165
00:08:47,841 --> 00:08:51,230
and this is an element of courage,
is you have to have faith that the

166
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:56,231
medium to longterm consequences of you
saying you have to say as clearly as

167
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,790
possible,
it's going to be positive and you have

168
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,460
to act on that supposition.
You don't know,

169
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,560
right?
You can't know that that's the

170
00:09:04,561 --> 00:09:07,980
existential leap of faith is you can't
know,

171
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:12,870
but you act anyway.
And my experience has been that you

172
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:15,120
don't wanna.
You don't want to make judgment too

173
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:18,060
quickly because it's not always clear
when things are going your way.

174
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:22,410
So when you know you might stand up in a
class and say something that people

175
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:25,800
react negatively to eat and you might
get pilloried for that by some people,

176
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:29,610
but you never know who you're touching
in the crowd and you don't know how

177
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,430
that's going to unfold across time.
And then you have that might be a

178
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:35,880
defining moment in someone else's life
to watch you stand up and say what you

179
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:40,140
have to say.
So don't underestimate the power of

180
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,730
truth and courage really.
So

181
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,960
thank you.
