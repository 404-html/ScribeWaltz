1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,970
So since studying your work,

2
00:00:10,971 --> 00:00:15,830
one of the things that I
find most fascinating is
your analysis of the story of

3
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:16,664
Cain and Abel.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:19,310
And my question is,

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:20,203
um,

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,830
if,

7
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,390
if came got to the point
that he did right before,

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:27,890
uh,

9
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:28,730
killing his brother,

10
00:00:28,731 --> 00:00:33,731
murdering his ideal and decided that
that was something he didn't want to do,

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,470
what advice or guidance would you,

12
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,110
would you give a person
that got to that point?

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,183
Well,

14
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:50,550
there's a story I read
called the cocktail party.

15
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,480
I've mentioned this before by Tsa Elliot.

16
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,510
In the cocktail party,

17
00:00:54,511 --> 00:00:55,310
there's a scene,

18
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:00,310
it's a play where this woman approaches
a psychiatrist and starts talking to him

19
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,770
about her problems.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,930
And she said something that surprises him.

21
00:01:03,931 --> 00:01:04,351
She says,

22
00:01:04,351 --> 00:01:06,750
I hope that I'm the problem.

23
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:07,531
And he says,

24
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:07,681
well,

25
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,700
why would you hope that?

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,571
And she says,

27
00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:09,721
well,

28
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,740
I thought about it a lot.

29
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:12,750
And if the world's the problem,

30
00:01:12,751 --> 00:01:15,210
then I'm done because I
can't change the world.

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,410
But if I'm the problem,

32
00:01:16,411 --> 00:01:19,560
then maybe there's something
about myself I can change.

33
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,650
I can undo this terrible
situation that I meant.

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,470
And so I would say that's repentance.

35
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:26,370
Fundamentally.

36
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:28,770
It's like there if,

37
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,070
and I say this carefully
because I understand that
people are susceptible to bad

38
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,324
fortune.

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,950
Sin and ignorance can make that worse,

40
00:01:40,951 --> 00:01:44,250
but independently of that
like good people suffer.

41
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,840
Make no mistake about it,

42
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,790
but if things aren't right for you,

43
00:01:50,791 --> 00:01:54,580
if you're resentful about being,

44
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,640
because that's the right way of cause,

45
00:01:56,641 --> 00:02:00,030
that's the deepest way of thinking about
if you read the writings of the people

46
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,800
who do the mass killings for example,

47
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,360
that's what you see over and over.

48
00:02:03,361 --> 00:02:03,931
It's cane.

49
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:08,931
It's like they're angry
beyond comprehension at the
intolerability of being and

50
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:12,090
they're angry at God.

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,860
Even if they don't say
it exactly like that.

52
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:16,200
They come so close to saying it like that,

53
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:16,940
that it's,

54
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,090
there's no difference.

55
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,120
You know what God says to Cain is look
to yourself first before you criticize

56
00:02:24,121 --> 00:02:24,954
being,

57
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,190
and that strikes me is right.

58
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,170
It's because to not do that as arrogant
beyond belief that say tannic arrogance.

59
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,161
Literally,

60
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:36,840
if something like that can be literal,

61
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:42,290
it's like don't make yourself the judge
of being before you clean up your your

62
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:43,230
room,

63
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,063
let's say.

64
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,990
And it because,

65
00:02:46,991 --> 00:02:47,900
and the other thing too,

66
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,720
this is something I learned in some
part from soldier Nixon when he,

67
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:54,030
when he was in the prison camps and trying
to understand how these heroic people

68
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:55,740
he saw could possibly manage it.

69
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,720
One of the exercises he undertook,

70
00:02:57,721 --> 00:03:02,200
and he really viewed this within Christian
Orthodox context of Repentance and

71
00:03:02,201 --> 00:03:03,034
redemption,

72
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,160
is he said he went over his life with a
fine tooth comb and tried to imagine all

73
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:14,581
of the ethical mistakes he made in his
entire life that he knew were mistakes,

74
00:03:14,771 --> 00:03:15,021
right?

75
00:03:15,021 --> 00:03:15,160
Hey,

76
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,401
there was,

77
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:17,470
it was this was a soul search,

78
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,310
not,

79
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:22,150
he wasn't relying on external standards
of morality except in so far as we're

80
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:23,680
inevitably influenced by those.

81
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,480
And then his idea was,

82
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,480
is there something I could do
right now to put that right?

83
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:31,390
And that's the right question.

84
00:03:31,391 --> 00:03:33,370
Like if things aren't going your way,

85
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:37,750
and I think that means that you're
resentful and arrogant and deceitful.

86
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,820
Those are the three things
that clump together.

87
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:40,660
I think that that,

88
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,370
that constitute the core of evil.

89
00:03:42,371 --> 00:03:43,270
It's something like that.

90
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,340
And so if you're possessed by that,

91
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:47,320
which is a hell,

92
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:49,540
then it's repentance.

93
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,740
That's the right answer.

94
00:03:50,741 --> 00:03:54,760
And what that means is you have to figure
out what you did wrong and you have to

95
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,594
pay for it.

96
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:57,460
And then at least you could think,

97
00:03:57,461 --> 00:03:57,851
well look,

98
00:03:57,851 --> 00:04:00,490
I can try that with all of my soul,

99
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,330
let's say,

100
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,500
and see what happens,

101
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:03,521
right?

102
00:04:03,521 --> 00:04:04,960
It could at least be an experiment.

103
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:07,120
And then I would also say
that that's an act of faith.

104
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,110
It's an act of faith to conduct that
experiment because you put yourself on the

105
00:04:11,111 --> 00:04:11,471
line,

106
00:04:11,471 --> 00:04:11,920
right?

107
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,240
And that's what an act of faith is.

108
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,350
You don't know the outcome,

109
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,030
but you don't know the
outcome of your life.

110
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,790
So to live in some senses,

111
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,663
an act of faith.

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,240
You're putting faith in something
that that's why you're moving forward.

113
00:04:22,241 --> 00:04:24,640
You couldn't move forward
without an act of faith,

114
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:25,691
you know?

115
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:26,261
And people say,

116
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:26,441
well,

117
00:04:26,441 --> 00:04:28,720
I only move forward on
the basis of the fact.

118
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,081
It's like,

119
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:29,261
yeah,

120
00:04:29,261 --> 00:04:32,830
but you select the fact and there's an
infinity of facts and they don't just

121
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:33,760
tell you what to do.

122
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,530
So it's not a credible answer.

123
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,200
So if you're in that situation,

124
00:04:38,201 --> 00:04:39,034
it's like,

125
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:41,830
look to yourself,

126
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:42,821
you know?

127
00:04:42,821 --> 00:04:43,051
And,

128
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:46,330
and one of the things about soldier
that's a bloody amazing is that's what he

129
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:46,860
did.

130
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,990
And then he wrote the Gulag
archipelago and you know,

131
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:52,320
he took an ax to the intellectual
and moral substructure of,

132
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,780
of the totalitarian communist states.

133
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,360
So while he was redeeming himself,

134
00:04:58,361 --> 00:05:01,690
let's say he was simultaneously
redeeming the world,

135
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:02,921
and you know,

136
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,120
you see something like that,

137
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:04,810
like you,

138
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,650
you got to wake up,

139
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,010
man.

140
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:06,843
That's,

141
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,830
that was really something.
