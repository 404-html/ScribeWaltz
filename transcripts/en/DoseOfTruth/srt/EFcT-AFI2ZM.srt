1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,751
Well,

2
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:03,930
the a book's subtitle
is the case or reasons,

3
00:00:03,931 --> 00:00:04,531
science,

4
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,230
humanism and progress at all.

5
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:07,910
I'll begin with the,

6
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,870
with the progress because that was the
epiphany that more than anything inspired

7
00:00:12,871 --> 00:00:13,590
the book.

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:14,790
I'd written a previous book,

9
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:18,990
the better angels of our nature when I
was surprised to come across data sets

10
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:23,220
showing that many measures of violence
it declined over the course of history.

11
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,700
I was stunned to see a graph that showed
the rates of homicide from England and

12
00:00:28,981 --> 00:00:33,180
other western European countries from
the 13 hundreds to the 20th century

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,360
showing a decline of anywhere
from 35 to 50 in the chances of a,

14
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:39,864
of getting murdered.

15
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:40,741
Uh,

16
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:41,670
when I,

17
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:43,343
uh,

18
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,510
called attention to this
fact and a blog post,

19
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:50,160
I didn't got correspondence from
historians from international relations

20
00:00:50,161 --> 00:00:50,731
scholars,

21
00:00:50,731 --> 00:00:51,990
from sociologists say,

22
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:52,351
you know,

23
00:00:52,351 --> 00:00:53,970
you could have mentioned other declines,

24
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,440
another decline of violence.

25
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,490
And one worst scholar showed me that
the rate of death and war had plummeted.

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,640
Another showed me that rates of domestic
violence have gone down still another

27
00:01:06,631 --> 00:01:09,000
that rates of child abuse had gone down.

28
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,750
And I realized that the time that there
was an important story here that was,

29
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,230
uh,

30
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:17,130
that it had to be told that these
different declines of violence ought to be

31
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:20,160
presented to the world in
between a single pair of covers.

32
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:20,940
Uh,

33
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,220
just because it did seem to
be something of a pattern.

34
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,730
And as a psychologist it opened up
the challenge of how to explain it.

35
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,211
First of all,

36
00:01:27,211 --> 00:01:28,800
how to explain the,

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:29,250
uh,

38
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,180
the fact that there's been,

39
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,730
that there is so much
violence in human affairs,

40
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,100
but also the fact that
it can be brought down.

41
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:35,560
Well,

42
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,490
I had a similar set of epiphany's that
led to the writing of enlightenment.

43
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:39,390
Now when,

44
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:39,691
uh,

45
00:01:39,691 --> 00:01:41,610
after better angels was published,

46
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,540
um,

47
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:46,230
I started a couple of cross data showing
that other aspects of human wellbeing

48
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,064
had improved.

49
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:52,310
The rate of extreme poverty had plummeted
by but 50% just in three decades and

50
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:54,780
now stands less than 10%.

51
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,230
Life expectancy has been
increasing all over the world,

52
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,213
including the,

53
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:00,600
the poorest parts of the world.

54
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,043
Uh,

55
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:02,760
the,

56
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,740
the number of kids going
to school has increased.

57
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:04,941
We,

58
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:05,671
including girls,

59
00:02:05,671 --> 00:02:10,280
more than 90% of people under the age
of 25 on the planet are illiterate.

60
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:12,270
Now we have more leisure time.

61
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,133
We're safer,

62
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:13,651
uh,

63
00:02:13,651 --> 00:02:16,290
in measure after measure
life has been getting better.

64
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:21,350
And it's not the kind of development
that you could learn about reading the

65
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:21,841
papers.

66
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:26,610
Quite the contrary because
journalism covers what goes wrong.

67
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,180
Uh,

68
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,350
not what goes right.

69
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,350
You could easily come away with the
impression that the world is getting worse

70
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:34,380
and worse as a kind of
statistical illusion,

71
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:35,310
uh,

72
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,310
feeding a cognitive bias and not
realize until you looked at datasets,

73
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,320
how many ways in which life has improved,

74
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,630
including measures like war and crime,

75
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,231
uh,

76
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,064
which would,

77
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:51,300
what my guests are going in the wrong
direction as opposed to the right

78
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:52,134
direction.

79
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,030
That combined that the other motivation
for the book was a set of attacks on the

80
00:02:57,031 --> 00:03:02,031
application of science to the
traditional domains of the humanities to,

81
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,980
to history,

82
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,510
to the arts,

83
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:07,120
to morality,

84
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:07,990
to language.

85
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,070
Uh,

86
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:09,341
a,

87
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:09,521
a,

88
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:13,380
an effort that I think is quite
a celebrates the fact that,

89
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:13,670
that,

90
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,270
that scientific insights are
being brought to bear on,

91
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,223
um,

92
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,340
on Cuban affairs.

93
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,020
And how could they not give him that,

94
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:20,891
uh,

95
00:03:20,891 --> 00:03:25,240
art in society or are in
a sense products of our,

96
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,250
our psychology products of human nature.

97
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,020
But,

98
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:28,390
uh,

99
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,950
in a lot of the intellectual life,

100
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:34,951
there's bitter resentment to any
application of scientific ideas or the

101
00:03:35,351 --> 00:03:37,300
scientific mindset to,

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,380
to human affairs.

103
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:42,960
This was first noted by CP snow in his
famous lectures and [inaudible] and the

104
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,570
early,

105
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,200
late fifties,

106
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,340
early 1960s.

107
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,091
Uh,

108
00:03:46,091 --> 00:03:48,880
but the conflict is very much with us.

109
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,580
I wrote an essay called
science is not your enemy,

110
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,710
which were published
in the new Republican,

111
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:54,700
which went viral.

112
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:56,410
And that was the immediate,

113
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:00,670
a kickoff for the proposal that
ended up in the enlightenment.

114
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:01,280
Now,

115
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:01,550
uh,

116
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:05,860
I was involved in something
of a literary spat with,

117
00:04:05,861 --> 00:04:06,490
uh,

118
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:06,780
with,

119
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:06,910
uh,

120
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,040
Leon Wieseltier and editor
at the new republic.

121
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,390
But I quickly realized that,

122
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,290
uh,

123
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:15,370
two guys having an argument is
not enough to pump out a book.

124
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,790
And so I had the centerpiece of the book
just be the documentation of the fact

125
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:25,120
that most people are unaware of
namely back in most measures,

126
00:04:25,121 --> 00:04:26,530
life has gotten better over time.

127
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,580
Now,

128
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,410
as with the better angels of our nature,

129
00:04:29,411 --> 00:04:32,810
I didn't want to just
present a bunch of graphs.

130
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:34,300
So I did present many graphs,

131
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,560
but I wanted to explain them.

132
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,910
And it seemed to me that if we,

133
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:41,860
if there was any overarching
explanation as to why life get better,

134
00:04:41,861 --> 00:04:42,910
it's that people,

135
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,300
uh,

136
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,540
in the past thought that by
understanding how the world works,

137
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:47,620
including ourselves,

138
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,401
uh,

139
00:04:48,401 --> 00:04:49,990
we could try to solve problems,

140
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,880
remember what works,

141
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,440
uh,

142
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,080
uh,

143
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,531
drop the,

144
00:04:53,531 --> 00:04:54,550
drop the failures.

145
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,150
And as we accumulate our,

146
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:57,490
our cultural knowledge,

147
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,030
uh,

148
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,190
we can improve our wellbeing.

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,930
And I attribute that mindset to the light,

150
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,760
the idea that we can use knowledge
to improve human wellbeing.

151
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:12,150
Now that might sound almost too banal
and that tried to be worth defending.

152
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:18,310
And so I thought that those
ideals very much needed a defense.
