1
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,010
We had to,

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:10,953
uh,

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,930
some of your recent conversations with
people is we're operating at different

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:16,500
levels,

5
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,850
so Depok fruits,

6
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:19,440
apple pounds,

7
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:24,441
me with articles about quantum physics
that show their material stuff is really

8
00:00:24,901 --> 00:00:25,860
just energy.

9
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,920
Atoms are mostly empty space and so forth.

10
00:00:28,921 --> 00:00:29,401
Then you know,

11
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:29,641
this,

12
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:30,600
this table is,

13
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:30,870
you know,

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,670
it's actually mostly empty space.

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,320
This is all true,

16
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,940
but we don't live at the quantum level.

17
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,960
You live at the pro level where I'm
sitting in a chair and I'm not passing

18
00:00:39,961 --> 00:00:41,790
through it because at that,

19
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,773
at this level,

20
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,081
you know,

21
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:43,261
it's,

22
00:00:43,261 --> 00:00:44,310
it's not the same as that,

23
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:45,180
the quantum level.

24
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:46,014
And,

25
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,400
and I think making that distinction
helps clarify a lot of things.

26
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:55,401
So like when you talk about the truth
to be found in a biblical stories are,

27
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:56,760
or literary stories,

28
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:57,840
like that's the SD or,

29
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,610
or Shakespeare or whatever.

30
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,340
And a material scientist says,

31
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:02,700
well,

32
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,091
no,

33
00:01:03,091 --> 00:01:04,470
I mean something different by truth.

34
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,390
It's not that one of you is right,

35
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:07,081
the other's wrong.

36
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:11,160
It's just that these are different
levels or different ways of talking about

37
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,640
different toolkits.

38
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:15,720
Yeah.

39
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:16,010
That,

40
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:16,381
that's right.

41
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:17,191
Different tool kits.

42
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:17,551
That's right.

43
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,384
Yep.

44
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,820
Kind of the classic American pragmatist,

45
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,780
I think of these things as tools.

46
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,270
There's a scientific tool kit and there's
a tool kit for action in the world and

47
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:29,931
they overlap,

48
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:30,920
but they're not the same.

49
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:33,130
So for example,

50
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:33,990
I call this,

51
00:01:33,991 --> 00:01:34,824
um,

52
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,210
Elvis error,

53
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,590
Alvie singer,

54
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:39,480
they character in woody Allen's film,

55
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,770
um,

56
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,603
any hall.

57
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:45,480
And there's that funny scene where
there's a flashback to where he's in

58
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:49,680
childhood and he's refused to do his
homework and he's depressed and his mother

59
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:51,450
takes him to the doctor or psychiatrist,

60
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,021
whoever he is.

61
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:52,740
And okay,

62
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:52,971
what,

63
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:54,110
why are you depressed?

64
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:57,270
Because I found out that
the universe is expanding.

65
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:58,883
So what?

66
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:01,890
Because if the universe is expanding and
then eventually it's all going to blow

67
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,210
up and nothing means anything.

68
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:05,090
Others names Adam,

69
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,630
we live in Brooklyn.

70
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,450
Brooklyn's not expanding
and how to do homework.

71
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,260
That's a nice observation I think too,

72
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:14,400
because so,

73
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:14,820
okay,

74
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,160
let's go back to the
conceptualization issues.

75
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:19,260
So one of the things that we've agreed on,

76
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:22,230
and I don't want to lose track of that
thread because I think it's useful,

77
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:27,231
is that we do see an iconic reality
and the icons have practical utility,

78
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:32,901
but they also bear some one
to one correspondence with
the thing in itself and

79
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:35,810
it's low resolution is a
nice way of thinking about,

80
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,550
so they're low resolution
icons with functional utility.

81
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,100
Now the question would be,

82
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,520
so then what that makes clear is
that without human consciousness,

83
00:02:44,521 --> 00:02:45,900
all that disappears.

84
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:46,650
Right?

85
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,430
Okay.

86
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,430
Then the question is partly what is
there outside of that functional iconic

87
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:54,060
representation.

88
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,610
And so that would be the old
question of the thing in itself.

89
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:57,930
And you could say,

90
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:02,620
and I think you could say
with some justification that
the thing in itself is in

91
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:07,540
potential something that collapses across
time and space so that it's everything

92
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,890
and nothing at the same time,

93
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,440
which is I guess that's an eastern claim.

94
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,870
That's one way of thinking
about it or to Dallas claim.

95
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,110
And I like it because
the problem with the,

96
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:17,790
or the,

97
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:18,760
one of the issues that,

98
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,100
and this is associated
with the idea of Brooklyn,

99
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:24,160
it's not only does lb is
it they all be your LV,

100
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,120
LV,

101
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,610
LV not only does healthy live in Brooklyn,

102
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:30,040
he lives in Brooklyn now,

103
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,260
right?

104
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:34,390
And so it's spatially located
and temporarily located.

105
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,580
And so his mother's objection is,

106
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,540
well,

107
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:41,260
don't pick a reference point that makes
everything right now we irrelevant,

108
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,040
which I,

109
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,030
which is really good
practical psychological advice
because one of the things

110
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:50,920
that leads people down the
path of nihilism is this
claim that this observation

111
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:54,550
that you can pick a time frame of
analysis that makes your current action

112
00:03:54,551 --> 00:03:55,384
useless.

113
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,650
Who's going to care in a million years.

114
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,581
The is that,

115
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,950
argues it,

116
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,170
you know,

117
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,070
without God,

118
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:07,180
without some sort of external source
for morality and meaning nothing.

119
00:04:07,181 --> 00:04:07,690
What we're,

120
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,510
nothing we do matters
because in 15 billion years,

121
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:10,890
you know,

122
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,760
the heat death of the
universe or whatever,

123
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,950
we don't live 15 billion years from now.

124
00:04:14,951 --> 00:04:16,360
We live now here.

125
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,310
And what we do does matter.

126
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,330
Uh,

127
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:19,571
you know,

128
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,540
so like the,

129
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,251
this would argue,

130
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:21,820
you know,

131
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,140
the theodicy problem,

132
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:23,350
you know,

133
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:23,940
without God,

134
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,060
there's no right or wrong,

135
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,560
whatever Stalin did or
Hitler did is perfectly fine
because of the heat death of

136
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,070
the universe.

137
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:30,341
No,

138
00:04:30,341 --> 00:04:34,540
it's not fine because the people that
are suffering in the Gulag archipelago or

139
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,530
in the gas chambers,

140
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,813
that outfits,

141
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,400
they're not thinking about
15 billion years from now.

142
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:39,620
They're,

143
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,080
they're living right here right now.

144
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:42,910
The torture is really doing wrong,

145
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,650
like these standards.

146
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:45,484
So again,

147
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,250
the level at which we're
talking about is everything.
