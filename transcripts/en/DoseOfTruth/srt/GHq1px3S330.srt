1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,440
How's the online personality
tests coming along?

2
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,070
It's coming along pretty well.

3
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:17,640
We have all the reports
written and we have the,

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:18,823
um,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,720
the underlying computer
architecture finished.

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:24,570
And at the moment we're just
polishing it up essentially.

7
00:00:24,571 --> 00:00:29,571
And we're hoping that you'll be able to
get a very detailed description of all

8
00:00:30,391 --> 00:00:32,310
five of the big five traits,

9
00:00:32,311 --> 00:00:32,611
right?

10
00:00:32,611 --> 00:00:33,480
Extroversion.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
That's a positive emotion dimension.

12
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:36,600
Um,

13
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,110
that's,

14
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:42,110
that will break down into enthusiasm
and assertiveness and neuroticism.

15
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,220
Now it breaks down into withdrawal.

16
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,750
Like if you're in a state of withdrawal,

17
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,330
then you're frozen with fear and,

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,890
and don't want to do anything.

19
00:00:49,891 --> 00:00:50,910
You're afraid to go out.

20
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:51,480
You're,

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,170
you're afraid to engage in any
complex task because you might fail.

22
00:00:55,171 --> 00:00:56,790
You'll dealt yourself intensely.

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,250
That's withdrawal in neuroticism.

24
00:00:59,251 --> 00:01:02,910
And then volatility is that kind of
impulsive touchiness that people often

25
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:04,320
develop when they're in a bad mood.

26
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:04,531
You know,

27
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:06,540
where if you reach your
finger off to touch them,

28
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,070
they'll flinch and maybe slap you.

29
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,810
And they're over sensitive
to small slights and they
don't have much of a sense

30
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:13,644
of humor.

31
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,653
Um,

32
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,700
and agreeableness that subdivides into
compassion and politeness and the liberal

33
00:01:19,861 --> 00:01:22,350
types are more compassionate and the,

34
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,220
uh,

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,790
conservative types are more polite and
politeness seems to be something like

36
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:31,410
acting in accordance with the social
norms governing interpersonal interaction.

37
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:36,411
Whereas compassion seems to be the
proclivity to side with the weakest party,

38
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,470
something like that.

39
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:42,471
And I think it's the primary maternal
dimension because the perhaps alone with

40
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,590
higher levels of negative emotion because,

41
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,880
um,

42
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,400
it's obviously the case that when
you're dealing with children,

43
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:51,540
especially infants,

44
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:55,980
that you should take the side
of the weaker party pretty
much no matter what the

45
00:01:55,981 --> 00:02:00,720
logical argument and sprite because an
infant who's crying is always right,

46
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:02,790
especially if it's under a year old.

47
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,770
There's no logic to it.

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,100
It's,

49
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,700
it's an a priori fact that
a crying infant is correct.

50
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,230
And so we don't know how that translates
into the political sphere because the

51
00:02:13,231 --> 00:02:15,030
most direct translation would be,

52
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:15,990
um,

53
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,750
a complaining person is always right.

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,281
And you know,

55
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:22,440
I see that manifesting itself.

56
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,520
I would say great.

57
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:27,840
Clearly in the politically correct
domain is that you always side with the

58
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:30,600
person who's manifesting negative emotion.

59
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,220
And you always assume that there is
an external reason that needs to be

60
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:36,570
rectified in order to,

61
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:37,800
um,

62
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,581
to deal with that.

63
00:02:38,581 --> 00:02:39,630
And you know,

64
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,500
it isn't obvious to me that agreeableness
as an ethic is something that is

65
00:02:43,501 --> 00:02:46,620
transformable into the political
or the adult landscape.

66
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,580
But,

67
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,413
um,

68
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:49,590
well,

69
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,423
you know,

70
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,300
we don't know these sorts of things and
we can't even talk about them because

71
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:59,301
people automatically assume that that's
sexist or misogynistic or even though

72
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,021
you know,

73
00:03:00,021 --> 00:03:03,670
there are agreeable manner as well as a
group of women because men are quite um,

74
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,590
maternal for,

75
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,070
for,

76
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:09,100
for the kind of large apes
and mammals that we are.

77
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,240
But we need to take these sorts of things
seriously because it isn't obvious to

78
00:03:13,241 --> 00:03:17,940
me that an ethic of agreeableness
can govern a complex polity.

79
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,640
It looks to me more like conscientiousness
is something that needs to govern

80
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,480
arm's length transactions and that sort
of thing rather than treating everyone

81
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:28,450
like Ken that you just can't do
so you don't have the energy.

82
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:29,950
Um,

83
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,341
anyways,

84
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:34,930
the test will also associate
conscientious or assess conscientiousness.

85
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,310
That's orderliness,

86
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:38,590
which is seems to be
associated with disgust,

87
00:03:38,591 --> 00:03:43,591
sensitivity and is a good predictor of
conservative belief and industriousness,

88
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:45,340
which is something like the,

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,680
well it's what it says exactly.

90
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:52,681
It's the proclivity to engage in
effortful work towards a defined goal in a

91
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:56,860
reliable manner and it's the second
best predictor of longterm life success

92
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:57,760
after Iq.

93
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,770
And then the final thing it'll upset,

94
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,100
assessed is openness to experience,

95
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:05,590
which is more or less half creativity.

96
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,180
It half interest in ideas.

97
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,650
And so if,

98
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,350
if you take the test,

99
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,184
you'll get a boat,

100
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,930
it's about a 10 page report and it gets
quite detailed and it tells you where

101
00:04:16,931 --> 00:04:21,610
you fit on a percentile basis and what
your strengths and weaknesses are going

102
00:04:21,611 --> 00:04:21,851
to be.

103
00:04:21,851 --> 00:04:22,690
As a consequence,

104
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,830
we're going to produce a couple's version
so that two of you can take it and

105
00:04:26,831 --> 00:04:30,400
then you'll get a report that tells you
how you're similar and different and

106
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:34,540
where you're likely to have disagreements
and agreements where it's going to be

107
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,730
difficult to negotiate a consensus.

108
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,030
That'd be where your Wyatt widely
different from one another on a trait.

109
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:45,540
Like it's hard for an extrovert and an
introvert to come to an agreement about

110
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:48,580
how much socializing they're going
to do because the extrovert says,

111
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:49,331
well,

112
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,520
let's socialize all the
time in the introvert says,

113
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:51,761
well,

114
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:52,001
you know,

115
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,740
once a year would be plenty for me.

116
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,680
And those aren't opinions right there.

117
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:00,930
They're built in preferences that
are far beneath the realm of opinion.

118
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,240
And if you're high in openness and
your partner as low in openness,

119
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:08,710
like you're going to be interested in
the theater and arts and literature and

120
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,850
philosophy and,

121
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,130
and talking about ideas and,

122
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:15,540
and going to museums and not
sort of thing and your partner,

123
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:17,740
it's in some sense it will
be like they are colorblind,

124
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,740
they just won't find that sort of
thing engaging and interesting at all.

125
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:25,210
And you might be able to shift someone
a little bit to a higher degree of

126
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:25,691
openness,

127
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,220
but it's,

128
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,970
it's not an easy thing to do.

129
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:32,990
And so we think in the literature seems
to indicate that you should be fairly

130
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,950
well matched on most of your
traits with your partner,

131
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:36,640
uh,

132
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,770
with the possible
exception of neuroticism,

133
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:42,000
because it isn't obvious that two people
who are highly neurotic can get along.

134
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:42,370
Uh,

135
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:45,210
neuroticism is a pretty good
predictor of marital unhappiness,

136
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:48,790
just like it's a good predictor of
every other form of unhappiness.

137
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:49,960
So.
