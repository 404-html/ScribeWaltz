1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:11,590
Imagine you have a child and
they're playing soccer and uh,

2
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,760
your child is a pretty good soccer player.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:15,800
No,

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,850
I'll tell you a different story.

5
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,160
This actually happened.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,470
So I'm going to tell you a story about
hockey and I'm since I'm Canadian.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:25,311
What the hell?

8
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:26,780
I might as well tell you
a story about hockey.

9
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:28,113
Um,

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,690
my son played hockey,

11
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:30,680
he still plays hockey.

12
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,150
He's a pretty good hockey player.

13
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,410
And my wife and I used to
go watch him play hockey.

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,010
There was an arena just down the
street from us and there was a nice

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,240
neighborhood league there.

16
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:46,160
And so they'd start the kids into teams
and then they'd let them play a few demo

17
00:00:46,161 --> 00:00:46,994
games.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And if any team was getting stomped flat
or any other team was winning too much,

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:57,700
then they'd rebalanced the team so that
they were approximately equal in skill.

20
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,350
And so that was the sorting of the teams.

21
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:01,401
So,

22
00:01:01,401 --> 00:01:02,234
um,

23
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:03,790
and then they,

24
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:05,660
then they were on their
teams and then they play,

25
00:01:05,661 --> 00:01:06,440
you know,

26
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:08,540
15 games during the regular season.

27
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,040
They didn't have a little
tournament to see who won.

28
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:10,930
And,

29
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:11,330
uh,

30
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:12,200
it was really good.

31
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:16,670
It was good friendly league
and so my son's team was in,

32
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,970
I think it was the championship
game if I remember correctly.

33
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:25,370
And there's one kid on his team
who is the best player on the team,

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,840
but by quite a margin,

35
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,171
you know,

36
00:01:27,171 --> 00:01:28,700
he was very fast on his feet.

37
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,990
He could,

38
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,820
he could skate rings
around a lot of the kids.

39
00:01:31,821 --> 00:01:32,920
He was good at stick handling.

40
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,920
He was a good hockey player.

41
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,653
But um,

42
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,850
he had some problems.

43
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:38,684
This kid,

44
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,870
one problem was he wouldn't pass the puck.

45
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,641
Now you think,

46
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:43,761
well,

47
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:46,340
why the hell should you pass the puck
if you're the best hockey player?

48
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,690
Which is pretty much what he thought.

49
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,040
And the answer is,

50
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:49,874
well,

51
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,980
you're part of the team,

52
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:53,060
right?

53
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,130
You want to be the best
person on the team,

54
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:56,923
fair enough.

55
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,370
And you want to win the hockey game.

56
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,280
But you also want to what?

57
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,400
Make your team mates better players.

58
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:05,803
How's that?

59
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,120
Maybe you even want to meet
the people on other teams,

60
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:08,960
better players.

61
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,150
I knew now I know that's
going a little bit too far,

62
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:16,220
but you certainly want to make your
teammates better players and you might

63
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:16,431
think,

64
00:02:16,431 --> 00:02:16,581
well,

65
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:17,361
why would you do that?

66
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:19,760
Because if they're better than
maybe you won't be the best.

67
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,160
While that's a boneheaded way of looking
at the world because first of all,

68
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,650
if you amp up the competition around you,

69
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,440
maybe that will motivate you
to eat to be even better.

70
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:34,190
And it's a hell of a way to win
by making everyone else lose.

71
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,380
That's not much of a victory.

72
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,390
And so if you have any sense,

73
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,400
you pass the damn puck,

74
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,020
even if you're the better player,

75
00:02:42,021 --> 00:02:44,240
especially you especially do that.

76
00:02:44,241 --> 00:02:46,790
Let's say you've got a
comfortable two goal lead,

77
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,780
well then maybe you can risk taking the
time away from that specific game to

78
00:02:54,351 --> 00:02:55,580
build up the confidence,

79
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:56,451
confidence,

80
00:02:56,451 --> 00:02:58,040
and ability of your team mates.

81
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,750
And then maybe everybody thinks that
you're a bit of a leader and they make you

82
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,590
team captain.

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,320
Not even so much because
you're the best hockey player,

84
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,154
but because,

85
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,001
well,

86
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:07,834
because why?

87
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,400
That's the question.

88
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:09,821
Okay.

89
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:14,230
So we're watching the game and it's pretty
exciting and it's real close game and

90
00:03:14,231 --> 00:03:19,231
it's like three to three and it's a
minute left and another team zips down.

91
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,360
The nice and scores are
really brilliant goal.

92
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:27,510
And so my son's team loses except that
they were in the championship and it was

93
00:03:28,031 --> 00:03:28,990
a really good game.

94
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,770
So you know whether or not they
lost is not all that obvious.

95
00:03:32,771 --> 00:03:33,850
They lost that game.

96
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:34,841
But you know,

97
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:37,570
there's the broader context
to take into consideration.

98
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,111
Okay,

99
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:39,880
so this kid,

100
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,470
this this,

101
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:46,240
the star goes off the ice and he takes
his hockey stick and he smashes it on to

102
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:49,750
the cement and he's all angry
because as far as he was concerned,

103
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,890
he was robbed.

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,050
And maybe that's because of is useless.

105
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:56,860
Team mates who he didn't really
spend any time helping by the way.

106
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:01,120
And maybe it's because the referees were
unfair and who the hell knows why but

107
00:04:01,121 --> 00:04:06,121
it wasn't fair and his idiot
farther rushes over to them
and consoles and and on

108
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:13,030
his loss and supports him in
his notion that he was robbed.

109
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:18,760
And I thought you
unspeakable son of a bitch

110
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:27,980
because he was an arrogant narcissist
and it was way more important to him that

111
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:32,130
he had a son who was a star then,

112
00:04:32,131 --> 00:04:34,470
that he had a son who is a good person.

113
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,970
And that's absolutely inexcusable.

114
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,280
He made the wrong choice.

115
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:46,610
He sacrificed his son's soul in part to
help him save face for a hockey game.

116
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,520
That's not acceptable.

117
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,411
Okay?

118
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:54,880
So here's what you tell your children.

119
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,840
It doesn't matter whether you win or lose,

120
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:00,070
it matters how you play the game.

121
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,900
And so that's what the father should have
told the son and he should have meant

122
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:05,380
it.

123
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,041
And even better,

124
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,540
he should have known what it meant.

125
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,920
But who knows what that means because
you tell your children that and maybe

126
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:15,790
they're not so happy because they lost
the game and they look at you like you're

127
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:16,624
an alien.

128
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:17,801
And they think,

129
00:05:17,801 --> 00:05:17,951
well,

130
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,180
what the hell do you mean by that?

131
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:24,070
Because obviously it matters whether you
win and it does matter whether you win.

132
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,790
So what is it that you mean when
you say that and your kid asks,

133
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,870
well what do you mean by that?

134
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,010
And you go,

135
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,491
well,

136
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:31,390
I don't know what it means,

137
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,830
but it's a good rule.

138
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,940
So what do you mean by that?

139
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,440
Here's what you mean.

140
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,530
And it relates to rule five,

141
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:43,730
which is don't make your,

142
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,790
don't let your children do anything that
makes you dislike them because other

143
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,260
people will dislike them then.

144
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:51,710
And you don't want other people to
dislike your children unless you want your

145
00:05:51,711 --> 00:05:54,710
children to inhabit a world
where everyone dislikes them.

146
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,560
And maybe you do because
you don't like children.

147
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,920
And maybe you don't like your children
because you let them behave in ways that

148
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:02,120
makes you not like them.

149
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,750
And so the way you take revenge is by
not correcting them so that other people

150
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,630
will punish them because you don't
have the courage to discipline them.

151
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,090
And if you think that
people don't play that game,

152
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:14,540
then you don't know much about people
because they play that game all the time.
