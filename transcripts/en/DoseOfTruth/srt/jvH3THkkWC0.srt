1
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:14,893
You don't

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,550
take the opportunity to deliberately

3
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,190
as an opportunity to have a conversation
with a very large number of people

4
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,420
because a good lecture,

5
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,860
it's our second conversation because

6
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:34,950
people in the audience going to make
sure that everyone's going in the same

7
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,784
direction,

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,910
but also to push my thinking beyond where
I've gone and telling you things that

9
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,870
are going to rely on
things that I think I know,

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,900
but I'm trying to lead them into something
new so I can push it just a little

11
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:53,440
bit far out we are.

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,340
That makes us a lecture because
there's something alive about that.

13
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,870
I'm curious to deliver by

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,960
delivering a talk to the content side.

15
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,770
I'm trying to learn some things that
are most important and I'm trying to do

16
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:12,750
that in real time.

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,413
So that's.

18
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:15,810
That's the plan.

19
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,710
So the first

20
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,230
rule is not what is expedient

21
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,673
because.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,010
Because I think

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,620
there's a great question.

24
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,650
Our culture about whether or not the
experience of meeting or the real or the

25
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,680
experience say whether or not that's
real key is to figure out what's freedom.

26
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,110
You know,

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,280
we were founded.

28
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:12,281
The German back material
reality is at least clean that

29
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:21,880
we constructed the signed five years
ago and we believe that so far it seems

30
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:26,670
self evident to some degree is,

31
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:31,010
I mean there's something pretty
breathable material railroad

32
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:38,550
and our mastery of it from a technical
perspective in comparatively powerful and

33
00:02:40,911 --> 00:02:42,740
increasingly so and so,

34
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:48,950
and it has improved our lives
as well and so you don't want to

35
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,640
denigrate the maturity was,

36
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:54,903
but

37
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,590
just because that's a good way
of looking at the world is be the

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,520
best way and it's also
actually not our people.

39
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:07,894
Look at the world.

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,800
It's just a company in the world and

41
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,100
the way that people
seem to in our world is,

42
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:20,190
is as if the experience of meeting is the
most real and I think you can see that

43
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,120
most particularly if people's responses
to pain because pain is a form of

44
00:03:27,911 --> 00:03:28,520
leaving,

45
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,353
right?

46
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,760
Generative experience.

47
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,230
It's an emotional experience.

48
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:37,180
It's not self evidently material
because it has that suggested element,

49
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,040
but it's a very rare person.

50
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:43,390
That doesn't matter because if they
believe their pain is real and so I think

51
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,530
that's an interesting.

52
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,410
That's an interesting fact
because if you're nihilistic,

53
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,370
can you believe was like,

54
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,410
that's not meaning,

55
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,680
that isn't going to help
yourself with your pain,

56
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:55,260
and so even if you're an Ios,

57
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:58,720
we believe in the reality of
suffering about something,

58
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:03,721
you know in our ground students to realize
that actually here there's something

59
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:09,181
that I could take seriously even
in my dope and like disparate tape.

60
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:13,000
The fact that that
misery genuinely exists.

61
00:04:13,001 --> 00:04:16,600
I can take that seriously and that's
actually a hell of a fine starting point.

62
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:21,040
Don't descarte the philosopher,

63
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,790
when he was looking for a place to stand,

64
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:28,880
he underwent the process
that you described as radical
without trying to doubt

65
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:32,890
everything you can possibly know and
they make any ended up only being able to

66
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,950
not go with one thing which was
that he existed as a person who go,

67
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,390
he couldn't doubt the existence
of social consciousness

68
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:46,290
and that's where the famous line I think
therefore I am looking from and you get

69
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,320
really be an ad for like proceed or or
my experience exists or something like

70
00:04:54,491 --> 00:04:54,851
that.

71
00:04:54,851 --> 00:04:59,700
That's something that I can get a
good job taking that are in part,

72
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:02,460
but I know go into that

73
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,370
so that you can't criticize
that fundamental axiom
with quite a bit of success

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,880
and I've even been
something that was similar,

75
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:16,660
although I didn't know it at the time
because I was looking for something that I

76
00:05:16,661 --> 00:05:19,470
couldn't doubt that I couldn't do it.

77
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,770
I didn't really care what it was,

78
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,480
but if it's just like a for and for me,

79
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,740
it didn't end up being.

80
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,360
I think therefore I am.

81
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,090
It wasn't even the reality
of my consciousness,

82
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,210
which is where they ended up
with the reality of the pain.

83
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,231
I thought,

84
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:35,951
well that's the one thing.

85
00:05:35,951 --> 00:05:36,950
I cannot demand it,

86
00:05:36,951 --> 00:05:37,810
but the,

87
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:38,660
the,

88
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,660
the suffering exists as real mining
and other people and that's pretty

89
00:05:44,921 --> 00:05:46,420
pessimistic in some sense.

90
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,081
If you think,

91
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:47,261
well,

92
00:05:47,261 --> 00:05:48,850
the fundamental reality of suffering,

93
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,760
but I also learned at
approximately the same time,

94
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:55,370
but that was pretty high
level religious claim.

95
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,660
The might

96
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,520
listen in Judaism because
history of the Jews in history,

97
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,210
in some sense of suffering,

98
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:12,560
it's clearly the in Christianity
because of course the central finger

99
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:13,221
Christianity.

100
00:06:13,221 --> 00:06:17,800
As someone who's nailed to a cross
courtroom to data and and guys,

101
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,460
you know,

102
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,030
incredibly painful back,

103
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:25,031
so even if even if it's not explicitly
laid down the fundamental reality like

104
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:28,080
the suffering sort of
right there as the image.

105
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,653
So

106
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,560
that's,

107
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,393
that's,

108
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,460
that's a very pessimistic way of looking
at the world and that might be true,

109
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,750
but it might not be because

110
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,060
obviously the fact that there's a
pessimistic stack is pessimistic about the

111
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:52,820
fact that you admitted to that back.

112
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,970
That's not necessarily so pessimistic.

113
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:56,930
You know,

114
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,840
imagine that you're afraid of
something that's hard to imagine,

115
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:02,120
but then imagine that you
can notice you're afraid.

116
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:03,350
Anything come to terms with it.

117
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,040
What that means immediately
is that no matter how large,

118
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:11,330
the furious that there's something
in you could recognize that and then

119
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,880
conceivably transcendent.

120
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,260
And one of the things that I learned
about understanding the reality of both

121
00:07:18,261 --> 00:07:21,500
tragedy and malevolence because I
think those two things together make up

122
00:07:21,501 --> 00:07:22,970
suffering and tragedy.

123
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:27,410
Use the fact that you're prone
to illness and an old aging,

124
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:27,831
you know,

125
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,270
all of those old buildings.

126
00:07:29,271 --> 00:07:29,421
Look,

127
00:07:29,421 --> 00:07:29,951
the flesh,

128
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:30,784
let's say,

129
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,150
and millennials of course,

130
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:36,140
is that there's always someone around
making who's willing to make it a more

131
00:07:36,141 --> 00:07:41,141
worse than it has to be and that might
even be you fundamental reality of human

132
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:44,450
existence so,

133
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,540
but simultaneously there's that capacity
to serve that and contend with it and

134
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:56,111
then start to and then start to
work in forward looking manner.

135
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,230
Despite that,

136
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,390
and so one of the things,

137
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:04,450
the second thing are you going to say
after I was willing to put forward that as

138
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,100
a fundamental proposition,

139
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:11,890
the whole reality of suffering
is that way secondary.

140
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,750
That's,

141
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,060
that's not our most fundamental truth
for most fundamental truth is that people

142
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:21,080
are capable of transcending that and
so that takes the thing that's most

143
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:24,590
pessimistic and turns into perversely,

144
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:29,620
strangely and paradoxically immediately
turns it into something that's almost

145
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,040
unbelievably optimistic because you
can't imagine how you could possibly give

146
00:08:34,041 --> 00:08:37,570
people more credit and the book
the most terrible thing you could.

147
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,380
Magic happens to be true.

148
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,880
Life is limited and rural,

149
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:45,950
tormented by this fundamental truth,

150
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,170
but if we admitted to that
at faith based or greatly,

151
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,980
then we can transcend it.

152
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:52,770
And you know,

153
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:53,331
you might think,

154
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:54,164
well,

155
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,100
what's your evidence for that?

156
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,693
Well,

157
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,370
the evidence for that,

158
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,080
it's actually overwhelming.

159
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,800
The first thing is while you're here,

160
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,610
you know,

161
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:04,880
I mean,

162
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,400
despite the fact that the fundamental
conditions of your life in some sense,

163
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,420
the group,

164
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:14,220
you get yourself out of bed in the
morning and you go do your difficult jobs,

165
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,880
that you take care of your families
and you exist in the world despite its

166
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,930
limitations.

167
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,130
And even more importantly,

168
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:21,480
and this is something I'll return to,

169
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:25,520
this is also something very much
we're thinking is that you know,

170
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,660
you've got a relationship with people
around you and some of them you actually.

171
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,700
And that's a strange thing because
those people that you love,

172
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,790
their lights are characterized
by limitation and there's
a lot and maybe three

173
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,940
to change it by a certain muscles in the
left ones and your judgment because you

174
00:09:41,941 --> 00:09:42,751
do care for them,

175
00:09:42,751 --> 00:09:45,330
is that despite all that they're around.

176
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,810
Because that's actually the judgment
that you make when you actually care for

177
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:49,231
someone.

178
00:09:49,231 --> 00:09:49,770
Right?

179
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,160
You think,

180
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,993
well,

181
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,680
you know exactly what,

182
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
but despite their limitations,

183
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:59,010
really you actually care for the large
part because of their limitations,

184
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,390
which is a strange thing because

185
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:07,230
then the radio superseded and limitations
and weaknesses are all part of that

186
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:08,370
package.

187
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,460
It's not like you don't think that
maybe they could use some improvement,

188
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,490
but still the overall.

189
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,300
Chuck's,

190
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,091
when you love someone,

191
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:18,120
you overall general thing is
that all things considered,

192
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,140
it's been consistent,

193
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,390
that they are serious,

194
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:26,570
that's jumping

195
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,650
and I'm just thinking about myself,

196
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,740
but he was a kid.

197
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,243
No

198
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,843
kid,

199
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,710
especially kids from.

200
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,070
Well,

201
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,940
when they're under three,

202
00:10:44,941 --> 00:10:48,890
they're pretty damn and
are resilient in some ways,

203
00:10:48,891 --> 00:10:49,530
but they're,

204
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:50,040
you know,

205
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,490
they knew what the hell to do
it and just take note there.

206
00:10:53,491 --> 00:10:58,491
That can hurt and so you have to be a
wait to make sure that nothing terrible

207
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,933
happens to them.

208
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:05,590
They're not holding too much by other
children or their siblings or their

209
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,020
parents for that matter.

210
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:11,520
You know the baby that they don't hurt
themselves when they're trying to learn

211
00:11:11,521 --> 00:11:13,170
how to operate the chapter.

212
00:11:13,430 --> 00:11:16,520
They're characterized by this
terrible vulnerability and it's,

213
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,640
it's kind of brutal.

214
00:11:17,641 --> 00:11:18,450
The Roman,

215
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:19,620
because they can be heard,

216
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:22,550
you really get sick correctly.

217
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,130
This,

218
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,970
I don't know if it was much worse.

219
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,711
That can happen to you,

220
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:29,160
I don't think except maybe
to be this sick child,

221
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,540
him or herself.

222
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,210
There is much work to happen in your life.

223
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:34,890
That shop was a great deal.

224
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:35,963
That's rough.

225
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,740
I mean there's lots of terrible
things that can happen to you.

226
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,990
Maybe that's not the worst,

227
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:41,940
but it's definitely out there day.

228
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,190
It's rough and then you think,

229
00:11:44,191 --> 00:11:44,730
well,

230
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,390
wouldn't it be better if your chunks
didn't ever have anything wrong with it?

231
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,621
And then you think,

232
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:49,771
well,

233
00:11:49,771 --> 00:11:52,860
what would you have to do in
order to make that the case?

234
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,920
So the all that vulnerability,

235
00:11:54,921 --> 00:11:56,030
that's painful disappeared.

236
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:56,651
First of all,

237
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,880
they wouldn't be three years old

238
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,500
while you were capable of
taking care of yourself and your

239
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,353
abilities.

240
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,030
You know,

241
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,030
maybe you don't necessarily want to be
free if you want them to be like 20 feet

242
00:12:18,311 --> 00:12:19,144
tall.

243
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,410
So stellar human intelligence
and replaceable parts.

244
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:25,760
It's like,

245
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,550
well that removes a lot more.

246
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,980
It's not much less like your son.

247
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:34,310
It's just replaced it with a macro

248
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,890
themes that

249
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,400
kind of dream.

250
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,520
I'm really serious about math because
we're moving very rapidly to a narrow

251
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
artificial intelligence and robotics and
God only knows what would that be part

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
of a dream that we'd have to replace our
vulnerable selves on something and that

253
00:13:03,101 --> 00:13:05,880
would not be anymore whenever

254
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:12,670
and wherever we are with this fear and
with all the misery of the world bicycle

255
00:13:12,671 --> 00:13:15,630
that you could make a case that
maybe that's not for the worst,

256
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:20,340
but I think and so what that
means is we have to accept,

257
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:26,310
we have as part of your case for
existence and you might think,

258
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:27,360
well,

259
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,111
is it worth it?

260
00:13:28,111 --> 00:13:32,200
And I think in to respond to it with kids,

261
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:37,270
take that person's ultimate Hazel for sex.

262
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,880
You're pretty damn happy,

263
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:43,340
but they're around under
current form and so that's,

264
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,583
that's,

265
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,520
that's something that's worth
thinking about as far as.

266
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:50,890
So back to meeting.

267
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:51,940
So

268
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,480
I spent a little time thinking
about how the brain works.

269
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:07,190
The brain structure is
stranger than safety

270
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,940
and no more stranger.

271
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,420
Again,

272
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,740
partly because we don't understand the
relationship between consciousness,

273
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,803
emphasis material,

274
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:16,663
substrate.

275
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:21,600
They don't really understand that are
hitting the science of consciousness.

276
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:26,470
That's pretty hard for about 30 minutes
now since it became somewhat respectable

277
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:28,210
as a you're making studying,

278
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,580
I wouldn't say progress.

279
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:35,680
There's something wrong consciousness
that's an intractable Mr. existence what

280
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:41,010
its relationship to its material substrate
and so that was interesting and but

281
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:47,080
it's also interested that your
post analytics is bifurcating,

282
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:49,150
right?

283
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:53,490
You'd have two hemispheres
and the medical division,

284
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,290
he didn't realize that human
beings before we moved around,

285
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:01,370
so if you follow the logic
of evolutionary biology,

286
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,780
it reflects a duality that's
built into reality itself.

287
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,730
If you make the assumption that reality,

288
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:13,100
that's the selection in the course
of natural and what is selected is a

289
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:14,600
reflection of reality,

290
00:15:14,601 --> 00:15:16,840
which is like the Darwinian
truism essentially.

291
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:19,680
You can't really deny any of that.

292
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,980
It appears that has two
components to it as the case.

293
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:26,900
It's an implicit case,

294
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,960
mostly 12 rows like that that can be
mapped out using the language of chaos and

295
00:15:33,591 --> 00:15:34,190
order.

296
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:34,590
Again,

297
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:39,590
think about the most with the idea
that the world is chaos and order,

298
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,630
which I think is a nice way
of conceptualizing that.

299
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:44,901
Well,

300
00:15:44,901 --> 00:15:49,901
one is actually more real than almost
any other ideas and so if you say,

301
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:50,931
well,

302
00:15:50,931 --> 00:15:51,950
once you're approved for that,

303
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,140
that will say what the fruit,

304
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,860
the fact that that's how your brain
discretion and not just curating also Adam

305
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:01,580
was praying so it's deeper than
just human and your left hemisphere.

306
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,803
This is,

307
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,140
this is an oversimplification
because people are slightly.

308
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,520
People are differently.

309
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:11,910
Lab realized that this is true with
your left hemisphere to specialized or

310
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,930
operation in territory that you explore
and understand and it's sort of a

311
00:16:17,271 --> 00:16:19,250
totalitarian and experienced some sense.

312
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:23,690
It's always trying to impose its current
blogs on the world without having to

313
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:27,740
change them and you don't want to change
your model all the time because just to

314
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:31,040
cognitively effortful but so you're
going to take short cuts to preserve it.

315
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:34,070
If you can't because you put a
lot of work into your damn mall.

316
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,500
Here's the first mistake,

317
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,510
but it does make you kind of repeat it.

318
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,760
I'm able to admit to,

319
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:46,700
or a procedural error that seems to be
a left hemisphere function is primarily

320
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:51,340
associated with articulate speech and and,

321
00:16:51,550 --> 00:16:52,240
and,

322
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,360
and operation in the
known explored character.

323
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,850
Now you know,

324
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,140
if you think about the tribal landscape,

325
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,013
might think,

326
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,020
well,

327
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,230
what,

328
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:02,780
what was the,

329
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,040
how was the world constituted for
much of our evolutionary history.

330
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,340
You can kind of think of it this way,

331
00:17:07,341 --> 00:17:10,790
is that there was a fire and would
center things because we'd been hanging

332
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:14,750
around campfires for something on the
order of two years and the campfire,

333
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,580
the dark and said big,

334
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:16,910
right?

335
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,520
Then all the terrible things that lived
at the darkness that we're more than

336
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:20,470
happy to eat you.

337
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,150
And so there was no.

338
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:27,460
There was the fire as the center and the
place that the fire shot on light on.

339
00:17:27,801 --> 00:17:32,780
And then there was the dark perimeter
beyond that where the predators lit up and

340
00:17:32,781 --> 00:17:34,400
you can go out into the dark perimeter.

341
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:37,040
You can bring something of value,

342
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:38,330
but it's very dangerous team.

343
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,010
So that was really the
landscape of human based.

344
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,410
Its whole base of you to
your family and your tribe.

345
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:48,340
And then there's the
periphery that's from that.

346
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,780
You can think about that as explored
territory and unexplored territory.

347
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,610
That's a good way of conceptualizing it.

348
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:58,910
And that's the that dad really is explored
territory and unexplored territory.

349
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,540
Your spirit functions in the filmmaking,

350
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,900
unexplored territory,

351
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,200
and your right hemisphere
functions into domain,

352
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,500
unexplored territory.

353
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:12,480
What that means is you don't like it
when your right hemisphere turns off

354
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,540
because unexplored territory
is a place where things are.

355
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,450
And maybe even a horror movie now,

356
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,520
just learn would have your right
hemisphere through just to see what that's

357
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,620
like.

358
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:25,230
You could,

359
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:29,110
you could experiment with it if you can
explore it and maybe you could fortify

360
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:31,700
yourself with somebody because that's
what people do when they will see

361
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,400
thrillers are strangers.

362
00:18:33,401 --> 00:18:37,950
Why the hell would you
see like this stairs,

363
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,000
20 bucks it just strip it out,

364
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,943
right?

365
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,070
We'll do that.

366
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:46,043
We'll do that.

367
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,490
They're doing what I mentioned at
the beginning of this talk was there.

368
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,790
They're toying with
their own vulnerability,

369
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:53,731
right?

370
00:18:53,731 --> 00:18:54,730
And they're attempting to.

371
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:00,610
We're watching narratives of adventure
or is we're planning with our

372
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,551
vulnerability.

373
00:19:02,551 --> 00:19:03,860
When you rollercoasters,

374
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:07,730
you know we do that whenever we push
yourself off the edge and flirt with

375
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,380
potassium were toying with her.

376
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,920
We're also pointing with the big.

377
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:19,260
We're toying with our ability to move
out into uncharted territory and to

378
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:20,094
prevail,

379
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,520
and here's a.

380
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,230
here's a thought.

381
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,063
You know,

382
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,490
you might want to stay in
explored characteristics.

383
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,610
That's where it's safe.

384
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:31,580
The problem with that is that
explored I unexplored territory.

385
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,443
Various is saying,

386
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:35,920
I can just run down a date
because then like the dragon will.

387
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,790
You would have a pdf
that's food as strategy,

388
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,000
but if you really want to compare
yourself to the world or the world,

389
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,680
you don't just stay
where you're comfortable.

390
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,670
You stay where you're
comfortable enough going to die,

391
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:52,460
but you put one foot out where you
don't understand and then you balance

392
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:55,740
yourself there and you stay there
as much as you possibly can,

393
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,050
and that's actually what meaning is.

394
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,530
And I think that I think we know enough
about brain function actually say that

395
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:06,330
the sense of meaning that
envelops you when you're,

396
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,520
when you're occupied
property of your life,

397
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,400
is a neurophysiological
signal that you have.

398
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,870
The fundamental constituent elements of
reality in proper balance and you think,

399
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:16,111
well,

400
00:20:16,111 --> 00:20:17,730
why would that be the case?

401
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,271
I mean,

402
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:19,650
let's be hard to get it right.

403
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,350
We're not going to get old
mythological and religious about this.

404
00:20:22,370 --> 00:20:23,203
Let's be Africa.

405
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,990
We're going to stay in
there for materialistic.

406
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,873
Don't make.

407
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,650
It's like you're an evolved creature.

408
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,120
You're evolved for the actual world.

409
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,560
The actual world is made up
of things you don't want to.

410
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,350
Things you don't know.

411
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:36,870
A lot of things you don't
know are pretty dangerous.

412
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:39,780
Now you can stay where
everything is comfortable.

413
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,820
You can stay inside the walls,

414
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,030
but that's not very good strategy because
the things that are outside of the

415
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:47,330
wall can pick them up inside walls.

416
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,430
That's the state.

417
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:48,930
Regardless.

418
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,630
That's that's why in
paradise there's a state,

419
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,650
if they fall on paradise city,

420
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:00,600
which is are full of garden just speaks
to what the health of the state and then

421
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,340
there's no making a walled garden snake.

422
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,510
And so what that means is that not only
you have to be able to live with the

423
00:21:07,511 --> 00:21:07,871
garden,

424
00:21:07,871 --> 00:21:10,600
you bloody well better be
able to deal with the snakes.

425
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:14,940
And what that means is that's what you
should practice and would that mean that

426
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,720
you know that and when you feel
that things are aligned with your,

427
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,740
when you're doing things that
are meaningful and engaging,

428
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,920
what that means is that you've got
the balance between chaos and order,

429
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:26,650
right?

430
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,340
And that means that you're secure at
the same time you're extending your

431
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:31,180
confidence.

432
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:32,531
And then you might say,

433
00:21:32,531 --> 00:21:34,210
what is that real answer is,

434
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,020
well,

435
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,940
how about survival is that's real.

436
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,540
How about the expansion of
the human capacity to survive?

437
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,670
Is there anything more real than that?

438
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:43,430
Well,

439
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,010
not from a Darwinian perspective.

440
00:21:45,011 --> 00:21:45,844
There is.

441
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:49,830
And it could easily be that there isn't
anything more real then what's rebuild

442
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,370
from a therapy perspective.

443
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,800
And so I would say that the
sense of being an arrogant guy,

444
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:58,790
and it's interesting too,

445
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,460
I mean there's no shortage of religious
speculation on the depth of meaning.

446
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,590
I'll look at a particular symbol for
this for the sake of illustration.

447
00:22:08,591 --> 00:22:09,790
So you know,

448
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,200
for whatever reason,

449
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,780
very mysterious reason,

450
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,940
the image of the crucifixion
has transfixed the van,

451
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,070
the imagination of
humankind for 2000 years.

452
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,530
Now it's not obvious why,

453
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:24,011
in fact,

454
00:22:24,011 --> 00:22:29,011
it's quite obvious why it's a and to
put a symbol like that which is simple,

455
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,490
most painful death would be
trading something like that.

456
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,830
To put that in angels,

457
00:22:35,831 --> 00:22:40,831
that took like 300 years to build
something with your ability to close,

458
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:44,040
they knew those things were
going to take 300 years to build.

459
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,440
It was like no moon shop,

460
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,010
you know,

461
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:46,843
was no joke.

462
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:50,590
Those things took a lot of work and a
lot of resources and they're all built to

463
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,330
encapsulate this symbol
is horrific symbol.

464
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:54,790
It's like,

465
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,170
what the hell's going on there?

466
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,490
What if you could,

467
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,100
if you look at it from a
detached a bit and think,

468
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:00,221
well,

469
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:05,020
there's mystery and there's an idea.

470
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,030
There's a deep fear that the idea is
that the fundamental adaptive pattern is

471
00:23:12,341 --> 00:23:17,341
that which is is that which is
expressed in the radical acceptance of

472
00:23:17,921 --> 00:23:22,070
vulnerability and the level of the
crucifixion represents absolutely.

473
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:26,860
The Passion story represents and the
reason it's a typical story independent of

474
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:28,330
its religious significance,

475
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,470
don't have not speaking.

476
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:34,490
Then physically speaking as a psychologist
is that there was an idea and the

477
00:23:34,691 --> 00:23:38,490
idea is that if you strip
away everything from life,

478
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,300
you're living with the fact that your
vulnerability as an Oracle baiting and the

479
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:44,630
fact that you're subjugating,

480
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,080
okay,

481
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,820
the question is what do you do with that?

482
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,790
And the answer is the answer
that's expressed by that symbolism.

483
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,880
You accept him as radically and completely
as you can and the consequences that

484
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:03,190
can transcend that and all of our cultural
work that surrounds that symbol has

485
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,260
to bring that idea

486
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:12,110
up into something resembling
articulated consciousness.

487
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,071
You know,

488
00:24:13,071 --> 00:24:15,980
and we spent all those thousands of years

489
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:21,350
similar being possessed by that symbol
in an attempt to try to actually

490
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:24,020
understand what it means
and that's what it means.

491
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:29,260
It means that your best is to accept
you crucified preconditions of existence

492
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,150
and to move forward.

493
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,810
Appeal towards the best thing
that you could envision.

494
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,073
Regardless.

495
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,920
I think that that is.

496
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I do believe that an APP has never been
expressed in another Christian music

497
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,460
because it's such a well
known representation.

498
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,680
It's still something that's part of
our culture that everyone has to here.

499
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,730
But you see those sorts
of ideas expressed in,

500
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:10,010
in great stories from
traditional models of the world,

501
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:11,240
and it's the story.

502
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,960
It's the story of a radical
hero's language say,

503
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,470
and routing and encouraged,

504
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,300
and that's the courage to

505
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,160
dare to live in the property world,

506
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,293
which you

507
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,010
know,

508
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:29,540
sometimes you see people who are dying
and they look like good people because

509
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,250
they're not doing anything wrong.

510
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:34,550
You don't even have a conception
that things might be awesome.

511
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,833
They're like,

512
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,830
when you have good number,

513
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,370
those two issues in some senses,

514
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,740
to be the unconscious,

515
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:43,610
you know,

516
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,670
you're not a good person,

517
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,583
you know,

518
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,690
maybe until you actually
practice in Arabic so that
you've got some tea and then

519
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,630
decided that despite that your.

520
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,170
Despite that and despite the different
brutality in the world and you're going

521
00:26:00,171 --> 00:26:05,171
to act as an agent in the world who is
devoted at every level that's possible

522
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,240
towards making things better of it.

523
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:08,463
Worse

524
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,913
asking

525
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:21,690
question,

526
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,610
are you ready?

527
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,643
First of all,

528
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,090
oh,

529
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:33,923
well,

530
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,400
what do you mean by that?

531
00:26:35,401 --> 00:26:38,940
Exactly that what you mean by that.

532
00:26:38,941 --> 00:26:40,590
It's the same thing
that I meant like that.

533
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,080
And then the next.

534
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,230
I think is what sort of trap or
exactly when you will laugh about them,

535
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:49,830
right?

536
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:54,830
Because that's interesting because the
trap in that statement is it's there.

537
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,490
It's not obvious exactly what it is.

538
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,550
You started with something like,

539
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,740
well,

540
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,450
here's formulate questions,

541
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,740
here's a set of potential formulate
answers and it's under one of those or be

542
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:08,574
like answers.

543
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,610
Here's a boss.

544
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,910
I can ignore you and walk away,

545
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:25,810
and so I was thinking now
I'm just thinking about that.

546
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,770
There's always the possibility
that I'm not answering it because I

547
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,253
take

548
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:36,220
it seriously because I

549
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,393
know

550
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,343
possible.

551
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:43,023
That's

552
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:48,790
important to answer that question
for a long period of time.

553
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,280
If you want to know the answer to that.

554
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:56,310
If you want to know that I have a lecture
series 40 hours long and you listen to

555
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:03,530
that because that large constantly
requires 52 hours if you record it.

556
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,620
Do you want an answer?

557
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:08,350
That question?

558
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:10,180
Here's a 52 hour

559
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:15,670
to have a serious answer.

560
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,380
I was thinking about that.

561
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:37,340
I think I just don't mind it a little
bit in this discussion that we've already

562
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:39,610
had it so hard to get small.

563
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,183
Okay,

564
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,220
so let's say it's a question of

565
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:49,550
what you might put your faith and let's
say you put your faith in something

566
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:53,150
because you don't know everything and
so he starting point and I think that's

567
00:28:53,151 --> 00:28:57,470
actually true because you're fundamentally
eight different because you don't

568
00:28:57,471 --> 00:28:58,304
know everything.

569
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,380
Then you have to ask as if some things
are fundamentally true or you just can't

570
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:04,214
be many.

571
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,073
Right?

572
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,360
That's true.

573
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:12,060
So then the question might be that some
things are fundamentally true in order

574
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:15,130
to exist at a in the world looking to see

575
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,630
what are the things that you should
act as the Afar fundamentally true.

576
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,341
And I can say,

577
00:29:22,341 --> 00:29:23,174
well

578
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,010
I take the attitude that I've laid out
with regards to my three year old son is

579
00:29:28,011 --> 00:29:28,930
a good example of that.

580
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:29,530
Again,

581
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:33,980
you might start by hypothesizing that the
fact that people exist as a good thing

582
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:36,620
rather than a bad thing and you know,

583
00:29:36,621 --> 00:29:37,131
you might think,

584
00:29:37,131 --> 00:29:38,180
well that's all instance

585
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,440
about a month and ago within
philosopher from South Africa

586
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,870
and he wrote a book,

587
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,400
the kind of person I can't
remember unfortunately,

588
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,430
but his basic presupposition
and he lays this out,

589
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,760
but it hasn't been very
large number of followers,

590
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,070
absolutely catastrophic,

591
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,760
horrific and miserable
and it would be better if

592
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,970
you think that's pretty useful,

593
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,480
but he actually thinks that we're all
able to bring someone into the world,

594
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:14,483
not to.

595
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:15,520
You know,

596
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,980
you haven't taken any sort of argument
with a certain degree of seriousness

597
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,400
because I know that when women are
thinking about having children and not,

598
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,580
the reason they decided not to express
is that they don't want to bring a child

599
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:33,440
into a world like this and it's
usually because they have some mouse.

600
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,330
This apprehension,

601
00:30:34,331 --> 00:30:37,090
but now it's worse than
any other time in history.

602
00:30:37,091 --> 00:30:42,020
Which is so absolutely not true that
this is just a miracle that you can think

603
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:51,983
serious.

604
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:53,970
The census.

605
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:57,790
You bring somebody into the world
that they're going to suffer and die.

606
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:02,510
Perhaps something like retreats

607
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,010
being itself apart,

608
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,040
so much suffering.

609
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,280
It's actually not

610
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,620
fair.

611
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,453
Now.

612
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,420
It was two things.

613
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:22,490
One is that if you accept
that you don't stop there,

614
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,840
you can't just say,

615
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:24,081
well,

616
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:28,960
I think being is unjustifiable and
so we shouldn't have any more bs.

617
00:31:29,270 --> 00:31:30,620
Argument doesn't stop there.

618
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,190
The argument,

619
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:36,190
it's to be unjust celebrating and that
makes me bitter and angry and vengeful

620
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,500
and destructive and then I
take my revenge on the world,

621
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:47,120
and so when you look at the motivation
of people who these terrible things in

622
00:31:47,121 --> 00:31:47,930
the world,

623
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,610
they start with a presupposition.

624
00:31:49,611 --> 00:31:54,611
That being is is intrinsically feedback
and then proper role is to do something

625
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:02,410
to take advantage of that and that's
like a bad argument because it's being as

626
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,740
expensive to be bad,

627
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,450
maybe get a hell of a lot worse because
of what you're doing is not a solution.

628
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,530
So I think that

629
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,980
I would also say the problem with that
lack of argumentation is that it actually

630
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:24,040
does underestimate seriously underestimate
him with regards to the counseling,

631
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,670
the grandeur Europe,

632
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:28,940
the human spirit.

633
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,000
Because I do think that white is treasure,

634
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,940
can you just buy my level?

635
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:40,570
If you look at the facts of the matter
rush that human beings are so remarkable

636
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:47,690
that they can actually continue
with that and make it work.

637
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,760
And so I would say as I said,

638
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,420
get the hell out of bed
in the morning despite,

639
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:53,761
you know,

640
00:32:53,761 --> 00:32:57,500
there's lots of people in this audience
who are carrying some pretty vicious

641
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:02,501
burgers maybe in one or
two per 10 different ways,

642
00:33:02,931 --> 00:33:03,151
you know,

643
00:33:03,151 --> 00:33:07,520
because lots of people and you will be.

644
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,393
So

645
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,440
if you're not open profitability that you
have a first degree relative can start

646
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:20,150
something fairly serious wrong with it.

647
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:21,230
It's pretty damn high.

648
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,510
And if you happen to be one of those
periods in life where that is happening,

649
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:30,820
make more power to you because
you don't make assumptions.

650
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,403
But,

651
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,060
and still,

652
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:37,910
despite that fact you're getting,

653
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,020
how often do you go to work?

654
00:33:39,021 --> 00:33:41,150
And most of you are miserable.

655
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,030
We're trying to make everything
worse as a consequence.

656
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:46,310
So like we need to be.

657
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,353
Because

658
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,050
if you go into a shop or a liberal diners,

659
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,450
say you go there and get a cup
of coffee and fresh orange juice,

660
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:03,300
get some that are part of one
side versus the left writing,

661
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,050
so it means that they've managed to
transcend that tracks for your very

662
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:07,884
existence

663
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,810
when they go unnoticed
and I don't make sure

664
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,600
you understand what

665
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:32,740
people truly bear.

666
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:37,250
If you opened your eyes to that and you
see them through a simple glance of all

667
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,820
the you accept that suffering,

668
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,950
something like that.

669
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,330
Then the fact that someone just pleasant
to you when you go to the diner in the

670
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,360
morning and ask for a cup of coffee in
his mirror and I really think that isn't

671
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:51,304
the case.

672
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:56,440
I also think that that's an antidote to
the sorts of toxic ideas in our society,

673
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,920
like the fact that the
planet will be better off.

674
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:01,950
There weren't so many people.

675
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,400
I think it's the last
thing that you would want.

676
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,580
Anyone who's hand was near
the nuclear button to,

677
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,763
for example,

678
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:14,210
or somehow was cancer on the face of the
planet and that our very existence is

679
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,400
indication of our toxicity because of
all you can have a little sympathy for

680
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:20,234
ourselves.

681
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:20,741
You know,

682
00:35:20,741 --> 00:35:22,490
we're the only creatures on earth.

683
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,200
The struggle forward under incredible
psychological distress APP.

684
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:31,580
It's built right into the
fabric of our and given that

685
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,310
we did pretty damn well.

686
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,230
People don't,

687
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,620
and we're doing,

688
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:45,060
we're doing everything we can say as far
creatures to make things better rather

689
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:45,680
than worse.

690
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,640
And you can tell about,

691
00:35:46,641 --> 00:35:48,910
because I came here today,

692
00:35:49,970 --> 00:35:53,520
this is a pretty nice place to trees

693
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:57,123
no

694
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,010
to like trees

695
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,903
and you don't care.

696
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,260
And most of our cities,

697
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,950
especially in North America,

698
00:36:06,951 --> 00:36:07,784
Europe,

699
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,413
here's

700
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,183
structure,

701
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,230
no water,

702
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,073
so

703
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,360
you have a.

704
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,600
You can go off the street.

705
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,270
No one kills even takes you all.

706
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,060
I'm always happy.

707
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,490
That is the baseline condition.

708
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,353
Keep an

709
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:53,940
no easily societies to
generate the absolute mayhem
and how often that happens.

710
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,293
It's

711
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,720
still know to remind

712
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:03,343
me

713
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,510
there's not going to get it to as well.

714
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,410
So you know,

715
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:31,763
we'll use,

716
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:32,400
right?

717
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:37,400
Because if it's cash for coffee,

718
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:44,530
how fragile systems are in general
in every moment where that has been

719
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,050
happening,

720
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:50,050
it's actually a kind of miraculous human
spirit and one of the things I would

721
00:37:51,261 --> 00:37:54,450
say is we have a pretty decent website,

722
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,550
like our society is pretty damn civilized.

723
00:37:58,310 --> 00:38:02,640
I know their flaws and resources
that are given are distributed,

724
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,280
will be,

725
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,490
and that's obviously caused
a certain amount of trouble,

726
00:38:07,491 --> 00:38:10,220
but it can be a hell of a
lot worse than the extent.

727
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,190
We're pretty damn fortunate
that things are good.

728
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,990
You can take a certain amount of credit
for that because the reason they're good

729
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:22,990
is most of you are pretty
trustworthy and so how have

730
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:28,340
you seen around the world and in history,

731
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:33,150
there's so many corrupt states and once
the society is at the state and that

732
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:34,380
will not be individually level.

733
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:39,160
The baseline interaction between people
is predicated on trust on virtually

734
00:38:39,161 --> 00:38:42,190
impossible to figure
out how it gets going.

735
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:46,660
You can't trust anyone around you
and how do you start trusting people?

736
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:47,910
It just never seen.

737
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,840
It's just something that doesn't
seem to ever get off the ground fall

738
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:56,060
interaction in the west and increasingly
I would say the rest of the world that

739
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,800
the world is actually one of the trust.

740
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:00,550
I can give you an example of this.

741
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,483
This is a small,

742
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,993
um,

743
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,640
I think I've told this story was
in a chapter I cut out at 12 olds,

744
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:10,620
but it will be in the next

745
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,421
20 years ago.

746
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:22,180
And he drove in the car.

747
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,130
It's a little cadillac and a

748
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,120
rainstorm and hit the brakes and the
car into a wall right on the corner.

749
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,193
It's about,

750
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:38,540
because it takes the bumper panel and

751
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,160
the closing thing,

752
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,450
he was all embarrassed.

753
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:15,370
I decided to get the
car fixed or something,

754
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,510
if it's like worth more
than what we can do that.

755
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,560
And so I went online because,

756
00:40:21,561 --> 00:40:22,394
you know,

757
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:23,450
people want to fix your car.

758
00:40:23,451 --> 00:40:25,620
You can go online if
you could describe it.

759
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,790
A partner in geography result for

760
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,510
a good deal.

761
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:36,020
So I waited,

762
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:39,140
did this guy from Mississippi,

763
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,140
he said,

764
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,200
I kept that part and so we communicate
by email and he said he wanted some

765
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:52,841
ridiculous price for $160 for the whole
assembly and it's going to ship it,

766
00:40:53,151 --> 00:40:53,610
recharges,

767
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,610
brings to that deal and I wouldn't be so,

768
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:01,340
so that was fine and I

769
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:10,060
just went over to the yard and I found
out that there's a plastic piece on the

770
00:41:10,341 --> 00:41:13,700
side and it has the
scratching and I thought,

771
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,931
that's so amazing.

772
00:41:14,931 --> 00:41:17,110
It's like you're a
geography the Mississippi,

773
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,620
I'm never going to get you don't know
who they are and you already gave me a

774
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:23,340
pretty good deal on this part yet.

775
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,010
You caught me scratch.

776
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,621
Well thank you.

777
00:41:27,621 --> 00:41:28,454
That's great.

778
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:29,900
Very good.

779
00:41:30,970 --> 00:41:34,130
And then it extended scratch.

780
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:34,520
Really?

781
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,240
Scraps likes to be on the oven.

782
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,460
He called me again about 15 minutes later.

783
00:41:39,110 --> 00:41:40,160
Wait a sec if you want.

784
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,060
Did you want the bumper?

785
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:43,663
The Lights?

786
00:41:43,930 --> 00:41:44,361
And I said,

787
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:46,220
well I specified that in,

788
00:41:46,430 --> 00:41:46,741
you know,

789
00:41:46,741 --> 00:41:47,660
my original request.

790
00:41:47,661 --> 00:41:48,650
I want to propose assembly 70.

791
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:52,040
It was just for the,

792
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:52,450
you know,

793
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:53,180
the barrier,

794
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:56,250
their shell because we
already made the deal,

795
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,830
honor and I thought,

796
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:58,720
damn,

797
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,070
civilization works.

798
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,070
Excellent resources.

799
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:15,570
There's a great book I read called the
poverty of nations normally version

800
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:22,960
anyways,

801
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,511
it doesn't matter.

802
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:25,340
It was written by a Harvard professor.

803
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:29,630
He was trying to figure out why some
cultures and other cultures are for and he

804
00:42:29,631 --> 00:42:30,810
did an interesting analysis.

805
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:35,150
He compared the western hemisphere
countries that were settled by Portugal,

806
00:42:35,151 --> 00:42:35,550
Spain,

807
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:40,340
France to Western countries and what he
basically thought was that because of

808
00:42:40,410 --> 00:42:42,310
English common law
structure and the tradition.

809
00:42:42,530 --> 00:42:44,620
So if you were settled by England,

810
00:42:44,810 --> 00:42:45,643
brew rich,

811
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,180
the other countries,

812
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:48,140
then you can do.

813
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:53,800
And again trying to down and understand
why is basically which was countries

814
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,580
with common law tradition produce this
produce individual interactions that are

815
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,390
fundamentally predicated on trust.

816
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,460
And that's what made rich.

817
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,820
And you also have in Japan and
Japan is very interesting society.

818
00:43:07,821 --> 00:43:09,640
But maybe I've known right.

819
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,090
All they have is like rocks and rights.

820
00:43:13,350 --> 00:43:18,140
The rights that I think if we don't agree
on price because it's too expensive to

821
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:18,710
grow there.

822
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:19,543
So.

823
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,030
But they do have interpersonal trust.

824
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:27,410
You're stable enough and
so rich because of that,

825
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,820
and so his people is.

826
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,100
You're fortunate you're camping.

827
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,030
Maybe it might come to me.

828
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:37,150
Was that the only genuine naturally
resource was honesty of trucks and

829
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,640
I think there's something broke up.

830
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:44,120
It's deeply true,

831
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,760
so okay,

832
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,810
so back to the idea of meeting.

833
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:51,291
It's like,

834
00:43:51,291 --> 00:43:52,120
well,

835
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,840
if you experience meaning in your life,

836
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:58,930
when you move your comfort into the
unknown and you do that because you're

837
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:04,070
courageous enough to take on the burden
of your own vulnerability and to expand

838
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:09,071
your competence and when you do that
properly engaged with the world and you

839
00:44:09,351 --> 00:44:14,120
feel that your existence is worthwhile
and you feel bad because you are in fact

840
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,950
making yourself better in a way.

841
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,190
It's also making things better at
the same time and then rely on.

842
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:21,170
That's reliable.

843
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:21,800
Mark.

844
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,161
I said,

845
00:44:22,161 --> 00:44:22,311
well,

846
00:44:22,311 --> 00:44:23,660
what should you have faith in?

847
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:26,150
Let's say in terms of
your fundamental axiom?

848
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:28,700
You could start by causeways

849
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,860
existence is to do it.

850
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,280
You could start by,

851
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,313
you could say,

852
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,030
I'm going to access this acetates.

853
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,500
Obviously you can just
do that in a serious way.

854
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,260
If you will one way in one seven,

855
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:49,130
which is I think if the world gets
better when you make the other decision,

856
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,800
consequences of purchase,

857
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,830
which is the world gets worse,

858
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:53,911
so you would say,

859
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:54,744
well,

860
00:44:54,850 --> 00:44:57,750
as this being itself is justifiable,

861
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:00,760
and then let's take the further step in.

862
00:45:01,110 --> 00:45:04,220
Our proper role is to accept

863
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:07,143
the world

864
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:12,170
and then so people see that

865
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,410
that's the right way.

866
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:18,430
It's like blocking.

867
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:20,990
I think that it's

868
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:24,690
justifiable proper role.

869
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:28,890
It did not be of use to do everything
we possibly can to make things as good

870
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,320
and then that sound that's a.

871
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,420
that's active.

872
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:36,720
Our statement about a set of propositions.

873
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,643
Do you.

874
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:39,570
What do you mean by that?

875
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:44,630
What do you mean by believe it or are
you talking to the set of articulating

876
00:45:44,631 --> 00:45:45,470
double socks,

877
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:49,490
so like that's not the deepest form of
policing to be in the form of bleeding.

878
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,523
What's

879
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,180
the alternative is to make
everything worse and maybe

880
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:06,150
it's a bad idea.

881
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,470
It also can I get also
in some sense to me,

882
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:15,600
because I do believe that the human spirit
is in some senses and going on almost

883
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:16,400
like we could.

884
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:20,360
Maybe of what we all
trying to make the ask,

885
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:21,630
at the very least,

886
00:46:21,631 --> 00:46:26,631
I know that it stops things from
degenerating into the kind of absolutely

887
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:32,160
catastrophic health and we experienced
in the 20th century and that will to

888
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,203
avoid

889
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,130
paradise on earth.

890
00:46:35,390 --> 00:46:39,420
If we can all work towards
the kingdom on the hill,

891
00:46:39,450 --> 00:46:42,670
we could make sure that we get these
backwards into the sorts of counsel

892
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:43,573
characterized

893
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,630
in the Soviet Union,

894
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,053
be well.

895
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:05,690
We're going to accept the
team is justifiable parking
by noticing that despite

896
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,940
some we've already made that judgment
way and we're going to act as if our

897
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:17,280
proper role in life is to
take the overwhelming weight
of our on our shoulders

898
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:19,330
and work to make things better regardless,

899
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:20,680
which is a really noble pursuit,

900
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,220
right?

901
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:21,770
You know,

902
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:22,511
because you might think,

903
00:47:22,511 --> 00:47:23,344
well,

904
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:28,500
how is it possible given your current
circumstances and wretchedness that you

905
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,970
could possibly have regard for yourself,

906
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:32,723
for yourself?

907
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:33,680
Self esteem,

908
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:34,810
because I hate that phrase,

909
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,840
but for yourself and say,

910
00:47:37,841 --> 00:47:38,240
well look,

911
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,110
if you know that your.

912
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:44,570
Your fundamental conditions of
existence are tragic with the touch of

913
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:49,750
malevolence just to make it worse
and if your eyes are open to that,

914
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:54,380
do you understand the catastrophic
nature of that and then just wipe that.

915
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,060
You just started.

916
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:59,380
Your job is to wake up in the morning
and put things right and maybe you could

917
00:47:59,381 --> 00:47:59,891
also say,

918
00:47:59,891 --> 00:48:00,101
well,

919
00:48:00,101 --> 00:48:00,934
you know,

920
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,110
such a bad preacher,

921
00:48:02,111 --> 00:48:07,111
all things considered that I could take
down and still work would be to help

922
00:48:09,790 --> 00:48:13,210
myself with everyone else on board
to help with otherwise the birch.

923
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:14,403
So here's

924
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,830
check in with no ability

925
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,600
to justify your business's
existence in the world.

926
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,190
That's what we need

927
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:40,420
is disappears because
baseball is good for you.

928
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,190
Enjoy it and I'm running

929
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:49,780
through the storm because of students
and if happiness is what's keeping you up

930
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:54,690
and you sing and that's good because the
storms are always coming and so what?

931
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:58,180
You need something that will
get you through the store
and the idea that there's

932
00:48:58,181 --> 00:49:01,100
something to struggle this.

933
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:02,483
It's like,

934
00:49:03,410 --> 00:49:03,790
yes,

935
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:07,540
that's something you can take to the
bank and if you have that road in the

936
00:49:07,541 --> 00:49:08,374
world,

937
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:12,110
not only will you make your own life
better and you make yourself stronger and

938
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:16,780
improve your character and make
things better for your family,

939
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:18,640
for your society,

940
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:20,380
and so that sense of meaning.

941
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:23,620
This is something that also is true,

942
00:49:23,621 --> 00:49:28,621
is that sense of meaning that orients
in relationship to the node and also

943
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:33,050
orients you towards the
the what would you call it,

944
00:49:33,051 --> 00:49:35,860
the stacking of different levels of being.

945
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:40,840
So in order to properly in the world,

946
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:46,110
you can't just exist for yourself because
you don't just exist right now that

947
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,820
you exist right now and you exist.

948
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:49,960
You exist.

949
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,150
It's month next year,

950
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:56,200
so you have to act in the moment such
that the probability that you will

951
00:49:56,231 --> 00:50:01,231
continue to exist and happen at those
other traits and also civil exists.

952
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:05,460
So that means that you have to bite your.

953
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:10,560
You're actually the present
or the necessity for your
continued to propagate you

954
00:50:10,561 --> 00:50:12,710
to cross the discovery in future.

955
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:14,820
Something that's very unique to humans.

956
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:20,030
So you have to take into account your
future self and that's very much different

957
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:24,580
and taking it to other people
and you also have to do that.

958
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,980
If you're going to exist in the future,

959
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:31,750
you're going to exist in a way that
makes other people want to exist because

960
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,000
otherwise things might
fall apart pretty down you.

961
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:34,970
You're done,

962
00:50:34,970 --> 00:50:39,930
you're gone and so misbehaving in any
fundamental way isn't that long term

963
00:50:39,931 --> 00:50:40,764
survival,

964
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:41,820
so you might think,

965
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:46,820
well to act properly in regards to
your future selves at something like

966
00:50:49,051 --> 00:50:53,540
integrated with the gratification and
sacrifice and you haven't been out in a

967
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:57,530
way that also benefits your family
and that also benefits your community.

968
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:00,910
And I'm also saying
that's the last to close

969
00:51:02,970 --> 00:51:07,060
and the client that there's no
such thing as a fundamental.

970
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,790
It's something like this.

971
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:15,900
The world is so complicated that you can
interpret and that actually happens to

972
00:51:15,951 --> 00:51:16,784
be true.

973
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:21,460
The world is so complicated in this
and you can see it definitely like our

974
00:51:21,461 --> 00:51:22,730
vision is a real mystery,

975
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,160
but the fact that there's an infinite
number of ways of potentially interpreting

976
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:29,870
the world is not for a moment.

977
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:34,910
If there's an indefinite number of valid
ways of existing in the world and when

978
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:38,630
you think about the constraints
that are put on your existence,

979
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:43,720
then you can see the proper ways of
existing in the world start to shrink to a

980
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:44,711
very,

981
00:51:44,711 --> 00:51:46,510
very school range.

982
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,800
I said I really like to bit about this
idea since some of you might have heard

983
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,800
some of the things that's upsetting or pha

984
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,510
purposes,

985
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:01,100
analysis of children's gates,

986
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,370
children's Microcosm Society,

987
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:09,820
which is what children white about
African societies would be generate toys,

988
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:10,960
societies,

989
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:14,050
which is video games or go
see the movie by the way,

990
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:15,700
you generate twice society.

991
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:19,390
Then you practice
affidavit signed the past.

992
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:19,990
It's,

993
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:20,360
it's.

994
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,360
It has the same structure as real society
except that lower resolution children

995
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:30,560
or giving them a loan with playing because
they're actually practicing learning

996
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,890
council exists.

997
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:34,290
It isn't trivial.

998
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:42,500
That's a good indication that they're
following the path of meeting in the world

999
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:46,490
and so it would be a good thing.

1000
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:47,061
For example,

1001
00:52:47,061 --> 00:52:51,160
if our children are school
children more than they planning,

1002
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,343
so,

1003
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:10,600
so children,

1004
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:15,780
so piaget was very interested in
what made me gain and some rules,

1005
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,483
good game.

1006
00:53:18,890 --> 00:53:23,200
You can play iteratively and that's a
good thing to know that you're going to

1007
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,620
play the same everyday.

1008
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:30,180
Well that's

1009
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:35,700
something to think about too is you know,

1010
00:53:35,701 --> 00:53:39,450
because a lot of people make the mistake
of thinking the exceptional things they

1011
00:53:39,451 --> 00:53:40,110
do in their life,

1012
00:53:40,110 --> 00:53:44,760
like the vacations they take and so forth
are the important things in there and

1013
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:46,440
that's just absolutely not true.

1014
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,340
The thing is every day are they important

1015
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,071
the gay thing.

1016
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:02,750
But I had a client who was spending
about 45 minutes to sort of

1017
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,103
don't

1018
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:11,500
make your children do anything to make
him decide he was spending about 45

1019
00:54:11,570 --> 00:54:14,770
minutes and I'm fighting with
the sun to try to get into back.

1020
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,950
And so I knew the parents actually only
spend on average about 20 minutes a day

1021
00:54:18,951 --> 00:54:19,850
with your kids.

1022
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:22,050
Like a direct one on one contact,

1023
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,330
direct contact law
enforcement at the time.

1024
00:54:26,331 --> 00:54:30,260
And so you're spending 45 minutes and
right before was your kid was like,

1025
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:33,400
that's twice as much time as you normally
spend with them and if you think that

1026
00:54:33,401 --> 00:54:36,290
that's good and well and
you're not thinking about.

1027
00:54:36,350 --> 00:54:40,520
So people don't like it when I do this
because people don't like to risk to

1028
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:40,770
take,

1029
00:54:40,770 --> 00:54:44,380
but we get 45 minutes a day,

1030
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:45,820
about five hours a week,

1031
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,930
eight hours a month.

1032
00:54:47,930 --> 00:54:49,030
So that's half a work.

1033
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:54,040
Maybe people quite that by 12 and that
six weeks a year or a month and a half.

1034
00:54:55,100 --> 00:55:00,100
So basically he was spending
at least a year with his son.

1035
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,740
It's like that's a good game.

1036
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:06,990
That's not against anyone's going to win.

1037
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:09,830
It's interesting to do that risk

1038
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,820
with regards to the things
that you repeat every day.

1039
00:55:14,870 --> 00:55:17,200
Exactly what your is made up of.

1040
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:18,680
Those things that you repeat.

1041
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,000
And so what we want to do is get
those mundane things that you repeat,

1042
00:55:22,010 --> 00:55:26,720
pristine white trope that
enroll of cleaning up your room.

1043
00:55:26,721 --> 00:55:28,190
It's like when you live in the damn thing,

1044
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,880
it's quoted in order
to go to the next step.

1045
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:34,010
And they can manage that.

1046
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:35,630
And it's just my room.

1047
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,021
It's like,

1048
00:55:36,021 --> 00:55:37,820
well that's one way of looking at it.

1049
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:39,500
Another way of looking at it,

1050
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:40,883
it's,

1051
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:42,890
it's a microcosm of being.

1052
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,020
If you have that hand and if it's.

1053
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:46,550
And it's like,

1054
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:46,791
Whoa,

1055
00:55:46,791 --> 00:55:47,930
what the hell are you up to?

1056
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:54,333
Speed.

1057
00:55:55,290 --> 00:55:55,630
Really?

1058
00:55:55,630 --> 00:55:56,810
Is it fine?

1059
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:00,310
So if someone gets you
a country to roll on,

1060
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:00,610
you,

1061
00:56:00,610 --> 00:56:01,530
pull up your socks,

1062
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,510
get your act together,

1063
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:13,700
what is shaped?

1064
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:20,500
And everybody has to be able
to play it over and over.

1065
00:56:20,501 --> 00:56:22,320
But everybody has to play against the.

1066
00:56:24,790 --> 00:56:25,570
It's so cool.

1067
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:26,320
Because he was,

1068
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,153
he was asking,

1069
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:31,150
he was actually trying to reconcile this
ancient between science and religion

1070
00:56:31,151 --> 00:56:31,984
that was Australian,

1071
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,060
our intellectual life.

1072
00:56:34,150 --> 00:56:39,150
And he was trying to understand the
evolution of morality and one of his

1073
00:56:39,281 --> 00:56:40,020
observations,

1074
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:40,440
what's not.

1075
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:45,440
Children spontaneously play and their
games tend to awards playable games.

1076
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,670
And I play a little game is one where
everyone is treated with a certain operas

1077
00:56:49,700 --> 00:56:53,530
founded as a player and everyone
actually wants to play the game.

1078
00:56:53,531 --> 00:56:57,310
So it's voluntary and that's a pretty
good definition of a free society.

1079
00:56:57,470 --> 00:57:02,470
It's like you get to play and you get to
planning both if it's set up and so and

1080
00:57:05,060 --> 00:57:05,260
so.

1081
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:09,460
That's another indication of the fact
that there's something about a fundamental

1082
00:57:09,461 --> 00:57:10,040
ethic.

1083
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:14,840
These are just arbitrary and this is
very important thing to get 21st century

1084
00:57:14,870 --> 00:57:19,430
because one of the things that we kept
blaming in the 20th century was the any

1085
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,380
old arbitrary arbitrary.

1086
00:57:22,680 --> 00:57:26,500
It doesn't matter if they're Marxist
or capitalist on the arbitrary.

1087
00:57:26,501 --> 00:57:26,770
It's like,

1088
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:27,280
no,

1089
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,120
that's wrong.

1090
00:57:28,180 --> 00:57:33,180
That's a seriously long scientific
data or the philosophical data or in

1091
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:40,550
very constrained we can orient ourselves
in the world and when they boil down to

1092
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,400
I would say a seven fundamental blocks.

1093
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:50,760
Have you been to a sovereign and I
mean everybody has intrinsic value of

1094
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,370
societies.

1095
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:56,050
It's not asking for axiom

1096
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:08,300
in the old world,

1097
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,860
not convinced.

1098
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,820
Maybe perhaps you shouldn't be.

1099
00:58:17,090 --> 00:58:21,840
You might also avail yourself of the
relevant literature because some of the

1100
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:23,970
most brilliant people who support.

1101
00:58:23,971 --> 00:58:25,410
I can counter trends to wall.

1102
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:26,041
For example,

1103
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:31,041
who's the primatologist who was probably
the world's foremost neuroscientist of

1104
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,430
emotions,

1105
00:58:32,530 --> 00:58:35,450
both studied the emergence
of morality in racks.

1106
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,840
That was Kinda your wall demonstrated
quite clearly with the chimps is

1107
00:58:42,071 --> 00:58:43,790
particularly interesting.

1108
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:50,180
Brutal children don't want to tar is that
are predicated on power to kind of be

1109
00:58:51,391 --> 00:58:52,770
the chip patriarchy.

1110
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:55,280
I'm serious.

1111
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,300
I'm really serious about patents.

1112
00:58:58,060 --> 00:58:59,400
That's the view of the world.

1113
00:58:59,490 --> 00:59:04,490
Every hierarchy is brutal and it started
in my apartment and that's the most

1114
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,950
important for talking back
because they're tragical.

1115
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:12,040
You will demonstrate quite clearly of our
chimps are very unstable on the people

1116
00:59:12,210 --> 00:59:17,210
and the tubes are very likely to meet
an extraordinary model and so he showed

1117
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:23,130
that for the organization was on
state and it's not surprising,

1118
00:59:23,571 --> 00:59:23,811
right,

1119
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:25,790
because you could choose to be nice.

1120
00:59:26,270 --> 00:59:27,710
So when the big wheel thing,

1121
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:30,640
little rebel essentially
as a consequences.

1122
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:35,650
So you can see this emerge of epic
farmer below they don't know and yeah,

1123
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:38,690
and this is something he should
have won the Nobel prize.

1124
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,220
He was an absolute genius.

1125
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:43,090
He was the first point in
place or a certain way.

1126
00:59:43,670 --> 00:59:44,750
That's a big deal.

1127
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,330
They don't know.

1128
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:51,200
Our capacity for play is
actually a consequence of a
separate biological system.

1129
00:59:51,201 --> 00:59:52,510
That's a major discovery

1130
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,173
study.

1131
00:59:55,790 --> 00:59:56,623
Rats,

1132
00:59:57,140 --> 00:59:58,870
rough and tumble play in particular,

1133
00:59:58,871 --> 01:00:03,871
which is a very interesting field with
all others tend to do with your kids and

1134
01:00:04,781 --> 01:00:08,210
it seems to be one of the primary ways
that you would father socialites that

1135
01:00:08,211 --> 01:00:09,680
geography and so it's very

1136
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:11,700
fun,

1137
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:16,700
was the last were to earn the right to
engage in rough and tumble play and so

1138
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:22,020
that's how you tell them and was motivated
to see if it would work for something

1139
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:22,880
that's kind kinda the same way.

1140
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,830
You figure out if you can be a little
bit and ratchet work under reading over

1141
01:00:27,831 --> 01:00:29,560
that you'll be able to
wrestle with another bad,

1142
01:00:29,561 --> 01:00:31,760
especially if they're young juveniles,

1143
01:00:31,761 --> 01:00:33,530
especially if they're juvenile males.

1144
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:38,150
If you pair two together and one of them
was 10 percent bigger than the other,

1145
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,140
the big brother stole the halo,

1146
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,680
the little rap consistently and so
then you get to your experiment.

1147
01:00:44,681 --> 01:00:47,860
You just paired once
and big rats go say hi,

1148
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:48,740
go ahead and start.

1149
01:00:48,740 --> 01:00:50,570
These are predicated on power.

1150
01:00:50,780 --> 01:00:52,010
That'll be your conclusion.

1151
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:52,551
It's like,

1152
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:53,240
yeah,

1153
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:56,900
you missed something and what you missed
because you don't play with someone.

1154
01:00:56,901 --> 01:01:01,901
Once you blend with them over
and over and over and over,

1155
01:01:02,030 --> 01:01:06,200
and the rules that govern
gain continues across a large,

1156
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:09,660
safe like your time are not
the same rules that govern it.

1157
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:12,850
You will be played once
because if you're playing,

1158
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,960
imagine you're not claiming a set of
games and then imagine that the rules for

1159
01:01:18,171 --> 01:01:20,300
winning a set of gates are not the same.

1160
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:24,280
Rules are living one game and then
you don't care about winning one game.

1161
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:27,190
If you have any sense because you're
not just going to play one game,

1162
01:01:27,191 --> 01:01:30,680
you're going to play games and so then
you want to know what the rules are that

1163
01:01:30,710 --> 01:01:32,900
govern victory across the set of gates.

1164
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:36,530
And I would also say that the reason
that aren't religious presuppositions

1165
01:01:36,531 --> 01:01:40,070
evolve and this can
pick them up this year.

1166
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,113
This idea,

1167
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,890
the reason our preset positions evolve
as because we'd be trying to formulate a

1168
01:01:45,891 --> 01:01:50,150
picture of the proper action patterns
that enable you to attain victory across a

1169
01:01:50,151 --> 01:01:51,890
set of all possible games.

1170
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:53,030
And that's a very,

1171
01:01:53,031 --> 01:01:55,250
very difficult thing to figure out.

1172
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:59,110
But you kind of know what you tell your
kid when you say it doesn't matter what

1173
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,140
matters and the kid system.

1174
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:03,020
What do you mean by that?

1175
01:02:03,050 --> 01:02:03,381
You say,

1176
01:02:03,381 --> 01:02:04,590
I don't know

1177
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,620
why kindness dual.

1178
01:02:08,710 --> 01:02:11,660
They don't all have no holds
barred and do whatever I have.

1179
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:13,790
When is that supporting the beginning?

1180
01:02:13,910 --> 01:02:14,970
It's like no one's done.

1181
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:18,010
If someone reporting to
the point of the game,

1182
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:21,270
distribute the of the game is to play
the game in a manner that ensures that

1183
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,170
your complaint,

1184
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:24,990
that most masculine number of
gates that everyone at this age,

1185
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:26,700
that's the point,

1186
01:02:27,030 --> 01:02:27,480
right?

1187
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,420
And so part of that is
trying to lead each game,

1188
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,610
but there's so that's one level,

1189
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:34,860
but really trying to it,

1190
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:38,110
but there's a level of reality
was that it's trying to again,

1191
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:41,520
in a manner that ensures that everyone
wants to keep playing with you because

1192
01:02:41,521 --> 01:02:45,870
then you'll never get out of people to
play with your entire life and that's a

1193
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:46,280
bit.

1194
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:48,930
That's just what you're telling
your son or your daughter.

1195
01:02:48,931 --> 01:02:49,980
When you say it doesn't matter,

1196
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:55,080
it matters how you play and you wouldn't
know that except for the fact that

1197
01:02:55,081 --> 01:03:00,081
people have struggled to
conception unconscious for
tens of thousands of years,

1198
01:03:01,020 --> 01:03:05,700
will attempt the problem with the fact
that we iterate our processes across time

1199
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:06,950
and so we,

1200
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:07,440
we,

1201
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:07,870
we,

1202
01:03:07,870 --> 01:03:12,420
we built pictures of what you attitude
in life has to be like if you're going to

1203
01:03:12,421 --> 01:03:15,360
be the person who has a good chance,

1204
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:17,190
maybe the process,

1205
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:22,100
who has a good chance of winning across
the broadest possible of circumstances?

1206
01:03:22,330 --> 01:03:25,780
I don't mind when you accept it,

1207
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,220
you kind of from that,

1208
01:03:28,290 --> 01:03:33,290
if you pair it their backs together once
the big round of established dominance,

1209
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,500
then it was up with the little rep to
invite like so the next time you put the

1210
01:03:37,501 --> 01:03:39,330
rat skimming the liberal come out,

1211
01:03:39,430 --> 01:03:39,860
you know,

1212
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,670
go out.

1213
01:03:40,670 --> 01:03:41,730
So they want to play.

1214
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:43,020
It kind of clipped the rear end,

1215
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:48,240
the down the clumps around like
everyone knows this language,

1216
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:51,383
you know,

1217
01:03:53,010 --> 01:03:54,940
and you can pretend you're a pretty.

1218
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,513
Tends to fight.

1219
01:03:56,820 --> 01:03:57,570
He's a good guy.

1220
01:03:57,570 --> 01:03:58,870
He actually doesn't like this.

1221
01:03:58,890 --> 01:03:59,960
Your first accident.

1222
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,230
Don't smack him,

1223
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,060
even dogs down,

1224
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:07,410
so in the middle of that mess.

1225
01:04:08,220 --> 01:04:10,360
So I'm going to get out,

1226
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:10,810
you know,

1227
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,050
does this play invitation
to debate your APP?

1228
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,440
And then the big little smoking

1229
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:24,080
kind of nondescript and
I stopped once ready,

1230
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:24,411
but yeah,

1231
01:04:24,411 --> 01:04:29,340
I would feel complaints and so then
he was place and he doesn't let men 30

1232
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:30,420
percent of the time,

1233
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:32,570
little rumbles asking for anymore.

1234
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,460
And I read that.

1235
01:04:34,470 --> 01:04:35,770
It just blew me away.

1236
01:04:35,780 --> 01:04:37,350
It's so I'm.

1237
01:04:40,170 --> 01:04:44,290
And they're thinking repeated
like voluntary playbox.

1238
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,070
So that's where ethics comes from.

1239
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:48,210
I see.

1240
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:49,200
Well that's something,

1241
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,160
that's something to discover it because
he came to think of ethics is something

1242
01:04:53,161 --> 01:04:57,330
like an arbitrary articulated
and then couldn't be,

1243
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:58,280
couldn't be one thing.

1244
01:04:58,290 --> 01:04:59,370
It couldn't be Marxist,

1245
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,510
couldn't be capitalists.

1246
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,720
It couldn't be any number of arbitrary
set of rules like no one could quite

1247
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,230
isn't arbitrary there even racks on.

1248
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:12,900
So they what do you need or
even the humanity itself.

1249
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:15,720
And so that's something that's
very much worth knowing.

1250
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:17,400
So.

1251
01:05:23,140 --> 01:05:24,240
So let me

1252
01:05:27,650 --> 01:05:28,620
just one rule

1253
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:34,363
books,

1254
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:35,773
meaning

1255
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:39,640
nationally was the case.

1256
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:50,860
That's the landscape that you can have
and then your job is to expand it into

1257
01:05:52,300 --> 01:05:53,133
order

1258
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:00,480
and the way you do that is by having one

1259
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:07,300
of your challenges and then
you can tell what you're doing.

1260
01:06:07,301 --> 01:06:09,610
You're engaged in what you're doing.

1261
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:13,810
That's the mark from the deepest levels
of your reading that you have the

1262
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:18,790
constituent elements of reality property
and then imagine that that's balanced

1263
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:23,770
in a way that doesn't just work for you
or you on your future cells and works

1264
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:28,460
for you and your family and your
community perhaps thing beyond that,

1265
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:33,220
and that's why his excuses you
with that sense of engagement.

1266
01:06:34,060 --> 01:06:34,893
That's

1267
01:06:36,190 --> 01:06:41,190
I think it coordinates with
the best evidence we have
functional and so wouldn't

1268
01:06:42,571 --> 01:06:43,430
that be someone?

1269
01:06:44,260 --> 01:06:49,260
Whatever being is like is intrinsically
be and you've been with guide.

1270
01:06:51,460 --> 01:06:56,460
Is that sense of being will also help
you transcend a tragic existence or how

1271
01:06:56,620 --> 01:07:00,610
are you encountering it
will help you set the world.

1272
01:07:00,611 --> 01:07:02,250
Right and furthermore,

1273
01:07:02,251 --> 01:07:04,060
we're giving you that sense of

1274
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:11,100
being that comes with knowing that
your weight of your existence on your

1275
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:12,163
shoulders

1276
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:17,350
and stumbling towards
the change so to speak.

1277
01:07:17,410 --> 01:07:22,150
Just make sure that that's
the fundamental story.

1278
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:23,673
Yes,

1279
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:29,670
it's correct and I think it would be a
lovely thing if we all woke up the 21st

1280
01:07:31,571 --> 01:07:35,920
century and understood that consciously
and did everything we possibly

1281
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,530
implementing pounds.

1282
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,510
Yes.

1283
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,073
That's

1284
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,380
so true.

1285
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,573
He

1286
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:31,683
didn't.

1287
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:40,450
This is actually.

1288
01:08:40,460 --> 01:08:42,700
Jordan's going to be the best word

1289
01:08:45,820 --> 01:08:46,653
tonight.

1290
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:50,340
It could all come.

1291
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,520
Right.

1292
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,073
Awesome.

1293
01:08:56,570 --> 01:09:00,590
What you just heard in
the last hour and a half,

1294
01:09:52,230 --> 01:09:54,900
30 years ago when you started doing this,

1295
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,620
people would be dressing up like upstairs.

1296
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,930
It's a funny thing because,

1297
01:10:12,830 --> 01:10:13,663
well,

1298
01:10:13,940 --> 01:10:14,870
for example,

1299
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:23,803
Courtney

1300
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:32,853
surprised

1301
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:36,290
stamp.

1302
01:10:36,290 --> 01:10:36,960
What level?

1303
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:37,793
Not surprised.

1304
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,860
I'm not surprised just because

1305
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:46,130
when I learned that they just.

1306
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:47,073
They just.

1307
01:10:47,250 --> 01:10:48,083
Why?

1308
01:10:48,630 --> 01:10:50,350
You know there's some things in that

1309
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:54,600
nature is amy.

1310
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,030
I think I practice the old stories,

1311
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,840
one of the people to that story.

1312
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:05,990
When I finally understood that those
stories that I never written off,

1313
01:11:06,680 --> 01:11:11,090
it was so absolutely overwhelming
because it's a story.

1314
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,620
It's the Mesopotamian story,

1315
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:15,100
Fish Egyptian story.

1316
01:11:15,110 --> 01:11:15,940
They just,

1317
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:17,590
at the beginning of those

1318
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,200
stories have that modal forced,

1319
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,810
pushed the whole culture
for thousands of years.

1320
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:29,400
If you kind of stumble across what the
story means and you'd see the power,

1321
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:30,450
let's not surprised,

1322
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:32,700
and I asked her

1323
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:40,740
what's the base that I got to teach
when I was teaching this was just benign

1324
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:42,364
neglect

1325
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,853
rail.

1326
01:11:51,730 --> 01:11:54,540
So it's not surprising stories

1327
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:59,190
because they are exactly
the kinds of stories

1328
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,783
and so

1329
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:09,730
carl is a genius and a
perfectly proportioned,

1330
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,300
staggering my fingers back into and so

1331
01:12:16,770 --> 01:12:17,160
yes,

1332
01:12:17,160 --> 01:12:19,770
it's terrible to say

1333
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:25,490
you're within a great story and we need.

1334
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:28,710
We need to have a pre tools
generation after generation.

1335
01:12:28,890 --> 01:12:33,090
It's absolutely necessary and so
this is a manifestation of that.

1336
01:12:33,091 --> 01:12:34,530
I think we'll see.

1337
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:36,473
We shall see.

1338
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:49,550
Wouldn't be the order that is
probably most important one.

1339
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:52,590
When will you be doing
a duet with Kanye West?

1340
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,470
You've been talking
about music a little bit

1341
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:18,303
harder.

1342
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,060
You're good to go.

1343
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:37,740
Alright,

1344
01:13:37,740 --> 01:13:38,573
here we go.

1345
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,270
Shannon still

1346
01:13:50,210 --> 01:13:51,043
interestingly,

1347
01:13:52,850 --> 01:13:53,800
so the first thing,

1348
01:13:54,110 --> 01:13:56,010
the gym still reflects the light,

1349
01:13:57,160 --> 01:13:57,410
right?

1350
01:13:57,410 --> 01:14:01,410
And why does the system look at the
beach and then like it's associated with

1351
01:14:01,411 --> 01:14:04,010
consciousness and it's
associated with the idea.

1352
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:07,580
That whole idea that the some hero

1353
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:15,350
hero is the database that confronts the
private therapist at night and balanced

1354
01:14:18,450 --> 01:14:23,200
way through that and Victoria says
a morning and so that's part of the

1355
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:28,180
condemnation with the idea of life and
to have something that reflects like

1356
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:28,380
this,

1357
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:33,380
to have something that partakes of that
heavenly process of civil thing and so,

1358
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:37,030
but then there's another
level of analysis.

1359
01:14:37,031 --> 01:14:37,990
It's really interesting.

1360
01:14:38,050 --> 01:14:40,000
This is quite iron man for example,

1361
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:43,450
in the avengers movies basically
as a crystal that keeps them a lot.

1362
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:47,680
It's easy enough for Casa del chemical
transformation towards goal as part of

1363
01:14:47,681 --> 01:14:47,761
them.

1364
01:14:47,761 --> 01:14:49,030
That's logical substructure.

1365
01:14:49,031 --> 01:14:53,740
That story like a crystal
and crystal is very,

1366
01:14:53,741 --> 01:14:58,741
very interesting material object because
pure crystal diamond is exactly the

1367
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:02,150
same at every level of analysis.

1368
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:04,350
Like all of the molecules in Math Olympiad

1369
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:07,270
are lined up perfectly.

1370
01:15:07,630 --> 01:15:08,260
Everything.

1371
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:13,000
So it's one thing and that's like so part
and it's the fact that it's one thing

1372
01:15:13,090 --> 01:15:18,090
that makes it respect and so there's a
synchronistic relationship between the

1373
01:15:19,601 --> 01:15:23,930
purity and the hardness of the stone
and its ability to reflect and to the

1374
01:15:23,931 --> 01:15:28,931
nation and the implication of that for
a human made you want to do is confront

1375
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:35,160
even pressure to transform yourself into
something that's one thing and every

1376
01:15:35,960 --> 01:15:40,960
possible level and then you also reflect
and that's also metaphorically speaking

1377
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:43,360
and that's something that's symbolized by,

1378
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:44,190
by,

1379
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:49,190
by the job still and that that
gives you an example of how we are,

1380
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:50,081
you know,

1381
01:15:50,081 --> 01:15:52,510
because like sparkly things

1382
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:03,050
that those things are regardless and what.

1383
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:04,080
It's just some arbitrary,

1384
01:16:04,780 --> 01:16:05,700
not arbitrary,

1385
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:11,600
the jokes to all shake them and giving
them to people because it's a symbol of

1386
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:16,050
permanence and don't
want to make like that.

1387
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:17,013
So to speak.

1388
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:23,243
Yeah.

1389
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:30,693
The

1390
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:33,493
Christmas tree

1391
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,880
to bring the idea to
celebrate in darkness,

1392
01:16:42,481 --> 01:16:45,500
to celebrate the of the
light in the darkness,

1393
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:51,430
to associate the idea of the night and
the darkness of winter would be birth of

1394
01:16:52,710 --> 01:16:54,630
the redeeming hero,

1395
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:55,553
which is dark.

1396
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,840
It improves it.

1397
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,290
And so all of that stack up and ritual,

1398
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:05,030
this body that you undertake,

1399
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:10,900
it's so fascinating to see the test
case because we have wisdom that

1400
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:13,563
understands,

1401
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:16,510
which is to say that more and
more complicated as we know,

1402
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:19,010
obviously the case,

1403
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,270
even representative things that you don't.

1404
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:26,090
We go see movies like Harry Potter,

1405
01:17:26,091 --> 01:17:26,924
for example,

1406
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:28,883
can be

1407
01:17:31,900 --> 01:17:33,950
kids to read seven slash $600

1408
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,150
stadiums and they would all
come with Mrs Virgil Stories,

1409
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:42,633
a

1410
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:48,150
whatever movie empire generate

1411
01:17:50,180 --> 01:17:51,050
telling these stories.

1412
01:17:51,530 --> 01:17:53,060
What was the story she told?

1413
01:17:53,450 --> 01:17:58,450
She joined us an orphan hero who
was willing to die for artists.

1414
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:02,280
Heard that story before.

1415
01:18:03,830 --> 01:18:04,830
Great

1416
01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:11,380
recedes into the background state.

1417
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:14,530
What's happening with
Christianity and new mythological

1418
01:18:17,570 --> 01:18:18,403
imagination.

1419
01:18:19,210 --> 01:18:22,750
That's exactly what Scott wants

1420
01:18:25,830 --> 01:18:26,663
to

1421
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:29,393
screen,

1422
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:35,320
and so luckily it has enough
power to rejuvenate itself and

1423
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:43,020
engineering price per superheroes

1424
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:46,810
marbles,

1425
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:58,573
worst

1426
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:06,510
actually collapsed,

1427
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:08,753
collapsed.

1428
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,730
I can reduce use of

1429
01:19:14,970 --> 01:19:15,803
nature.

1430
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:21,010
Nature predicted

1431
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:26,960
because of the fundamental
narrative you described,

1432
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,450
that as you celebrate,

1433
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:34,410
you will never find enough water to wash.

1434
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,510
In Twentieth Century Relief

1435
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:48,483
Pitcher,

1436
01:19:53,390 --> 01:19:54,223
he

1437
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:58,900
described the sort of character which
you get from the Russian revolution.

1438
01:20:00,150 --> 01:20:05,150
So could you lose you lose your ear
angel differentiated into their tribal

1439
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,513
communities,

1440
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:08,710
completely out,

1441
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:13,820
or we will lose faith in life and I'm not
listing for that gender and science at

1442
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:18,840
the same sleep as well as
being depressed and anxious,

1443
01:20:18,910 --> 01:20:23,610
desert bitter and resentful and
cruel and murderous and genocidal.

1444
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:26,933
Even

1445
01:20:27,900 --> 01:20:28,733
Mr.

1446
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:40,580
conditional assistance or explicit
systems are metaphorical narrative that's

1447
01:20:42,820 --> 01:20:46,750
facing our industry
function and lose that.

1448
01:20:46,970 --> 01:20:51,970
It's whatever your last ideas
that I've been describing,

1449
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:59,910
what your responsibilities is to
rescue him from the belly of a whale.

1450
01:21:00,740 --> 01:21:02,480
Watch you think about

1451
01:21:04,410 --> 01:21:07,770
90 percent of this audience it and don't

1452
01:21:10,180 --> 01:21:11,013
launch

1453
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,280
into a whale.

1454
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:18,920
That makes sense.

1455
01:21:23,370 --> 01:21:24,580
Why don't we use,

1456
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:27,530
which is just absolutely beyond

1457
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:29,590
that.

1458
01:21:29,590 --> 01:21:30,423
Make sense?

1459
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:32,583
No

1460
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:38,980
father's house

1461
01:21:40,600 --> 01:21:45,360
all the way it members all
the way to ancient Egypt.

1462
01:21:45,750 --> 01:21:46,860
The I'm not.

1463
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:48,390
It's an idea.

1464
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:52,850
You can see as as the,

1465
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:53,690
as the,

1466
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:54,270
as the,

1467
01:21:54,270 --> 01:21:55,990
as the corpus of your

1468
01:21:57,980 --> 01:21:58,813
produce.

1469
01:21:58,940 --> 01:21:59,890
People with more.

1470
01:21:59,910 --> 01:22:00,520
No,

1471
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:01,160
it was good.

1472
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:05,910
Despite the data and there's a spirit
that animates and it's necessary for you

1473
01:22:05,940 --> 01:22:06,920
because your historical

1474
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:09,353
structure,

1475
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,440
it's necessary to revitalize the spirit
of that three in order to live you

1476
01:22:14,621 --> 01:22:18,600
chaplin property without a preacher,

1477
01:22:19,050 --> 01:22:20,430
and so am regeneration,

1478
01:22:21,010 --> 01:22:23,310
ethical responsibility
of every generation.

1479
01:22:23,430 --> 01:22:24,870
To go into the underworld,

1480
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:27,300
which is to face the things
that you're most afraid of,

1481
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,770
which is the fire breathing dragon.

1482
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:30,490
I'll tell them to somebody else.

1483
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,350
Springs a fire breathing dragon.

1484
01:22:34,770 --> 01:22:37,970
Remember what happens
when we don't breathing,

1485
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:43,410
drag it out of the with the and

1486
01:22:47,020 --> 01:22:48,770
drag and about

1487
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:53,740
competitors in danger of permanent.

1488
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,070
You're kind of assessing him.

1489
01:22:57,270 --> 01:23:01,280
Just let him speak yourself
and as a consequence,

1490
01:23:01,281 --> 01:23:03,000
he washed the beach.

1491
01:23:06,460 --> 01:23:11,320
What the temperature is a terrible,

1492
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:18,750
horrific rep council will be
necessary part of the ethical

1493
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:21,650
and so

1494
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:28,170
that's another example of how these are
so you have tried yourself back into the

1495
01:23:29,791 --> 01:23:34,000
past to resurrect the spirit of your
traditions because of the lost and the

1496
01:23:34,001 --> 01:23:39,001
problem with the last first and the second
is to make you susceptible to second

1497
01:23:41,891 --> 01:23:43,090
grade religious structures,

1498
01:23:43,091 --> 01:23:45,760
even forms and the ideologies
because you're not going to like.

1499
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:47,250
You're either going to be cost

1500
01:23:49,050 --> 01:23:53,760
or if you open up like fundamental
really fundamental soul,

1501
01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:54,640
deep market,

1502
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:55,473
differently structured,

1503
01:23:55,690 --> 01:23:58,870
we're going to be in soccer for the first
person who comes along and halfway to

1504
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:02,770
need and that's not getting
a university education

1505
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:36,330
sometimes weird sometimes.

1506
01:24:36,331 --> 01:24:37,930
I know I've been a

1507
01:24:39,520 --> 01:24:40,353
little bit.

1508
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:47,420
Thanks

1509
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:49,833
for

1510
01:24:51,740 --> 01:24:52,680
changing my life.

1511
01:24:52,770 --> 01:24:54,250
They're not as much changes.

1512
01:24:54,251 --> 01:24:56,370
There has been a certain

1513
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:02,610
breakfast as

1514
01:25:16,690 --> 01:25:17,523
well.

1515
01:25:18,030 --> 01:25:18,863
What I'm

1516
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,473
getting

1517
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:24,523
from

1518
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:27,063
twitter,

1519
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:32,063
especially

1520
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:41,730
twitter requires at the
end of the day that's bad.

1521
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:50,280
You should watch and wait until the
correct thing is to say that's what you

1522
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,860
should have.

1523
01:25:53,910 --> 01:25:54,440
Great piece.

1524
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:55,840
I think we should just quit.

1525
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:59,240
One of the things I've
learned that it's perhaps

1526
01:26:03,080 --> 01:26:07,360
you know versus what you
should do when people attack,

1527
01:26:07,450 --> 01:26:12,020
you can try to make it
real number of kids.

1528
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:17,800
You always use necessary
force to basically move

1529
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:26,080
necessarily forced to defend yourself
because why would you say people are

1530
01:26:27,010 --> 01:26:28,530
forced to not

1531
01:26:30,930 --> 01:26:33,050
miss any situations?

1532
01:26:33,070 --> 01:26:33,903
You know,

1533
01:26:34,310 --> 01:26:38,810
because the situations where I kept my
head when things are uncomfortable in the

1534
01:26:38,811 --> 01:26:42,950
student demonstrations in some of those
that are comfortable and it was pretty

1535
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:44,390
severely.

1536
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:47,530
There were some people
in those demonstrations,

1537
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:53,430
there was a small minority of the people
and we're definitely aiming at making

1538
01:26:53,931 --> 01:26:55,450
the world a hell of a lot worse.

1539
01:26:55,530 --> 01:27:00,530
It was the blow in and they're are of
people that you want to have an arts

1540
01:27:01,920 --> 01:27:02,753
reaching

1541
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:08,330
the right responses to react with,

1542
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:14,220
react in a minimal way and still putting
your ground and what's happened as a

1543
01:27:14,721 --> 01:27:19,721
consequence of implementing that as far
as I can tell is that every time you tap

1544
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:26,120
in that map in public if consequences,

1545
01:27:26,170 --> 01:27:30,010
that has ended up being good for
me and so that's the interesting

1546
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:35,593
part

1547
01:27:39,740 --> 01:27:41,440
because he was.

1548
01:27:41,940 --> 01:27:43,460
It wasn't that art

1549
01:27:45,310 --> 01:27:46,143
because

1550
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:52,100
I don't know what you think you're
talking to and it's certainly not me.

1551
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:55,610
Someone that was.

1552
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:56,910
It was like watching somebody

1553
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:02,590
jogging to.

1554
01:28:09,500 --> 01:28:14,500
Fortunately I didn't react
except minimally and that
really work and so it's a

1555
01:28:19,371 --> 01:28:20,600
good thing to learn.

1556
01:28:20,910 --> 01:28:22,130
If you can learn to do with.

1557
01:28:22,700 --> 01:28:26,160
It's hard because if you're being attacked

1558
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:29,330
and if they completely.

1559
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,160
You don't have to do that.

1560
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,990
You just asked sufficiently

1561
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:40,070
and so when you see npcs,

1562
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:44,550
you experienced that packet pressure
in your life that you want to stand.

1563
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:49,310
Your brother's been necessary for us as
the most effective possible strategies

1564
01:28:49,311 --> 01:28:50,144
for a second.

1565
01:28:50,330 --> 01:28:53,780
What about the other words that just
describe the people that get that look.

1566
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:56,870
Just showing you the university

1567
01:28:59,790 --> 01:29:00,890
truly scared.

1568
01:29:07,730 --> 01:29:08,563
That's

1569
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:10,513
awesome.

1570
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,650
You try to get yourself

1571
01:29:22,440 --> 01:29:27,090
in a manner that's generated
with a number of people possible,

1572
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:33,000
and so if we seriously gave me a
destruction of eventual destruction,

1573
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,180
the best allison

1574
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:42,380
rush toward the.

1575
01:29:42,900 --> 01:29:43,733
It's

1576
01:29:46,810 --> 01:29:47,643
hard.

1577
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,070
It's hard to defeat
someone who knows nothing.

1578
01:29:52,670 --> 01:29:53,503
So

1579
01:29:56,400 --> 01:29:57,480
what advice do you have?

1580
01:29:58,030 --> 01:30:00,410
His father's passed away while being

1581
01:30:02,610 --> 01:30:04,520
traded to the company.

1582
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:12,720
You could say the spirit is everywhere.

1583
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:17,740
One of the things that I

1584
01:30:20,460 --> 01:30:21,870
was that

1585
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,120
breach cigarettes,

1586
01:30:26,150 --> 01:30:26,770
the father,

1587
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:27,060
us.

1588
01:30:27,060 --> 01:30:29,890
Everywhere in the libraries

1589
01:30:32,220 --> 01:30:37,220
you can choose your heroes
and mentors from the people,

1590
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:38,543
whoever,

1591
01:30:39,040 --> 01:30:43,620
and so the prompts of
institute as mature anyway,

1592
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:44,641
something like that.

1593
01:30:44,641 --> 01:30:47,490
You have a personal father.

1594
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:51,490
That's another reason
why this notion of it

1595
01:30:53,640 --> 01:30:58,640
detached from reality feel that

1596
01:31:01,710 --> 01:31:03,660
transcended immediately.

1597
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:05,011
So you might say,

1598
01:31:05,011 --> 01:31:05,221
well,

1599
01:31:05,221 --> 01:31:07,880
it's incumbent on you
to worship this part of,

1600
01:31:08,520 --> 01:31:09,353
what do you mean?

1601
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,333
Psychological

1602
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:13,650
assessment,

1603
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:15,350
the spirit as a pattern.

1604
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:20,530
The pattern is generating civilization
and you even conceptualize that.

1605
01:31:20,821 --> 01:31:25,030
It's pretty easy to conceptualize
that as a journalist being a spirit,

1606
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:25,873
that's something

1607
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:32,010
experience something like making
more than that and some more

1608
01:31:33,740 --> 01:31:36,940
on the rails and the way people used to.

1609
01:31:37,310 --> 01:31:38,210
I'm looking at

1610
01:31:39,960 --> 01:31:44,010
because that's another really interesting
thing about people and interesting

1611
01:31:44,011 --> 01:31:48,580
thing that you and yourself and you
notice how you react in the world in the

1612
01:31:48,581 --> 01:31:49,414
middle

1613
01:31:50,690 --> 01:31:55,590
or the actions of the people that Meyer
and it isn't like you're doing that

1614
01:31:55,610 --> 01:31:56,720
voluntarily.

1615
01:31:57,090 --> 01:32:01,100
It's like you just noticed
that that's in some sense.

1616
01:32:01,170 --> 01:32:02,920
That's the instinct to worship.

1617
01:32:05,410 --> 01:32:08,740
Worship is the instinct
we imitate which it is,

1618
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:12,000
and if the instinct to empathy is work,

1619
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:13,600
which it is,

1620
01:32:13,690 --> 01:32:18,690
then the fact that you can be gracious
is the way you bet your unconscious line

1621
01:32:20,530 --> 01:32:21,820
oreos with words,

1622
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:26,230
good world crips outside
of an architect works.

1623
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:26,860
It's like,

1624
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:27,530
well,

1625
01:32:27,530 --> 01:32:29,290
not that I'm really fascinated.

1626
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:34,700
Got a trap line out and I'll focus on
them and it is attempting to do something

1627
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:37,084
that happens.

1628
01:32:37,410 --> 01:32:39,220
You can also use that as a guy.

1629
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:45,450
Talks a lot about this when very profound
psychological transformation where you

1630
01:32:47,321 --> 01:32:48,260
spent talking to me

1631
01:32:49,980 --> 01:32:51,890
and he said the artist,

1632
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:56,920
his transformation was his observation
of people who dr themselves.

1633
01:32:58,800 --> 01:32:59,570
Um,

1634
01:32:59,570 --> 01:33:00,790
what was impossible.

1635
01:33:00,830 --> 01:33:01,663
Nobility,

1636
01:33:02,770 --> 01:33:04,930
brutally difficult situations.

1637
01:33:05,460 --> 01:33:06,293
Now

1638
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:11,500
I would say perhaps hundreds
of stories of people like that,

1639
01:33:11,501 --> 01:33:12,250
that encounter.

1640
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:16,900
He was in the council and so he started
to notice that those people exist and

1641
01:33:16,901 --> 01:33:20,850
that there was something in him that
was responding with the gardener

1642
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:21,910
admiration,

1643
01:33:22,570 --> 01:33:26,130
who's incorporation that will
completely transformed world.

1644
01:33:27,010 --> 01:33:27,843
And so that's,

1645
01:33:27,960 --> 01:33:29,630
that's the rediscovery of the fog.

1646
01:33:29,710 --> 01:33:34,710
That's part of the process of registering
the fondant group wave it seems.

1647
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,390
That's exactly what this
question was asking.

1648
01:33:37,420 --> 01:33:38,700
This is what my understanding.

1649
01:33:40,110 --> 01:33:41,690
That's the question that's important.

1650
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:42,870
It's like,

1651
01:33:42,870 --> 01:33:46,000
why don't you turn from the reverse
with father to the spiritual,

1652
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:50,410
which is something you have to do with
your maturity when it's it goes or you

1653
01:33:50,411 --> 01:33:55,310
lose the spirit of is that if you don't
replace your personal father with a

1654
01:33:55,311 --> 01:33:57,430
trans person before and
your different mature,

1655
01:33:59,270 --> 01:34:03,030
your personal father who you
essentially get psychological,

1656
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:06,560
you got and you see people

1657
01:34:08,450 --> 01:34:10,150
when they're like 40 years old,

1658
01:34:10,210 --> 01:34:14,320
the reason they haven't taken
the pattern of the spirit,

1659
01:34:14,350 --> 01:34:19,350
the father away from offered and putting
it into the transcendent space where

1660
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:26,440
there's tremendous utility in doing it
and now say the in the metaphysics of the

1661
01:34:26,441 --> 01:34:29,510
spirit of that question,

1662
01:34:29,770 --> 01:34:34,160
so let's just go with the spirit
middle somewhere and perhaps

1663
01:34:35,910 --> 01:34:37,420
there's something that even more,

1664
01:34:39,320 --> 01:34:40,153
and this is

1665
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:45,070
the psychological idea
of the transcendent.

1666
01:34:45,070 --> 01:34:47,950
The laundry is not something
that you want to snap,

1667
01:34:49,650 --> 01:34:50,500
like look,

1668
01:34:51,310 --> 01:34:56,310
don't give precedent that of course
the temptation is to become a chain

1669
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:57,513
tensioner.

1670
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:03,780
That was good because the person is the
king indicate uses the reasons about

1671
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:10,970
is because God is thought precedent.

1672
01:35:11,370 --> 01:35:12,270
Precedent is

1673
01:35:15,120 --> 01:35:15,953
God is

1674
01:35:17,390 --> 01:35:18,530
sovereign already.

1675
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:19,830
It's.

1676
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:23,910
It's the board with the
idea of that's great.

1677
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:29,590
Report is extracted away from any
carrier and made a princess or the trend

1678
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:35,530
principle and then the president is
subordinate to that transcended principle

1679
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:39,100
and that's been the case because
otherwise that temptation is precedent.

1680
01:35:39,110 --> 01:35:42,080
Janie gone very bad idea.

1681
01:35:44,620 --> 01:35:45,860
Know We.

1682
01:35:48,860 --> 01:35:52,480
We're basically on page 10
of the essential points.

1683
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:56,000
It was like being on task.

1684
01:35:59,300 --> 01:36:00,133
They were

1685
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:04,630
really helpful and perhaps
more than you think.

1686
01:36:05,180 --> 01:36:06,013
So.

1687
01:36:06,230 --> 01:36:06,660
Awesome.

1688
01:36:06,660 --> 01:36:07,493
That's very cool.

1689
01:36:20,430 --> 01:36:21,530
Good followup to that.

1690
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:22,680
Do you ever,

1691
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:23,513
right?

1692
01:36:33,770 --> 01:36:34,603
Yes.

1693
01:36:51,380 --> 01:36:52,213
Yeah.

1694
01:36:59,480 --> 01:37:00,313
Nope.

1695
01:37:07,440 --> 01:37:08,273
No.

1696
01:37:11,010 --> 01:37:11,843
For me,

1697
01:37:14,670 --> 01:37:15,910
for me on the calls,

1698
01:37:16,000 --> 01:37:16,833
dangerous

1699
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:25,560
legal impulsively.

1700
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:31,650
I do also understand some scripts

1701
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:35,713
for

1702
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:41,070
smoking is probably the gate suicide.

1703
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:42,960
I mean that was the whole story.

1704
01:37:43,470 --> 01:37:44,030
You know,

1705
01:37:44,030 --> 01:37:45,550
I'd say that

1706
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:50,710
means that in some sense
it's careless thinking.

1707
01:37:51,290 --> 01:37:53,220
Everything has its risks.

1708
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:00,433
Richard asked you

1709
01:38:17,940 --> 01:38:19,330
back to one of the rules.

1710
01:38:24,760 --> 01:38:26,490
You don't want people,

1711
01:38:26,491 --> 01:38:27,930
you don't want to just
tell you those little

1712
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:38,320
get here

1713
01:38:53,560 --> 01:38:54,770
that I drove.

1714
01:38:54,780 --> 01:38:55,800
The advice that I gave

1715
01:39:04,570 --> 01:39:06,020
was

1716
01:39:08,930 --> 01:39:10,930
about that age

1717
01:39:13,430 --> 01:39:14,263
60,

1718
01:39:14,440 --> 01:39:17,280
which is perfect for me for

1719
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:20,353
my

1720
01:39:22,570 --> 01:39:23,403
depression,

1721
01:39:24,260 --> 01:39:25,093
depression

1722
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,890
and my grandfather.

1723
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:40,160
I asked my daughter,

1724
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:41,320
my daughter has,

1725
01:39:43,590 --> 01:39:44,660
she has 38

1726
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:51,540
when she was 16,

1727
01:39:51,541 --> 01:39:56,270
she had her hip replaced
after walking around with

1728
01:39:59,640 --> 01:40:02,280
and she also has this impression

1729
01:40:04,650 --> 01:40:05,910
when that happened,

1730
01:40:06,200 --> 01:40:09,790
if she removed one of her illnesses,

1731
01:40:09,910 --> 01:40:10,743
I

1732
01:40:12,750 --> 01:40:16,110
which one would be
removed and she said it,

1733
01:40:19,790 --> 01:40:24,530
she would keep the arthritis and
so that gives you some indication.

1734
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:27,330
That impression is mine

1735
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:30,750
was brutally hard.

1736
01:40:31,090 --> 01:40:32,560
My father pointed remarks

1737
01:40:34,740 --> 01:40:35,573
anyways,

1738
01:40:36,870 --> 01:40:37,820
so I'm

1739
01:40:39,850 --> 01:40:42,350
feeling pretty miserable face.

1740
01:40:44,290 --> 01:40:45,140
What's that?

1741
01:40:47,500 --> 01:40:52,500
There were a bunch of things that are
wrong and then I can try to stop them and

1742
01:40:53,651 --> 01:40:56,970
see what happened or the crispy exterior.

1743
01:40:57,940 --> 01:40:59,770
I know what I'm doing wrong.

1744
01:40:59,780 --> 01:41:04,780
Those obvious and they'll probably make
my life worse than it has to be and

1745
01:41:06,940 --> 01:41:11,350
maybe there was 10 things that I remember
fight contract that I'm sort of doing

1746
01:41:11,351 --> 01:41:16,351
wrong and I could start not doing
those experiments and when I started,

1747
01:41:17,240 --> 01:41:19,050
but it was probably 20,

1748
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:21,273
21.

1749
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:22,960
Just what I went to graduate school.

1750
01:41:22,961 --> 01:41:23,261
I thought,

1751
01:41:23,261 --> 01:41:23,531
okay,

1752
01:41:23,531 --> 01:41:24,680
I'm going to see what would happen,

1753
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:29,450
and I just started doing all the things
that I'm doing that are stupid that I

1754
01:41:29,460 --> 01:41:30,700
know where it's at.

1755
01:41:30,860 --> 01:41:35,320
The same time when I decided that was a
strange experience and I need to go out

1756
01:41:35,321 --> 01:41:37,370
a little bit in the

1757
01:41:39,700 --> 01:41:41,060
maximum security prison.

1758
01:41:41,400 --> 01:41:45,760
Just this is the patients
are very strange stuff.

1759
01:41:52,340 --> 01:41:53,173
Insurance

1760
01:41:58,150 --> 01:41:58,983
made

1761
01:41:59,830 --> 01:42:01,160
me think

1762
01:42:03,370 --> 01:42:08,370
about what I was saying and so at the
same time I decided to stop doing the

1763
01:42:11,640 --> 01:42:15,920
stupid things I was doing that I
knew that it was making it worse.

1764
01:42:16,040 --> 01:42:21,040
I was going to start saying things
that might be true and that was also

1765
01:42:21,271 --> 01:42:23,590
extremely shocked because I'm really

1766
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:25,470
like,

1767
01:42:25,470 --> 01:42:26,460
I really needed it.

1768
01:42:26,480 --> 01:42:27,313
I was going to be

1769
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,920
safe myself on that.

1770
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:37,330
It was very uncanny because over the
four months almost a decision to revise,

1771
01:42:38,590 --> 01:42:43,590
like almost everything I said was the
true 95 percent of it was for show people

1772
01:42:46,690 --> 01:42:47,523
for books.

1773
01:42:47,880 --> 01:42:52,880
You deserve things that I really didn't
have just raised up shallow and deep

1774
01:42:58,140 --> 01:43:02,500
forms of self deception and I noticed
that if I paid attention to what I'm

1775
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:03,343
saying,

1776
01:43:03,840 --> 01:43:08,010
I could tell when being
false because I've helped me.

1777
01:43:08,170 --> 01:43:13,170
He was talking to and so what I tried to
list to only say things that it make me

1778
01:43:14,821 --> 01:43:18,960
feel and that was really extreme
experience because to begin with almost

1779
01:43:18,961 --> 01:43:19,381
everything,

1780
01:43:19,381 --> 01:43:20,214
I said,

1781
01:43:20,940 --> 01:43:21,773
oh my God,

1782
01:43:21,870 --> 01:43:24,600
a case almost every week,

1783
01:43:25,270 --> 01:43:26,820
and it was a shock.

1784
01:43:26,821 --> 01:43:27,211
I thought,

1785
01:43:27,211 --> 01:43:27,780
well,

1786
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:29,640
it's kind of insanity in both ways.

1787
01:43:29,641 --> 01:43:29,960
It's like,

1788
01:43:29,960 --> 01:43:34,930
is it the case that you're that false?

1789
01:43:36,900 --> 01:43:41,350
Which of these things that you believe
the sense of falseness and put up with

1790
01:43:41,370 --> 01:43:46,090
the fact that 95 percent you're doing
this all certainly you put up with

1791
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:50,960
and I just started that written and

1792
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:55,200
that's a good thing.

1793
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,090
It's changed me,

1794
01:43:59,180 --> 01:44:00,140
almost completely

1795
01:44:06,180 --> 01:44:07,370
use.

1796
01:44:08,790 --> 01:44:10,320
It's also helped me

1797
01:44:12,760 --> 01:44:13,593
write

1798
01:44:18,430 --> 01:44:19,263
this

1799
01:44:21,860 --> 01:44:23,670
sentence that I

1800
01:44:26,210 --> 01:44:27,043
read

1801
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:29,273
it

1802
01:44:32,240 --> 01:44:34,110
wrong and it's

1803
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:38,930
wrong anyway.

1804
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,030
I can get underneath it and try it out.

1805
01:44:43,190 --> 01:44:46,370
I couldn't challenge and so that's

1806
01:44:50,060 --> 01:44:51,050
500 page book.

1807
01:44:51,051 --> 01:44:52,580
There's a lot of sentences,

1808
01:44:55,430 --> 01:44:56,263
consequences.

1809
01:45:00,420 --> 01:45:01,910
Even during these times.

1810
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:05,460
You're still there.

1811
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:12,230
Well,

1812
01:45:12,230 --> 01:45:14,970
unfortunately when we

1813
01:45:16,510 --> 01:45:17,343
were

1814
01:45:19,380 --> 01:45:20,470
meeting with the Queen,

1815
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:26,700
but my brother in law and sister in

1816
01:45:29,210 --> 01:45:34,210
what this whole experience
has been like for me,

1817
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,780
I feel like now I'm on this jury.

1818
01:45:38,590 --> 01:45:40,770
At the end of yours will be the.

1819
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:42,830
I think that's exactly right.

1820
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:47,393
Yes sir.

1821
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:00,940
I just love being honest.
