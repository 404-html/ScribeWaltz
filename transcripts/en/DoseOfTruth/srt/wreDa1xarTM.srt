1
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,490
So this is what had to
say about Socialists.

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:13,880
It might be sad,

3
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:14,271
however,

4
00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:19,271
that even if the theoretical oriented
book trained socialist is not a working

5
00:00:19,821 --> 00:00:20,750
man himself,

6
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:25,810
at least he has actually created by a
love of the working class he's endeavoring

7
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:29,330
to shed is bourgeois status and
fight on the side of the proletariat.

8
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,700
Obviously that must be his motive,

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:33,463
but is it

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,800
sometimes I look at the socialist,

11
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,020
the intellectual tract writing type of
socialist with his pullover because fuzzy

12
00:00:42,021 --> 00:00:45,800
hair and his Marxist quotation
and wonder what the devil is.

13
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:46,910
Motive really is.

14
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,240
It's really difficult to believe
that it's a love of anybody,

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,420
especially if the working class
from whom he is of all people,

16
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,560
the furthest removed.

17
00:00:56,450 --> 00:01:00,350
The truth is that too many people calling
them socialists revolution does not

18
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:04,730
mean a movement of the masses with
which they hope to associate themselves.

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,410
It means instead of set of reforms which
we the clever ones are going to impose

20
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:11,870
on them the lower orders.

21
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,310
On the other hand,

22
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:17,270
it would be a mistake to regard the
book train socialist as a bloodless

23
00:01:17,271 --> 00:01:17,661
creature,

24
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,310
entirely incapable of emotion,

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,500
though seldom giving much evidence
of affection for the exploited

26
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,550
is perfectly capable of displaying hatred,

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,760
sort of queer theoretical in vacuum.

28
00:01:31,761 --> 00:01:31,911
Oh,

29
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:33,830
hatred against the explorers.

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,030
Hence the grand old social sport
of denouncing the bourgeoisie.

31
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,710
It is strange how easily almost any
socialist writer can lash himself into

32
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:44,540
frenzies of rage against the class too,

33
00:01:44,541 --> 00:01:46,580
which by birth or by adoption,

34
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:50,030
he himself almost invariably belongs.

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:52,920
Oh,

36
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,920
I worked for the NDP when I was a kid
and I had privileged access to the

37
00:01:58,371 --> 00:02:02,510
leadership for provincially and federally
for reasons that I won't go into.

38
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,160
And I thought that

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,030
many of them were honorable people who
were really striving to give the working

40
00:02:10,031 --> 00:02:10,864
class of voice.

41
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,260
And I believe that the
working class needs a voice,

42
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:17,170
a political voice for obvious reasons.

43
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,683
Um,

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,050
I think the Democrats in the United
States have made an absolutely dreadful

45
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:28,051
abysmal mistake replacing
their working class,

46
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,450
political ethos with identity politics.

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,920
We're going to talk about that.

48
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:33,911
And,

49
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:34,744
uh,

50
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,160
and I don't think the situation
has changed that much.

51
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:43,830
I think one of the things that's
happened in the United States is that

52
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:50,630
world stability and peace in some ways
has been purchased at the expense of

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:56,180
North American working class wellbeing
now because the Chinese have got rich

54
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:59,260
compared to 30 years ago,

55
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,071
40 years ago,

56
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:01,000
50 years ago,

57
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,530
the,

58
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,210
the Indians have gotten rich again,

59
00:03:04,211 --> 00:03:05,470
same comparison basis.

60
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,560
There's more middle class people in
India now than there are on the United

61
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,020
States.

62
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,853
Um,

63
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:14,500
the trade arrangements that have been
in North America allowed for the rise of

64
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:18,430
middle classes globally at the same time,

65
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,510
they opened up the working class in North
America to competition from those low

66
00:03:22,511 --> 00:03:23,440
wage sources.

67
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,880
And maybe that's a good deal.

68
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,631
It's hard to say,

69
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,260
right,

70
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,850
because it's not such a bad thing that
the Chinese aren't starving and it's not

71
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:34,240
such a bad thing that the Indians aren't
starving and that those societies are

72
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:37,420
transforming themselves actually into
communities that are quite wealthy.

73
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,650
It's like hooray for that.

74
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:40,930
It's an absolutely
miraculous transformation.

75
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:45,610
It's the most rapid growth of human
wealth in the history of humanity.

76
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,130
So we should be pretty happy about that,

77
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:52,990
but we should also remember at least to
some degree who's paid the price for it

78
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:57,130
and so as far as I'm concerned,

79
00:03:57,131 --> 00:03:59,830
the working class needs a voice

80
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,033
and

81
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,860
it isn't obvious that they
have one at the moment.

82
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:08,180
Having said that,

83
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,080
however,

84
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,080
it isn't obvious to me at all

85
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,420
that the people who purport to stand
for the working class actually do so or

86
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,630
that if they do so that the reason
they do so is because they're all

87
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,680
compassionate and sympathetic
and loving and kind and St.

88
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,310
Like I'm more convinced
by Orwell's argument.

89
00:04:31,311 --> 00:04:33,260
So back to the NDP,

90
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,410
the people I met at the leadership level,

91
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,890
a lot of them I had a fair
bit of admiration for,

92
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:43,610
but as I worked with the party
over about a five year period,

93
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:48,350
there's this contradiction that Cape
kept emerging for me and that was that I

94
00:04:48,351 --> 00:04:51,710
didn't really like the low level
party functionary activist types.

95
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:54,230
Like they just weren't
personally appealing to me.

96
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,600
They seem peevish and resentful.

97
00:04:57,290 --> 00:05:00,050
And then at the same time
I was going to college,

98
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,130
I was about 17.

99
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:06,200
I got elected to the Senate on the College
Board of Governors and at that time

100
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,930
Alberta was conservative politically,

101
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,261
right?

102
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:10,250
It still is of course,

103
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:11,440
but they.

104
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,730
It was part of the
progressive conservative

105
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,580
empire because they ruled Alberta forever
and all the board of governor members

106
00:05:22,451 --> 00:05:23,710
were basically nominees,

107
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:23,951
right?

108
00:05:23,951 --> 00:05:25,000
They were conservative nominees,

109
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:29,800
so these were conservative people and I
was an NDP member and I thought and I'd

110
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:32,060
worked for small businessman
to who weren't NDP.

111
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,620
They were.

112
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,430
They were conserved.

113
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,530
It never figured that out,

114
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:35,770
but I'll tell you about that in a minute,

115
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,750
but I had a bad case of
cognitive dissonance because
actually turned out that I

116
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:43,630
admired the people on the board
of governors and they were mostly.

117
00:05:43,631 --> 00:05:44,590
It was in grand prairie.

118
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,600
It's not a very big place
and it's not very old.

119
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:50,920
And so if you were reasonably
successful in grand prairie,

120
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,510
the probability that you inherited your
money from the aristocrat aristocracy

121
00:05:55,511 --> 00:05:57,740
was like zero because there wasn't one.

122
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,250
Right.

123
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,650
The whole damn town was 50 years old.

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,130
So if you had any influencer or wealth,

125
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,480
you are a small businessman,

126
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:07,040
small to middle sized businessmen,

127
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:07,874
and you'd

128
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,920
you knew what you were doing.

129
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,520
And I actually admired these people.

130
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,031
I thought,

131
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:14,140
well that's not very good.

132
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:17,140
I mire them and I don't
share their political views.

133
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:20,140
And then there's these other people with
whom I hypothetically share political

134
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:22,060
views and I don't admire them at all.

135
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,411
What's going on?

136
00:06:23,411 --> 00:06:25,180
And then I read road to
Wigan pier and I thought,

137
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,170
oh,

138
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:27,483
that's it.

139
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,040
They don't like the poor.

140
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,330
They just hate the rich.

141
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,840
It's not the same thing.

142
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,690
It's not the same set of motivations.

143
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:43,250
And so let's say that you're
a postmodernist and you
privileged compassion for

144
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:44,210
the oppressed.

145
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,231
Think,

146
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:45,351
well,

147
00:06:45,351 --> 00:06:46,760
what are you pushed to the margins?

148
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,290
Well,

149
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,760
what are you doing with all your
hatred and resentment and you're evil.

150
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,140
It's like you don't have any of that.

151
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,990
That's a bad theory.

152
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,150
That's a really bad theory.

153
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,131
Okay,

154
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:02,880
so fine.

155
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,750
So you can say,

156
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:04,584
well yeah,

157
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,580
you can say that,

158
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:07,200
but I don't buy it.

159
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:12,000
I still think that the people who stand
to speak for the oppressed are in fact

160
00:07:12,001 --> 00:07:13,860
motivated by empathy and sympathy.

161
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,810
Their hearts are in the right place.

162
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:16,171
See,

163
00:07:16,171 --> 00:07:19,830
I don't really buy that either because
I don't really think generally speaking

164
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:25,130
that it's a credible claim for someone
to make that their heart is in the right

165
00:07:25,441 --> 00:07:26,274
place.

166
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,450
Now you can ask that of yourself and
if you think your heart is in the right

167
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:30,781
place,

168
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,580
well more power to you.

169
00:07:32,581 --> 00:07:32,941
You know,

170
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:33,720
I,

171
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,480
I can't see the halo from here.

172
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,373
However,

173
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:46,230
and so given that you're
just as malevolent as your
neighbor or maybe even more

174
00:07:46,681 --> 00:07:51,681
so and that that's actually pretty
malevolent given the intrinsic nature of

175
00:07:51,961 --> 00:07:52,860
human beings.

176
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,330
I can't help but wonder what you're doing
with all those traits that you're not

177
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,253
admitting to,

178
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,100
but you can.

179
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,770
You could even object.

180
00:08:03,771 --> 00:08:03,951
Well,

181
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:04,251
you know,

182
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,650
that's a pretty pessimistic
view of humankind.

183
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,660
It's not by the way,

184
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:09,680
it's just not naive,

185
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:10,161
but anyways,

186
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:12,380
you could object that and you can say no.

187
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:13,214
Actually,

188
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:17,780
the weight of moral authority
is in fact on the left,

189
00:08:17,781 --> 00:08:22,130
even the radical left with those who
identify with the oppressed and who are

190
00:08:22,131 --> 00:08:23,840
working to better their conditions.

191
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,053
Okay,

192
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,730
fair enough.

193
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,321
So then let's say,

194
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:31,531
well,

195
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:36,531
let's give those people some power
and if they're actually motivated by

196
00:08:36,781 --> 00:08:39,840
compassion and empathy and
desire for the working class,

197
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,170
if you give them power and
you give their ideas power,

198
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:46,020
then as those ideas unfold in real time,

199
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,370
you're going to find out like,

200
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:50,580
did things get better
for the working class,

201
00:08:50,581 --> 00:08:51,414
let's say?

202
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,800
Or did they get worse?

203
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,480
Because we could.

204
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,790
We could consider that like an experiment.

205
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,950
We could consider the outcome proof.

206
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:00,900
I don't know what else you would do.

207
00:09:00,901 --> 00:09:02,040
I don't know how else you would.

208
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:05,820
You would come to your decision because
it's just theory until you see it

209
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:06,420
happen.
