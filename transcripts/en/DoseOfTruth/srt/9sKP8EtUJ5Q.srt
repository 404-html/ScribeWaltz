1
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,260
So I guess what I wanted
to talk to you about,

2
00:00:08,261 --> 00:00:09,041
what's a few things?

3
00:00:09,041 --> 00:00:09,761
First of all,

4
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:13,570
I know that your book is coming out
in January and I've preordered it.

5
00:00:13,571 --> 00:00:14,920
I'm very excited about that.

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,740
So you are going on a book tour that's,

7
00:00:17,741 --> 00:00:18,270
yeah,

8
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:23,270
just talking to the book is going to be
published by penguin counted down also

9
00:00:23,791 --> 00:00:24,511
in the UK,

10
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:28,180
which I'm really excited about because
penguin is a top rate publisher.

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,350
We were just having a
marketing discussion today.

12
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,860
I'm going to England in,

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,170
in the middle of January as
well as to Amsterdam and uh,

14
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,030
we talked about,

15
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:40,530
so there's two,

16
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,210
I'm doing two talks in the UK,

17
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:42,661
in London,

18
00:00:42,661 --> 00:00:44,340
both of which I think have sold out now.

19
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,850
Yeah,

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,440
three I checked this morning.

21
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:46,951
Oh,

22
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:47,460
okay.

23
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:47,851
Okay.

24
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:48,350
Yeah,

25
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:48,600
yeah.

26
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,660
So the thousand seat venue
sold out in about one day,

27
00:00:51,661 --> 00:00:54,360
which is hard to fathom.

28
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:58,020
And then I talked to
them about renting a bus,

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,960
having it painted in some,

30
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,153
um,

31
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,390
mean like way I suppose
I probably not like,

32
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:09,940
I hope nothing close to
what Milo is doing now.

33
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:10,823
Who knows?

34
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:13,440
Then I thought I'd run a
contest for the bus design.

35
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,100
Yeah.

36
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,360
And so they are,

37
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,580
they seem like that.

38
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,210
They seem to think that was a good idea.

39
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:21,600
And I think I want to do the same
thing in the u s so that should be

40
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:24,210
ridiculously entertaining and surreal.

41
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,090
Bus Tours start.

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,720
Would it be next summer or next fall?

43
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,400
Well,

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:28,971
yeah,

45
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:31,730
probably next fall in the u s and maybe,

46
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:33,770
I don't know where it went in the UK,

47
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:34,581
maybe in the spring,

48
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:37,450
but sometime next year and
I'm going to Australia,

49
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,620
New Zealand and I'm sure I'll,

50
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:42,410
by the looks of things I'll
be going all over the place.

51
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:46,580
And so that's also extremely
interesting and somewhat unexpected.

52
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:47,920
So,

53
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,370
so 2018 looks like it's going to be a
very adventurous and exciting year for

54
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:51,940
you.

55
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:52,211
Yeah.

56
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:55,810
You mean like compare it
as contrasted to 2017 say,

57
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,620
well 2017 the latter part
was I think been really good.

58
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,420
Like I've attended all your lectures.

59
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,254
Uh,

60
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:06,760
the psychological significance of the
biblical stories they've been sold out and

61
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,620
uh,

62
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,110
I,

63
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,280
that's a crazy thing.

64
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:11,680
The question and answer period.

65
00:02:11,681 --> 00:02:13,900
At the end has been so sophisticated,

66
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,610
really in depth questions and the
audiences really tuned in and very,

67
00:02:18,611 --> 00:02:23,080
very mature and there's so much respect
and silence during the entire lecture.

68
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,590
I'm sure you're very pleased,

69
00:02:24,591 --> 00:02:25,120
but uh,

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,953
it's amazing.

71
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,201
Yeah,

72
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:26,620
I'm reading

73
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,900
pleased about it and I've
learned a tremendous amount.

74
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:29,380
I mean,

75
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,213
part of the reason I,

76
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,880
I've wanted to do a series on the
psychological significance of the biblical

77
00:02:33,881 --> 00:02:35,680
stories for long time,

78
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,780
15 years probably,

79
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:41,560
and never had the opportunity,

80
00:02:41,561 --> 00:02:43,180
never set itself up properly.

81
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:43,901
And I've,

82
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:47,420
I've learned a ridiculous about doing
it and I'm really looking forward to

83
00:02:47,421 --> 00:02:48,280
starting it up again.

84
00:02:48,281 --> 00:02:51,670
I'm going to try to do it to
go through exodus next year.

85
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:52,660
Um,

86
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:55,990
I really liked the exodus exists stories
and I know them better than I did the

87
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:56,950
Abrahamic stories,

88
00:02:56,951 --> 00:02:57,784
for example,

89
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:58,843
I had to do a lot of,

90
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,341
but that's okay.

91
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,270
It's often,

92
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,250
it's a funny thing when you're lecturing.

93
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,690
Sometimes it's,

94
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,411
I mean,

95
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:09,880
you need to have a fairly
wide background of knowledge,

96
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:10,990
say that you can draw from,

97
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:11,620
but in,

98
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,090
in,

99
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:12,700
in,

100
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,900
in a more specific way.

101
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:18,280
Sometimes it's not bad to be just one
step ahead of the audience and be learning

102
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,980
along with them because it
keeps the material really fresh.

103
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,031
So yeah,

104
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:22,864
that's been,

105
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,340
that's been an amazing thing.

106
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,220
I don't know how many people have
watched those biblical lectures now,

107
00:03:27,221 --> 00:03:29,460
but I think it's something
upwards of 5 million.

108
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:29,961
Yeah,

109
00:03:29,961 --> 00:03:30,400
that's,

110
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,310
that's remarkable.

111
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:32,144
And you know,

112
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:36,050
what's even more remarkable to me is when
I attend is the number of young people

113
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:36,884
in the audience.

114
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,570
And you know,

115
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:42,230
that's been really encouraging because
I think statistically if we look at

116
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,093
across the board,

117
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,420
um,

118
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,980
I know that young people show not a
very strong interest in religion or

119
00:03:48,981 --> 00:03:49,850
religious stories.

120
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,733
Yep.

121
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,070
Don't attend church.

122
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:53,780
And that's especially true for young men.

123
00:03:53,781 --> 00:03:58,370
And I know it's really funny because I'm
talking to young men about religion and

124
00:03:58,371 --> 00:04:02,240
responsibility and there
there's a huge market for it,

125
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,313
which is

126
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,493
amazing.

127
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:06,973
Excuse me,

128
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,210
teasing on unpredictable,

129
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,020
right.

130
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:15,050
A part of me is not surprised
because as you know,

131
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:19,130
I've spent the last like 22 years kind
of in various types of social services

132
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:20,870
from child protection to young offenders.

133
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:26,240
And the one thing I noticed is I almost
saw that people were like starving for

134
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:29,690
some type of structure and
morality and some type of,

135
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,190
um,

136
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,093
just sort of,

137
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:32,900
you know,

138
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,540
way to live their lives
in a very meaningful way.

139
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,420
And that hunger was very apparent to me.

140
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,580
I didn't realize it was that strong until
actually you came along and I saw the

141
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:46,400
response to you worldwide
has been phenomenal.

142
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:46,891
Yeah.

143
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:47,131
Well,

144
00:04:47,131 --> 00:04:47,480
I,

145
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,313
I,

146
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,021
it was something,

147
00:04:49,021 --> 00:04:49,980
I was talking to the,

148
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,130
I call them the penguin people
because that's actually quite funny,

149
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:55,530
but I was talking to the
penguin people today.

150
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,620
They would ask me how I can account
for what's happened over the last year,

151
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,173
say,

152
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,060
and I,

153
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:08,250
my sense essentially is that young people
haven't been talked intelligently to

154
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:13,490
about responsibility and tradition since
like 1965 and that's three generations.

155
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:16,050
It's way too long.

156
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:19,800
And so they are starving for it
because we've missed half the story.

157
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:20,634
You know,

158
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:21,050
people,

159
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,770
they've been fed a diet of nothing but
sugar freedom and impulsive pleasure and,

160
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,143
and uh,

161
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,770
and cynicism about,

162
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,570
about structure and tradition.

163
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:35,990
And you just can't live like that because
freedom and novelty and the unexpected

164
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:38,250
is half the story.

165
00:05:38,251 --> 00:05:40,720
But structure and predictability
and responsibilities,

166
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,060
the other half and you,

167
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,320
you have to have both.

168
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,880
Both halves of the story told

169
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,671
no,

170
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:50,671
your detractors are saying that 90% of
your audience is male and most of them

171
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:52,870
are white male.

172
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,610
I really don't understand
why that's an issue.

173
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,020
I also don't think it's,

174
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,273
it's funny.

175
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,030
Um,

176
00:05:59,030 --> 00:05:59,361
you know,

177
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:02,780
I was going through my Twitter
followers yesterday because I,

178
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,870
I'm sending some of them books and I used
a program that helped me identify the

179
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:09,824
most,

180
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,300
sort of a combination of
my most influential Twitter
followers and also those

181
00:06:14,301 --> 00:06:18,050
who are most likely to be
engaged with my material.

182
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,500
And so I identified about
200 of them and you know,

183
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:24,800
there were some pretty
right wing types in there.

184
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:25,070
Uh,

185
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:26,780
three or four of them pretty right wing.

186
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,160
Um,

187
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,940
but you know,

188
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,260
three of them were a
transsexual porn stars.

189
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,820
Really,

190
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,340
really interesting because you know,

191
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,190
if you looked at the three
kind of radical right wingers,

192
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:40,611
you'd say,

193
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,090
well,

194
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,300
Dr. Peterson attracts radical
right wing and followers.

195
00:06:44,301 --> 00:06:45,260
But then,

196
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:45,711
well,

197
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:46,071
okay,

198
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:49,490
what you're going to say about
the transsexual porn stars,

199
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,860
literally there were
three of them thought,

200
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,460
well,

201
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,000
what do I,

202
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,790
what am I like tarred with the,

203
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,300
with the association transsexual Porn
Stars because that seems to be just as as

204
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,630
big a group.

205
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:03,943
So it's just,

206
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,851
I think Serena,

207
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:08,450
part of what it is is that if you
stand up against the radical left,

208
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,433
let's say,

209
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:14,420
then it isn't obvious where
you're positioned on the
political spectrum because

210
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,200
everybody to the right of the radical
left is going to agree with you and

211
00:07:18,201 --> 00:07:20,120
that'll include people on the radical,

212
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:20,954
right.

213
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,800
Correct.

214
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,080
And then people say,

215
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:24,201
Oh,

216
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:24,651
well look,

217
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:27,200
you've got people on the
radical right supporting you.

218
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,370
You must be radical.

219
00:07:28,371 --> 00:07:28,731
Right?

220
00:07:28,731 --> 00:07:30,500
And it's a reasonable question,

221
00:07:30,501 --> 00:07:31,334
but,

222
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,860
but it's generally not
posed in a reasonable way.

223
00:07:33,861 --> 00:07:34,491
And you know,

224
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:37,130
you obviously you were
out the free speech rally.

225
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:38,420
I mean the,

226
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,820
there was no evidence whatsoever that
the crowd we attracted was anything other

227
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:48,821
than pretty damn stable
center of the road citizens.

228
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:50,110
And you know,

229
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,050
the other thing about,

230
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:56,470
about someone's audiences that to assume
that I'm mostly appealing to people say

231
00:07:58,821 --> 00:07:59,780
who are right wing.

232
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,560
You'd have to show that the number of
people that I'm attracting who are right

233
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:08,870
wing is somehow bigger than it
is in the normal population.

234
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:09,980
And I,

235
00:08:09,981 --> 00:08:11,570
that's not self evident to me.

236
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:12,291
And so,

237
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:12,501
and,

238
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:13,131
and well,

239
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:13,590
I mean,

240
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,570
just to some degree,

241
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:18,080
I think it's beside the point because
a lot of what's happening is that the

242
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:22,430
people who really misunderstand what
I'm talking about purposefully or

243
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:27,431
accidentally or maliciously are looking
for any means whatsoever to discredit

244
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:29,391
me.

245
00:08:29,391 --> 00:08:30,224
And,

246
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:30,800
uh,

247
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,410
fortunately that has not worked at all.

248
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,603
Yeah.

249
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,810
Not working in the least.
