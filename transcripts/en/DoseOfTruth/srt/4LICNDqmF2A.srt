1
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:10,230
Success breeds success and failure
breeds failure.

2
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:14,280
And it's not necessarily linear.
And that's a really difficult thing to

3
00:00:14,281 --> 00:00:18,630
deal with.
And it's hard on societies because one

4
00:00:18,631 --> 00:00:21,840
of the things we do know is that,
you know,

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:27,260
as you stretch out the inequality you
make men particularly on the lower end

6
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:31,920
of the distribution,
more and more likely to be aggressive.

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,680
It's sort of like,
imagine every man has a threshold for

8
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:36,340
violence.
Um,

9
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,230
and status is important to men,
knocked that it's not important to

10
00:00:40,231 --> 00:00:42,240
women,
but it's different.

11
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,990
It's a different kind of status.
It's status is important to men because

12
00:00:45,991 --> 00:00:49,870
it's one of the things that makes them
marketable as partners to women.

13
00:00:49,871 --> 00:00:52,170
So it actually turns out to be quite
important to man them.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,890
Men tend to compete with one another for
status,

15
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:00,180
hierarchy position and in a really
unequal society.

16
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,720
If you're like a low rung guy then and
you don't have any opportunity to rise

17
00:01:06,451 --> 00:01:11,100
because the society isn't structured so
that there's mobility,

18
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,490
then the more aggressive guys tend to
turn into criminality and you know,

19
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:22,371
and so you could say there's a threshold
for criminality and the more inequality

20
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:28,101
pressure you put on a particular area,
geographic or political area,

21
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,870
the more inequality pressure you put on
it,

22
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,120
the more men slip past that threshold
and into criminality.

23
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,610
And you know,
there's been pretty good studies done of

24
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,940
drug gang in Chicago.
That was the best one.

25
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:45,780
It's sociologist actually went and hung
out with a drug gang for,

26
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,140
he got into it,
I guess the drug gang leader was,

27
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:54,480
you know,
I wouldn't say necessarily narcissistic,

28
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:57,060
but that might be a reasonable way of
thinking about it.

29
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:02,690
And he was kind of happy with the idea
of maybe being a subject of a book and,

30
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,910
and so this guy was able to associate
with them,

31
00:02:08,911 --> 00:02:12,750
got to know them quite well.
And then the housing project in which

32
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,380
the gang was housed was slated for
demolition.

33
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:21,150
And the gang broke up and he got the
books because they kept books.

34
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,360
And what he found was the average street
drug dealer,

35
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,390
first of all was employed in another job
as well and was making far less than

36
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:33,840
minimum wage now.
But the guy is,

37
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:37,050
you know,
further up the chain of course followed

38
00:02:37,051 --> 00:02:39,810
the Prieto distribution.
And so there was a tiny minority of them

39
00:02:39,811 --> 00:02:41,790
who were raking in a tremendous amount
of loot.

40
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:46,350
And the guys at the bottom,
we're just waiting around for the

41
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:49,800
possibility that they could rise up the
hierarchy and you know,

42
00:02:49,801 --> 00:02:53,580
it's pretty violent game.
So the chances that someone is going to

43
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,350
be
taken out is pretty high and then a

44
00:02:58,351 --> 00:03:03,351
little slot up for some opportunistic
second rater and perhaps he can move up

45
00:03:04,901 --> 00:03:05,734
the hierarchy.

46
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,653
Okay.

47
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,660
So the burrito distribution governs all
sorts of other things too.

48
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:19,190
I mentioned
it governs the popularity of box,

49
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:21,530
the sales of books,
but it also,

50
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:27,010
it also characterizes the distribution
of everything that people produce.

51
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:32,900
So if you think of creative production
of any sort of artistic production,

52
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,180
industrial production,
it doesn't matter.

53
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,540
Almost everything fails.

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,070
Yeah.

55
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,480
And a few things succeed beyond anyone's
wildest imagination.

56
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,850
Apple's a good example of that.
No,

57
00:03:47,851 --> 00:03:51,360
I mean the iPhone,
they have their competitors,

58
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:55,860
but it's an extraordinarily dominant
product and they rake in billions of

59
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,693
dollars,
I think.

60
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,580
I don't know if apple is valued at $1
trillion,

61
00:03:59,581 --> 00:04:03,750
but it's close to that.
And that's a lot of money.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,380
And I think if I remember correctly,
it's something like this,

63
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:10,290
I probably have the figures wrong,
but like the top 40 people,

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,950
the richest 40 people in the world have
as much money as the bottom 2 billion

65
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,960
right now.
You know,

66
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:19,530
it's not like they're stuffing their
mattresses with that money or they have

67
00:04:19,531 --> 00:04:24,531
a skyscraper full of cash.
That money is out in the economy doing

68
00:04:24,601 --> 00:04:28,200
whatever money does.
So you know,

69
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,890
you can't spend $28 billion.
So,

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,870
and sometimes you can even do some good
with it.

71
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:36,960
You know,
Bill Gates seems to be doing something

72
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:40,350
reasonable with his money.
But the reason I'm telling you this is

73
00:04:40,351 --> 00:04:45,351
because one of the things you should
know is that this proclivity for

74
00:04:45,931 --> 00:04:50,931
inequality is pervasive among the
creative products of human beings.

75
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,690
It's the case with with goals scored in
hockey.

76
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:58,200
My son told me,
and he's a reliable source on hockey

77
00:04:58,201 --> 00:04:59,160
statistics that,

78
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,770
okay,

79
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,200
if Wayne Gretzky,
if you don't count any of the points

80
00:05:03,201 --> 00:05:08,201
that Wayne Gretzky managed with scoring
is still had enough points just with

81
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:11,480
assistance to have more points than any
hockey player that ever played.

82
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,760
So you know,
you even at the upper end of of of the

83
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:20,130
distribution,
there's some person who's ha there are

84
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:23,900
so good at what they do and then there's
another person that's so much better

85
00:05:23,901 --> 00:05:27,470
than them that it's not even comparable.
And so,

86
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:31,440
and the benefits flow to people who are
in that position.

87
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:33,290
And you can understand why.
I would say,

88
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,190
because I all,
let's say you start writing and you get

89
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:42,150
a book and a rare things,
very rare things to have happen.

90
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:43,790
And then some people read it and they
like it.

91
00:05:43,791 --> 00:05:46,760
And then of course it's much more likely
that you'll get a next book.

92
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,760
And if people like that,
while it's even more likely that you'll

93
00:05:49,761 --> 00:05:53,060
get a third book and then people start
to know who you are and then because

94
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,040
they know who you are,
they phone you up on offer you

95
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,900
opportunities and your network grows.

96
00:05:56,900 --> 00:06:01,900
And it's like this exponential increase
in your reach and your capacity for

97
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:06,560
production and more and more flows to
you.

98
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,920
And,
and then on the other hand,

99
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:14,300
if you start to fail and you know,
why would someone fail?

100
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,290
Well,
God,

101
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:19,610
you know,
one idea that's very common in our

102
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,070
culture is that poverty is caused by
lack of money.

103
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:27,071
And that's a really stupid idea because
money is very difficult to handle.

104
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:32,081
I have clients who were drug addicts and
the worst possible thing that could

105
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:34,460
happen to them was that they got some
money,

106
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,800
but they're just done.
First of all,

107
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:39,050
you know,
they were hanging around with people who

108
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,530
were little on the sociopathic side.
And so,

109
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,730
especially if they weren't that bright
and couldn't defend themselves very

110
00:06:46,731 --> 00:06:49,310
well,
as soon as they got money while it was

111
00:06:49,311 --> 00:06:52,130
off to the bar with all the friends and
you know,

112
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,130
one guy I remember in particular,
you know,

113
00:06:55,131 --> 00:06:58,940
every time he got his,
his disability check,

114
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,750
he was gone for five days,
usually found him in a ditch.

115
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,000
You know,
cause he just go to the bar,

116
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:10,930
spent every sandy had on alcohol and
cocaine and wake up in a ditch,

117
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:14,120
three quarters dead,
uh,

118
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,100
eventually completely dead.
And you know,

119
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:23,230
then he was ashamed and horrified and
repentant and he'd straightened himself

120
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,540
out again.
And then that was all well and good

121
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:29,900
until,
as long as he was broke until the next

122
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:31,940
check showed up and then bang the same
thing.

123
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,930
So,
you know,

124
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,580
it's not like money is necessarily a
good for everyone.

125
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,640
It's hard manage money.
It's really easy for it to disappear.

126
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:42,830
I mean,
elderly people have a hell of a time now

127
00:07:42,831 --> 00:07:46,040
because you know,
crooks are contacting them all on the

128
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:50,210
Internet nonstop.
And so just giving people money,

129
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:53,720
money's like,
it's like pouring water in their hands

130
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,540
is not that helpful.
Not necessarily that helpful.

131
00:07:56,541 --> 00:07:59,870
And then of course contributors to
poverty are,

132
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:01,940
well it's not so good to have a low Iq.

133
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:06,410
You know,
people don't like the idea of Iq because

134
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,010
it seems so arbitrary.
You know you have a high Iq.

135
00:08:10,011 --> 00:08:12,470
Well it's not like you deserve that.
Exactly.

136
00:08:12,471 --> 00:08:15,560
It's,
you set up that way pretty much right

137
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:16,880
from the beginning.
It's very,

138
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:18,020
very,
very,

139
00:08:18,021 --> 00:08:21,770
very stable.
You can make a high Iq person stupider

140
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,620
by you know,
not educating them up to the level of

141
00:08:24,621 --> 00:08:28,850
their possibility but taking someone who
has a low Iq and trying to raise that.

142
00:08:28,851 --> 00:08:30,710
It's like if you can figure out how to
do that,

143
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,160
well you know it's Nobel prize time for
you because people have tried that a lot

144
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,040
and most recently with those,
you know Luminol Lumosity games and that

145
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,560
sort of thing.
And the evidence that those produce

146
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:48,700
anything other than brilliant
performances on the Lumosity game itself

147
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:52,460
is basically zero.
We haven't been able to figure out how

148
00:08:52,461 --> 00:08:57,461
to see cause I intelligence a cross
domain phenomena and you can get really

149
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:02,910
good in a single domain by practicing
like mad and what you'd want is to

150
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:06,570
practice like mad in a single domain and
hope that it generalize to other

151
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:09,630
domains.
That's the holy grail of intelligence

152
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,560
increase.
It's like,

153
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,140
no,
no one's done it.

154
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:16,380
People claim it,
but the claims never hold up and people

155
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:20,460
have been trying for a long time to do
it and they haven't been able to do it.

156
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,563
And

157
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,290
differences in Iq really make a
difference.

158
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,870
You know,
I mean you guys,

159
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:35,930
average Iq is probably one 25 one 30
at one 15 you're at the 85th percentile

160
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:43,130
and one 15 would barely get you going
for,

161
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,490
for Harvard University one 30 you're
probably graduate school and material,

162
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,410
you know one 45 you're up there
at the range where you can probably do

163
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:58,650
pretty much whatever you want.
Although as you get smarter,

164
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:01,160
the scatter between your abilities
increase it.

165
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:04,860
So you might have a very high verbal Iq,
but not be so good at mathematics or the

166
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,010
other way around.
But it's a massive contributor to

167
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:13,011
lifetime success.
And I don't know what to do about that.

168
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:16,440
I mean,
why do smart people make more money?

169
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:21,690
Well,
they get to where the edge of production

170
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:25,380
is faster.
So if you have a thousand people and you

171
00:10:25,381 --> 00:10:27,810
rank order them by Iq,
the smart people are going to come up

172
00:10:27,811 --> 00:10:31,840
with a new ideas first and they're going
to have more ideas and they're going to

173
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:35,370
strategize better.
And you know,

174
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,490
with an Iq of 90 which is
15% of the population,

175
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,390
you think about that 15% of the
population.

176
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:50,190
That's pretty much the threshold for
reading instructions and being able to

177
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:50,700
follow them.
