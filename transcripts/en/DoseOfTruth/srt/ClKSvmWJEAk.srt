1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:01,380
Um,

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,380
there's some evidence that he was
murdered by Khrushchev and his crew and

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,400
Khrushchev was the next leader.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,160
And if he wasn't murdered,

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,000
he was at least not provided with
medical attention when he was dying.

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,641
And,

7
00:00:17,641 --> 00:00:18,300
uh,

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,250
there is reasonable evidence that he was
gearing up to invade western Europe and

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:26,040
he didn't really care how much
destruction would go along with that.

10
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:26,251
I mean,

11
00:00:26,251 --> 00:00:29,550
he'd already killed tens
of millions of people.

12
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,900
He had a lot of practice.

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,060
He was good at it.

14
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,420
It didn't really bother him.

15
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,950
Maybe even enjoyed it.
