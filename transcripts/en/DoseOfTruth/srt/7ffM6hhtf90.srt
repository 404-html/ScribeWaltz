1
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,123
Yeah.

2
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:12,300
How do you reconcile studies to chill
genetic superseding environment in life

3
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:15,480
outcomes with your own experience
conducting successful psychotherapy?

4
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:16,420
He,

5
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,253
yeah.

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,330
Well,

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:20,280
I'll tell you one thing man did,

8
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:25,281
I really did come to realize more and
more in the last three or four years,

9
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:28,530
partly I would say from dealing with
my own health problems to some degree,

10
00:00:28,531 --> 00:00:32,430
but also watching the health
problems that my daughter had.

11
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:33,693
Um,

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:39,030
I think a lot of what we think of as
mental illness is physical illness.

13
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,760
It's a lot more than we think even,

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,043
but,

15
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,810
and I think that that is
reflected in the genetic studies.

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,093
Um,

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,260
but I also think I also still think
that that doesn't eliminate the role of

18
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:55,134
learning.

19
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:56,060
You know?

20
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,893
Um,

21
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,200
people obviously learn and they can learn
better or worse and they learn better

22
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:05,100
when they voluntary voluntarily
approach things that are frightening and

23
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:06,870
threatening and they
challenged themselves.

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,093
And so,

25
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,383
um,

26
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:11,610
it's made me more humble,

27
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,140
I would say in some sense,

28
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,210
both as a person and as a psychotherapist
because I'm more attuned to the fact

29
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:22,680
that the apparently psychological
difficulties that my clients might be

30
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:23,401
experiencing,

31
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:27,480
maybe a consequence of an underlying
destabilization of physical health.

32
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,730
I'm really unwilling to discount that.

33
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:30,480
Um,

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,150
even if what they're experiencing
is very idiosyncratic.

35
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,360
But it still seems to me that there
is credible evidence that exposure to,

36
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,810
to what you would rather
avoid is curative.

37
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:48,050
And so is the weaving
together of a coherent and a
coherent map or narrative of

38
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:50,820
your experience.

39
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,830
I believe that those doctrines are solid.

40
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,113
So,

41
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,650
and that's what psychotherapists do.

42
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,310
Essentially,

43
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,700
they help you get your story straight
about your past and your present and your

44
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,091
future.

45
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:02,310
They help you establish
your point in life.

46
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:07,580
They help you lay out a map so that you
can negotiate through the territory of

47
00:02:07,921 --> 00:02:08,371
your life,

48
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:08,761
past,

49
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,151
present,

50
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:09,661
and future.

51
00:02:09,661 --> 00:02:12,150
And they help you develop
strategies to deal with,

52
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,890
to help deal with emergent complexity
and the fear that goes along with it.

53
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,173
So,

54
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,873
um,

55
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,600
Michael Tom Rose House
a very hard question.

56
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,820
Please comment on young Paulie's.

57
00:02:43,821 --> 00:02:44,990
That's Wolfgang Paulie's.

58
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:45,501
Who knows?

59
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,760
Mundus hypothesis,

60
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:48,830
one world hypothesis essentially.

61
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:49,903
So that,

62
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,481
so Michael,

63
00:03:13,481 --> 00:03:14,350
Tom Bros ass,

64
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,160
sorry,

65
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,290
I got frozen there again momentarily.

66
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,040
Please comment on Yom Paulie's
[inaudible] Mundus hypothesis.

67
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:24,370
Does this correlate with quantum
theory solutions to the hard problem?

68
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,540
Eg Penn Rose Hameroff or church or or
c h o r I don't know what orange or is.

69
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,500
I know Penrose and Hameroff,

70
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,630
I'm not an admirer of the
pen Penrose and Hameroff,

71
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:36,483
uh,

72
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,770
attempt to reduce consciousness to,

73
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,090
to um,

74
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,620
microtubule function,

75
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,990
quantum mechanics and
microtubule function.

76
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,790
I did my best to understand it.

77
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,691
I couldn't,

78
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:47,920
it seemed hollow to me.

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,420
My experience has generally been if I
find something in comprehensible and

80
00:03:52,421 --> 00:03:52,811
hollow,

81
00:03:52,811 --> 00:03:53,980
it generally is.

82
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:54,940
Um,

83
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,010
I've read better books on consciousness,

84
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:57,730
um,

85
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:58,810
like the user illusion,

86
00:03:58,811 --> 00:03:59,680
which I really liked.

87
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,240
That's the user illusion by the way.

88
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,730
And Jeffrey Gray wrote a good
book on consciousness as well.

89
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,973
Um,

90
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,100
the only Paulie,

91
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,500
I'm not going to be able to answer this
question very well cause I'm starting to

92
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:09,640
get a bit worn out here.

93
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,003
Um,

94
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:17,300
Wolfgang Pauli and young recognized that,

95
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,201
man,

96
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:19,820
this is really a complicated problem.

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,210
I don't know if I can,

98
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:24,650
I don't know if I can answer this.

99
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:26,811
Okay,

100
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:27,800
let's try this.

101
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,120
Yeah.

102
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,511
God,

103
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:32,180
it's been years since I've thought
about this and wrote about it,

104
00:04:32,181 --> 00:04:33,380
so we'll see how I can do.

105
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,410
Mm.

106
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,240
You can think about this from a
perspective of Piaget and Constructivism,

107
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,630
so imagine that what you confront.

108
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:50,520
Yeah.

109
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,520
What you confront fundamentally in the
world is what is unknowable and what is

110
00:04:55,681 --> 00:04:58,020
an unknowable has an intrinsic meaning.

111
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,600
It's both frightening and compelling.

112
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:01,860
Simultaneously,

113
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,190
it activates Predator detection systems
that protect you in the way that a prey

114
00:05:09,021 --> 00:05:12,650
animal is protected by freezing and
withdrawal and that sort of thing.

115
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:17,690
But it also makes you curious so
that which you do not understand,

116
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,610
which is something that
you can conceptualize as
that which has not yet been

117
00:05:22,611 --> 00:05:23,001
made.

118
00:05:23,001 --> 00:05:25,940
Habitable world has an intrinsic meaning.

119
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,570
Yeah.

120
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,340
Now the question is whether the
fundamental stuff of the world is that

121
00:05:33,341 --> 00:05:36,700
meaningful unknown or something material.

122
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,970
You can make the case that
what we recognize as material
is actually a pragmatic

123
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:51,420
reconceptualization of the meaning of
the ambivalent meaning of the unknowable.

124
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,470
Now I know that that's hard.

125
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,640
That's a hard concept,

126
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:03,230
but imagine you see it depends on
whether or not you believe that our

127
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:07,820
descriptions of material
reality are the superordinate

128
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,400
descriptions of reality or whether our
conceptualization of material is actually

129
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,930
a form of pragmatic tool use that's
oriented towards our survival and this is

130
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,520
not an easy thing to sort out.

131
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:26,280
It's something that I did try to
sort out to some degree with Sam,

132
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,331
you know,

133
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:32,040
is do we have an objective description
of reality and his reality,

134
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:37,041
something that can be
objectively described or are
we using a technology that

135
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:42,441
produces so called
objective representations
to facilitate our tool use?

136
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,460
And it's a hard question,

137
00:06:44,461 --> 00:06:44,671
right?

138
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:47,160
Because obviously our advanced technology,

139
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,140
which we use in a tool like fashion
is a consequence of our materialists

140
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:52,950
science.

141
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,120
Which begs the question,

142
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:59,121
is the science is the fundamental
purpose of the science descriptive or

143
00:06:59,131 --> 00:07:00,030
pragmatic?

144
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:00,271
Now,

145
00:07:00,271 --> 00:07:00,871
I think,

146
00:07:00,871 --> 00:07:04,770
I tend to think it's pragmatic because
I think our fundamental problem is a

147
00:07:04,771 --> 00:07:06,030
problem of survival.

148
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,960
So there's a way of looking at the world
where the fundamental reality is the

149
00:07:13,321 --> 00:07:17,460
chaotic potential that gives
rise to fear and curiosity.

150
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,800
And that's how your nervous
system responds by the way.

151
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:22,320
And see that's interesting
to me because I would say,

152
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:22,830
well,

153
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:27,830
it's a truism of evolutionary biology
that what your nervous system is adapted

154
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,710
to what you're adapted to as a consequence
of your three and a half billion

155
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:34,080
years of evolution is reality.

156
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,390
And that there's no other
real way of defining it.

157
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:41,810
And so the way your brain construes
reality is as if what you're confronting

158
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,980
isn't indeterminant chaotic potential
that first generate something like

159
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:49,020
apprehension,

160
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:50,820
fear and curiosity.

161
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:51,654
Secondarily,

162
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:55,680
the apprehension to freeze you so that
you don't get eaten or destroyed and the

163
00:07:55,681 --> 00:08:00,681
curiosity to allow you to engage with
what's on known and to transform it into

164
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:02,340
habitable territory,

165
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:05,430
which in large part consists of tools.

166
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:06,301
Now,

167
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:11,301
the onus Mundus that Paulie and young
talked about seems to me to be associated

168
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:17,850
with this idea of that chaotic potential.

169
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,680
And I think that's related to the
physicist wheeler's proposition,

170
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:27,660
that the fundamental reality of the world
is information rather than material.

171
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,030
That material is a secondary,

172
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,993
what would you call it?

173
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,910
It's a secondary
manifestation of information.

174
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,270
And I think that what we
confront in the world,

175
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:39,781
see,

176
00:08:39,781 --> 00:08:44,160
I don't think we're driven by the
past and or determined by the present.

177
00:08:44,161 --> 00:08:47,940
I think what we do is we apprehend
the potential of the future,

178
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,620
that chaotic potential of the future.

179
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,913
And,

180
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:56,220
and I think that that's
associated with a Wa Bohu,

181
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,350
which is the chaotic potential that
God confronted with the logos at the

182
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,010
beginning of the,

183
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,180
of time in Genesis.

184
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:06,960
I think the genesis story is a
reflection of that fundamental truth.

185
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,290
And I think that that
capability characterizes us.

186
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:15,291
And so the onus Mundus is
the informational substrate
that constitutes the world

187
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,410
before it's divided into psyche.

188
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,550
So that would be spirit,

189
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,550
that'd be human spirit and
consciousness and material.

190
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,470
So there's something underneath that,

191
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:28,200
and this is what young and Pauline
we're driving out in my understanding,

192
00:09:28,201 --> 00:09:33,201
there's something underneath that which
is the pre division unity of reality.

193
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:38,250
And that's something like the
Tohu wa Bohu or that tail,

194
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,620
which is etymologically
cognate by the way,

195
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,090
with the word Tiamat.

196
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,010
And Tiamat is the goddess that
the message put Damien Creator,

197
00:09:47,011 --> 00:09:51,600
God Marduk confronted and cut into
pieces and made the world from.

198
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,640
So that's all outlined in maps of meaning,

199
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:57,930
although not so much the
onus Mundus hypothesis.

200
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:58,351
You know,

201
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:00,390
and I haven't thought about
that for while I wrote about it,

202
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,790
but these were in papers I never
published because they were too damn

203
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,940
complicated and I tried to publish
them a couple of times for people.

204
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,193
Okay.

205
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,200
But people didn't understand what
I was talking about and you know,

206
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,280
I hadn't even thought about,

207
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,690
oh man.

208
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:48,951
Okay,

209
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:49,784
well,

210
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,360
okay,

211
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,530
here's a weird thing.

212
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,253
All right,

213
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,550
well the rate at which my camera equipment
is crashing seems to be accelerating.

214
00:11:31,161 --> 00:11:35,810
So it appears that discussion
of the onus Mundus is,

215
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,560
yeah,

216
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,870
irritating the structure
of reality in some manner.

217
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,441
Anyways,

218
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:41,790
let's get back to it for a minute.

219
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,180
So this is a different way
of conceptualizing the world.

220
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:47,550
I think it's a
phenomenological perspective.

221
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:48,120
So,

222
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,470
and I don't know what to make of it.

223
00:11:49,471 --> 00:11:50,850
So think about it this way,

224
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:56,540
so it looks like your left hemisphere is
specialized for operation in territory

225
00:11:57,161 --> 00:11:58,060
that you understand.

226
00:11:58,061 --> 00:12:03,010
So it's specialized for operation in those
places where behavioral patterns have

227
00:12:03,011 --> 00:12:04,900
been made habitual and explicit.

228
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Whereas the right hemisphere
is specialized for response
to chaos itself to the

229
00:12:10,751 --> 00:12:11,584
unknown.

230
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,700
And what that implies is that
the division that's expressed,

231
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:17,380
for example in the in Yang symbol,

232
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:22,150
which is essentially chaos and order is
actually actually represents something

233
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:24,100
fundamental about the
structure of reality.

234
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,151
Now you might say,

235
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:25,451
well,

236
00:12:25,451 --> 00:12:29,740
only the structure of reality in so far
as biological organisms conceptualize

237
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:29,861
it,

238
00:12:29,861 --> 00:12:33,580
but I don't know if we can talk about
the structure of reality outside the

239
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:35,740
conceptions of biological organisms.

240
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:39,550
Like if you're a strict believer in
objective material reality in that

241
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,100
transcendent existence of
strict material reality,

242
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,091
then you might say,

243
00:12:43,091 --> 00:12:46,570
well you of course you could talk about
it because strict material reality

244
00:12:46,571 --> 00:12:49,360
exists in the absence of
biology and consciousness.

245
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:54,361
But it isn't so obvious to
me that material reality
does exist in the absence of

246
00:12:55,571 --> 00:12:59,830
consciousness because I
can't conceptualize what
existence would mean in the

247
00:12:59,831 --> 00:13:01,180
absence of consciousness.

248
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,500
Like is there time?

249
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:03,460
Is their duration,

250
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:04,480
is their size,

251
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,070
the,

252
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,670
all of these things are relative.

253
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,541
In some sense.

254
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,800
All of these things presuppose a
conscious observer even in the materialist

255
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:12,634
description.

256
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,330
So it looks to me like what reality is,

257
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,340
is this Eunice Mungus,

258
00:13:18,341 --> 00:13:20,050
that union Paulie we're pointing to,

259
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:21,820
it's chaotic potential.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,910
Now I also think that we
treat each other that way.

261
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:27,340
So if I'm treating you properly,

262
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:31,690
then I treat you as if you're a moral
agent who's actively engaged in the

263
00:13:31,691 --> 00:13:36,691
transformation of the chaotic potential
that manifest itself as the dawning of

264
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:38,074
the future.

265
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,490
And that attracts your attention.

266
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,970
I treat you as if you're
an active moral engage.

267
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:47,030
I'm active moral agent engaged in making
the moral decisions that determine how

268
00:13:47,591 --> 00:13:49,690
that potential is going
to manifest itself.

269
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,520
And if I don't treat you that way,

270
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,020
then I'm patronizing.

271
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:55,210
I don't give you your full,

272
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,760
I don't grant you your full stature as an,

273
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,940
as a a sovereign being and I impinge
upon your net at your intrinsic value,

274
00:14:04,601 --> 00:14:08,350
the same value that that
allows you to claim,

275
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,490
um,

276
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:13,540
the existence of natural rights and
also the presence I would say of natural

277
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:14,410
responsibility.

278
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,560
So I treat you as if you're well I would
say made in the image of God in the

279
00:14:19,631 --> 00:14:24,631
genesis terminology that you are part of
the process that turns the toe who are

280
00:14:25,991 --> 00:14:26,300
bold,

281
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:31,300
who should I never pronounced
properly into habitable order.

282
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,640
And I think that that's the onus Mundus
and I think that that's reflected in

283
00:14:36,641 --> 00:14:37,960
your neurological structure.

284
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,140
And I think the fact that it's reflected
in your neurological structure and in

285
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:43,570
the neurological structure
of animals with this,

286
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:44,643
you know,

287
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:49,030
almost universal dual hemisphere
neurological structure,

288
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:52,670
which also by the way is it is something
that's necessary even in neural

289
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,504
networks.

290
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:54,443
Um,

291
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:58,010
which is where we got the idea for
plasticity and stability by the way,

292
00:14:58,011 --> 00:14:58,280
for the,

293
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,360
in the big five aspects,

294
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:01,940
scale models and the higher
order personality factors.

295
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,173
Um,

296
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:08,560
I think the fact that that bifurcation
is reflected in neurology is a reflection

297
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:10,820
of the fact that it's,

298
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,860
it exists in reality.

299
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:13,221
Now,

300
00:15:13,221 --> 00:15:13,850
of course,

301
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,920
defining reality is no simple thing.

302
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:16,754
You know,

303
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,630
it's,

304
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:20,210
you can think about it as
an objective materialist,

305
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:24,950
but you can also think of reality as the
sum total of that which is experienced.

306
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,780
And those aren't the same things.

307
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,030
They aren't the same
fundamental presuppositions.

308
00:15:29,031 --> 00:15:34,031
And I think that we've predicated our
society in so far as our society is

309
00:15:34,761 --> 00:15:39,761
functional on the proposition that
each individual is a sovereign entity.

310
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,763
Um,

311
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:47,360
what would you say characterized by
a spark of divinity that uses the

312
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:48,200
responsible,

313
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:53,201
truthful word to confront the chaos of
potential and generate the habitable

314
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:54,141
order?

315
00:15:54,141 --> 00:15:54,974
That is good.

316
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,300
I think we act out.
