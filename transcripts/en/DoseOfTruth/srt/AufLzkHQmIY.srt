1
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,290
When I was looking at the difference
between the Communist system and the

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,610
western capitalist system,

3
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:15,300
I started to get underneath the belief
systems to find out what was there at

4
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:16,560
yoga was extremely,

5
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:18,780
how helpful and other thinkers that,

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:20,100
I'm sure you've heard me mentioned,

7
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:21,390
if you've listened to my lectures,

8
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:25,590
Nietzschean and Dostoevsky and social
knits and seem to be the people who had

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,740
dug deepest down into
those subterranean levels.

10
00:00:28,741 --> 00:00:29,910
And what I found,

11
00:00:29,911 --> 00:00:32,690
I think was that the
communist system was very,

12
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,141
very shallow.

13
00:00:34,141 --> 00:00:38,070
It was predicated on a set of rational
assumptions that were generated by a

14
00:00:38,071 --> 00:00:42,300
handful of people with no real
biological here or historical rooting.

15
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:43,560
Um,

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,560
and I think that the fact that that was
the case was part of the reason why when

17
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:51,240
those ideas unfolded in real time,

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,680
they were so murderous.

19
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,750
They just weren't imagine that,

20
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:55,950
you know,

21
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:57,090
Karl Marx was thinking,

22
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:57,211
well,

23
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,680
here's the game that we're playing in.

24
00:00:58,680 --> 00:00:59,610
Here are the rules.

25
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:04,200
And so that he laid out the
rules explicitly and then
people made societies that

26
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:07,740
follow those rules and it turned out
that that game didn't work at all.

27
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,180
He just got it wrong.

28
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:10,560
And like seriously Ra.

29
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,130
Whereas in the west the
ideas emerged from a,

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,330
an unbroken historical
process that stretches back
probably to the beginning of

31
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:20,563
civilization,

32
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,510
say maybe,

33
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,750
maybe all the way back
to Africa who knows how,

34
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,210
how,

35
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,680
how ancient these ideas are.

36
00:01:25,681 --> 00:01:26,190
And there's,

37
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,080
there's an unbroken con continuity
of ideas that emerged up and that,

38
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,950
and they're expressed in symbolic form
and it's on that symbolic platform which

39
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:39,510
actually matches our biology and our
behavior that are more articulated ideas

40
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:40,344
rest upon.

41
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,000
And so I found that extremely
useful and surprising.

42
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:47,380
I mean it wasn't what I expected.

43
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,440
And at the same time I was,

44
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,423
I was,

45
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,391
I had,

46
00:01:54,391 --> 00:01:58,080
another problem that emerged while I
was dealing with this and one was that I

47
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,380
come to understand what group
identity meant to people.

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:04,640
Like you have to have a group identity
because you live with other people and

49
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,570
unless you have a shared identity,

50
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,250
Jonathan talked about this a bit.

51
00:02:08,251 --> 00:02:12,120
Unless you have a central pole
around which you're all oriented,

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,680
it's all chaotic and confused and
you're in constant conflict and warfare.

53
00:02:16,681 --> 00:02:18,660
It's like that's a bad thing you do.

54
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,860
You do not want that.

55
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,380
And you're all confused
individually and all of that.

56
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,850
That's a state of chaos.

57
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:24,840
It's unbearable.

58
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:28,480
But if you tighten up
the group identity too,

59
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,430
great a degree,

60
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,050
say like the Nazis tried to do,

61
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:35,310
then the probability that you'll come
to blows with other groups reaches a

62
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,380
almost a point of certainty.

63
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,160
Right?

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,400
And so it seemed to me that human beings
were damned if they did and damned if

65
00:02:41,401 --> 00:02:42,234
they didn't.

66
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:42,690
On the,

67
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,381
on the one hand,

68
00:02:43,381 --> 00:02:45,120
if you dropped your group identity,

69
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,730
then you fragmented and
degenerated into the chaos.

70
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:50,640
And if you gripped hard
to your group identity,

71
00:02:50,641 --> 00:02:51,490
then you,

72
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,020
you tilted towards totalitarianism
and group conflict.

73
00:02:55,021 --> 00:02:55,831
And then I thought,

74
00:02:55,831 --> 00:03:00,250
well that was okay in the past to tilt
towards group conflict because you know,

75
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,810
when we had sticks and swords,

76
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:02,620
we,

77
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,490
we'd have a war in,

78
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:05,890
lots of people would get killed
and lots of people would get hurt,

79
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:08,680
but the entire planet
wouldn't burst into flames.

80
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:08,981
Right?

81
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,180
So you know,

82
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:10,411
this,

83
00:03:10,411 --> 00:03:10,880
this,

84
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,010
this inborn

85
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,650
dichotomy of,

86
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,060
of catastrophe that characterized human
existence wasn't something that could

87
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:21,100
spiral into complete destruction.

88
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,750
And so we could get away with it.

89
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,880
But now in a thermonuclear age,

90
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:26,500
it's like we can't get away with it,

91
00:03:26,501 --> 00:03:28,000
but that's still what we're like.

92
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,710
We're still like that.

93
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,600
And so for months I thought,

94
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:32,270
oh my God,

95
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,840
I always believed that if you could
get to the bottom of a problem,

96
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,860
you could solve it.

97
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,890
Cause that that was sort of the
definition of getting to the bottom of it.

98
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,180
You know,

99
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,850
you get solution would emerge.

100
00:03:40,851 --> 00:03:42,790
And when I got to the bottom of it,

101
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:43,630
as far as I could go,

102
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,464
I thought,

103
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:44,741
oh,

104
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:49,630
it's group identity and
like group fostered warfare
and catastrophe on the one

105
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:52,120
hand and degenerate nihilism on the other.

106
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,541
It's like,

107
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:54,070
well jigs up.

108
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:55,270
There's no way out of that.

109
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,480
And I had a prophetic dream at that point,

110
00:03:58,481 --> 00:03:58,691
which,

111
00:03:58,691 --> 00:04:00,340
and I won't tell you the details of that,

112
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:04,570
but it outlined a third path to me that,

113
00:04:04,571 --> 00:04:07,900
that I had already picked up to some
degree from reading young and also Eric

114
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:08,734
[inaudible],

115
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,780
who is one of Young's great students.

116
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:12,460
And that was,

117
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,540
that had to do with the embodiment of the
idea of the hero and the individual as

118
00:04:16,541 --> 00:04:21,541
the like the pathway of the courageous
individual as the mediating force between

119
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:26,710
the chaos of nihilism and the totalitarian
and totalitarianism of authority,

120
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:27,580
authority,

121
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,760
authoritarian certainty
that there was a third path.

122
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,390
And then I started to understand its
relationship to religious thinking,

123
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,860
mostly to Christianity,

124
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,600
but partly because that's my tradition,

125
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:38,590
you know,

126
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,690
in so far as I'm a western person say,

127
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,690
and I understood as well
that it had something to do.

128
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,540
And this was what it
was dramatized in the,

129
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:47,590
in the,

130
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,300
in the,

131
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,550
uh,

132
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,270
in the passion story in the New Testament
was that it had something to do with

133
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:57,220
taking responsibility for malevolence
because Christ is architecturally the

134
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:00,310
person who takes the
world's sins upon himself.

135
00:05:00,311 --> 00:05:03,970
And what that means in some sense
is that if you read about history,

136
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,140
read about Nazi Germany,

137
00:05:05,141 --> 00:05:06,820
you read about the Soviet Gulags,

138
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,770
you don't read as a observer looking
at what other people have done.

139
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,730
You read as the subject and
the object of the history.

140
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,920
You're both the person who was persecuted.

141
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:19,810
And the victimizer at the same time.

142
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,491
And you,

143
00:05:20,491 --> 00:05:24,850
you have to see both of those inside
us actual forces in order to understand

144
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:25,750
history properly.

145
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,490
And of course that's a very,

146
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:29,170
very terrifying thing to do.

147
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,930
It's easier to take the part
of victim in some sense,

148
00:05:31,931 --> 00:05:33,280
even though that's terrible,

149
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:33,551
right?

150
00:05:33,551 --> 00:05:36,100
Because who wants to be the
victim of a concentration camp?

151
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:37,091
Obviously,

152
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:40,780
but maybe that's preferable
ethically to being the perpetrator.

153
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,520
But when you're reading about Auschwitz,

154
00:05:42,521 --> 00:05:46,330
you're not reading about past history of
your reading about exactly what people

155
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:47,164
are like.

156
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:49,000
And that's a very terrifying thing.

157
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:53,500
And so one of the things you have to do
if you're going to take responsibility

158
00:05:53,501 --> 00:05:56,890
for the nature of your being is
to take responsibility for the,

159
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,480
that's truly part of human nature.

160
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,440
And that's,

161
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,710
that's part of the encounter with the
shadow from the union perspective.

162
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:04,371
And you know,

163
00:06:04,371 --> 00:06:07,880
one of Ewing's proposition was that the
human shadow reaches all the way down to

164
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:08,714
hell.

165
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:09,643
And you know,

166
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,920
we're used to thinking of religious
language maybe even as outdated

167
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:15,891
superstition.

168
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:19,460
But if you take that sort of statement
seriously from a psychological

169
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:20,031
perspective,

170
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:24,230
what it means in some sense is that the
malevolence that resides inside you,

171
00:06:24,231 --> 00:06:25,580
at least in potential,

172
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:30,110
is of the same sort as the malevolence
that produces the worst things that human

173
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:31,610
beings have ever done.
