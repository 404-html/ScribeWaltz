1
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,940
Recently I took a job working at
a camp with at risk boys were out.

2
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,100
Well there I will live and work as a
counselor and a house with the kids.

3
00:00:14,101 --> 00:00:17,160
Any advice for working with young
people with behavioral issues?

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,650
Okay.

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:19,483
Uh,

6
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,433
yeah.

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,030
Okay.

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,890
It depends on what the
behavioral issues are.

9
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,860
So I don't know what our risk meets,

10
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:27,430
but I,

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:27,831
so I,

12
00:00:27,831 --> 00:00:29,290
I can't be too specific.

13
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,060
But what I can tell you is that
almost nothing beats listening.

14
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:34,601
You know,

15
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,400
like take a kid for a walk,

16
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:38,020
let him talk.

17
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:38,801
Like listen to them,

18
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:39,730
ask them questions.

19
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,330
You know,

20
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:43,120
because most disturbed people,

21
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:48,121
and maybe even most people don't actually
have anyone they can talk to and they

22
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:50,230
need to talk first of all,

23
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:53,350
to find out that someone
actually cares enough to listen.

24
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:57,580
So it's sort of like a validation of the
fact that they exist and second so that

25
00:00:57,581 --> 00:00:59,260
they can sort out their own thoughts.

26
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:01,510
So as a beginning counselor,

27
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:03,610
the best thing you can do is listen.

28
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:05,440
You don't want to give advice really.

29
00:01:05,441 --> 00:01:05,681
You know,

30
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:06,730
because what you want,

31
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,600
you can ask questions that might lead
someone in an advisable direction.

32
00:01:10,601 --> 00:01:14,920
But the problem with giving advice is
that people are much more likely to

33
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,640
remember something and to implement it
if they've thought it up in their own

34
00:01:18,641 --> 00:01:19,270
words.

35
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:22,540
I think that actually produces a
kind of neurological transformation.

36
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,000
The idea has to be in
gendered from within.

37
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,620
It's one of the prime dicta of,

38
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,870
of psychoanalytic theory for example.

39
00:01:28,871 --> 00:01:30,160
And I think it's a really good one.

40
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:31,293
So,

41
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,750
uh,

42
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,081
yeah,

43
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:32,950
when and with regards,

44
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,470
so Brendan Trista says
trippy snakes and retinas.

45
00:01:35,471 --> 00:01:35,830
Yeah.

46
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:37,180
Like it's really specific.

47
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:38,710
So this woman named,

48
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:39,544
um,

49
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,270
okay.

50
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:41,391
No,

51
00:01:41,391 --> 00:01:42,620
I probably can't remember her name.

52
00:01:42,621 --> 00:01:44,150
Me and he either she,

53
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,490
she wrote a book about trees and serpents.

54
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:46,941
Uh,

55
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:48,770
she's a UCLA professor.

56
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,000
Um,

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,481
the fruit,

58
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,560
the tree and the serpent,

59
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:52,394
I think it's called.

60
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,810
She showed quite clearly that not only
do our retinas say directly detects

61
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:57,171
snakes,

62
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:00,260
but they do a better job in
the bottom half of the retina.

63
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,970
And that we're really good at detecting
the a camouflage patterns that are

64
00:02:04,971 --> 00:02:08,090
characteristic of snakes to snakes
have these like diamond patterns,

65
00:02:08,091 --> 00:02:08,631
which are very,

66
00:02:08,631 --> 00:02:09,464
very rare.

67
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,530
And we have specialized
circuitry for detecting those.

68
00:02:12,531 --> 00:02:17,531
And there was recent research conducted
that showed that children six months old

69
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:19,220
who had never been exposed to anything,

70
00:02:19,221 --> 00:02:20,390
even resembling a snake,

71
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:22,730
had an automatic response to snakes.

72
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,470
And so it actually seems to be innate,

73
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,333
not just,

74
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,773
uh,

75
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,310
not just easily learned.

76
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,110
So that's really quite interesting.
