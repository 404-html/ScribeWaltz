1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:07,521
Relationships,

2
00:00:07,521 --> 00:00:08,230
you know,

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:08,500
they,

4
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:08,870
they,

5
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,340
what they do is me taking fragile piece
and I actually think that probably works

6
00:00:13,341 --> 00:00:14,120
if you're,

7
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,890
if you're bounded by roles.

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,500
And this was a union observation.

9
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:23,580
So Yoga belief that you didn't have to
have an individual relationship if you

10
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:27,890
were in a traditional culture because
women did women phase and then did men

11
00:00:27,891 --> 00:00:32,510
things and they walked along the path
in parallel and there were no conflicts

12
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:34,140
because there were no their word.

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,360
But you know,

14
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,350
they're there.

15
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,340
Most of what you were supposed
to do was laid out for you.

16
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:41,390
And you know,

17
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:42,980
modern people don't like that idea,

18
00:00:42,981 --> 00:00:46,310
but just trying to go
shooting over who should do,

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:48,020
who should cook dinner,

20
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,830
see if you can settle that before you
make a decision about whether the rules

21
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:52,670
are useful or not.

22
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,451
Cause you know,

23
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:55,010
I'd be in lots of houses where that fight,

24
00:00:55,011 --> 00:00:56,810
it'd been going on for 35 years.

25
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:58,363
Never solved.

26
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,190
So hitch could need neo was,

27
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,390
the food was terrible.

28
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:04,730
The husband and wife were
at each other's throats,

29
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:05,630
you know,

30
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:06,463
fine.

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,360
So it's really hard once
you're under the rules to,

32
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,720
once you're out of the rules,

33
00:01:11,721 --> 00:01:13,190
you have to do it as an individual.

34
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,480
But that's a trek,

35
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,680
tremendous demand.

36
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:16,940
It's an unbelievable demand.

37
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,780
It's the same demand that essentially
the Dostoyevsky put on himself.

38
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:24,260
It's like we're partners will say,

39
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:29,410
you are one weird and unwieldy and
malevolent and peculiar creature and so

40
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:30,351
alive.

41
00:01:30,351 --> 00:01:33,410
So like how the hell are
we going to sort that out?

42
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,553
Well,

43
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,990
you better be awake if you're going to
sort that out and they fuck you all heard

44
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:41,550
of him is the Gottman situation,

45
00:01:41,551 --> 00:01:41,970
right?

46
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:46,410
Everything's fine and your heart's racing
and your cordisol is generating and

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,990
you know you're having murderous streams.

48
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:55,490
I've had clients who were very motivated
to commit homicide and they had their

49
00:01:55,651 --> 00:01:56,484
reasons.

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,900
One client I'm thinking about,

51
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:02,930
she thought it was their moral duty to
do this because the person that she paid

52
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:05,790
it had really hurt their family.

53
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,170
Like not in some trivial way,

54
00:02:07,171 --> 00:02:10,830
but like hurt them as badly
as she possibly could,

55
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,200
but there was nothing
she could do about it.

56
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,970
There was no legal recourse.

57
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,310
And so she was a very moral person.

58
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,533
In fact,

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,190
somewhat I would say

60
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,880
it doesn't matter if
she's a very moral person.

61
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,630
This was just driving her crazy.

62
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,680
It's like I have to act,

63
00:02:26,681 --> 00:02:27,260
I have to ask.

64
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,550
I can't just let this person get away
with it because it was also ongoing.

65
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:32,640
Well,

66
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,473
but what are you going to say?

67
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:33,860
Well,

68
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,330
stop thinking about that.

69
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:36,470
You know,

70
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,020
you could put your thoughts
to a more productive use.

71
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:39,710
It's like,

72
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,580
it's not helpful.

73
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,091
You can't,

74
00:02:41,091 --> 00:02:43,970
you can't help a person like
that at all until you put your,

75
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,890
you put yourself in their situation.

76
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:46,161
You think,

77
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:46,940
okay,

78
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,310
if I was in that situation
and that had happened,

79
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:50,780
what would I do?

80
00:02:50,781 --> 00:02:52,160
And then the first thing I thought was,

81
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,401
oh,

82
00:02:52,401 --> 00:02:54,590
I'd be having the same
kind of burgers fantasies.

83
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:55,880
So that,

84
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,790
that doesn't seem like it's
possible that that's not a great,

85
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,970
so let's see if we can come
up with something else.

86
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:04,630
But the danger there is that you have
to put yourself in that situation.

87
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,060
And people don't like to
do that because they think,

88
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,860
oh well I'd never have
murdered his fantasies.

89
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:13,300
It's like if you would never
have murderous fantasies,

90
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,130
I would actually say there's
something wrong with you.

91
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,920
If you're not capable of that.

92
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,620
Then there's like there's
a path of you missing.

93
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:22,180
It's in there man,

94
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,511
and when and when.

95
00:03:23,511 --> 00:03:26,710
When someone's pushing on you at some
point in your life and they will,

96
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,340
you better have that reserve capacity
or they're just gonna mow you right over

97
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,090
so you could see what this would mean.

98
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,500
It would simply mean that before
presenting your own point of view,

99
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:41,800
it would be necessary for you to really
achieve the other speakers frame of

100
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:46,720
reference to understand his thoughts and
feeling so well that you can summarize

101
00:03:46,721 --> 00:03:47,554
them for him.

102
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:48,611
Sounds simple,

103
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,444
doesn't it?

104
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,771
But if you try it,

105
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,040
you will discover it is one of the most
difficult things I've ever tried to do.

106
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,560
However,

107
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,290
once you have been able to
see the other's point of view,

108
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,340
your own comments,

109
00:04:00,341 --> 00:04:02,080
we'll have to be drastic and revised.

110
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,560
You will also find the emotion
going out of the discussion,

111
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,790
the differences being reduced and those
differences which remain being up a

112
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,590
rational and understandable sore.

113
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:18,690
Roger's thought that courage was a
prerequisite for empathic understanding.

114
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,161
It's interesting too,

115
00:04:20,161 --> 00:04:22,320
because you know,

116
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:22,770
here,

117
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,171
here's a,

118
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,360
here's a question for you.

119
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,293
It's like,

120
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,970
should you trust people

121
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,730
or more specifically,

122
00:04:29,731 --> 00:04:29,941
you know,

123
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:31,110
should I trust you?

124
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,371
Well,

125
00:04:32,371 --> 00:04:35,310
you might think if you've heard me talk,

126
00:04:35,311 --> 00:04:35,790
you'd think,

127
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:35,971
well,

128
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:39,060
there's no way you should trust a person
because they're just so full of snakes

129
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:41,910
and malevolence that it's
just absolutely mind boggling.

130
00:04:41,911 --> 00:04:44,700
So why in the world would you
ever trust something like that?

131
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,890
Well then you can think about it this way.

132
00:04:46,891 --> 00:04:48,030
There's two kinds of trust.

133
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,150
There's the kind of trust you have when
you're too stupid to know better and

134
00:04:51,151 --> 00:04:51,990
that's not trust.

135
00:04:51,991 --> 00:04:52,890
That's naivete.

136
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,480
And that is not a moral virtue.

137
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,690
And there's the kind of trust you have
when you know that the person you're

138
00:04:57,691 --> 00:05:02,340
talking to and you are completely full
of snakes and you decide as an act of

139
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:06,600
courage that you're going to trust the
person anyways because that of all the

140
00:05:06,601 --> 00:05:11,490
things you could do to help lead them
and the discussion towards the light,

141
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:12,510
that's the most important.

142
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:12,961
It's like,

143
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:17,040
I'm going to assume that you know,

144
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,030
our interactions,

145
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,870
your impulse towards the good
is going to be victorious.

146
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:22,560
Now,

147
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,393
isn't it?

148
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,450
If you're interested in this,

149
00:05:24,451 --> 00:05:25,240
you could go online.

150
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,490
You can watch Paul Bernardo,

151
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,350
you remember Old Paul Bernardo.

152
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:28,940
Okay.

153
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:33,840
There's videos of Paul Bernardo online
when he's talking to a bunch of RCMP

154
00:05:33,841 --> 00:05:35,340
officers and judges.

155
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:39,180
They're trying to extract
some more information from
him about some murders that

156
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:40,170
remained unsolved.

157
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:42,900
You want to see a
psychopath and operation.

158
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,820
You can just watch those videos.

159
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,840
It's amazing.

160
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,451
He,

161
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:48,900
he runs the meeting like
he's the CEO of Apple.

162
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,303
It's amazing.

163
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,620
So,

164
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:52,560
and that's a problem,

165
00:05:52,561 --> 00:05:54,750
I would say to some degree
for the Rogerian approach,

166
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:54,961
right?

167
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:55,794
Because,

168
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:56,640
well,

169
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,950
what about Paul Bernardo,

170
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,533
you know,

171
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:03,830
is everyone fundamentally
oriented towards the good?

172
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,233
Wow.

173
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:08,390
It's a reasonable presupposition.

174
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:12,650
Most of the time I think it works
better if societies organize themselves

175
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:14,690
according to that principal
because otherwise we know,

176
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:15,231
for example,

177
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:16,064
that one of the,

178
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,113
you might think,

179
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,590
what's a natural resource

180
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,310
oil,

181
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,090
right?

182
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,923
For a

183
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,610
bauxite or iron ore or
forget about all that.

184
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,510
The fundamental natural resource is trust.

185
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,040
So if you look around the world and
you look at economies like Japan for

186
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:35,431
example,

187
00:06:35,431 --> 00:06:37,080
Japan has no natural resources,

188
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:37,680
right?

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,090
While they're filthy rich.

190
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:39,983
Why?

191
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,980
Because of the economy is basically
predicated on interpersonal trust.

192
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,810
So when there's been some lovely work
done in economics regarding precisely

193
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:49,141
that,

194
00:06:49,141 --> 00:06:49,980
without trust,

195
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,370
your oil just sits in the ground or it
leaks out of the pipelines because nobody

196
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,330
welded them property.

197
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,560
You know,

198
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:55,831
there,

199
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:56,664
there isn't,

200
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:00,180
there's no reason to assume that
you're going to be able to do anything

201
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,500
cooperative or collaborative.

202
00:07:01,501 --> 00:07:02,850
So trust is a necessity.

203
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:05,940
If you're really willing to
understand a person in this way,

204
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,840
if you're willing to enter his private
world is see the way life appears to him.

205
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,300
You run the risk of
being changed yourself.

206
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,490
You might see it his way.

207
00:07:14,491 --> 00:07:17,430
You might find yourself influenced
in your attitudes or personality.

208
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,750
The risk of being changed is one of the
most frightening prospects most of us

209
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:22,584
can face.

210
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,090
If I enter as fully as I am able into
the private world of the neurotic or

211
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:28,350
psychotic individual,

212
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,080
isn't there a risk that I might
become lost in that world?

213
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,750
Most of us are afraid to take that risk.

214
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,090
The great majority of us cannot listen.

215
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:41,130
We find ourselves compelled to evaluate
because listening is too dangerous.

216
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:44,490
The first requirement is courage
and we do not always have it.

217
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,493
Okay,

218
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,930
so it says three o'clock on this,

219
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,103
is that right?

220
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:53,970
Wow.

221
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,260
That's a good place to stop there.
