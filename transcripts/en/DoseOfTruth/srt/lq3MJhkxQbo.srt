1
00:00:02,890 --> 00:00:04,860
Oh this observe one another.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,210
They observe people and they represent
what they see and they transmit the

3
00:00:09,211 --> 00:00:11,640
message of what they see to
us and they teach us to see,

4
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:15,000
and we don't necessarily know what
it is that we're learning from them,

5
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:16,740
but we're learning something.

6
00:00:16,741 --> 00:00:18,900
Or at least we're acting like
we're learning something.

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,801
We go to movies,

8
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:20,820
we watch stories,

9
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:21,340
we,

10
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:21,740
we,

11
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,230
we,

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,690
we immerse ourselves
in fiction constantly.

13
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,160
That's an artistic production.

14
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:27,690
And for many people,

15
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,700
the world of the arts is a living world.

16
00:00:29,701 --> 00:00:33,780
And that's particularly true if you're
a creative person and it's the creative,

17
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,890
artistic people that do move the
knowledge of humanity forward.

18
00:00:37,891 --> 00:00:40,200
And they do that with their
artistic productions first.

19
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,600
They're on the edge and
the dancers do that.

20
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,010
And the poets do that.

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,000
And the visual artists do that in the
musicians do that and we're not sure what

22
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:48,510
they're doing.

23
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,190
Like we're not sure what
musicians are doing,

24
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:51,150
what the hell are they doing?

25
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:52,380
Why do you like music?

26
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:52,931
You know,

27
00:00:52,931 --> 00:00:57,931
it gives you deep intimation
of the significance of
things and no one questions

28
00:00:57,961 --> 00:00:58,081
it.

29
00:00:58,081 --> 00:00:58,940
You go to a concert,

30
00:00:58,950 --> 00:00:59,731
you're thrilled.

31
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:01,890
It's a quasi religious experience,

32
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:05,850
particularly if the people really get
themselves together and get the crowd

33
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:06,271
moving.

34
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:06,481
You know,

35
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:08,580
there's something
incredibly intense about it,

36
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:10,350
but it makes no sense whatsoever.

37
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,780
It's not an easy thing to understand.

38
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,390
Music is deeply patterned and I,

39
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,070
and patterned in layers.

40
00:01:17,071 --> 00:01:21,200
And I think that has something to do
with it because reality is pattern and

41
00:01:21,201 --> 00:01:22,530
deeply patterned in layers.

42
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:26,760
And so I think music is representing
reality in some fundamental way,

43
00:01:26,761 --> 00:01:30,870
and that we get into the sway of that
and sort of participate in being,

44
00:01:30,871 --> 00:01:34,410
and that's part of what makes
it such an uplifting experience,

45
00:01:34,411 --> 00:01:36,660
but we don't really know
that's what we're doing.

46
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,710
We just go do it.

47
00:01:37,711 --> 00:01:38,170
And,

48
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,560
and,

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:38,980
and,

50
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,770
and it's nourishing for people,

51
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,011
right?

52
00:01:41,011 --> 00:01:41,640
I mean,

53
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,660
young people in particular that
lots of them live for music.

54
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:47,100
It's where they derive all their meaning,

55
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:48,390
their cultural identity,

56
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:52,560
everything that's nourishing comes from
their affiliation with their music is

57
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,030
part of their cultural identity.

58
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,800
So that's an amazing thing.
