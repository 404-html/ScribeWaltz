1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,920
You know,
another thing that struck me about your

2
00:00:01,921 --> 00:00:06,510
book that was quite interesting I
thought was that you list the names of a

3
00:00:06,511 --> 00:00:09,630
very large number of totally unsung
heroes,

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,480
you know,
those are people and we have a very

5
00:00:12,481 --> 00:00:15,150
interesting table near the beginning
where you list,

6
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:20,180
I think about 10 names,
maybe 12 of people who've saved between

7
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:23,880
hundreds of billions and billions of
lives with their scientific,

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,310
with their incremental scientific
productivity.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,820
And yet those are people that are by no
means household names.

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,430
That's another place where things don't
make the news.

11
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:33,830
Yes,
absolutely.

12
00:00:33,831 --> 00:00:36,800
And it's a,
it's funny how our

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,690
moral,
a crediting our moral,

14
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,640
our awarding of World Brownie points
doesn't quite correlate with how much

15
00:00:46,641 --> 00:00:49,340
good people often doesn't at all
correlate.

16
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:55,010
And the case of the inventors of
synthetic fertilizer,

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,850
of vaccines,
of chlorination,

18
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,710
of public water,
supplies of the green revolution in

19
00:01:00,711 --> 00:01:03,410
agriculture are,
are pretty much unknown.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,440
And they literally say billions of lives
a.

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,930
whereas various reformers and,
and,

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:10,440
uh,
uh,

23
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:13,400
profits and agitators are a pretty well
known.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,640
A number of,
uh,

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,140
uh,
certainly people who are painted by the

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,080
Roman Catholic Church who have to
perform a miracle that might resolve

27
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,220
resulted saving one life,
of course in fact did not because

28
00:01:25,221 --> 00:01:29,000
miracles don't happen,
but the fact that that definition of

29
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:34,001
saint has nothing to do with saving
lives on scales of millions or billions

30
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:40,670
to shows like human moral sense is not
really well calibrated to morality as we

31
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:41,970
would have defended myself.

32
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,700
I think it was stolen who said something
like a single death is a tragedy,

33
00:01:47,781 --> 00:01:52,670
but a million deaths is a statistic.
Maybe didn't say it,

34
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:53,060
but,
uh,

35
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,850
but it's,
it's a conventionally attributed to him.

36
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:58,760
So let's say for good reason.
I mean,

37
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,360
I suppose I could have said it to or I
guess maybe the same thing plays in

38
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:07,370
reverse say,
is that the saving of a single life has

39
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:12,260
a narrative punch and the incremental
savings of 100 million lives,

40
00:02:12,261 --> 00:02:14,960
especially through prevention.
That's another problem,

41
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:16,730
right?
Because prevention isn't dramatic

42
00:02:16,731 --> 00:02:19,100
because the terrible thing merely
doesn't happen.

43
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,330
And that's,
um,

44
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,840
I,
I rather cheekily wrote an article on

45
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:27,950
the human moral sense that began with a,
who do you,

46
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:32,840
who do you think is most a morally
Praiseworthy Mother Teresa or Bill Gates

47
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:37,280
or Norman Borlaug.
And this was before a gates is pivot

48
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:40,770
from a computer technology to
philanthropy was,

49
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,500
was well known.
It was about 10 years ago.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
And I set it up as a bit of a trick
question because of course everyone

51
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:48,770
would say mother Teresa,
even in our field and in discussions

52
00:02:48,771 --> 00:02:52,070
with moral psychology,
whenever a speaker has to pull out of

53
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:55,400
the air and example of a particularly
moral person,

54
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,580
Mother Teresa is the stereotype.
Even though if you ask people,

55
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,610
well,
what did she accomplish?

56
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,470
Uh,
how many lives did she save?

57
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:05,440
How many sick people did she actually
cure?

58
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,960
A,
it's very hard to come up with,

59
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,320
for actual accomplishment.
What does Bill Gates has already been

60
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:15,040
credited with saving perhaps $100
million lives through his efforts to

61
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,430
eliminate affection,
infectious disease living world.

62
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,500
And Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1970 for his role in a

63
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,320
fermenting.
The green revolution probably saved a

64
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:30,100
billion lives,
selective breeding of hybrid crops that

65
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:34,420
required less fertilizer that could be
grown twice a year,

66
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,820
less water,
higher yields,

67
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:41,821
less susceptibility to disease,
which countries like Mexico and India

68
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:45,770
from a from basket cases to exporters of
food in,

69
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,290
in,
in less than a decade.

70
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,390
Right.
Do you think that would be a story that

71
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:53,200
everyone in in elementary and junior
high school would learn because it's

72
00:03:53,201 --> 00:03:56,560
such a remarkable.
It's an absolutely remarkable story and

73
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,920
no one.
I mean,

74
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:00,880
I don't know what percentage of people
would know his name,

75
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,140
his name,
but I don't imagine it's.

76
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:06,100
It's.
I suspect it's in the low percentages if

77
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:06,934
that.

78
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,790
I,
I,

79
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,500
I'm sure that's right.
I think there may have been a change.

80
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:14,440
I seem to recall a,
although I hate to begin any sentence

81
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:18,480
with when I was young a day,
but we,

82
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:23,760
we did read heroic biographies of
Medical Pioneers like annotating the

83
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:28,570
discover of sewage and that Thomas
Edison,

84
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,840
and I don't know if that kind of a
heroic biography of the innovator of the

85
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:38,200
inventor a scientist is as common at
children's education.

86
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,590
Yeah,
I suspect,

87
00:04:39,591 --> 00:04:42,860
I strongly suspect not.
It certainly wouldn't be in Canada given

88
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:45,140
the tilt that our education system has
taken.
