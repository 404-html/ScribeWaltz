1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,150
Justice.

2
00:00:01,150 --> 00:00:02,140
That is a good one.

3
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:03,670
Let's circle back to young people,

4
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,840
um,

5
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,050
because the future is going to
belong to them before we know it,

6
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:08,770
Huh?

7
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:09,603
Uh,

8
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
remarkable and a very insightful
and engaging human being.

9
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,700
Jonathan Height is perhaps a,

10
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:26,170
a leading example of somebody who's
seen from a left perspective himself.

11
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:31,171
How dangerous all of his ears on how we're
endangering young people by not being

12
00:00:32,981 --> 00:00:33,760
honest with them,

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,380
not encouraging them to,

14
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:39,910
to explore what they instinctively feel
needs to be explored going back to our

15
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:44,911
earlier topic and when leaving
them without the resilience
that they're going to

16
00:00:45,431 --> 00:00:50,431
need to confirm if you like a
free and prosperous society.

17
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:52,481
And A,

18
00:00:52,481 --> 00:00:55,150
I had a question he would
run relating to this,

19
00:00:55,151 --> 00:00:56,470
which I'd just like to read,

20
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,663
uh,

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,450
in his piece of the coddling
of the American mind.

22
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,480
Jonathan Heit outlines why millennials
today are so fragile and lacking

23
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,820
resilience in life and in relationships,

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,070
in university courses in the workplace,

25
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,850
and what has led to this overwhelming
push to be protected from anything

26
00:01:15,851 --> 00:01:18,250
difficult or uncomfortable or offensive.

27
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,160
And he calls it the flight to safety.

28
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,110
And I think you've used that expression.

29
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,640
Um,

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,750
he outlines the core reason for
this fragility of mind and emotion.

31
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:33,370
He says it stems firstly
from overfunctioning and
over protective parents.

32
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,600
Then schools now reaches
into our universities and
of course more people than

33
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:37,811
ever.

34
00:01:37,811 --> 00:01:39,190
I go to universities in the west,

35
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,480
so they formed a much bigger bulk in our
community afterwards and at least some

36
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,290
tragically unprepared and unarmed
for life and relationships.

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,150
Would you comment on,

38
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,310
I think it's good to take a step back
from that and think about it in the

39
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,660
broadest possible terms.

40
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,400
There is definitely an epidemic
of over protective parenting,

41
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,700
but it's useful to ask why.

42
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,440
And my suspicions are,

43
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:10,441
is that this is driven by very fundamental
biological and cultural phenomena

44
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:14,440
that aren't generally considered
in relationship to this issue.

45
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,880
We don't have very many children.

46
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,823
We don't have

47
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,200
12 you know,

48
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,710
six of whom died.

49
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,220
We have one or two

50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,510
that makes them very precious,

51
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,440
right?

52
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,080
We're unwilling to take risks
with them and no wonder.

53
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,620
And then we also have
the much later in life.

54
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,940
And so like if you have a kid
when you're 18 you're still a kid.

55
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,000
You know you're going to
go out and have your life,

56
00:02:44,001 --> 00:02:44,271
right?

57
00:02:44,271 --> 00:02:46,670
Because you're so while you were in the,

58
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,830
in the height of your exploratory,

59
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,061
you're,

60
00:02:50,061 --> 00:02:52,730
you're in the height of the
exploratory part of your life.

61
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,350
You're not going to overprotect
your kid because you're still a kid.

62
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,250
But if you're 40 and have one child,

63
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,070
it's like all your eggs are in one basket.

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:07,120
And the probability that you're going
to take undue risks with that precious

65
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,680
person is very,

66
00:03:08,681 --> 00:03:09,161
very low.

67
00:03:09,161 --> 00:03:12,070
Now obviously there's some
advantages to that because great,

68
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,750
you would devote resources to your child,

69
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:14,021
you know,

70
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,490
and foster their development.

71
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:20,491
But the downside is that you have every
motivation to hover and maybe you're

72
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:26,161
also extraordinarily desperate as a mother
to maintain that bond with your child

73
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:30,400
because you've struggled
so long to achieve it.

74
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,091
It's a highly,

75
00:03:31,091 --> 00:03:31,990
highly valuable,

76
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:33,340
you can't take a risk.

77
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,271
Well,

78
00:03:34,271 --> 00:03:35,560
so these,

79
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,730
so we might say,

80
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:37,060
well,

81
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,840
perhaps over protective parenting is a
secondary unintended consequence of the

82
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:41,740
birth control pill.

83
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:45,490
And the fact that people now have
children later in life could easily be,

84
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,031
you know,

85
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:46,960
if you have six kids,

86
00:03:46,961 --> 00:03:47,201
it's like,

87
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:47,651
what are you going to do?

88
00:03:47,651 --> 00:03:48,820
Hype helicopter,

89
00:03:48,821 --> 00:03:49,720
parent them.

90
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:50,171
It's like,

91
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:50,950
no,

92
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,790
you're so tired.

93
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,140
You can't even get off the couch.

94
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,030
If you have six kids and they're,

95
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,140
they outnumber you,

96
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:56,351
right?

97
00:03:56,351 --> 00:03:57,610
They're raising each other.

98
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:00,220
They're competing and they're
taking each other down a peg.

99
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:00,581
They're not,

100
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:01,990
there's no overprotection there,

101
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:03,550
but with the,

102
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,880
with a single child landscape
or dual child landscape,

103
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,460
mostly a single child landscape,

104
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:14,170
then you're going to overprotect and
then that ethos starts to permeate the

105
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:18,430
schools and it starts to permeate the
higher education institutions as those

106
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:19,330
children mature,

107
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,790
and then that all reinforces it.

108
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:22,923
Not Good.

109
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,990
It's not obvious what to do about
it either because if it is driven by

110
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,010
demographics in that,

111
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,873
in that sense,

112
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,890
it's a much more intractable
problem that we think.

113
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,280
So I did some of that
in 12 rules for life,

114
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:33,461
you know,

115
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:33,761
I said,

116
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,260
look,

117
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,660
what you have to understand is that
you're a danger to your children no matter

118
00:04:37,661 --> 00:04:38,494
what.

119
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:39,550
Right?

120
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:44,550
You can let them go out in the world and
be hurt or you can overprotect them and

121
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:46,030
hurt them that way.

122
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:46,660
So you,

123
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,560
here's your choice.

124
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,720
You can make your children competent and
courageous or you can make them safe,

125
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,750
but you can't make them safe
because life isn't safe.

126
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,950
So if you sacrifice their courage and
competence on the altar of safety,

127
00:04:59,951 --> 00:05:04,120
then you disarm them completely and all
they can do is pray to be protected.

128
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,950
So in the very act of trying
to do the right thing by them,

129
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:13,330
although often with a selfish motive
right off of the surface mining,

130
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,793
we

131
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:21,030
strip why the tools and the equipment
and the understanding they really need to

132
00:05:22,001 --> 00:05:22,900
make life work.

133
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,381
Well,

134
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:23,801
that's the,

135
00:05:23,801 --> 00:05:24,790
that's the DePaul mother,

136
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:24,971
right?

137
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:28,990
That was for great discovery of the
dark mother and the dark mother is the

138
00:05:28,991 --> 00:05:29,440
person.

139
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,890
She's the witch in Hansel
and Gretel gingerbread house.

140
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,520
Lost children too good to be true.

141
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,410
It's like a house of candy.

142
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,070
Wow.

143
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:40,360
Who could want anything better?

144
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,670
What lives inside the House of Candy,

145
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,240
the which that wants to
fatten you up and eat you.

146
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,680
Right.

147
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,070
A cautionary tale about
over protective parents,

148
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,690
over protective mothers,

149
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,670
about the over protective feminine.

150
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,350
It's like the psychoanalysts,

151
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,860
they were so said,

152
00:05:57,861 --> 00:06:01,730
the good mother necessarily
fails at such a brilliant phrase.

153
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:03,230
It's like you can't,

154
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:04,843
as you,

155
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,700
as your child matures,

156
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,920
you have to fail more
and more as a mother.

157
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,161
Right.

158
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:14,540
Until by the time you're 30 you're your
child's 30 let's say 25 for that matter,

159
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,570
you're not their mother anymore.

160
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,800
I mean obviously you are,

161
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:22,430
but the relationship has hit
something like quasi peer status,

162
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,810
not entirely obviously,

163
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:25,280
but the child is independent,

164
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:27,890
able to stand up on their own
two feet and take on the world.

165
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,321
Okay,

166
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:31,650
now we say this thing or the university
student runs into some difficulties with

167
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:34,770
study or whatever and it brings the
parents in to talk to the faculty.

168
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:35,261
Yeah.

169
00:06:35,261 --> 00:06:36,400
Or they go off in color.

170
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:42,580
I mean when I went to Queens University
a week ago and there was a lot of noise

171
00:06:42,581 --> 00:06:44,150
and and horror around that,

172
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:48,220
you know that the people who were
decrying my visit set up coloring book

173
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:52,120
stations so that people could be comforted
because you know the evil professor

174
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,140
was coming to talk.

175
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:53,950
It's like,

176
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:57,850
and you know as a clinician and height
knows this as well and all the clinicians

177
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:58,481
worth their salt.

178
00:06:58,481 --> 00:06:58,651
No,

179
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:03,651
this the worst thing you can do for
someone who's anxious is overprotect them.

180
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:06,520
It makes them worse.

181
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,890
The clinical literature
on that is crystal clear.

182
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:14,010
What you do for people who
are hyper anxious is gradually
expose them with their

183
00:07:14,231 --> 00:07:19,231
voluntary consent to increasingly
threatening situations that cures them.

184
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,200
It's exactly the opposite of what all
the mental health professionals so,

185
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:28,240
and I use that term extraordinarily
lightly or trying to do to produce safe

186
00:07:28,241 --> 00:07:30,070
spaces on the university campus.

187
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,410
Like if a safe as if it's space
needs to be defined as safe.

188
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:37,330
You can be sure that's the one thing.

189
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,164
It is not

190
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,420
drove and this has been fascinating.

191
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,400
Let me pay you a compliment.

192
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,241
In some ways,

193
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:49,241
I think the most valuable thing you can
do for us is to model the courage to

194
00:07:49,641 --> 00:07:50,570
speak your mind.

195
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,430
You do it forcefully,

196
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,140
you do it courageously,

197
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,300
you do it compassionately because the
reality is you only have to spend a bit of

198
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:02,450
time with you to realize
that you actually care,

199
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:05,840
especially about our young people
and what they're experiencing.

200
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:11,350
And especially for our young men because
we know boys model themselves are men

201
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,440
who they respect

202
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:17,241
you.

203
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:19,950
They are great job of modeling
courage in the face of it.

204
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:20,531
Well,

205
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:23,890
there's something I like to say
maybe in closing about courage.

206
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:25,490
People say that to me and you know,

207
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,400
I don't think it's exactly right.

208
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:28,320
There's a,

209
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,680
there's a line in the Old Testament,

210
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:33,160
the fear of God is the beginning of
wisdom and I think it's more like that.

211
00:08:33,161 --> 00:08:34,540
It's not that I'm courageous,

212
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:36,430
it's that I'm afraid of the right things.

213
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,120
So when I made my videos,

214
00:08:39,121 --> 00:08:40,990
it wasn't like that
didn't make me nervous,

215
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,390
but I was less nervous about going back
to bed and not saying what I had to say,

216
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,600
that I was about making the videos
because I know where this is going.

217
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:51,550
I don't want to go there.

218
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,160
And so it's,

219
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,940
it's not so much courage.

220
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,280
It's that it's a matter of,

221
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,410
uh,

222
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:57,800
it's,

223
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,290
it's,

224
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:03,290
it's less risky to say something
than to remain silent when,

225
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:04,621
you know,

226
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:05,760
there's something to be said.

227
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,650
I know that to be the case.

228
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,180
And so lots of times in life it's like
there's no pathway forward that's going

229
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,260
to shield you from risk.

230
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,990
You get to pick this risk or
you get to pick this risk.

231
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,440
And I think I picked the lesser
risk and that might be wise,

232
00:09:19,441 --> 00:09:21,180
but I'm not so sure it's courageous.

233
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,373
Well,

234
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,910
I think it's admirable.

235
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,140
Let's leave it on that basis.

236
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:25,740
All right.

237
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,573
Thank you.

238
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,100
Thank you very much for the conversation.
