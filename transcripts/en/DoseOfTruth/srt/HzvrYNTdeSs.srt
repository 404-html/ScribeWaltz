1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,500
Anyways,

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:00,780
bins,

3
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,650
Wanger and boss.

4
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:04,260
So they work mostly in
the 1950s and as I said,

5
00:00:04,261 --> 00:00:06,810
they were very concerned about
what had happened at World War Two.

6
00:00:06,811 --> 00:00:10,620
And so Dostoyevsky and Nichi had basically
predicted that it was going to be

7
00:00:10,621 --> 00:00:13,710
nihilism or ideological totalitarianism.

8
00:00:13,711 --> 00:00:15,840
And that's basically
exactly what happened.

9
00:00:15,841 --> 00:00:16,674
And by,

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,280
by the time the 1930s
appeared on the horizon,

11
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:21,240
the Germans had been,

12
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,133
you know,

13
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,710
they'd gone through an absolutely brutal
first world war and then they went

14
00:00:28,711 --> 00:00:31,890
through hyperinflation
of insane proportion.

15
00:00:31,891 --> 00:00:36,840
So in the 1920s Germany underwent this
partly because they had such heavy war

16
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:38,400
debts to pay for World War One.

17
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:43,970
The German German inflation got to the
point where it was literally upwards of

18
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:48,060
100 million marks to buy a loaf of bread,

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:48,571
you know,

20
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:52,470
so they were taking wheelbarrows
full of money to the grocery stores.

21
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:52,810
You know,

22
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,440
what happened was their
currency devalued to zero.

23
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,380
And you know,

24
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,340
that actually happens to economies
more often than you might think.

25
00:00:59,341 --> 00:01:01,620
So the thing just hit
zero and that's that.

26
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,420
And then it has to be rebooted,

27
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:04,051
so to speak.

28
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:05,490
So they had been,

29
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:10,170
the war was dreadful in
hundreds of thousands of men
were killed or brutalized.

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,500
Then their economy just
absolutely fell apart.

31
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,551
And then of course,

32
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:15,540
at the same time,

33
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:17,580
well a little bit earlier,

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,040
the revolution had taken place in Russia,

35
00:01:20,041 --> 00:01:20,520
right?

36
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:20,761
You know,

37
00:01:20,761 --> 00:01:24,210
right at the end of the first world war
and the communists had come to power and

38
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:27,210
the communists were agitating all
over Europe and in North America.

39
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:27,960
And you know,

40
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,220
their goal was to,

41
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,180
to produce a communist
revolution that was worldwide.

42
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:37,260
And so the Germans were all shorted out
that the communists were going to take

43
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:37,891
over the country,

44
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:40,320
which was a perfectly reasonable fear.

45
00:01:40,321 --> 00:01:41,400
And you know,

46
00:01:41,401 --> 00:01:42,270
instead of that,

47
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,190
what happened was that fascism,

48
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,330
morose and fascism was a form of,

49
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,360
of state totalitarianism.

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,930
And I think the Germans were so
desperate for order by that point,

51
00:01:51,931 --> 00:01:52,470
that,

52
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,600
and that's what the fascists
basically offered them,

53
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:55,590
at least in theory.

54
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,550
Um,

55
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,590
unfortunately as it turned out,

56
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:02,580
they offered them a little bit too much
order or maybe a lot too much order and

57
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,110
things went dreadfully south.

58
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:04,840
But then,

59
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,131
you know,

60
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:09,490
so then the whole world had to walk
through the horrors of World War Two.

61
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:09,990
And,

62
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:12,390
and it was shocking in a variety of ways,

63
00:02:12,391 --> 00:02:14,520
not only because of the
brutality of the warfare,

64
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:18,810
but because of the genocidal actions
that took place consciously by the Nazis.

65
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:19,740
And you know,

66
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,750
and those actions were in many ways,

67
00:02:21,751 --> 00:02:23,220
very difficult to understand,

68
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,493
um,

69
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,530
mean here's why they're particularly
difficult to understand.

70
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:28,740
There,

71
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,740
there were certainly times where the
brutality that the Nazis employed in their

72
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:39,561
eradication of their theoretical enemies
far surpassed the necessity for the

73
00:02:40,801 --> 00:02:41,970
mere eradication.

74
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,050
But even worse than that,

75
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:47,250
so it went past eradication
into real torture constantly.

76
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:48,570
And not only that,

77
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,330
there are many situations
in which the Nazis,

78
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,530
especially near the end of the war,

79
00:02:52,531 --> 00:02:56,490
they had to decide really whether they
were going to continue exterminating Jews

80
00:02:56,491 --> 00:03:00,490
and Gypsies and homosexuals and all the
people they felt didn't fit into their

81
00:03:00,491 --> 00:03:02,800
culture or whether they
were going to win the war.

82
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,520
And there were decisions they had to
make about the distribution of resources

83
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:09,880
where if they were going to pursue
the genocidal extermination,

84
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,640
that would mean it would decrease
the probability that they would win.

85
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:14,080
The war not happened a lot,

86
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,130
especially at the end,

87
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:18,280
and the Nazis always picked
continuing the extermination.

88
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,590
Now that's pretty damn interesting,

89
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:20,801
you know,

90
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:21,700
because you can think,

91
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:22,330
well,

92
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,163
on the one hand,

93
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,191
you know,

94
00:03:24,191 --> 00:03:24,490
if,

95
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:29,490
if they are serving a creed and the
creed is world domination and this is the

96
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:34,711
extermination processes are considered
a step towards the actual end point,

97
00:03:36,071 --> 00:03:39,430
which is the establishment of a
world state of fascist world state,

98
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,470
or at least a fascist European state,

99
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:46,360
then you would think that
the extermination attempts
would be subordinate to

100
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:49,630
that goal if they were actually pursuing
the goal that they said they were

101
00:03:49,631 --> 00:03:50,110
pursuing.
