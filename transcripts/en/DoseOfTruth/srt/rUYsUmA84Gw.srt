1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,310
So what if we said hypothetically
something like this.

2
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:14,200
Let's say that morality
isn't a philosophy.

3
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,910
It's not something explicit,

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,170
something implicit.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,610
How does it evolve?

6
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,503
Well,

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,670
emotional creatures produce it.

8
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,480
You don't have to produce it in isolation
if you were weren't a social animal.

9
00:00:25,481 --> 00:00:28,750
If you live the solitary and
nocturnal existence by yourself,

10
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:31,960
there's no need for morality cause you
don't have to regulate your behavior with

11
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:33,250
regards to your peers,

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,930
but your social animals.

13
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,430
So you're stuck with everybody else.

14
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:40,420
But everybody else could be
conceived of as a grand average.

15
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:41,020
Right?

16
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:43,450
How would you act towards
the average person?

17
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,350
Well,

18
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,550
I would say that very,

19
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:49,540
very stable moral systems tell you
exactly that and they say things like,

20
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:50,403
uh,

21
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,120
do on others as you would
have them do unto you.

22
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,480
Right?

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,250
Basic principle of reciprocity.

24
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:58,480
Why does that work?

25
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,090
And it's a complex precept.

26
00:01:01,091 --> 00:01:04,510
It means I should treat you like
I would like to be treated by you.

27
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:05,741
And you might think,

28
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:07,150
well that means to be nice to you,

29
00:01:07,151 --> 00:01:09,640
but that isn't really what it
means because Nice isn't enough.

30
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:10,180
Right?

31
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,330
What I want from you
really is communication.

32
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,190
Real communication feedback.

33
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:17,320
What am I doing that's
acceptable and good?

34
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:19,690
What am I doing that's
unacceptable and not good?

35
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:25,170
And that ladder aspect of feedback
as part of the reason why,

36
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,210
if you're psychopathological and isolated,

37
00:01:28,211 --> 00:01:33,211
you're in much worse shape because half
of your sanity or three quarters of it,

38
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,240
or 90% of it,

39
00:01:34,241 --> 00:01:36,070
who knows is distributed sanity.

40
00:01:36,071 --> 00:01:39,490
You don't have to be that sane as long
as you're hanging around other people.

41
00:01:39,491 --> 00:01:41,590
Because as soon as you do
something that's deviant,

42
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,570
they're going to raise an eyebrow at you,

43
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:43,990
right?

44
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,591
And then you think,

45
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:44,951
oh,

46
00:01:44,951 --> 00:01:46,280
well no,

47
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,080
that,

48
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,760
and as soon as you do something good,

49
00:01:48,761 --> 00:01:50,890
then they're going to pay more
attention to you and smile at you.

50
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:55,840
So all of the information about how to
regulate yourself is out there in the

51
00:01:55,841 --> 00:01:56,261
world,

52
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:56,830
right?

53
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,240
The average person.

54
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,280
How many people do you
interact with in a week?

55
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,770
300 say maybe it's not that many.

56
00:02:02,771 --> 00:02:03,604
100.

57
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:09,060
How about any year thousand two thousand
five thousand ten thousand what are

58
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:11,380
they all telling you?

59
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,030
Well,

60
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,800
the message is similar across people.

61
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,634
How similar.

62
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,130
Don't know exactly how similar.

63
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,740
That's what stories telling you.
