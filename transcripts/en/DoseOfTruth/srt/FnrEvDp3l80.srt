1
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,050
Don't underestimate the significance
of the birth control pill.

2
00:00:13,051 --> 00:00:15,930
It's like the hydrogen bomb
or the or the computer chip.

3
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:20,931
It's a world revolutionary technology
and for all we know it might do us in,

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:21,490
you know,

5
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:22,860
I mean in the West,

6
00:00:22,861 --> 00:00:26,010
the birth rate is far below
replacement and you know,

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,050
that's as a,

8
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:29,280
has a multigenerational strategy.

9
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:29,880
That's just,

10
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,230
that's an absolute dead end.

11
00:00:31,231 --> 00:00:32,064
And of course,

12
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,810
no one can talk about that because,

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:34,670
well,

14
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,070
for,

15
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:39,420
for obvious the obvious reasons of
egalitarianism and diversity and all that,

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,440
but the declining birth
rate and the West is really,

17
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:45,030
I would say a,

18
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,523
a catastrophe.

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,130
I don't have to be one of those people
that you think the planet has too many

20
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:50,780
people on it,

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:51,210
you know,

22
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,043
so,

23
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:52,240
um.
