1
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,690
Individuals was I describe us Mecca who
are saying when they say he wants to say

2
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,081
hi,

3
00:00:16,081 --> 00:00:20,320
if you sweet individual and I have no
problems with other religions and I did

4
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,110
not want to be engaged with any politics
or any show or to link politics with

5
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:25,830
religion,

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,940
please leave me alone.

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:27,451
Right,

8
00:00:27,451 --> 00:00:27,750
right,

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:27,991
right.

10
00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:30,690
And now I wouldn't say it would be
the majority of Muslims worldwide.

11
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,370
I'm not sure you agree with that,

12
00:00:32,371 --> 00:00:36,480
but it seems to me that it isn't self
evidently the case that the majority of

13
00:00:36,481 --> 00:00:41,481
human beings are violent and warlike
and so my sense is is that given the

14
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:45,090
essential peace
peacefulness of most people,

15
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:48,390
they're going to take a look at the
Islamic doctrine and extract from it those

16
00:00:48,391 --> 00:00:51,720
elements that are supportive
of that more individual piece,

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,220
but that still leaves open the question
of exactly what the doctrine means as a

18
00:00:56,221 --> 00:00:59,550
set of motivational principles and that
seems to be a big part of the current

19
00:00:59,551 --> 00:01:02,580
problem and also the need
for current discourse.

20
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,080
What I would hope is that it would be
possible to undertake a dialogue with

21
00:01:07,081 --> 00:01:07,770
Islam,

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:11,130
let's say between Islam and the West
are between Islam and Judeo Christianity

23
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:16,290
and defined within Islam itself the
seeds that would enable that dialogue to

24
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:20,940
occur so that some sort of long term
negotiated conceptual and practical piece

25
00:01:20,941 --> 00:01:21,774
could be attained.

26
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:23,880
But the more I've read about Islam,

27
00:01:23,881 --> 00:01:27,120
the more difficult it is for me to
understand how that might be managed,

28
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:28,320
especially because of its,

29
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:32,450
well because of the war like tradition
that emerged from from Medina and then

30
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,340
moved outward ins at a
staggering rate from that.

31
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,210
And also the thing that's quite
quite disconcerting to me,

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,081
I mean it's not,

33
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:44,310
my Christianity hasn't been rife with
internal divisions like that between the

34
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,600
counselors and the Catholics,

35
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,930
but it also was the case that what you
might describe as the civil war that's

36
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:52,680
been occurring within Islam,

37
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,900
more or less started as far as I can tell,

38
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,530
more or less started that day that
Muhammad died and has never stopped since

39
00:01:58,531 --> 00:01:59,190
then.

40
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,570
And that also seems to be,

41
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,930
well obviously it's a problem
for the Islamic community itself,

42
00:02:03,931 --> 00:02:05,460
but it also seems to be a problem,

43
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,330
an increasing problem for the west because
we can't not be tangled up in that.

44
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:10,681
Yeah.

45
00:02:10,681 --> 00:02:10,850
We,

46
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,850
we have to share the planet with one
fifth of humanity and it's very clear that

47
00:02:16,321 --> 00:02:21,321
things have to change and it is the duty
of Muslims to change the theological

48
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,880
underpinnings of their religion.

49
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,490
And as far as I'm concerned,

50
00:02:26,491 --> 00:02:31,200
this is being pushed by those that I
call them the farmers or modifiers.

51
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,103
Yeah.

52
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,330
And these are individuals who
maybe know a little bigger groups.

53
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:41,250
They are forming views and maybe
even being led by some nation states,

54
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,710
the leaders of countries who are low,

55
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,470
she'll before that change,

56
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,760
the big question is either going
to agree on what to change.

57
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,920
So what is this inbuilt into Islam is
this idea that does contract with God.

58
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,593
You,

59
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:03,490
I'm submit edits to the Corolla
and it's the same thing.

60
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:03,731
You know,

61
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:08,731
Mohammed boys is seen by Muslims as
infallible as somebody who never made a

62
00:03:09,881 --> 00:03:10,714
mistake.

63
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:15,910
It's an uphill battle for those Muslims
inside this lamb who was seeking

64
00:03:15,911 --> 00:03:16,870
modernization,

65
00:03:16,871 --> 00:03:21,871
who was seeking the forearm to
agree on how to Eddie score.

66
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:27,641
How tough is to wait Muslims to accept
a truly peaceful right and a truly

67
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:33,820
tolerant idea of religion that
separates religion from politics,

68
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:35,180
respects women,

69
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,270
supposed to lie to people of other faiths
and people within Islam who wants to

70
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,520
leave their face.

71
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,030
So how do you get the theological
underpinnings for that?

72
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:46,750
Yeah,

73
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,180
that's the big button with him within his,

74
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:48,890
yeah.

75
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:49,101
Well,

76
00:03:49,101 --> 00:03:49,381
yeah,

77
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,840
and the danger there too is that,

78
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,980
I mean we're not sort of thing is it
tempted often reform from within a

79
00:03:54,981 --> 00:03:55,820
religious community.

80
00:03:55,821 --> 00:04:00,290
One of the dangers there is that
instead of reforming it peacefully,

81
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,120
all you do is add another sect

82
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,283
to the,

83
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,930
for us secular people,

84
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,310
it seems from,

85
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:08,980
from a distance it seems
kind of easy to say,

86
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:13,800
well why don't they just separate
religion from politics and yeah,

87
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,980
we want to be here.

88
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:15,550
They just,

89
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,500
they can be the legislators
to look at it that way.

90
00:04:18,501 --> 00:04:21,790
Too simplistic because then you get
the people who want to be religious.

91
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,200
These Medina subset,

92
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,513
what do you say?

93
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,440
The Medina Muslims,

94
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:31,240
an expression of his Muslim
less is to combat you to Islam.

95
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:32,080
Yeah.

96
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,811
To kill me as,

97
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:35,050
as opposed to if it's to
get women to cover up.

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,460
It's to keep the warning us
about live life to their,

99
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:39,303
yeah,

100
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:40,930
it,

101
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,950
it's the thing that's made me,

102
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,000
I wouldn't say nervous to some degree
from the perspective of someone who

103
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,710
analyzes totalitarian ideology because
the thing about totalitarian ideology is

104
00:04:51,711 --> 00:04:53,210
it tends to be totalitarian,

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:53,811
right?

106
00:04:53,811 --> 00:04:55,820
It's absolutely all consuming.

107
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,010
And yeah,

108
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:57,620
that's,

109
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,660
that's why also when I've been assessing,

110
00:04:59,661 --> 00:05:02,850
cause I've done a fair bit of research
into comparative religion and,

111
00:05:02,851 --> 00:05:06,080
and done my best to
expand my knowledge base.

112
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:11,260
And I've always had a hard time with Islam
in that regard because it's difficult

113
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:15,920
for me to extract out the purely religious
elements and to compare them to let's

114
00:05:15,921 --> 00:05:20,240
say religious sentiments that have emerged
across across humankind and all sorts

115
00:05:20,241 --> 00:05:21,320
of different times and eras.

116
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,750
And to separate that from
the political doctrine.

117
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,440
And sometimes I'm tempted
to think more that Islam,

118
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:28,400
you know,

119
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,020
broadly and vaguely speaking,

120
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:33,020
is something much more like a political
movement than it is in fact like a

121
00:05:33,021 --> 00:05:33,854
religious movement.

122
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,600
It is a political theory and
it's a political movement.

123
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:40,860
It started out even in
Mecca in the early days,

124
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:41,970
come to my daughter.

125
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,580
It was a political message.

126
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,021
It wasn't,

127
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:45,340
it just has religious message,

128
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,940
right?

129
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,940
Even in the early days in
McAfee was absolute is Islam
by its nature is absolute

130
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,300
complete and total submission
of the individual to God.

131
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:01,310
And then Medina Mohammed then
came around with a political,

132
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:05,630
a blueprint for how society ought to live.

133
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,850
The relationship between
the individual and God.

134
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,150
There's relationship
between men and women.

135
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,480
It has been this relationship
between parent and child,

136
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,790
the relationship between the government

137
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,070
and the subjects and their duties.

138
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,330
It has a court system.

139
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,680
It has a military sisters.

140
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:31,360
So from its very beginnings is like,

141
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,650
it was more of a political theory.

142
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,510
There was at religion,

143
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,120
as we understand the agent today.
