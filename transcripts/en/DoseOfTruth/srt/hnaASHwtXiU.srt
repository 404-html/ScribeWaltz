1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:11,840
Somebody asked me the other
day if I believed in miracles
and I hate being asked

2
00:00:11,841 --> 00:00:12,740
questions like that,

3
00:00:12,741 --> 00:00:13,574
you know,

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,180
and you know it's also
people ask me to do,

5
00:00:17,181 --> 00:00:20,600
I believe in God and I don't know
what they mean when they say that.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,450
So I don't know what to answer because
I don't think we're taught necessarily

7
00:00:23,451 --> 00:00:24,800
going to talk about the same thing.

8
00:00:24,801 --> 00:00:25,790
But in any case,

9
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:28,490
I said yes and I have a
variety of reasons for that,

10
00:00:28,491 --> 00:00:29,540
but one of them is that,

11
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:30,933
you know,

12
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:38,230
the consensus among physicists is that
we can track the origin of the cosmos to

13
00:00:39,561 --> 00:00:44,030
something like 100 million of a
millionth of a second after the big bang.

14
00:00:44,031 --> 00:00:46,490
It's like it's so close
to the big bang that

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,540
the differences literally infinitesimal,

16
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,630
but the consensus is that before that,

17
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,560
whatever that is,

18
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:57,020
the laws of physics themselves breakdown,

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,023
well,

20
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,260
what,

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,850
what do you call an event that
exists outside the laws of physics?

22
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,220
That by definition that's a miracle.

23
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:07,431
Now,

24
00:01:07,431 --> 00:01:12,260
that doesn't necessarily mean that there's
a transcendent daddy that caused the

25
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:12,651
event.

26
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:13,820
That's a separate issue.

27
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,660
But it does imply a barrier of some
sort beyond which we can't go where some

28
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:22,850
other set of rules apply.

29
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:26,480
And so I find that interesting as well.
