1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:06,900
Did,

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,980
these are dark musings and I would say
how much of the antipathy towards man

3
00:00:10,981 --> 00:00:13,650
that's being generated by
say college age women is,

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,370
uh,

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:14,700
uh,

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,810
deep repugnance for the role that they've
been designed and a disappointment

7
00:00:18,811 --> 00:00:20,180
with the man who,

8
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:20,521
you know,

9
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,570
like you think of those,

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,670
is it Carpathian um,

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:24,030
are,

12
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:24,331
are,

13
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:24,740
are,

14
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,420
uh,

15
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,253
um,

16
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,113
uh,

17
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,770
I can't remember the culture that the
basic Marit marital written routine was to

18
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:35,910
ride into the village and grabbed the
Bryden runaway with her on a horse.

19
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:36,121
Right.

20
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:36,840
It's like the,

21
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,840
like the motorcycle gang member who
rips the too naive woman out of girl,

22
00:00:42,031 --> 00:00:43,580
out of the bosom of her family,

23
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:43,700
right?

24
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,351
Say by women.

25
00:00:44,351 --> 00:00:44,940
That's all I can think of.

26
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:45,411
Ancient myth.

27
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:45,790
Yeah.

28
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:46,970
There used to be bride stealing.

29
00:00:46,971 --> 00:00:47,780
It was quite,

30
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:48,380
quite,

31
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,280
quite widespread.

32
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:49,691
Right.

33
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:49,841
Well.

34
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:53,650
So I kind of wonder if part of the
reason that modern university age women

35
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:58,630
aren't so aren't so angry is because that
fundamental feminine role is actually

36
00:00:58,631 --> 00:00:59,640
being denied to them.

37
00:00:59,641 --> 00:01:00,310
And they're,

38
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,020
they're objecting to that at a really,

39
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,400
really fundamental level,

40
00:01:03,401 --> 00:01:04,560
like a level of,

41
00:01:04,561 --> 00:01:06,400
of primitive outrage at,

42
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:07,500
well,

43
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,880
what's happened is the chaos that my
generation of the any sixties be creased

44
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,170
through the sexual revolution.

45
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:15,930
I went when I arrived in
college and I need 64,

46
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:16,171
right?

47
00:01:16,171 --> 00:01:20,280
W w the colleges were still acting in
local parentes in place of a parent.

48
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:21,960
So my dormitory,

49
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:22,950
um,

50
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,150
all women's dormitory,

51
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:24,631
uh,

52
00:01:24,631 --> 00:01:24,781
we,

53
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:27,300
women had to sign in
at 11 o'clock at night.

54
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,190
The men could run free the entire night.

55
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:32,100
So it was my generation of
women that rose up and said,

56
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,130
give us the same freedom as men have.

57
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,360
And the college's replied,

58
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,140
no.

59
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,670
Um,

60
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,900
in the world is dangerous
that you could be raped,

61
00:01:39,901 --> 00:01:39,981
a,

62
00:01:39,981 --> 00:01:41,310
we have to protect you against.

63
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:41,550
Right.

64
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:42,690
And would we said,

65
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:42,961
okay,

66
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:46,620
was give us the freedom to risk rate.

67
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,080
Okay.

68
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,620
So that what?

69
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,470
That today's women don't understand.

70
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,440
It's a freedom that you want.

71
00:01:51,441 --> 00:01:54,600
It's the same freedom that give gay men
have when they go and they pick up a

72
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:55,590
stranger someplace.

73
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,610
They know it's dangerous.

74
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
They know that they could
end up beaten up or killed.

75
00:01:59,041 --> 00:01:59,341
Okay.

76
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,620
But they find it hat if you want freedom,

77
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,940
if you want equality,

78
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,181
okay,

79
00:02:03,181 --> 00:02:04,740
then you have to stop behaving like a man.

80
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,310
No.

81
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,310
So what we did is we gave freedom to
these young women for several generations,

82
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:15,930
but my generation had been raised and I
far more resilient and robust culture.

83
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,081
Okay.

84
00:02:16,081 --> 00:02:17,430
We had the strength,

85
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:17,771
okay.

86
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:20,640
To know what we wanted and
to fight for what we wanted.

87
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,510
These young women had been raised in
this protective terribly protected ways.

88
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:24,900
Right.

89
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,150
So I think in some strange th you know,

90
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,950
the fashion that,

91
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:31,800
that all of these demands
for intrusion from these,

92
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:32,130
you know,

93
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,700
Stalinist committees,

94
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,191
sexual,

95
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:35,640
you know,

96
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,560
investigating dates and so on.

97
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:39,540
It's a way to re institute,

98
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:39,781
okay.

99
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:42,300
The rules that my generation
through out the window and I,

100
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:44,530
so I think these young
women are desperate now.

101
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,061
Only that,

102
00:02:45,061 --> 00:02:47,930
but I have spoken out very strongly in,

103
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,210
you know,

104
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:51,450
ended up in a piece I wrote for Time
magazine isn't my most recent book

105
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,110
[inaudible] the racing,

106
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,750
the drinking age in this country.

107
00:02:54,751 --> 00:02:54,961
Okay.

108
00:02:54,961 --> 00:02:56,700
From 18 to 21 okay.

109
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:58,050
Has had a direct result.

110
00:02:58,051 --> 00:02:58,351
Okay.

111
00:02:58,351 --> 00:02:59,110
In these,

112
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:03,570
in these disasters of binge drinking
fraternity parties because they tend to

113
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,200
elect couch students the way we could
go out at as freshmen have a beer,

114
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,180
sit any protected adult environment,

115
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,260
learn how to have discourse
with the opposite sex in,

116
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:13,550
in,

117
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:13,810
in,

118
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,300
in a safe environment.

119
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:16,661
Right.

120
00:03:16,661 --> 00:03:17,200
And so on.

121
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,790
And you and not today.

122
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:18,971
Okay.

123
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:22,420
Because because of the stupid rule that
the young people can't even buy a drink.

124
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:22,821
Okay.

125
00:03:22,821 --> 00:03:23,000
You know,

126
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,240
in a bar until the 21 we have these,

127
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,370
the fraternity parties that aren't,

128
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,360
that are like the caveman era.

129
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:28,661
Well,

130
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:29,301
of course in,

131
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:30,134
in this modern age,

132
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,510
this is an advantage as men,

133
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,690
gay men want to hook up
and then want to have sex.

134
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,520
Women don't understand what men want.

135
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,450
Women,

136
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:40,090
women are like put out because they're
hoping that maybe the man will continue

137
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:41,110
to be interested in them.

138
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,560
Okay.

139
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,000
The man just wants experience.

140
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,241
Okay.

141
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,060
And that the hormones
drive toward door to me.

142
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:46,411
I,

143
00:03:46,411 --> 00:03:46,741
I've,

144
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:47,980
I've theorized okay.

145
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:48,610
That the,

146
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:48,791
you know,

147
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:48,901
the,

148
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,720
that the sex drive and
men is intertwined with,

149
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,840
with hunted pursuits.

150
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,693
Okay.

151
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:55,091
I feel absolutely,

152
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:56,320
this is what women don't understand.

153
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:56,710
Okay.

154
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,700
If women understood what I understand
from my transgender perspective,

155
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,633
all right.

156
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:02,980
These women on the streets,

157
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,823
okay.

158
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:05,230
I know I'm obviously,

159
00:04:05,231 --> 00:04:05,620
you know,

160
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,950
Madonna and admirer and you know,

161
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,460
and I,

162
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,870
I support pornography and prostitution,

163
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,170
so I don't want what I'm about to save
to seem conservative and then it isn't,

164
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,501
okay.

165
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:16,870
What I'm saying is the
women on the street,

166
00:04:16,871 --> 00:04:17,530
young women,

167
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:17,950
okay.

168
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:18,610
Who are,

169
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,870
who are jogging.

170
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,201
Okay.

171
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,430
With no bra on.

172
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:21,940
Okay.

173
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,300
Short shorts and have and
have earbuds in their ears.

174
00:04:25,301 --> 00:04:25,720
Okay.

175
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,850
Just jogging along line.

176
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,940
And I saw these women do not understand
the nature of the human mind.

177
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,340
They do not understand
the nature of psychosis.

178
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:33,820
Okay.

179
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,880
And this intertwining them
talking about the hunt,

180
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,200
the hunt and pursuit thing.

181
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:38,800
Okay.

182
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,900
They're triggering a hunter thing.

183
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:45,820
Just what do what you have talked
about in terms of the zebra heard.

184
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:46,420
Okay.

185
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,670
They are triggering the hunt game,

186
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:49,020
uh,

187
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,781
impulse.

188
00:04:49,781 --> 00:04:50,320
Okay.

189
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,760
In psychotic men.

190
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,211
Okay.

191
00:04:52,211 --> 00:04:53,350
I have here the,

192
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,210
there goes a very appetizing and,

193
00:04:56,211 --> 00:04:58,360
and totally oblivious animal.

194
00:04:58,361 --> 00:04:58,571
Okay.

195
00:04:58,571 --> 00:04:59,560
Bouncing along here.

196
00:04:59,590 --> 00:04:59,740
Okay,

197
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,110
sorry.

198
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:00,701
And we're,

199
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,700
we're in a period now where
psychosis is not understood at all.

200
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:03,911
Okay.

201
00:05:03,911 --> 00:05:04,350
Do you know yet,

202
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:04,961
young women have,

203
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:09,100
you had to have had no
exposure to movies like psycho.

204
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:09,963
Okay.

205
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,561
The,

206
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:10,750
you know,

207
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,200
the kind of rapists serial
murderer thing and so on,

208
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,180
the kind of strange dynamic
that has to do with the,

209
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,400
with the assault on the,

210
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,420
on the mother and Mongo,

211
00:05:19,421 --> 00:05:19,631
you know,

212
00:05:19,631 --> 00:05:19,731
in,

213
00:05:19,731 --> 00:05:20,200
in the,

214
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:20,441
in the,

215
00:05:20,441 --> 00:05:21,700
in the mind of the psychotic.

216
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,460
But I think that's an incredible naivete.

217
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,270
These young women are emerging and going
to college and in this like incredible

218
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:30,370
Dinesen environment of,

219
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:30,620
you know,

220
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:30,791
a,

221
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:34,450
a sec orgiastic sexual
experience in fraternity houses,

222
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,310
they're completely unprepared for it,

223
00:05:36,311 --> 00:05:36,590
right?

224
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:36,800
And,

225
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,260
and so you're getting all this outrage.

226
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:43,261
So feminist rhetoric has gotten more and
more extreme in its portrayal of men is

227
00:05:43,331 --> 00:05:43,720
evil.

228
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,471
But in fact,

229
00:05:44,471 --> 00:05:44,681
okay,

230
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:44,821
wait,

231
00:05:44,821 --> 00:05:46,190
what we have is a cask is a,

232
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:47,890
is a chaos in the sexual realm.

233
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,610
The girls have not been
told anything real.

234
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:52,140
I mean,

235
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:54,460
in terms of biological substrate,

236
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,343
them just sexual

237
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,220
what constitutes consent

238
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,580
to.

239
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,241
Exactly.

240
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:03,620
And it's become something that's
essentially portrayed linguistically as a

241
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,570
sequence of progressive contracts,

242
00:06:05,571 --> 00:06:06,500
which you know,

243
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:07,010
is,

244
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:07,340
it's,

245
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,121
well I think,

246
00:06:08,121 --> 00:06:08,331
you know,

247
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:12,110
I've thought for a while that we're living
in the delusional fantasy of a naive

248
00:06:12,111 --> 00:06:15,410
13 year old girl that's
basically sums up our culture.

249
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,740
And I look at all these sexual
rules that permeate the,

250
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,590
the,

251
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:21,380
the academia and I think two things.

252
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,880
The first thing I think as well,

253
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,150
I know because I was an alcohol
researcher for a long time,

254
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:30,890
and you know that 50% of violent crimes
are directly attributable to alcohol.

255
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,940
So if you're a murdered,

256
00:06:31,941 --> 00:06:36,140
there's about a 50% chance that you're
drunk and about a 50% chance that the

257
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,640
person who kills you is drunk.

258
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:41,060
And the alcohol is the only drug
that we know that actually amplifies

259
00:06:41,061 --> 00:06:41,840
aggression.

260
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,640
It does that in laboratory situations.

261
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:45,140
Plus it's a great disinhibitor.

262
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:45,411
Right.

263
00:06:45,411 --> 00:06:46,850
So what alcohol does is it,

264
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:51,050
it doesn't make you oblivious to the
future consequences of your action because

265
00:06:51,051 --> 00:06:54,590
if you ask someone who's drunk about
the consequences of something stupid,

266
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,870
they can tell you what
the consequences are,

267
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,670
but it makes you not care.

268
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,900
And it does that because it's
technically an anxiety alytic like,

269
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:02,240
like,

270
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,520
like barbiturates are
like benzodiazepines.

271
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,480
And it also has a,

272
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,291
as a,

273
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,370
an activating,

274
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:08,070
um,

275
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,360
uh,

276
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,130
property for many people who drink.

277
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:10,620
So it's,

278
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,960
it's a stimulant and a,

279
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:15,320
and an exile lytic at
the same time and a very,

280
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:16,154
very potent,

281
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,540
very potent for both of them.

282
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,200
And,

283
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,441
you know,

284
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:22,460
we put young people together and douse
them in alcohol right at the binge

285
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:23,294
drinking level.

286
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,020
And then,

287
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,210
which also interferes
with memory consolidation,

288
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,220
which of course makes
things much more complex.

289
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:31,970
And then we're surprised when there
are sexual misadventures and you know,

290
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:36,380
and then it's also attributed almost
purely to the predatory element that's,

291
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:36,950
that's,

292
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,220
uh,

293
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:38,690
part and parcel of masculinity.

294
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:39,200
But a true,

295
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,830
a tremendous amount of that
is also naivety and stupidity.

296
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:42,350
You know,

297
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:46,010
because we expect like
eight to 18 year old guys,

298
00:07:46,011 --> 00:07:47,420
especially the ones that aren't,

299
00:07:47,421 --> 00:07:49,040
that haven't been successful with girls,

300
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:53,390
which is like 85% of them because the
successful men are a very small percentage

301
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:54,224
of men.

302
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,650
The 85% who haven't been
successful with men or with women,

303
00:07:57,651 --> 00:07:59,630
they don't know what the
hell they're doing at all.

304
00:07:59,750 --> 00:07:59,991
Right.

305
00:07:59,991 --> 00:08:04,580
In part of the reason they're getting
drunk is to garner up enough courage to

306
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:06,200
actually make an advance.

307
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:06,900
Yeah,

308
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,410
because I think another thing
that women don't understand,

309
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,620
especially with regards to young men is
just exactly how petrifying a attractive

310
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:19,800
woman whose of say somewhat higher
status actually is to a young guy on it.

311
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:23,450
There's lots of guys that
right knee constantly and
people that I've worked with

312
00:08:23,451 --> 00:08:24,680
that are so terrified of women,

313
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:25,730
they can't even talk to them.

314
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,541
It's very,

315
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,374
very common.

316
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:27,820
Well,

317
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,090
I take a very firm position,

318
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,960
which is that I want
college administration,

319
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,090
so stay totally out of the
social lives of the students.

320
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,770
If a crime is committed,

321
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,060
it should be reported to the police.

322
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:41,250
I've been writing now
for 2050 of 25 years now.

323
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:41,790
All right.

324
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:42,050
But,

325
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:47,050
but there's not the business
of any college administration
to take any notice of

326
00:08:47,071 --> 00:08:48,750
what the students say to each other,

327
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:51,360
say to each other as well
as do with each other.

328
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:51,810
Okay.

329
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,190
I want it to totally stop.

330
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,650
Is Fascism of the work?

331
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:55,350
Agree

332
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,010
while it's sitting?

333
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,890
It's think it's fascism of the
worst time because it's an,

334
00:08:58,891 --> 00:09:00,600
it's a new kind of fascism,

335
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:01,470
you know,

336
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,190
it's,

337
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,410
it's partly generated by legislation.

338
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:04,741
So the,

339
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:08,940
like the title nine men memo that was
written in 2011 I recently got a copy of

340
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,870
that God damn thing.

341
00:09:09,871 --> 00:09:12,180
That was one polluting bit of legislation.

342
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:12,571
That was,

343
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:16,920
that memo basically told universities
that unless they set up a parallel court

344
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:17,281
system,

345
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:18,870
they were going to be
denied central funding.

346
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,180
It is absolutely unbelievable.

347
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,580
Incredible.

348
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:21,720
And,

349
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:21,881
and,

350
00:09:21,881 --> 00:09:22,790
and w in the law,

351
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,880
the leftists are supporting this.

352
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,421
I know,

353
00:09:25,421 --> 00:09:25,811
I know.

354
00:09:25,811 --> 00:09:26,431
It's just this,

355
00:09:26,431 --> 00:09:26,980
and this show is,

356
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,510
there is no authentic campus.

357
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,530
Leftism I'm sorry.

358
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:30,364
It's a fraud.

359
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,270
Okay.

360
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,530
You think the faculty should
be fighting the administration,

361
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,660
federal in federal regulation of,

362
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,870
of you know how we're
supposed to behave on camp?

363
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,310
Well,

364
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,310
how can you be so how can you be so naive
and foolish to think that taking on an

365
00:09:47,381 --> 00:09:48,970
organization like the university,

366
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:53,971
which already has plenty to do and you
sing it to become a pseudo legal system

367
00:09:55,991 --> 00:09:58,000
that parallels the legal system,

368
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,360
could possibly be anything
but utterly catastrophic.

369
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:04,630
It would mean you'd have
to know absolutely nothing
about the legal system and

370
00:10:04,631 --> 00:10:09,631
about the tremendous period of evolution
that produced what's actually a stellar

371
00:10:09,641 --> 00:10:13,780
system and an adversarial system that
protects the rights of the accused and of

372
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:15,220
the end of the victim.

373
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:20,110
And to replace that with
an ad hoc bureaucracy that
has pretty much essentially

374
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:23,200
the same degree of power as the court
system with absolutely none of the

375
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:24,490
training and none of the guarantees.

376
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:24,710
Yeah.

377
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:26,470
And won't get real cards or kangaroo.

378
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,110
That piece that I wrote about date rape,

379
00:10:29,111 --> 00:10:31,300
it was in January,

380
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,270
1991 a news day.

381
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:32,840
God,

382
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:35,410
whether the most controversial thing
I ever wrote in my entire career,

383
00:10:35,411 --> 00:10:36,610
I attack the entire thing.

384
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:40,090
And I demand of the college's standing
back and get out of the social wise with

385
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:40,750
the students.

386
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,440
So on and and people that will,

387
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:45,520
the abreaction people tried to recall
it and they called the president of the,

388
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,770
my university tried to get me fired.

389
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,090
You can believe the hysteria.

390
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:49,520
Okay.

391
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:49,810
All right.

392
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:50,581
I can believe it.

393
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:50,721
Yeah,

394
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:50,941
it,

395
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,120
yeah.

396
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,953
It won't cost them

397
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,820
anything and it went,

398
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:58,120
if anything that says to women,

399
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:58,630
okay,

400
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:03,630
but they should be responsible for their
own choices is regarded as reactionary.

401
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,770
Are they kidding me?

402
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:06,280
Okay.

403
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,070
This is such a betrayal of
authentic feminism in my view.

404
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,061
Well,

405
00:11:10,061 --> 00:11:12,970
it's the ultimate betrayal of
authentic feminism because it's,

406
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,310
it's an invitation of all the things
that you might be paranoid about with

407
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,560
regards to the patriarchy
back into your life.

408
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:20,950
Right.

409
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:25,540
It's an insistence that the most intrusive
part of the tie radical king come and

410
00:11:25,541 --> 00:11:28,810
take control over the most
intimate details of your life.

411
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,673
Incredible.

412
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,580
Incredible.

413
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,030
On the assumption is that that's going
to make your life better rather than

414
00:11:34,031 --> 00:11:34,480
worse.

415
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,930
Right.

416
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:35,930
In that dimension,

417
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,830
this idea of,

418
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:36,981
you know,

419
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:38,570
this is the stages of verbal consent.

420
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,110
As if,

421
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:41,690
as if your impulse is based in the body,

422
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:43,340
have anything to do with word,

423
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,650
right?

424
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,680
That's the whole point is,

425
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:45,831
you know,

426
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:47,860
you're allowed the case to abandon,

427
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:48,081
okay.

428
00:11:48,081 --> 00:11:52,280
That you know that part of the brain
that's so it traveled with words.

429
00:11:52,281 --> 00:11:53,410
I mean there's,

430
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,070
you see

431
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:58,540
these two actually a marker of lack
of social ability to have to do that.

432
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,130
Because if you're a sophisticated,

433
00:12:00,131 --> 00:12:01,960
it's normally like if
you're dancing with someone,

434
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:04,000
it's not like you call out the moves,

435
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,660
right?

436
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,680
If you have to do that,

437
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,514
well then you're,

438
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:06,911
you're,

439
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:07,241
you're,

440
00:12:07,241 --> 00:12:09,260
you're more worse than a neophyte,

441
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,581
right?

442
00:12:09,581 --> 00:12:13,300
You're an awkward Neil fight and anybody
with any sense should get the hell away

443
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:14,050
from you.

444
00:12:14,050 --> 00:12:17,770
And so if you're reduced to the point
where you have to verbally negotiate every

445
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:18,510
element of,

446
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,080
of intimate interaction,

447
00:12:20,081 --> 00:12:22,930
then what a Downer that he the ass.

448
00:12:22,931 --> 00:12:25,150
But what I want an unbelievably,

449
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,200
what would you call it?

450
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:30,070
Naive and pathological view of the
manner in which human beings interact.
