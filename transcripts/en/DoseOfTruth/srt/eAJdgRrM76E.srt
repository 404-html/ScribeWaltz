Richard zane

2
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,510
would love to hear about anxiety.

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:16,090
Well that's,

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,130
that's a rough thing to
have egg or a phobia.

5
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:23,131
So agoraphobic get increasingly isolated
and afraid of things outside of their

6
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,980
domain and familiarity.

7
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:31,420
And often what happens with Agora phobia
is that people who develop it or afraid

8
00:00:31,421 --> 00:00:32,254
of two things,

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,070
they're afraid that something is going
to go dreadfully wrong with their health,

10
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,880
especially with regards to their heart.

11
00:00:37,881 --> 00:00:41,200
So they start to become afraid that maybe
they'll have a heart attack and that

12
00:00:41,201 --> 00:00:42,310
they'll die in public,

13
00:00:42,311 --> 00:00:45,910
far from a hospital and that they'll
make a fool of themselves while they're

14
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:47,380
doing it or well they,

15
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,570
well they think they're dying.

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:53,590
So it's a combination of two fears and
one is fear of mortality and the other is

17
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:54,880
fear of social judgement.

18
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:58,150
And you might think about those as
the two main categories of fear that

19
00:00:58,151 --> 00:01:00,730
possessed people because
one is associated,

20
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:04,330
well obviously with mortality and
death and the other is associated with

21
00:01:04,331 --> 00:01:05,620
exclusion from the group,

22
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:08,230
which of course can lead
to mortality and death.

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,720
And so the agoraphobic is
the worst of both worlds.

24
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:14,110
It's often a disease of middle aged women.

25
00:01:14,111 --> 00:01:15,070
But not always.

26
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,580
And there are often people who've been
somewhat dependent in their previous

27
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,250
lives and then undergo
some traumatic event,

28
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,830
like a divorce or the
death of someone close.

29
00:01:23,831 --> 00:01:24,250
And,

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,750
and at the same time,

31
00:01:25,751 --> 00:01:29,560
our perhaps experiencing
heart palpitations that are
associated with menopause

32
00:01:29,561 --> 00:01:34,561
that brings ideas of mortality to mind
and that can trigger a panic attack,

33
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:36,510
which is very,

34
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,030
um,

35
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,863
what would you call it?

36
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,870
Unpleasant experience to say the least.

37
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,160
Um,

38
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,750
and then that fear of panic attack starts
making people avoid and that's when

39
00:01:46,751 --> 00:01:50,600
Agra phobia develops out of anxiety
disorders with panic attack.

40
00:01:50,601 --> 00:01:55,150
So you go out and maybe you go to a mall
and maybe you're in a crowd and maybe

41
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:56,170
you start thinking about,

42
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:56,861
well,

43
00:01:56,861 --> 00:01:59,890
your heartbeat and about the fact
that someone close to you is died.

44
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:03,820
And maybe then you become aware of your
heartbeat and you start to panic because

45
00:02:03,821 --> 00:02:08,821
you feel that maybe it's the beat is
irregular or or that or that you can't

46
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:11,020
detect it as well as you usually can.

47
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:14,290
And then that makes your heart
accelerate because it makes you afraid.

48
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:16,570
And then you get more more,

49
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,470
what would you call sensitive to that
and that makes your heart rate beat even

50
00:02:20,471 --> 00:02:21,011
faster.

51
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:21,910
And then you panic.

52
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,420
You want to get to the hospital to get
checked out to make sure that you're all

53
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:28,210
right and then you make
your fatal mistake,

54
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:32,740
which is that you avoid going back to
the mall and then you go to a grocery

55
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:35,860
store in the same thing happens and then
you start to avoid going to the grocery

56
00:02:35,861 --> 00:02:36,490
store.

57
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:41,350
Then you start avoid avoiding the subway
or taxis or crowds or anywhere you

58
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:43,930
might get trapped and wouldn't
be able to get to the hospital.

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,910
Soon you end up avoiding everything and
that's when your life really starts to

60
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:50,080
become a living hell.

61
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,470
So the basic way to treat egg or a phobia,

62
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,400
there's two ways.

63
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:57,460
One is to develop some
control of breathing,

64
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,290
to do progressive relaxation.

65
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,660
The way you do that is
that you start with your,

66
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,980
you start by concentrating on your
toes and your feet and your ankles,

67
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:07,870
and then your shins and your knees.

68
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:12,310
You move all the way up your body and
let the tension flow out of your muscles

69
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:17,311
and regulate your breathing calmly and
carefully so that you can learn to relax.

70
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,210
And then you go out,

71
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:24,760
you go out voluntarily and start to
confront the things you're afraid of.

72
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,630
So for example,

73
00:03:25,631 --> 00:03:26,710
if you're afraid of the mall,

74
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:30,790
maybe you go to the parking lot and you
look at the mall and then you walk close

75
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,530
to the door and you look inside,

76
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,101
you know,

77
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:35,320
and then you go home because
that's enough for one day.

78
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,960
But you do progressive exposure.

79
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:39,041
And that's the base.

80
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,340
One of the basic rules of psychotherapy
is that if you're afraid of something,

81
00:03:42,341 --> 00:03:45,520
you progressively and voluntarily
expose yourself to it.

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,360
And that generally it's the
voluntary exposure that's curative,

83
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:49,781
right?

84
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,700
Accidental exposure can make you worse,

85
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:54,010
but voluntary exposure can be curative.

86
00:03:54,011 --> 00:03:58,000
And that's sort of associated with
the myth of the hero and the Dragon.

87
00:03:58,450 --> 00:03:58,751
You know,

88
00:03:58,751 --> 00:04:02,500
the hero is the person who goes out
voluntarily to confront the dragon and

89
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,330
overcome it and get the treasurer.

90
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:08,110
And so if you voluntarily expose
yourself to things you're afraid of,

91
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,730
like no more than you can tolerate,

92
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:14,560
then you'll find that you get braver
and you learn that you can tolerate the

93
00:04:14,561 --> 00:04:16,890
fear and that can chase
the or phobia back.

94
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,230
And it's very important to
do it on a regular basis.

95
00:04:20,231 --> 00:04:21,830
And if you have agoraphobic,

96
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:25,690
a full fledged agoraphobic and you
should probably consult professional help

97
00:04:25,691 --> 00:04:28,150
because it's a very tricky
condition and it can be very,

98
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,950
can really impair you badly.

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,160
So that's what I would recommend.

100
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:35,930
Hi Jp.

101
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:39,410
I'm wondering how the computer program
that rates university courses as

102
00:04:39,411 --> 00:04:41,840
worthwhile or not is coming along well,

103
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,000
it isn't rating them as worthwhile.

104
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,560
It's rating them as postmodern,

105
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:48,380
Neil Marxist or not and it's
actually fully developed.

106
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,570
I was going to launch it and I didn't,

107
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,190
I didn't design it.

108
00:04:52,191 --> 00:04:52,460
Uh,

109
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,450
somebody volunteered to design it and
presented it to me and it seems to work

110
00:04:56,451 --> 00:04:57,284
very well.

111
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:57,890
Um,

112
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,700
I was going to launch it at the end of
August so that this year's university

113
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,080
students could benefit from it.

114
00:05:03,081 --> 00:05:07,820
But there was the Charlottesville event
and then I got busy and I also wasn't

115
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:12,110
feeling great and so I just didn't
hit the window of time properly.

116
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:17,140
But I hope to be able to launch it for
the January incoming class to do a video

117
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:20,030
about what's wrong with
the university system,

118
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,120
that many things that are wrong with
the university system and to launch the

119
00:05:23,121 --> 00:05:24,320
website at the same time.

120
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,160
Also had people suggest to me that maybe
it wasn't a good idea that it would

121
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,140
increase polarization,

122
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:32,960
but I've thought about that
for about a month and a half.

123
00:05:32,961 --> 00:05:35,240
And I think that the
benefit to the consumer,

124
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:39,460
so that would be the informed student
outweighs any danger of polarization.

125
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,370
And besides that,

126
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:43,670
something has to be done because the
situation in the universities is really

127
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:44,504
ridiculous.

128
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,793
So,

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:47,641
all right,

130
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,310
so let's see what else we've
got here in the chat room.

131
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,990
D.

132
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:56,990
V.

133
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:56,990
S.

134
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:56,990
S.

135
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:56,990
K.

136
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:56,990
H.

137
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:56,990
E.

138
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:57,823
R.

139
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,120
That's quite a mouthful.

140
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,770
Says I'm studying to be a teacher,

141
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:01,940
but I'm also an introvert.

142
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,470
Could this be a big problem?

143
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,540
Can I still be a successful teacher?

144
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:10,541
Actually what seems to predict success
of teaching best is intelligence and

145
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,650
conscientiousness.

146
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,150
That's the data so far.

147
00:06:14,151 --> 00:06:15,830
So if you're conscientious,

148
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,750
then you'll probably be fine.

149
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:22,190
I mean extra introverts have a harder
time speaking in front of groups,

150
00:06:22,191 --> 00:06:23,510
but you can learn to do that.

151
00:06:23,511 --> 00:06:23,721
You know,

152
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:26,870
an introvert can become a very
successful public speaker.

153
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,690
May Not enjoy it the same
way that an extrovert might,

154
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:32,210
but that doesn't mean that
you can't learn the skills.

155
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:36,320
And when I would recommend
for an introvert is the same
thing that I do when I'm

156
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,570
lecturing is I never
talked to the whole group.

157
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,090
You know,

158
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,580
it doesn't matter how big the crowd is,

159
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:44,780
I'm always picking out individuals in
the group and talking specifically to

160
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:45,050
them.

161
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,650
So I'll make a point to an individual
and I watched their face and see if

162
00:06:48,651 --> 00:06:50,180
they're nodding and understanding.

163
00:06:50,181 --> 00:06:50,451
Right?

164
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,170
Because that way you make contact with
the entire audience and then you know,

165
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,840
all talk to someone for
about 15 seconds or so.

166
00:06:56,841 --> 00:06:58,550
I don't want to put them
on the spot too much.

167
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,900
And then I shift my attention to someone
else and I sort of pinpoint around the

168
00:07:02,901 --> 00:07:06,350
room and that keeps everybody in
the room focused on what I'm saying,

169
00:07:06,351 --> 00:07:10,010
because each person reflects
the entire crowd back to you.

170
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:13,490
And so I would say if you're an introvert
or if you want to speak in public in

171
00:07:13,491 --> 00:07:14,090
general,

172
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,590
forget about the damn crowd.

173
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,970
It doesn't exist.

174
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,550
Speak to people one on one at a time.

175
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,410
And an introvert can do that just fine.

176
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,300
So you know,

177
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,320
that's where your strength would be.

178
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,540
And I would say you're,

179
00:07:26,541 --> 00:07:31,490
you're much more likely to be unsuccessful
as a teacher if you don't work hard

180
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:31,850
at it.

181
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,210
And if you're not interested in it.

182
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,310
So if you're an introvert,

183
00:07:34,311 --> 00:07:35,420
I wouldn't worry about that.

184
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,380
Um,

185
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,990
I don't think that that'll be the
biggest problem that you'll face.

186
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:40,580
So.
