1
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,040
The other thing that's interesting about
that is that what's happened is that

2
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:17,060
the people who have these
radical viewpoints have been
given a permanent sign it

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,150
cure right there,

4
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:23,690
there their state and tuition sponsored
activists who can spend every single

5
00:00:25,101 --> 00:00:30,101
moment of their time on what I would
consider their fifth call them agenda.

6
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,840
So we're basically funding a cohort of
people who stated purpose is to demolish

7
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:37,870
the patriarchy.

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:39,360
Um,

9
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,900
you know,

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,610
one of the things Carl Jung said,

11
00:00:41,611 --> 00:00:44,040
which I really liked and
haven't talked about that much,

12
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:49,041
is that the unconscious representation
of men in the female psyche,

13
00:00:49,431 --> 00:00:54,431
he called the animus and the animus was
always in his estimation because of the

14
00:00:54,971 --> 00:00:58,930
dream analysis he did and so forth
that that although the unconscious

15
00:00:58,931 --> 00:01:02,620
representation of a woman in a man's
psyche was an individual woman,

16
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:07,621
the unconscious representation of the
male psyche in the females unconscious was

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,130
men as a group.

18
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,800
And there's a very large number of women
and also some men whose conception of

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,470
male yes is,

20
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:24,400
has been damaged very badly by their
failure to establish any positive

21
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:27,520
relationship with any male whatsoever
in their developmental history.

22
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,320
And then they project this paranoid
representation of what constitutes

23
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:36,780
hierarchical masculinity onto
the world and then fight,

24
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,243
bring it down.

25
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,383
And,

26
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:41,840
and the thing is they're being successful.

27
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,970
That's the problem is this is,

28
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,730
this is another one when I was actually,

29
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:51,130
I know that you are very popular with the,

30
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,620
a lot of young men,

31
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:55,470
but I was actually introduced to you by a,

32
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:56,370
a mother too.

33
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,070
So professor in,

34
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,870
uh,

35
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,220
in education.

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,840
So she's really,

37
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,210
she's not in her,

38
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,840
uh,

39
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,021
at the,

40
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:04,710
at home,

41
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:05,311
so to speak,

42
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:06,650
ideologically or a,

43
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:07,891
but,

44
00:02:07,891 --> 00:02:08,724
uh,

45
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,650
one thing that's worrying me is,

46
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:14,623
okay,

47
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,740
there are certain,

48
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:22,100
certain parts of certain ideologies that
take on a religious overtones though.

49
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:28,320
And I think that feminism has
some of those characteristics.

50
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:28,581
I mean,

51
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,290
in Christian,

52
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:32,970
they were all born sinful and we need
to come to grips with our sinfulness.

53
00:02:32,971 --> 00:02:33,804
And in the end,

54
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:36,240
only God's grace and
forgiveness can redeem us.

55
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:37,074
And,

56
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,481
uh,

57
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:37,811
in,

58
00:02:37,811 --> 00:02:39,660
in Lutheranism at least a,

59
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,061
it's,

60
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:40,570
uh,

61
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:40,991
we don't,

62
00:02:40,991 --> 00:02:41,291
can,

63
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,570
we can be forgiven by priests is only God.

64
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,923
Yeah.

65
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:45,760
Doctrine.

66
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,593
There's no escape.

67
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,940
And I,

68
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,940
I totally sympathize with it even
though I don't in a lot of ways,

69
00:02:53,101 --> 00:02:53,371
but,

70
00:02:53,371 --> 00:02:53,700
um,

71
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:54,533
I realized,

72
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,770
uh,

73
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,740
but within feminist and the
sin is situated within instead,

74
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:00,663
so

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,320
not only with within males,

76
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:04,270
but within nails as a collective,

77
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,760
which has even seen,

78
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:09,550
the thing about the Christian doctrine
that you referred to is that it makes

79
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:12,100
each individual responsible
for their own darkness.

80
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,260
Now the Catholics say,

81
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:14,561
look,

82
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,530
that's unbearable and people need
to have the slate wiped clean.

83
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,390
Now in that and confessional do that,

84
00:03:19,391 --> 00:03:23,350
and there's an intermediary and
Yeoman considered that merciful.

85
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,080
And there's some real
power in that argument.

86
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:26,470
You know,

87
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,700
that the cynical argument is,

88
00:03:27,701 --> 00:03:27,971
well,

89
00:03:27,971 --> 00:03:31,780
you can just wipe the slate clean at
any time and you don't have to bear any

90
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:32,620
responsibility.

91
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:33,940
But I think that's cynical.

92
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:37,420
The Protestants put themselves in a
much tougher position because there's no

93
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,254
escape.

94
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,190
And,

95
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,930
but the upside of all of that is,

96
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,900
is that the darkness is
to be regarded as within,

97
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,853
not without.

98
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,140
And,

99
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,040
and as soon as you move away from that,

100
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,320
then while you're,

101
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,800
you're the good person.

102
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,170
And so is everyone that thinks like you.

103
00:03:53,171 --> 00:03:56,020
And all the evil is
wherever you want to put it.

104
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:56,940
And,

105
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,550
and then as soon as the thing
that's really dangerous about that,

106
00:04:00,551 --> 00:04:05,551
especially if the evil is conceptualized
as contemptible and parasitic and using

107
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,890
disgust related language,

108
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:09,551
for example,

109
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:11,080
instead of fear related language,

110
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,440
then the logical
directive is to purify it.

111
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,860
And boy,

112
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,903
that's,

113
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,740
that's not good.
