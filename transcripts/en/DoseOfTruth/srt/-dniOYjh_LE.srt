1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:12,050
So Jacob goes back to Israel and he's
terrified even though it's been 14

2
00:00:12,271 --> 00:00:14,370
years.
He thinks maybe his hotheaded brother

3
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:17,730
hasn't calmed down yet and he has good
reason to think that I would say

4
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,740
so he sends messengers to Isa who then
sets out with 400 men.

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,770
And so Jacob is not very happy with this
whole idea.

6
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,730
And he breaks his people into two bands
so that maybe half of them cannot be

7
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:36,030
killed.
And then he takes from his large flocks

8
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:40,440
a bunch of animals and a bunch of
servants and he sends them out to meet.

9
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:44,380
He saw basically to say look I'm I'm a
jerk.

10
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:47,880
Sorry about the whole birthright thing.
And.

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,440
And here some animals and you know maybe
maybe that's the beginnings of of an

12
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,220
apology.
It's something like that.

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,750
And so but he's not very convinced that
that's actually going to work.

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:06,530
But he saw who actually turns out to
perhaps have matured in the interim.

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,730
Perhaps that's one way of thinking about
it.

16
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,230
Meet Jacob and says that just seeing him
is enough.

17
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,530
But Jacob insists that he takes the gift
and so accepts and which is probably a

18
00:01:19,801 --> 00:01:24,801
wise thing because even if you saw is
ninety five percent convinced that just

19
00:01:25,261 --> 00:01:28,740
seeing his brother is enough there's
probably five percent of them that still

20
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:32,580
really not all that happy.
And so you have to be careful.

21
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,900
You know when you say that you forgive
someone because there might be a part of

22
00:01:36,901 --> 00:01:40,380
you that really doesn't that really need
something else before you can actually

23
00:01:40,381 --> 00:01:45,381
say OK look fight you know and you don't
want to fool yourself about that because

24
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:50,990
that 5 percent that hasn't been
completely convinced will find its voice

25
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:55,370
at some point and then maybe undermine
the whole reconciliation process.

26
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,060
You don't want to think that you're any
better than you are any nicer than you

27
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:02,610
are it's not helpful.
And so you saw as smart.

28
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:07,430
I think so while Jacob smart to say no
no like thanks a lot but take the damn

29
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:12,431
goats.
And Jacob and Esau a smart enough to

30
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:16,640
accept that and he might do that maybe
to you know

31
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,780
to please Jacob but also I think so that
there really is the possibility of

32
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:26,470
establishing peace because
hypothetically the gift that's being

33
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:31,471
offered is of sufficient magnitude to
erase the debt of the loss of the

34
00:02:31,661 --> 00:02:34,080
Birthright.
It's something like that right it's it's

35
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,980
it's it's the payment of the real debt.
And

36
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Jesus said what I mean is that by all
this drove which I met and Jacob said

37
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:48,490
these are to find grace in the sight of
my lord.

38
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,650
And he so says I have enough brother
Keep thou keep that that thou hast unto

39
00:02:53,651 --> 00:02:58,651
thyself
and Jacob said this is interesting

40
00:03:03,961 --> 00:03:08,961
statement I think no I pray you if I
have now found grace in nice sight take

41
00:03:09,361 --> 00:03:14,361
the present at my hand for therefore I
have seen thy face as though I had seen

42
00:03:14,371 --> 00:03:17,160
the face of God and now was pleased with
me.

43
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:22,670
And so that's so he's he's taking the.
Honourable judgment of his brother

44
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:28,080
because it is honorable because he saw
did get betrayed so he has a right to be

45
00:03:28,081 --> 00:03:33,081
standing in judgment and he equates that
judgment with with what would you say

46
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:40,251
with the highest of virtues it's
appropriate judgment and so he wants to

47
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,080
make complete amends to ease so as if he
saw as a representative of the divine

48
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:51,380
element of justice and
I guess that's convincing to you so it's

49
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:56,200
quite a thing to say.
You know that I need to be reconciled to

50
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,050
you because that would simultaneously
reconcile me with God.

51
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,080
It's like it's crucial.
This is between us.

52
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:04,860
But it's there's a higher principle at
stake that's vital.

53
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:08,920
And I think that is the case with
betrayal that's very frequently the case

54
00:04:08,921 --> 00:04:13,390
because if you betray someone you really
have violated you've deeply violated

55
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
what can only be called a sacred trust.

56
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,340
It's the right terminology for that.
Take it.

57
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:23,200
I pray the my blessing that is brought
to the because God has dealt graciously

58
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:28,201
with me and because I have enough and he
urged him and he took it so you know

59
00:04:28,871 --> 00:04:32,980
this story seems to be something like
Well Jacob was

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,260
kind of an arrogant crooked deceitful
character maybe over impressed with his

61
00:04:40,261 --> 00:04:43,170
own ability he thought it was pretty
amusing to pull.

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,480
A fast trick or two on his brother.
Then he ran off which is not all that

63
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,900
brave.
And then he got walloped a lot and

64
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,410
perhaps learned something.
And then when he came back you know he

65
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,400
was a different person.

66
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,940
And so that's a
that's a reasonable story.

67
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:08,010
And you know he he has to repent
completely of about what he did before

68
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:14,740
he can rectify the situation properly
and he's willing to do that.

69
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:20,890
So that's an interesting idea too
because it's it's it's an early

70
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:25,891
reflection of the idea that it is if you
do something wrong in the past a that

71
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:27,610
you can learn from it.
Right.

72
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,630
So that you're actually capable of
learning and b that you can set the.

73
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:36,700
Balance right in the present.
Those are very optimistic ideas you know

74
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:41,701
because you might say well once you've
committed some sort of crime that's it

75
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,310
there's no hope for you but that's
pretty rough because the probability

76
00:05:45,311 --> 00:05:49,960
that you've done unethical things at
some point in your life is 100 percent.

77
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:55,290
And so if there was no way of setting
the balance right after that then

78
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,280
everybody would be doomed.
