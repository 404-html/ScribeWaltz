1
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,740
And sexual selection is no joke.

2
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,930
It could be the primary thing.

3
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:13,660
It's certainly one of the primary
things that's driven human evolution.

4
00:00:13,661 --> 00:00:14,750
And I think you can say that

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:21,100
you think about the environment again,

6
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,570
let's think about the environment.

7
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,680
So you have a dominance hierarchy
and that's really an old structure.

8
00:00:26,681 --> 00:00:31,120
The dominance is harkeys 300 million
years old because it emerged pretty much

9
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:32,050
whenever there was,

10
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:33,640
whenever there was a nervous system,

11
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:34,780
emergent nervous system,

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,510
and whenever animals had
occupied the same territory,

13
00:00:37,511 --> 00:00:40,840
they automatically organize themselves
into something approximating a dominance

14
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:41,171
hierarchy.

15
00:00:41,171 --> 00:00:42,460
So it's a very,

16
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:42,851
very,

17
00:00:42,851 --> 00:00:43,241
very,

18
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:44,470
very old structure.

19
00:00:44,471 --> 00:00:45,820
It's older than trees,

20
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,530
it's older than flowers,

21
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,820
it's old.

22
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,850
And as far as real goes,

23
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,140
from a Darwinian sense,

24
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,270
permanent is real.

25
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,920
And so when you,

26
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:57,401
you can say,

27
00:00:57,401 --> 00:00:57,671
well,

28
00:00:57,671 --> 00:00:57,911
you know,

29
00:00:57,911 --> 00:01:01,010
our burial ancestors adapted
themselves to treats.

30
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:03,060
And so the tree was a long,

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,950
around long enough to be a
feature of the environment.

32
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,400
But the dominance hierarchy has
been around a lot longer than trees.

33
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,090
And you can think of the dominance
hierarchy both as an adaptation to the

34
00:01:13,091 --> 00:01:13,840
environment,

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,140
because you'd kind of think about the
dominant Turkey has a cultural construct,

36
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,080
but if a cultural construct
lasts long enough,

37
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,910
then it becomes part of the environment.

38
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:24,550
And so the dominant Turkey's
part of the environment.

39
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,160
And what seems to happen roughly speaking,

40
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,360
and this is an oversimplification,

41
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,531
but we'll go with it,

42
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:34,531
is that males have a dominance hierarchy
and there's a relatively small number

43
00:01:36,101 --> 00:01:38,320
of males that are relatively successful.

44
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,360
And those successful males have
preferential access to female reproductive

45
00:01:43,361 --> 00:01:44,170
capacity,

46
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,430
either because of the females actively
choose the more dominant males,

47
00:01:48,431 --> 00:01:49,091
which is very,

48
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:49,924
very common.

49
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:54,640
Or because the more dominant males chase
all the less dominant males away so

50
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:57,700
that even if the females
don't exercise choice,

51
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:58,750
which they often do,

52
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,960
then the only males left around that can
serve as reasonable mating partners are

53
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,030
the more powerful ones.

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,160
And so you think you got to really
radical determiners of evolution as a

55
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:13,390
consequence of that one?

56
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:14,224
Is that

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,953
each,

58
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,220
I'm not talking about female
dominance hierarchies at the moment,

59
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,720
but I can talk about that.

60
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:22,790
But that's why this is
an oversimplification,

61
00:02:22,791 --> 00:02:27,620
but what happens is that
the males obviously are
selected for their ability to

62
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:31,370
move up dominance hierarchies obviously
because the ones that are at the top of

63
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:33,950
the dominance hierarchy
reproduce preferentially.

64
00:02:33,951 --> 00:02:38,840
And so that means the male dominance
hierarchy becomes a method of selection.

65
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,050
But then allied with that is the female
proclivity for choice on whatever

66
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:47,750
dimension the dominance
hierarchy happens to be arranged.

67
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:52,751
And so then female sexual selection also
becomes a radical nonrandom selector

68
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,090
of,

69
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:56,720
of,

70
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,680
of what,

71
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,460
what genetic material is to
move into the next generation.

72
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,570
And so I,

73
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:06,340
I fail to see how any of that can be
separated from the emergence of complex

74
00:03:06,341 --> 00:03:10,120
nervous systems and mind over the course
of evolution because people aren't,

75
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,550
creatures aren't making random choices,

76
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,050
they're not random at all.

77
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,920
So we even notice it.

78
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,930
Such things like managing
the Peacock's tail,

79
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:21,000
you know,

80
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,090
and it's covered with eyes,

81
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:25,300
which is quite interesting because eyes
of course attract attention and lots of

82
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,230
animals have evolved.

83
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,450
I light markings like Moss,

84
00:03:28,451 --> 00:03:30,340
there's moss that when
they unfold their wings,

85
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:31,870
they have two big eyes
on the back of them.

86
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,310
And that's to keep birds from eating them.

87
00:03:33,311 --> 00:03:33,491
Right?

88
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,290
Cause the birds don't
like being stared at.

89
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,730
So they stay away from the moths.

90
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:39,500
But so a peacock's tail
is nothing but eyes.

91
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,820
And so it's very attractive and it
shimmers and there's something about it

92
00:03:42,821 --> 00:03:43,481
that's beautiful,

93
00:03:43,481 --> 00:03:47,230
which is quite interesting to the females
have obviously been selecting the male

94
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,120
peacock peacocks for beauty.

95
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:52,330
They have this insane tail while so they,

96
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,770
evolutionary biologists have thought,

97
00:03:53,771 --> 00:03:56,830
well what possible utility
could that tail be?

98
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:00,730
Is it just maybe the females
got fixated on tail so to speak.

99
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,020
And you know,

100
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,280
you got a Baldwin effect loop going there
and the male peacocks just got bigger

101
00:04:06,281 --> 00:04:08,710
and bigger tales and it's just
like an evolutionary dead end.

102
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:08,951
It's,

103
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:09,221
you know,

104
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:12,250
it's a positive feedback list
system that's gone out of control.

105
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,500
But they have done things that
like look at the symmetry and,

106
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:17,220
and,

107
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,370
and breadth say,

108
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:23,371
or the symmetry and size and overall
quality of the male peacock's tail as a

109
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,180
marker for physical health.

110
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:27,370
So reduce parasite load for example.

111
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:31,000
And it does turn out that the healthier
male peacocks have better tail display.

112
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,281
And so the way,

113
00:04:32,281 --> 00:04:36,970
what the females seem to be doing is using
some marker or some set of markers as

114
00:04:36,971 --> 00:04:38,710
a proxy indicator for,

115
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:39,873
for,

116
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:40,773
for health.

117
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,010
And I think,

118
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:43,780
I think you could say with,

119
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,130
with reasonable,

120
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:49,690
you could say reasonable that reasonably
that female human beings do the same

121
00:04:49,691 --> 00:04:50,890
thing to male human beings.

122
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,960
And there's some of that vice versa too.

123
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:54,070
Like we evaluate each other,

124
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:54,641
for example,

125
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:55,301
for symmetry,

126
00:04:55,301 --> 00:04:58,930
which is one of the elements of beauty
because healthier people tend to be more

127
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,450
symmetrical and lots of
animals use symmetry.

128
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,900
Butterflies if butterflies won't
mate with another butterfly,

129
00:05:04,901 --> 00:05:07,450
if it deviates from symmetry
by the tiniest amounts,

130
00:05:07,451 --> 00:05:08,284
you can imagine.

131
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,410
So symmetry is a marker and there's other
markers like shoulder width to waste

132
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,140
with his wanton waste,

133
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,450
with to hip with this is another,

134
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:19,630
that's usually what males use
that to evaluate females in park.

135
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,460
So there's lots of markers of health.

136
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,643
Um,

137
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,970
but it also looks to me like the,

138
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,210
the,

139
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,670
the data worldwide seems
to indicate that women,

140
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,560
so managing that women May to
cross dominance hierarchies and up

141
00:05:32,561 --> 00:05:35,740
socioeconomically speaking and
on average across cultures,

142
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,140
women go for men who are about
four to five years older.

143
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:38,441
You know,

144
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,190
it varies.

145
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,530
In the Scandinavian countries
that's shrunk a little bit,

146
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:42,550
but not that much.

147
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,290
And in other cultures it's bigger.

148
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:48,280
I would say that depends to some degree
on difficulty of establishing economic

149
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:49,114
independence,

150
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:49,661
right?

151
00:05:49,661 --> 00:05:52,780
Because in richer countries it's easier
to have enough economic independence if

152
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:57,740
you're a male to B to B are useful
participant in the process of having

153
00:05:57,741 --> 00:05:58,574
children.

154
00:05:58,670 --> 00:05:59,503
Um,

155
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,490
but it doesn't matter cross culturally,

156
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:04,250
it's still across an op where
man mate across and down,

157
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:06,560
they don't care much about
socioeconomic status.

158
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,380
It doesn't seem to be part
of their selection method.

159
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,340
Um,

160
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,300
generally speaking.

161
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,153
So,

162
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:19,090
so I think that part of that is also
that the ability of women to select for

163
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,241
male health,

164
00:06:20,241 --> 00:06:23,090
it's something like that
because it isn't the only that,

165
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:24,800
because if you're healthy and energetic,

166
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,010
you're much more likely to be successful
because it's very hard to be successful

167
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,731
if you're ill,

168
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:29,450
obviously.

169
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,230
I mean,

170
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:32,570
so because the competition
is just too high.

171
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,411
And both,

172
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:34,250
both genders,

173
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:36,440
both sexes select each
other for attractiveness,

174
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:37,730
both select for intelligence,

175
00:06:37,731 --> 00:06:39,650
both at select for personality,

176
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,270
although the different,

177
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:44,300
there are differences there in
terms of what's what stressed.

178
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,310
But so,

179
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:46,910
so,

180
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,850
so I think you can derive a couple
of things out of out of this.

181
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,920
And this is where I think
people are different than,

182
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,151
than other animals.

183
00:06:53,151 --> 00:06:54,530
Importantly different is that,

184
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,940
so you imagine that there's
tremendous selection pressure to,

185
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,620
uh,

186
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,000
towards the production,

187
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,290
let's say of man who are good at climbing
male dominance hierarchies or climbing

188
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,910
the male dominance hierarchy.

189
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:11,660
But the thing that's so interesting
about people is that we've multiplied our

190
00:07:11,661 --> 00:07:12,800
dominance hierarchies.

191
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:13,641
You know,

192
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,970
if you take an animal that's got a
rather static behavioral pattern,

193
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:18,680
then there's,

194
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,970
there's the single hierarchy.

195
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Elephant seals are a good example of that.

196
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,640
So elephant seals,

197
00:07:22,641 --> 00:07:24,190
the males are absolutely massive.

198
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:24,801
They're way,

199
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:26,120
way bigger than the females.

200
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,760
And they basically have
harems roughly speaking,

201
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,060
and they use physical prowess as
their marker of status essentially.

202
00:07:34,401 --> 00:07:37,580
And obviously size is a huge part of
that because otherwise the male elephant

203
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,870
seals wouldn't be as,

204
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:39,831
they're massive.

205
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:41,870
These things are absolutely enormous.

206
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,800
And so it's just power slash health,

207
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,160
you know,

208
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,060
maybe aggression,

209
00:07:47,061 --> 00:07:47,894
something like that.

210
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,340
It's whatever makes them more um,

211
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,820
suitable for the kind of physical
combat that elephant seals engage it.

212
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,253
So,

213
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,440
and the degree to which
power is associated with
dominance status in those sorts

214
00:08:03,081 --> 00:08:07,580
of situations seems to be associated
with the size differential between males

215
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,414
and females.

216
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,800
So the more power is an issue
with regards to male competence,

217
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:16,400
the larger the bales are compared to the
females and the more likely the males

218
00:08:16,401 --> 00:08:18,680
are going to have a harem
relationship with the females.

219
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,980
And you see that a little bit in human
beings because men are bigger than women.

220
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,260
They're not overwhelmingly bigger.

221
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:25,520
That's sexual dimorphism.

222
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,151
And you know,

223
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:28,070
there's some men that are
smaller than some women,

224
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:29,880
but on average men are tolerant there.

225
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,880
They have more upper body
strength and so forth.

226
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:34,430
So there is a power element
to male competition,

227
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:38,700
but it's not as extended as it
would be among animals say like,

228
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,800
like elephant seals.

229
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:45,100
So in the elephant seal you see maybe
there's one stable set of traits that's

230
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:49,220
being selected for that makes the
males more likely to reproduce.

231
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,181
But human beings,

232
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:54,230
we're very weird creatures because
we're so conceptually flexible.

233
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:55,680
And so what seems to have happened,

234
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,100
maybe we started males started selecting
each other for don in dominance

235
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:05,760
competitions for something like cognitive
flexibility and conscientiousness.

236
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,750
It's something like that.

237
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:11,610
So that would be the ability to abstractly
represent the world and then the

238
00:09:11,611 --> 00:09:15,960
ability operate effectively within it
to represent yourself socially in a way.

239
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,230
And then to carry through with that
because that enables people to trust you.

240
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,880
So it's something like that.

241
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,720
And so that produced cortical expansion
and then women were selecting men who

242
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:29,430
are good at that and not
produce cortical expansion.

243
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:33,390
And then there's an arms race
between women and men with regards to

244
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:33,991
intelligence.

245
00:09:33,991 --> 00:09:37,620
So the women kept up or
they certainly kept up with,

246
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,040
with,

247
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,560
with intelligence as,

248
00:09:39,561 --> 00:09:41,880
as the evolutionary cycle continued.

249
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:47,630
But one of the consequences of selection
for cortical expansion and increased

250
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:54,270
cognitive flexibility was that the number
of dominance hierarchies that human

251
00:09:54,271 --> 00:09:56,100
beings could produce started to multiply,

252
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:56,761
right?

253
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:59,100
Because there's all sorts of
ways that you can be successful.

254
00:09:59,430 --> 00:09:59,940
There's,

255
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,880
you think about how many ways you can
be successful in a modern culture,

256
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,080
and you can be successful in dimensions
that aren't even associated with each

257
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:07,680
other.

258
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,130
So you can be successful socially that
that's what an extrovert would do.

259
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,890
You could be successful in
terms of intimate relationships.

260
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,140
That's what a agreeable person would do.

261
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,830
A disagreeable person would be more
successful with regards to competition.

262
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,230
A person who is high in
neuroticism would be,

263
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,220
would be tried to protect themselves and
to establish some sort of security and

264
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:28,410
open person would be
looking for a flexible,

265
00:10:28,411 --> 00:10:29,550
creative environment.

266
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,680
And so there's this multiplicity of,

267
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:37,200
of ways that you can establish a dominance
hierarchy and be successful in it.

268
00:10:37,201 --> 00:10:38,070
And if you're creative,

269
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,080
you can come up with your
own damn dominance hierarchy,

270
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,760
which is exactly what you're doing.

271
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:42,511
If you're creative,

272
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:42,790
right?

273
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,040
You,

274
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,290
you spin up a game that's
your game and then you,

275
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,400
you make the rules.

276
00:10:47,401 --> 00:10:49,930
And that's hard because if you
make a new game with new rule,

277
00:10:49,931 --> 00:10:51,180
if it's hard to monetize it,

278
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:53,970
but you can be the best
at playing that game.

279
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,540
And so that's a huge advantage to
being creative if you can pull it off.

280
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,831
So then you think,

281
00:10:58,831 --> 00:10:58,981
well,

282
00:10:58,981 --> 00:11:03,981
what's happened among human beings is
the multiplication of the set of possible

283
00:11:04,471 --> 00:11:05,520
dominance hierarchies.

284
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:06,930
So it's become very broad.

285
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:08,070
And then you could say,

286
00:11:08,071 --> 00:11:08,251
well,

287
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:08,611
what's,

288
00:11:08,611 --> 00:11:12,210
what's driving selection now is the
ability to be successful across multiple

289
00:11:12,211 --> 00:11:13,560
sets of dominance hierarchies.

290
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,590
And that account's at least in
part for our cognitive flexibility.

291
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,720
And so that's really
what a human being is.

292
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:23,520
A human being is a creature that has high
potential for succeeding across a very

293
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:26,190
wide range of potential
human dominance hierarchies.

294
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,520
And so that gives us our
transformative psyche.

295
00:11:29,521 --> 00:11:30,450
That's the niche,

296
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:34,230
that's the niche that we've
both produced and occupy.

297
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,760
And I think it's out of that,

298
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,990
that hero mythology emerges fundamentally
because I think what the hero is,

299
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:44,550
the mythological hero is a representation
of that part of the psyche that's

300
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:48,570
particularly good at being successful
across sets of dominance hierarchies.
