1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:00,933
Right,

2
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,190
and was promoted and not liking it
because I have to adjust massively.

3
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:14,340
Is there a difference between liking
your job and the lack of discipline to

4
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:15,660
perform a change?
Are there,

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,370
are they connected?
Yeah.

6
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,550
While they're definitely connected.
It's a tough one.

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,520
Um,
the first thing I would say is that if

8
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,890
it was a real radical change,
you know,

9
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:28,530
it takes people,
unless they're very young,

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,670
it takes people about a year to adjust
to a really radical change,

11
00:00:32,671 --> 00:00:35,790
like to move to a new city,
to,

12
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,210
to adjust to being married.
That can take longer than a year to

13
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:44,211
adjust to having a new baby to,
to getting over a relatively serious

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,030
loss,
like a death in the family a year,

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,020
you know?
And so the first thing you might ask

16
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:55,050
yourself is,
are there things that are good about the

17
00:00:55,051 --> 00:00:56,730
promotion?
The second is,

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,740
do you have the capacity to do the job
or to learn how to do it?

19
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,610
You could talk to someone about that.
And then the third thing is have you

20
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:09,210
given yourself enough time to adjust?
Because one of the things I often

21
00:01:09,211 --> 00:01:11,430
recommend to people when they've made a
radical change,

22
00:01:11,431 --> 00:01:13,880
like going leaving home and going to
universities,

23
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,780
don't pay any attention to how you feel
for a year because everything is so much

24
00:01:18,781 --> 00:01:21,540
up in the air that you can't really
trust your own judgment.

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:25,440
So you have to give yourself time to
adapt and um,

26
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,120
you can't expect that that's going to
happen overnight.

27
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:29,340
It,
it's certainly not.

28
00:01:29,341 --> 00:01:32,790
And to put that expectation on yourself
increases the probability that you're

29
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,960
going to feel bad about it.
