1
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:13.880
<v Speaker 1>diversity is actually necessary because people differ in intelligence and the</v>

3
00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>different temperament and the different skills and so you actually need</v>

4
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>diversity cause otherwise you can't take advantage of all those differences.</v>

5
00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.060
<v Speaker 1>So you need diversity but you need genuine diversity and like what would genuine</v>

6
00:00:27.881 --> 00:00:28.720
<v Speaker 1>diversity mean?</v>

7
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.430
<v Speaker 1>If you're trying to put together a work team,</v>

8
00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 1>you want enough,</v>

9
00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.450
<v Speaker 1>you want people of sufficient diversity so that they more or less so that you</v>

10
00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 1>gathered together the appropriate talents to produce the implement that's</v>

11
00:00:41.021 --> 00:00:43.180
<v Speaker 1>necessary to work properly in the world.</v>

12
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a competence marker cause otherwise your business is going to fail.</v>

13
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.940
<v Speaker 1>And so the proper diversity with regards to employment is that diversity that</v>

14
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>meets the requirements of the business essentially.</v>

15
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's why you try to hire people carefully and not randomly,</v>

16
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:03.974
<v Speaker 1>let's say</v>

17
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 2>third error,</v>

18
00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.911
<v Speaker 2>first errors.</v>

19
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:10.744
<v Speaker 2>There's</v>

20
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>only a finite number of valid interpretations.</v>

21
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Second error is that um,</v>

22
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>there aren't real differences between groups of people,</v>

23
00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>but there's more difference within the groups then between them.</v>

24
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 2>Third differences,</v>

25
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>social status and payment,</v>

26
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Speaker 1>especially in a free democratic capitalist society is based more on competence</v>

27
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:31.114
<v Speaker 1>than on</v>

28
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.193
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

29
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.130
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

30
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 1>we would say that when a person in a hierarchy starts to act like their position</v>

31
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.470
<v Speaker 1>entitles them to power,</v>

32
00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.590
<v Speaker 1>then that hierarchy has become corrupt.</v>

33
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Weinstein is a good example of that.</v>

34
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:49.401
<v Speaker 1>I'm serious.</v>

35
00:01:49.401 --> 00:01:52.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like he acts acted like a tyrant.</v>

36
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.480
<v Speaker 1>What happened to him?</v>

37
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

38
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>Not good for him.</v>

39
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.580
<v Speaker 1>What he did was not good,</v>

40
00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's an indication it's revealed.</v>

41
00:02:01.581 --> 00:02:04.640
<v Speaker 1>It's an indication that that misuse,</v>

42
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.200
<v Speaker 1>so he's competent,</v>

43
00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.681
<v Speaker 1>fine.</v>

44
00:02:06.681 --> 00:02:11.240
<v Speaker 1>He gets to have position because we need people who are competent,</v>

45
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean you get to turn into a tyrant.</v>

46
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 1>If you turn into a tyrant,</v>

47
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>then that overshadows your competence and you go.</v>

48
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the definition of a functioning state and our state essentially</v>

49
00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 1>functions.</v>

50
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:24.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not perfect,</v>

51
00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.903
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>

52
00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 2>but compared to what?</v>

53
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the issue compared to your hypothetical Marxist Utopia.</v>

54
00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.671
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:36.370
<v Speaker 1>compared to your hypothetical Marxist Utopia,</v>

56
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're living in Auschwitz,</v>

57
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.010
<v Speaker 1>but your what?</v>

58
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.080
<v Speaker 1>Your actual Marxist utopia is indistinguishable from Auschwitz,</v>

59
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>so we're not listening to that comparison.</v>

60
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.400
<v Speaker 1>We're going to take a look at what we have and we're going to compare it to</v>

61
00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.880
<v Speaker 1>other places that actually existed in time and geographically and by those</v>

62
00:02:57.101 --> 00:02:57.934
<v Speaker 1>criteria.</v>

63
00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:58.600
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

64
00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.433
<v Speaker 1>is there another,</v>

65
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>you'd rather live,</v>

66
00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.921
<v Speaker 1>do another place.</v>

67
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:03.581
<v Speaker 1>You'd rather live,</v>

68
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean a real place in a real time,</v>

69
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>and you want to live back in 1895 even in the western world where the average</v>

70
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>person lived on less than a dollar a day.</v>

71
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>In today's money,</v>

72
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.220
<v Speaker 1>you want to live like those coal miners.</v>

73
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like the answer to that's no.</v>

74
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:19.150
<v Speaker 1>If you have any sense,</v>

75
00:03:19.151 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 1>you should have some gratitude.</v>

76
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.580
<v Speaker 1>That's another problem with the postmodern neo Marxists like zero,</v>

77
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.631
<v Speaker 1>zero,</v>

78
00:03:25.631 --> 00:03:26.980
<v Speaker 1>zero gratitude.</v>

79
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

80
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.560
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

81
00:03:29.561 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm more pressed.</v>

82
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're oppressed,</v>

83
00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 1>but you're not oppressed by the Patriarchy for God's sake.</v>

84
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

85
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>so you have status in a hierarchy.</v>

86
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.231
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

87
00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:43.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

88
00:03:43.351 --> 00:03:46.920
<v Speaker 1>that's like a reward to your s you're a high status person.</v>

89
00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:47.581
<v Speaker 1>It's a reward.</v>

90
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:49.290
<v Speaker 1>The reward should be shared equally.</v>

91
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like a badge of merit that you get.</v>

92
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.470
<v Speaker 1>It's a privilege.</v>

93
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.400
<v Speaker 1>It's not the reason that in a capitalist society,</v>

94
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.520
<v Speaker 1>filthy selfish capitalists put you in a position so they can extract maximum</v>

95
00:04:01.951 --> 00:04:03.300
<v Speaker 1>productivity from you.</v>

96
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly why you're there.</v>

97
00:04:05.581 --> 00:04:06.450
<v Speaker 1>You get paid,</v>

98
00:04:06.451 --> 00:04:07.021
<v Speaker 1>you get paid.</v>

99
00:04:07.021 --> 00:04:08.070
<v Speaker 1>So you keep working.</v>

100
00:04:08.071 --> 00:04:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Why do we want you to work?</v>

101
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.620
<v Speaker 1>Because your work is actually valuable to us and so we're going to pay you so</v>

102
00:04:13.621 --> 00:04:14.610
<v Speaker 1>you don't quit.</v>

103
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not a reward because you're a good guy.</v>

104
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not a privilege.</v>

105
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 1>That's not what it is.</v>

106
00:04:19.951 --> 00:04:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't hand those things out like merit badges.</v>

107
00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:23.670
<v Speaker 1>That's not how it works.</v>

108
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.370
<v Speaker 1>This society is set up on selfish principles.</v>

109
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:30.600
<v Speaker 1>We paid people who are competence so they won't stop striving cause we want what</v>

110
00:04:30.601 --> 00:04:31.620
<v Speaker 1>they can produce.</v>

111
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.050
<v Speaker 1>So you don't just distribute that like,</v>

112
00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.520
<v Speaker 1>like it's a gift.</v>

113
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.600
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gift.</v>

114
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gift at all.</v>

115
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.780
<v Speaker 1>So that's another place where they're wrong.</v>

116
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Social Status and payment is the consequence of the selfish desire of</v>

117
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>individuals and the group to extract resources of intellect,</v>

118
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:49.591
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>

119
00:04:49.591 --> 00:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>and industriousness from those who possess them in excess.</v>

120
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.321
<v Speaker 1>Now of course,</v>

121
00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:57.060
<v Speaker 1>it's not 100% like that.</v>

122
00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.370
<v Speaker 1>There's the incompetent people who rise to the top.</v>

123
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.910
<v Speaker 1>You can fool people and you can manipulate them and you can act like a tyrant.</v>

124
00:05:02.911 --> 00:05:03.481
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

125
00:05:03.481 --> 00:05:08.481
<v Speaker 1>we might say maybe the system is like 30% warp to something like that.</v>

126
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not much more than that because we can account for people's success across</v>

127
00:05:12.391 --> 00:05:15.270
<v Speaker 1>life by looking at their individual differences,</v>

128
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:16.021
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

129
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:16.461
<v Speaker 1>comp,</v>

130
00:05:16.461 --> 00:05:17.460
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

131
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.750
<v Speaker 1>emotional stability,</v>

132
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.770
<v Speaker 1>creativity.</v>

133
00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 1>We can do a pretty good job of predicting their trajectory.</v>

134
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.870
<v Speaker 1>So there's error,</v>

135
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.920
<v Speaker 1>some of its health,</v>

136
00:05:25.921 --> 00:05:26.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

137
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes you've got what you need,</v>

138
00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:31.200
<v Speaker 1>but you get cut off at the knees or your family members do or you know,</v>

139
00:05:31.201 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>some tragic thing befalls you the,</v>

140
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.870
<v Speaker 1>there's a randomness in the system that accounts for a fair bit of it.</v>

141
00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.820
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a certain amount of corruption.</v>

142
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough.</v>

143
00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.490
<v Speaker 1>But not so much that the lights go off.</v>
