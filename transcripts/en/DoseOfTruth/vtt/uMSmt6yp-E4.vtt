00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Last question.</v>

2
00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.603
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.361
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

4
00:00:12.361 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Also for continuing the electric series.</v>

5
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>I haven't listened to all of the lectures,</v>

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like you focus very much on the appeal of the biblical stories to</v>

7
00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:23.040
<v Speaker 1>the individual psychology.</v>

8
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any thoughts on the relative importance of crowd psychology to the</v>

9
00:00:27.871 --> 00:00:28.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>appeal instinct?</v>

11
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.120
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

12
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.260
<v Speaker 1>the Bible and also the,</v>

13
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.920
<v Speaker 1>the reason why the Bible or the biblical stories took precedence over other,</v>

14
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>ideologies which could have taken its place.</v>

16
00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.801
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

17
00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:39.951
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

18
00:00:39.951 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 2>let's go to the second one first.</v>

19
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the same thing that happens when someone,</v>

20
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

21
00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Both creates an edits,</v>

22
00:00:54.371 --> 00:00:55.480
<v Speaker 2>a great movie.</v>

23
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

24
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 2>It's no one knows,</v>

25
00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

26
00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 2>imagine how many choices are they're in a great movie.</v>

27
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 2>Let's say it's an animated movie because absolutely everything in an animated</v>

28
00:01:04.851 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 2>movie is constructed.</v>

29
00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.853
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>

30
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.701
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

31
00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 2>God only knows how many choices.</v>

32
00:01:09.411 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe there's millions of choices,</v>

33
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.741
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

34
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:17.741
<v Speaker 2>and each choice is guided by some intuition of narrative suitability or beauty</v>

35
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:22.400
<v Speaker 2>or there's some higher ideal motivating it,</v>

36
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.330
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

37
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.950
<v Speaker 2>The desire to produce a masterpiece.</v>

38
00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's it.</v>

39
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 2>That was certainly the case with the Disney movies,</v>

40
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:28.604
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

41
00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:33.730
<v Speaker 2>And so that that aspiration then then makes the decisions.</v>

42
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say,</v>

43
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:40.811
<v Speaker 2>well something like that guided the writing and the selection of the stories in,</v>

44
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 2>in the biblical Canon now</v>

45
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 2>could have there been other stories included while the Catholics and the</v>

46
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Protestants don't have the same biblical tradition and neither do the Jews and</v>

47
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:52.231
<v Speaker 2>the Christians.</v>

48
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 2>And so it isn't exactly clear what to make of that,</v>

49
00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

50
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a can in some sense to the discussion we just had about Islam and</v>

51
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:01.734
<v Speaker 2>Christianity.</v>

52
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.883
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

53
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.100
<v Speaker 2>in some sense I've left that aside,</v>

54
00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 2>that specific question except in so far as I've just answered because I'm trying</v>

55
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 2>to take what we have,</v>

56
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Speaker 2>which I know is that the root of our culture and to figure out what it is that</v>

57
00:02:18.301 --> 00:02:19.134
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>

58
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.090
<v Speaker 2>why it is that we have it.</v>

59
00:02:21.091 --> 00:02:21.924
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

60
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

61
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Well I've made some attempt to explain that in the manner that I just described,</v>

62
00:02:27.571 --> 00:02:29.610
<v Speaker 2>but I don't have a final answer.</v>

63
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Like could it have been different?</v>

64
00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.070
<v Speaker 2>It could have been different at some levels,</v>

65
00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:37.180
<v Speaker 2>but the same at others.</v>

66
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.051
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

67
00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:38.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that's the scholars of comparative religion who haven't been</v>

69
00:02:42.641 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 2>infected fatally with postmodernism have definitely realized so young,</v>

70
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:47.801
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

71
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:50.980
<v Speaker 2>in Elliott and people who are interested in grand narratives,</v>

72
00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.580
<v Speaker 2>one of the things they pointed out quite clearly is that there's,</v>

73
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.090
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

74
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 2>there's a set of common mythological themes across many,</v>

75
00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>and I tried to outline that in maps of meaning.</v>

76
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 2>And that worked out quite nicely for me at least as far as I was concerned</v>

77
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.930
<v Speaker 2>because once I had the basic archetipal structure mapped out,</v>

78
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 2>it opened up all sorts of stories to me from all sorts of different cultures.</v>

79
00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.750
<v Speaker 2>And that's been unbelievably useful.</v>

80
00:03:13.751 --> 00:03:15.850
<v Speaker 2>Like the Mesopotamian story of it,</v>

81
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:16.910
<v Speaker 2>the Enuma Elish when,</v>

82
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 2>when I figured out what that meant as far as I was concerned,</v>

83
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 2>like I've never forgotten that.</v>

84
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 2>It just seared itself into my memory.</v>

85
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 2>And the same with the Egyptian stories and you know,</v>

86
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 2>some Buddhist writing said,</v>

87
00:03:28.121 --> 00:03:28.960
<v Speaker 2>I've read it in some,</v>

88
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 2>the Tao Te Ching is also very powerful.</v>

89
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.760
<v Speaker 2>So I think that things can be different on one level and that same metta</v>

90
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

91
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.370
<v Speaker 2>but that humanity kind of coalesces on what's the same over a reasonable period</v>

92
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 2>of time because there isn't that many ways that human beings can live properly</v>

93
00:03:45.581 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 2>as individuals and as groups together.</v>

94
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this constant force that makes our ethical presuppositions</v>

95
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 2>converge and then that's automatically expressed in the stories.</v>

96
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.290
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that now.</v>

97
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>It's an imperfect process and it's full of error.</v>

98
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.153
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

99
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.823
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

100
00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.320
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

101
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.193
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

102
00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:14.630
<v Speaker 2>one announcement,</v>

103
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:15.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.400
<v Speaker 2>well two announcements.</v>

105
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.830
<v Speaker 2>The next lecture I believe is November 14th,</v>

106
00:04:18.831 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 2>so I'll hopefully finish off the story of Jacob,</v>

107
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.153
<v Speaker 2>looks like it.</v>

108
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm also appearing on a panel with Gad Saad and or an amateur Jay on</v>

109
00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:32.240
<v Speaker 2>November 11th and there's still quite a few tickets available for that.</v>

110
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:33.260
<v Speaker 2>So if you're interested,</v>

111
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 2>you could go to my website and pick up those tickets.</v>

112
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.033
<v Speaker 2>It should be,</v>

113
00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.731
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

114
00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:38.990
<v Speaker 2>hopefully it'll be interesting.</v>

115
00:04:38.991 --> 00:04:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I think it will be and it might be too interesting.</v>

116
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.640
<v Speaker 2>That's one possibility.</v>

117
00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:45.740
<v Speaker 2>So we'll see.</v>

118
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.350
<v Speaker 2>But I'm going to do two more of these this year,</v>

119
00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.700
<v Speaker 2>and I hope I get through the story of Joseph and then I can start in the new</v>

120
00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:53.930
<v Speaker 2>year with the exodus.</v>

121
00:04:53.931 --> 00:04:56.000
<v Speaker 2>And that's a story that I know quite well.</v>

122
00:04:56.001 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Speaker 2>And the exodus and Leviticus.</v>

123
00:04:58.191 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 2>And what's the one after that?</v>

124
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.830
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

125
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.220
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

126
00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.790
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

127
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:02.450
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

128
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.810
<v Speaker 2>so I'm very much looking forward to that because that is one killer story</v>

129
00:05:05.811 --> 00:05:06.111
<v Speaker 2>mountain,</v>

130
00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:06.860
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

131
00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.590
<v Speaker 2>and I've got some surprises for that as well.</v>

132
00:05:09.591 --> 00:05:10.424
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>

133
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.350
<v Speaker 2>so thank you very much for coming.</v>

134
00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:12.711
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

135
00:05:12.711 --> 00:05:12.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

136
00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.520
<v Speaker 2>hopefully we'll see you November for</v>

137
00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 3>14.</v>
