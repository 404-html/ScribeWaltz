<v Speaker 1>Eric says,</v>

2
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>apologies to the weird question.</v>

3
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever performed a ritual sacrifice?</v>

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.863
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:17.363
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

6
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And it is a weird question,</v>

7
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>although I can understand why you would ask it.</v>

8
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>I have performed psychological sacrifices,</v>

9
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:30.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:35.311
<v Speaker 1>I suppose when I decided to give up something that I needed to give up so that I</v>

11
00:00:35.381 --> 00:00:36.910
<v Speaker 1>could move forward into the future.</v>

12
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

13
00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>That certainly happened when I quit smoking and when I more or less quit</v>

14
00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:42.011
<v Speaker 1>drinking,</v>

15
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>I still have a drink from time to time now,</v>

16
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 1>but I quit for 20 years and that was a sacrifice.</v>

17
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.170
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't continue to drink again.</v>

18
00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I said I was from northern Alberta.</v>

19
00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>It was pretty hard drinking culture and I really liked alcohol,</v>

20
00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:59.041
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't drink and write and do my phd and manage my family</v>

21
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities.</v>

22
00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>It was too much.</v>

23
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.670
<v Speaker 1>And so I stopped and that was a good thing.</v>

24
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>So that was a sacrifice.</v>
