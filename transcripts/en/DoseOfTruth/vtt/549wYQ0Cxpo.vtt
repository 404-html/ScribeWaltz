1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.110
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what's possible and you're not as much as you could be.</v>

2
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>And so God only knows what you could,</v>

3
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>what you could do and have and give if you sacrificed everything to it.</v>

4
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reason that Abraham is constantly making sacrifices.</v>

5
00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.001
<v Speaker 1>It's archaic,</v>

6
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:18.181
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:18.181 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>He's burning up like baby lambs,</v>

8
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:21.234
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

9
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

10
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:22.470
<v Speaker 1>they're alive.</v>

11
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.711
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:22.711 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>that's something and they're valuable.</v>

13
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And that's something it's,</v>

14
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>you have to admit,</v>

15
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.130
<v Speaker 1>even if you think about it as a modern person,</v>

16
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.370
<v Speaker 1>that the act of sacrificing something might have some dramatic compulsion to it.</v>

17
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:34.861
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

18
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>to go out into a flock and to take something that's newborn and to cut its</v>

19
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:40.170
<v Speaker 1>throat into bleed it into burn.</v>

20
00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:44.340
<v Speaker 1>It might be a way of indicating to yourself that you're actually serious about</v>

21
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:45.174
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

22
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.050
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't so obvious that we have rituals of seriousness like that now.</v>

23
00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 1>And so it's not so obvious that we're actually serious about anything.</v>

24
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe that's not such a good thing.</v>

25
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe we shouldn't be thinking that these people were so archaic and</v>

26
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>primitive and superstitious.</v>

27
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that they knew something that we don't.</v>

28
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>And certainly in the Abrahamic stories,</v>

29
00:01:04.111 --> 00:01:08.000
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that maintains Abraham's covenant with God is continually</v>

30
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>willingness to sacrifice it.</v>

31
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It's so that sacrificial issue is so important because you are not committed to</v>

32
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:16.260
<v Speaker 1>something unless you're willing to sacrifice for it.</v>

33
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Commitment and sacrifice are the same thing and I think it's,</v>

34
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>it borders on miraculous that those concepts are embedded into this narrative at</v>

35
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>the level of dramatic action.</v>

36
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.370
<v Speaker 1>instead of abstract explanation,</v>

38
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.600
<v Speaker 1>people are acting this out and the,</v>

39
00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>and the fundamental conception is so profound that it's really quite,</v>

40
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>it's quite are inspiring.</v>

41
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.490
<v Speaker 1>It's breathtaking really.</v>

42
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>When you understand what message is trying to be conveyed,</v>

43
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.750
<v Speaker 1>you have to make sacrifices and what do you have to sacrifice?</v>

44
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.990
<v Speaker 1>You have to sacrifice that which is most valuable to you currently that stopping</v>

45
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>you and God only knows what that is.</v>

46
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly the worst of you.</v>

47
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly that and god only knows to what degree you're in love with the</v>

48
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>worst of you so</v>

49
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>so you moved from the unbearable present to the ideal future and,</v>

51
00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>and you can't help that.</v>

52
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>You have to live in a structure like that,</v>

53
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:11.941
<v Speaker 1>that's your house.</v>

54
00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of thinking about it.</v>

55
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to get your house in order,</v>

56
00:02:15.151 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Speaker 1>and if you want it to be a place that you can live properly,</v>

57
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:22.230
<v Speaker 1>then you have to plan the future.</v>

58
00:02:22.231 --> 00:02:24.570
<v Speaker 1>That is perfect.</v>

59
00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.281
<v Speaker 1>And then I think,</v>

60
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:27.114
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

61
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

62
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>It means it's good for you.</v>

63
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.261
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

64
00:02:31.261 --> 00:02:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that I,</v>

65
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

66
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I do all the time with my clinical and consulting clients is try to figure out</v>

67
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>what would be good for them.</v>

68
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.260
<v Speaker 1>But we do more than that.</v>

69
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:40.801
<v Speaker 1>We try to think,</v>

70
00:02:40.801 --> 00:02:41.041
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

71
00:02:41.041 --> 00:02:41.401
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

72
00:02:41.401 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>how can we set this up so it's really good for you?</v>

73
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.700
<v Speaker 1>And that all of the side consequences of that are things that are good for other</v>

74
00:02:47.701 --> 00:02:48.534
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

75
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Speaker 1>And so because people are often also timid about trying to get something that's</v>

76
00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>good for themselves because they feel that it's selfish or that they don't</v>

77
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:56.004
<v Speaker 1>deserve it.</v>

78
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.060
<v Speaker 1>So we set it up so that,</v>

79
00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:57.751
<v Speaker 1>well look,</v>

80
00:02:57.751 --> 00:03:02.560
<v Speaker 1>we're going to set it up so that it's plainly obvious that this will not harm</v>

81
00:03:02.561 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>the structure of the universe.</v>

82
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>For you to have what you need and to do it in a way that's of benefit to other</v>

83
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

84
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>There's no downside to that.</v>

85
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>And so it's okay.</v>

86
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>It's okay if you reach out and take that.</v>

87
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that's interesting about the biblical stories,</v>

88
00:03:17.891 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Abrahamic stories as well,</v>

89
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:23.290
<v Speaker 1>is that God doesn't really seem to be opposed to this success of the people that</v>

90
00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:24.190
<v Speaker 1>he's chosen.</v>

91
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

92
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:26.180
<v Speaker 1>what happens to them as,</v>

93
00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 1>as they progress through their journey,</v>

94
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.610
<v Speaker 1>as they get larger flocks and they,</v>

95
00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>they get more authority and they,</v>

96
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>they get,</v>

97
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 1>they get more,</v>

98
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.530
<v Speaker 1>they get life more abundant.</v>

99
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

100
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It's God isn't,</v>

101
00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.790
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to be a miser in the old testament.</v>

102
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you put in the effort and you,</v>

103
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>and you accept the covenant and you make the sacrifices,</v>

104
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:49.660
<v Speaker 1>then you get to be successful and maybe successful beyond your wildest dreams.</v>

105
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 1>And that that's actually seems to be okay with God.</v>

106
00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>And that's pretty cool given that you know,</v>

107
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:59.740
<v Speaker 1>that that general notion of Old Testament God is that all he's doing is casting</v>

108
00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:01.360
<v Speaker 1>out curses and death,</v>

109
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.631
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:03.100
<v Speaker 1>wherever he happens to wander.</v>

111
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>And I mean there's certainly no shortage of that,</v>

112
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.303
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

113
00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.510
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

114
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be that that's very good news and that you also don't have to be</v>

115
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>perfect in order for to have that happen.</v>

116
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing,</v>

117
00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>this is the issue about going into the unknown.</v>

118
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.524
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

119
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.831
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

120
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:22.390
<v Speaker 1>if you leave your country and your kin and your father's house and you go out</v>

121
00:04:22.391 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>into a land that your intuition guides you to,</v>

122
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.630
<v Speaker 1>you're going to undergo these radical transformations.</v>

123
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:30.870
<v Speaker 1>This is a sacrificial transformation too because you're,</v>

124
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 1>you're moving forthrightly and voluntarily into chaos,</v>

125
00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:35.081
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's the same as the dragon fight.</v>

127
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:37.780
<v Speaker 1>That's the hero of the story.</v>

128
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And what will happen there is that you will transform yourself.</v>

129
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:46.561
<v Speaker 1>And so the call to an ideal is also the call to a sequence of deaths and</v>

130
00:04:46.961 --> 00:04:49.930
<v Speaker 1>rebirths that move you closer and closer to the ideal.</v>

131
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.973
<v Speaker 1>And that's what,</v>

132
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>that's what God is calling Abraham to do.</v>

133
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 1>In the first sentence of this story.</v>
