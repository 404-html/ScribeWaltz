1
00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Hmm,</v>

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.840
<v Speaker 1>I would like to move onto discussing</v>
<v Speaker 1>myths.</v>

3
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>This is so interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would just say one more thing</v>

4
00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you talk to these people about how we</v>

6
00:00:17.821 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>can reconstruct homosexuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>can you send,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you send them to a straight camp?</v>

8
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean all of them would say that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible,</v>

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>but if you ask about how can you</v>
<v Speaker 1>deconstruct and then reconstruct boys</v>

10
00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>and their masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them are aboard.</v>

11
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.380
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's,</v>

13
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.830
<v Speaker 1>it's a very inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:41.831 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I complained about</v>

15
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>last year with regards to this build cc</v>
<v Speaker 1>see legislation in Canada,</v>

16
00:00:48.461 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

17
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.970
<v Speaker 1>you're instantiating a social</v>
<v Speaker 1>constructionist view of gender,</v>

18
00:00:55.971 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>gender,</v>
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>

19
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.110
<v Speaker 1>sexual proclivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things into the law.</v>

20
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's socially constructed.</v>

21
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wake up.</v>

22
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.890
<v Speaker 1>The Conservatives who have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>opposing homosexuality for the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred years have used nothing but</v>

24
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>social constructionist arguments.</v>

25
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.650
<v Speaker 1>They basically say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:01:16.651 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>if it's socially constructed or an</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual choice,</v>

27
00:01:19.831 --> 00:01:20.611
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

28
00:01:20.611 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 1>now it's stantiating into Canadian law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then why the hell can't you just be</v>

29
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:28.610
<v Speaker 1>reeducated out of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or just drop it if it's just an</v>

30
00:01:28.611 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 1>individual choice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.750
<v Speaker 1>I tried to say you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

32
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>you're playing with fire the fire that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will consume you.</v>

33
00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

34
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody,</v>

35
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.730
<v Speaker 1>nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

36
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These arguments are,</v>

37
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>these arguments are subtle and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're not easy to follow.</v>

38
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.560
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the problem is,</v>

39
00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>is that the consequences of producing</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation like that unfold over</v>

40
00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not minutes.</v>

41
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know.</v>

42
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Did you see what happened at Wilfrid</v>
<v Speaker 1>laurier university in Canada last week,</v>

43
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.170
<v Speaker 1>two weeks ago?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lindsay Shepherd.</v>

44
00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Does that ring a bell?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I listened to the conversation.</v>

45
00:02:12.391 --> 00:02:13.960
<v Speaker 1>She recorded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.840
<v Speaker 1>So in Canada now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three things are happening.</v>

47
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.740
<v Speaker 1>The first is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that I predicted this</v>

48
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>and that the only reason my reputation</v>
<v Speaker 1>was ever let's say tarnished,</v>

49
00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.120
<v Speaker 1>was because I predicted that this was</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to happen.</v>

50
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I'm still being vilified by people who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

51
00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.530
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are admitting nonetheless,</v>

52
00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:37.230
<v Speaker 1>that what happened at Wilford Laurey was</v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible.</v>

53
00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing.</v>

54
00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.630
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laurie,</v>

55
00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.940
<v Speaker 1>who used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who accused Lynsay of breaking the</v>

56
00:02:45.941 --> 00:02:50.740
<v Speaker 1>Canadian federal and provincial laws are</v>
<v Speaker 1>being accused of misinterpreting those</v>

57
00:02:50.741 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they aren't as far as I'm</v>

58
00:02:52.821 --> 00:02:55.640
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that enables people to save face.</v>

59
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.710
<v Speaker 1>And third and most a fair number of</v>
<v Speaker 1>faculty members and public commentators</v>

60
00:03:04.301 --> 00:03:07.630
<v Speaker 1>are claiming that Ramboo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kana and pim lot and Joel,</v>

61
00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 1>who were the interlocutors in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>inquisition are the true victims,</v>

62
00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>but really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh absolutely.</v>

63
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>Because now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that people have been.</v>

64
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

65
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:22.000
<v Speaker 1>they were only standing up for trans</v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and second,</v>

66
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.050
<v Speaker 1>well because they've been the target of</v>
<v Speaker 1>substantial criticism,</v>

67
00:03:26.051 --> 00:03:30.280
<v Speaker 1>let's say like overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing,</v>

68
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.490
<v Speaker 1>brutal criticism on ending for weeks</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're that they're now victims</v>

69
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 1>because that's just not fair.</v>

70
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.890
<v Speaker 1>And so when the president could Wilfrid</v>
<v Speaker 1>laurier university apologized to lynsay</v>

71
00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:46.690
<v Speaker 1>shepherd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she also said,</v>

72
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also feel,</v>

73
00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I also feel that what has happened to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the faculty members in the aftermath of</v>

74
00:03:53.081 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>this faculty members and administrators</v>
<v Speaker 1>was also raw.</v>

75
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.270
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that typical thing.</v>

76
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see this when kids get bullied in</v>

77
00:04:01.301 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>schools.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is that the idiot</v>

78
00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.610
<v Speaker 1>interveners and they're and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind.</v>

79
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Humanitarian impulse is bringing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bully and the victim into the</v>

80
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 1>principal's office to discuss it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming equal,</v>

81
00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.080
<v Speaker 1>equal causal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

82
00:04:20.081 --> 00:04:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Responsibility on the part of the victim</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the perpetrator,</v>

83
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>and they think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 1>if they just had a nice talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then</v>

85
00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 1>we could be settled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not understanding at all that the bully</v>

86
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say one of these,</v>

87
00:04:34.271 --> 00:04:37.750
<v Speaker 1>one in 100 Predator types,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to stand on the outside</v>

88
00:04:37.751 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>of the school ground and wait for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>victim to come by and just pound the</v>

89
00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>hell out of him because that's how</v>
<v Speaker 1>bullies work.</v>

90
00:04:44.441 --> 00:04:44.981
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

91
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:46.870
<v Speaker 1>we could settle it like reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

92
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

93
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're so God damn naive that you know,</v>

94
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>if evil ever popped out and made a face</v>
<v Speaker 1>at you,</v>

95
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:56.760
<v Speaker 1>which would likely will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd be scared into posttraumatic</v>

96
00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 1>stress disorders so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't know what hit you.</v>

97
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that plenty of times in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical practice.</v>
