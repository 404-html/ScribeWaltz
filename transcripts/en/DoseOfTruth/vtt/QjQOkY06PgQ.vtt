00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Direct stake asks,</v>

2
00:00:07.681 --> 00:00:10.740
<v Speaker 1>how do you see love arrows in your general world view?</v>

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>We're just love to come see you guys.</v>

4
00:00:14.191 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>See asking possibly hard questions.</v>

5
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>Well I think that truth has to be embodied inside love or embedded inside love.</v>

6
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.383
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy to figure out a hierarchy and failures of ultimate values.</v>

8
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>There was great,</v>

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.400
<v Speaker 1>the great traditional values of the good and the beautiful and the true,</v>

10
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.550
<v Speaker 1>let's say the courageous and that sort of thing.</v>

11
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:43.551
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy to figure out how you arrange those hierarchically,</v>

12
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me that truth is likely something that serves a master of one</v>

13
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.114
<v Speaker 1>form or another,</v>

14
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.980
<v Speaker 1>at least ethical truth.</v>

15
00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:57.981
<v Speaker 1>And love is something like the decision that being is fundamentally good or it's</v>

16
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>the decision to act as if being is fundamentally good.</v>

17
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>That might be the right way of thinking about it.</v>

18
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.160
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

19
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.910
<v Speaker 1>I thought about this in relationship to my son when he was little,</v>

20
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.520
<v Speaker 1>three years old and like unbearably cute.</v>

21
00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

22
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:14.930
<v Speaker 1>Three year olds,</v>

23
00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.420
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

24
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.740
<v Speaker 1>they're fairly easily hurt.</v>

25
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're quite robust in some ways,</v>

26
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>but they're fairly easily hurt.</v>

27
00:01:19.621 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 1>They can run out into traffic and you know,</v>

28
00:01:22.351 --> 00:01:26.000
<v Speaker 1>they skinned their knees and they bang heads on tables,</v>

29
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>they're prone to emotional breakdown and they have all these extreme fragility.</v>

31
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that make you nervous?</v>

32
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.543
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

33
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>and alert and attentive as an adult.</v>

34
00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>But that also expose you directly to the,</v>

35
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>to the fact of the potential tragedy of life.</v>

36
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure as,</v>

37
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the reasons why having children matures you in,</v>

38
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>in a way that nothing else can.</v>

39
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:54.541
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

40
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:55.470
<v Speaker 1>I imagined,</v>

41
00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>I've written about this in my new book,</v>

42
00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>12 rules for life.</v>

43
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.470
<v Speaker 1>I imagined that I could remove his vulnerabilities one by one so that he</v>

44
00:02:03.811 --> 00:02:04.650
<v Speaker 1>couldn't be hurt.</v>

45
00:02:04.651 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

46
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.993
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.750
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

48
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.583
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.240
<v Speaker 1>I could make them into a robot.</v>

50
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 1>It was 15 feet tall and made out of metal and,</v>

51
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>and that would remove his physical vulnerability to have tremendous strength.</v>

52
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:18.871
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

53
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you could turn them into something like a superhero with all these,</v>

54
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.170
<v Speaker 1>with all these strengths instead of these exceptional vulnerabilities.</v>

55
00:02:28.171 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>But what I realized very rapidly was that every time you removed a</v>

56
00:02:32.431 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>vulnerability,</v>

57
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.270
<v Speaker 1>you removed and essential part of the person,</v>

58
00:02:36.271 --> 00:02:36.511
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

59
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 1>A part that you really love because with a little three year old boy kid for</v>

60
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:41.604
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

61
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.593
<v Speaker 1>mean it's there,</v>

62
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.943
<v Speaker 1>it's there,</v>

63
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:45.680
<v Speaker 1>it's their fragility.</v>

64
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.200
<v Speaker 1>In some sense that's a huge part of their charm and appeal.</v>

65
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you'd wish it on them,</v>

66
00:02:50.791 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

67
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>it's part of their,</v>

68
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 1>it's part of their value as being,</v>

69
00:02:54.521 --> 00:02:57.120
<v Speaker 1>and I think that reflects something like the,</v>

70
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>this paradoxical situation that the Dow was referred to win when they,</v>

71
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.480
<v Speaker 1>in the Dell teaching,</v>

72
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>they talk about the what makes a plot valuable is the empty space inside it.</v>

73
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.600
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

74
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.031
<v Speaker 1>it's what,</v>

75
00:03:10.031 --> 00:03:15.031
<v Speaker 1>it's not as much as what it is that makes it well actual first of all real but</v>

76
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:16.990
<v Speaker 1>also useful.</v>

77
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.991
<v Speaker 1>And there's something really profound about that in the limitations.</v>

78
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.260
<v Speaker 1>I would say limitation is the precondition for being,</v>

79
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 1>and it's really,</v>

80
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.001
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

81
00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.620
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to get this rate so that you can follow it because it's,</v>

82
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most useful thoughts I think that has ever occurred to me.</v>

83
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.910
<v Speaker 1>The first is that</v>

84
00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 1>limits are a precondition for being just like rules are preconditioned for a</v>

85
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:43.121
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

86
00:03:43.121 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't play a game where you can make any move at any time.</v>

87
00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>You have to narrow the playing field's substantially and you have put</v>

88
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>restrictions on what can be done in order for anything to be done.</v>

89
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe being is this paradoxical state where there's,</v>

90
00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.580
<v Speaker 1>there's just enough limitation to maximize possibility,</v>

91
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

92
00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.380
<v Speaker 1>And that seems right to me why that would be.</v>

93
00:04:08.381 --> 00:04:09.191
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea.</v>

94
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:11.470
<v Speaker 1>But maybe that's something like an answer to why,</v>

95
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.330
<v Speaker 1>why there's anything,</v>

96
00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.661
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

97
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:18.590
<v Speaker 1>why anything was created or I know I'm speaking metaphysically but,</v>

98
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>but I still think it's worthwhile doing so and then well if,</v>

99
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

100
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:30.030
<v Speaker 1>if limitation is the precondition for being then then that that introduced the</v>

101
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>suffering into the world and tragedy because of course suffering and tragedy or</v>

102
00:04:34.001 --> 00:04:35.470
<v Speaker 1>consequence of limitation.</v>

103
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.360
<v Speaker 1>And so then the situation is that if you want to have the being where</v>

104
00:04:40.361 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>possibility is maximized,</v>

105
00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to accept the limitations that produce tragedy.</v>

106
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>And so that's maybe the justification for tragedy.</v>

107
00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Assuming that such a thing needs to be justified.</v>

108
00:04:51.431 --> 00:04:56.431
<v Speaker 1>And then the final thought in that three part series as well,</v>

109
00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a way to live so that the tragedy that's an intrinsic part of</v>

110
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>limited being becomes bearable or becomes even something like celebrate a</v>

111
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 1>bubble.</v>

112
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that would be akin to niches.</v>

113
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.263
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

114
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>wish for the eternal return,</v>

115
00:05:11.171 --> 00:05:14.690
<v Speaker 1>like he thought you should live so that if every moment that you lived re</v>

116
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 1>recurred eternally,</v>

117
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>that that would be a good thing.</v>

118
00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.080
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a heroic motive being,</v>

119
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 1>it's conceivable that a heroic mode of being that requires the adoption of</v>

120
00:05:25.091 --> 00:05:29.470
<v Speaker 1>responsibility gives your life sufficient gravitas and weight and meaning.</v>

121
00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.010
<v Speaker 1>So that the tragedy of being can be withstood without becoming corrupt.</v>

122
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.680
<v Speaker 1>And I would certainly hope that that would be the case.</v>

123
00:05:38.681 --> 00:05:41.650
<v Speaker 1>And I think there's some reasons to assume that it might be.</v>
