1
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:07.811
<v Speaker 1>And they say,</v>

2
00:00:07.811 --> 00:00:08.380
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3
00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:08.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.790
<v Speaker 1>we're in real trouble unless someone goes out there and confronts tire Matt</v>

5
00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Straight on,</v>

6
00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>she's going to wipe everything out.</v>

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a dangerous and terrifying job,</v>

8
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.290
<v Speaker 1>but somebody has to do it.</v>

9
00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:20.981
<v Speaker 1>And Mark says,</v>

10
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:21.160
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

11
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.941
<v Speaker 1>that's no problem,</v>

12
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:24.910
<v Speaker 1>but I got a few rules here and this is the first rule.</v>

13
00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

14
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm in charge from here on forward.</v>

15
00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean exactly?</v>

16
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.503
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

17
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>these archaic stories,</v>

18
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:40.911
<v Speaker 1>our policy in our policy policymakers in Northrup fries terminology,</v>

19
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:45.330
<v Speaker 1>and what that means is that they can be read validly at multiple levels of</v>

20
00:00:45.331 --> 00:00:47.010
<v Speaker 1>analysis simultaneously.</v>

21
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>And so one thing it means is that if you take the two year old child who's</v>

22
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>essentially under the dominion of assorted primordial Gods and Goddesses,</v>

23
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Aggression,</v>

25
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>fear,</v>

26
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:01.793
<v Speaker 1>panic,</v>

27
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>and according to Freud,</v>

28
00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.770
<v Speaker 1>a certain degree of sexual aggression,</v>

29
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>the child moves from domination,</v>

30
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.260
<v Speaker 1>from motivated state to domination for motivated state.</v>

31
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:17.580
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't until the age of three and four when under the pressure applied by</v>

32
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 1>the social world.</v>

33
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of the maturation of the prefrontal Cortex,</v>

34
00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.680
<v Speaker 1>which matures throughout childhood and adolescence,</v>

35
00:01:25.681 --> 00:01:29.640
<v Speaker 1>and doesn't reach its final form until perhaps into the early twenties,</v>

36
00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>all of those fundamental motivational force to start taking on a structured</v>

37
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>relationship to one another,</v>

38
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that once your,</v>

39
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>as your personality becomes integrated,</v>

40
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>a single motive force forward has to bring all of these underlying motivational</v>

41
00:01:48.091 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>systems into some sort of harmonious arrangement.</v>

42
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.001
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

43
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:51.610
<v Speaker 1>so let's,</v>

44
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.580
<v Speaker 1>let's see what the Sumerians are doing here.</v>

45
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:53.821
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:54.361
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

47
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:54.800
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

48
00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>they're doing psychology.</v>

49
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to figure out,</v>

50
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>given the dominion of the elder gods,</v>

51
00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>the indisputable dominion of the elder gods instincts.</v>

52
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.850
<v Speaker 1>Who should rule,</v>

53
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>What should be in charge,</v>

55
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>how do you construct the hierarchy of values?</v>

56
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>And then more complex.</v>

57
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:13.764
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>

58
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.630
<v Speaker 1>when you integrate a state,</v>

59
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>which is what the Mesopotamians did,</v>

60
00:02:18.091 --> 00:02:18.331
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>The first great civilization.</v>

62
00:02:19.801 --> 00:02:20.634
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

63
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.820
<v Speaker 1>The first time hundreds of tribes were hammered into some sort of stable,</v>

64
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical order.</v>

65
00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.850
<v Speaker 1>How do you represent that order?</v>

66
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>So Marta gets his act together.</v>

67
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.580
<v Speaker 1>The gods all meet in a huge chamber.</v>

68
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>They elect him king and then they prepare them for battle.</v>

69
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>When the gods of the father's beheld the power of his word,</v>

70
00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>they were glad and didn't homage saying Martin is king.</v>

71
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.120
<v Speaker 1>They bestowed upon them a sceptre,</v>

72
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.841
<v Speaker 1>a throne,</v>

73
00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:52.890
<v Speaker 1>and a royal robe.</v>

74
00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.120
<v Speaker 1>They gave him an irresistible weapons,</v>

75
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>fighting the enemy saying,</v>

76
00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Golan cut off the life of tire.</v>

77
00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Matt.</v>

78
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>May the winds carry her blood out of the way.</v>

79
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Places after the gods.</v>

80
00:03:03.461 --> 00:03:05.980
<v Speaker 1>His father's had determined the destiny of Marduk.</v>

81
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.551
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>

82
00:03:06.551 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm on the road the way to success and attainment,</v>

83
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.160
<v Speaker 1>so then he goes to the heart of darkness,</v>

84
00:03:14.161 --> 00:03:14.881
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

85
00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:15.800
<v Speaker 1>and confronts tire.</v>

86
00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Matt accuses her of treachery and challenges are to battle.</v>

87
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.290
<v Speaker 1>When Tom had heard this,</v>

88
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:25.050
<v Speaker 1>she became like one in a frenzy and lost her reason.</v>

89
00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.010
<v Speaker 1>She cried out loud and furiously to the very roots or two legs,</v>

90
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:30.180
<v Speaker 1>shook back and forth.</v>

91
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.050
<v Speaker 1>She recited an incantation repeatedly casting her spell.</v>

92
00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.880
<v Speaker 1>As for the gods of battle,</v>

93
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.910
<v Speaker 1>they sharpened their weapons Tiamat and Marduk the wisest of the gods advanced</v>

94
00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:42.000
<v Speaker 1>against one another.</v>

95
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>They pressed onto single combat and approached for battle.</v>

96
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.251
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

97
00:03:47.251 --> 00:03:49.280
<v Speaker 1>well things don't go out so well with time.</v>

98
00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Matt,</v>

99
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 1>from this point forward,</v>

100
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that Martech does,</v>

101
00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:54.900
<v Speaker 1>it encapsulate her and then net,</v>

102
00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.040
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's a really interesting metaphor because that's essentially what</v>

103
00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:01.160
<v Speaker 1>human beings do when they encounter the unknown,</v>

104
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.411
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:04:01.411 --> 00:04:04.890
<v Speaker 1>They encapsulated in an explanatory network,</v>

106
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>so it's a way of binding up the the anomaly or the unknown and giving it a</v>

107
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.050
<v Speaker 1>substandard form.</v>

108
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Then he cuts her into pieces.</v>

109
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Then he makes the world out of her pieces.</v>

110
00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.791
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

111
00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:24.791
<v Speaker 1>one of Martin's names is he who makes ingenious things as a consequence of the</v>

112
00:04:25.791 --> 00:04:28.580
<v Speaker 1>combat with ty and mapped out.</v>

113
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:29.211
<v Speaker 1>That's very,</v>

114
00:04:29.211 --> 00:04:32.990
<v Speaker 1>very interesting because what it means is that the Samaritans are presenting in</v>

115
00:04:32.991 --> 00:04:36.530
<v Speaker 1>metaphorical form the notion that when the chips are down,</v>

116
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:41.531
<v Speaker 1>the survival of being depends on the capacity of whatever Martech represents the</v>

117
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.080
<v Speaker 1>solar God to encounter the Matrix of being,</v>

118
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.660
<v Speaker 1>to cut it into pieces and to make the world.</v>

119
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.100
<v Speaker 1>And if you think about it in those terms,</v>

120
00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:49.551
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

121
00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:50.870
<v Speaker 1>very straightforward story,</v>

122
00:04:50.871 --> 00:04:51.051
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

123
00:04:51.051 --> 00:04:52.880
<v Speaker 1>It's basically the story of human beings,</v>

124
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:57.020
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally the story of human beings because we,</v>

125
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.910
<v Speaker 1>in the words of a famous evolutionary psychologist whose name completely escapes</v>

126
00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:02.360
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

127
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.280
<v Speaker 1>We occupied the cognitive niche,</v>

128
00:05:04.281 --> 00:05:04.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

129
00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Our motive being his creativity in the in the face of the unknown and when chaos</v>

130
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.630
<v Speaker 1>threatens the established motive being,</v>

131
00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.830
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary for us to put our creativity into action and to carve out new</v>

132
00:05:18.831 --> 00:05:23.150
<v Speaker 1>territory or territory as a consequence of encounter with the unknown.</v>

133
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.193
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

134
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:28.190
<v Speaker 1>because we can take the world apart with our hands and put it together in new</v>

136
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:32.570
<v Speaker 1>ways and then we can scold what we've done verbally and we can transmit it to</v>

137
00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:36.080
<v Speaker 1>another person and then they can do the same thing and we're all doing this all</v>

138
00:05:36.081 --> 00:05:38.570
<v Speaker 1>the time and we're all telling each other how we're doing it.</v>

139
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And that's how the embodiment of logos in the human being,</v>

140
00:05:42.051 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 1>which is precisely equivalent to this Sumeria notion of Marta.</v>

141
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 1>That's precisely how it is.</v>

142
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:49.940
<v Speaker 1>That we're constantly capable of redeeming the world.</v>
