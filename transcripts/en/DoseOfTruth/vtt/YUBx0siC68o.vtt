00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm a psychoanalytic thinker.</v>

2
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.130
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that I believe that people are collections of some</v>

3
00:00:10.131 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>personalities and that those subpersonalities are alive.</v>

4
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>They're not machines.</v>

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:15.990
<v Speaker 1>They're there.</v>

6
00:00:15.991 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>They have their viewpoint,</v>

7
00:00:17.161 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>they have their wants,</v>

8
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:19.860
<v Speaker 1>they have their perceptions,</v>

9
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:20.970
<v Speaker 1>they have their arguments,</v>

10
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>they have their emotions,</v>

11
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.680
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

12
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 1>they're like low resolution representations of you.</v>

13
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:25.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

14
00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.461
<v Speaker 1>when you get angry,</v>

15
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:27.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

16
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a very low resolution representation of you.</v>

17
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It only wants rage or it only want something to eat or only once,</v>

18
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>only once water only wants sex.</v>

19
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:35.940
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

20
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.271
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

21
00:00:36.271 --> 00:00:36.811
<v Speaker 1>it's you,</v>

22
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:37.760
<v Speaker 1>but shrunken,</v>

23
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.780
<v Speaker 1>focused in a specific direction.</v>

24
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.560
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

25
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>and those,</v>

26
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>all those motivational systems are very,</v>

27
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>very ancient,</v>

28
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>very archaic and very,</v>

29
00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:47.220
<v Speaker 1>very powerful.</v>

30
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.480
<v Speaker 1>And they you up determining role in the manner in which we manifest ourselves.</v>

31
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.090
<v Speaker 1>As Freud pointed out with the kid,</v>

32
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.070
<v Speaker 1>we have to figure out how to take all those underlying animalistic motivations</v>

33
00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:04.071
<v Speaker 1>and emotions and civilize them in some way so that we can all live in this same</v>

34
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>general territory without tearing each other to shreds,</v>

35
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>which is maybe the default position of both chimpanzee and humanity.</v>

36
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.343
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

37
00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>so I take that seriously.</v>

38
00:01:15.301 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>The idea that we're a loose collection of spirits and that that that,</v>

39
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>that you know what it says in the Old Testament somewhere that the fear of God</v>

40
00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>is the beginning of wisdom and I think this is akin to that.</v>

41
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>If you know that you're not in control of yourself thoroughly and that there are</v>

42
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>other factors behind the scenes,</v>

43
00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>like the Greeks thought that human beings where the play things of the gods,</v>

44
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.140
<v Speaker 1>that's the way they conceptualize the world.</v>

45
00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.800
<v Speaker 1>They sort of meant the same thing.</v>

46
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:44.880
<v Speaker 1>They meant that there are these great forces that that move us,</v>

47
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>that we don't create that were,</v>

48
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:47.460
<v Speaker 1>that were,</v>

49
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.380
<v Speaker 1>that were subordinate to in some sense,</v>

50
00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>not entirely,</v>

51
00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:53.130
<v Speaker 1>but we could be subordinate to them and they move our destinies.</v>

52
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>That was the Greek view,</v>

53
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>and there's something indeed it,</v>

54
00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 1>it teaches you humility to understand that,</v>

55
00:01:59.411 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

56
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>that there's a hell of a lot more going on behind the scenes and you're,</v>

57
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.490
<v Speaker 1>you're the driver of a very complex vehicle,</v>

58
00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>but you don't understand the vehicle very well.</v>

59
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's got its own motivations and methods and sometimes you think it's doing</v>

60
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>something and it's doing something completely,</v>

61
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.240
<v Speaker 1>completely different.</v>

62
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.970
<v Speaker 1>You see that in psychotherapy all the time because you know,</v>

63
00:02:17.971 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>you help someone unwind a pattern of behavior that they've manifested forever.</v>

64
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.071
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

65
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:23.791
<v Speaker 1>they describe it,</v>

66
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.020
<v Speaker 1>then they become aware of it.</v>

67
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe they start to see what the cause is.</v>

68
00:02:27.091 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>They had no idea why they were acting like that.</v>

69
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.701
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

70
00:02:29.701 --> 00:02:34.701
<v Speaker 1>they have to have the memory that produced the behavioral pattern to begin with.</v>

71
00:02:34.711 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>It has to be brought back to mind and then it has to be analyzed and assessed</v>

72
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>and then they have to think about a different way of acting.</v>

73
00:02:41.161 --> 00:02:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And it's extraordinarily complex.</v>
