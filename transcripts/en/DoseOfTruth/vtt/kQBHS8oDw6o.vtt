1
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.213
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering if you could,</v>

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>if it's plausible,</v>

4
00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>it's race and our narcan tipple or narrative origin for some of the intellectual</v>

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.380
<v Speaker 1>tenants of the postmodern as oppose to like deny the structures of language as</v>

6
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:20.730
<v Speaker 1>corresponds to reality.</v>

7
00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>deny the sanctity of the individual.</v>

9
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.690
<v Speaker 1>I think you've done some of that in your,</v>

10
00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>your talk today,</v>

11
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>but you think it's possible from a psychological perspective to trace kind of</v>

12
00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:31.830
<v Speaker 1>the narrative,</v>

13
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.940
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>origin of postmodernism and human behavior or is it so unnatural?</v>

15
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.801
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

16
00:00:37.801 --> 00:00:38.101
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

17
00:00:38.101 --> 00:00:38.311
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

18
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:38.461
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

19
00:00:38.461 --> 00:00:39.221
<v Speaker 2>It's an architect,</v>

20
00:00:39.221 --> 00:00:40.054
<v Speaker 2>an architect.</v>

21
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's always,</v>

22
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 2>there's always a force so to speak that opposes the logo's hallways that that's</v>

23
00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:47.640
<v Speaker 2>the hostile brothers.</v>

24
00:00:47.641 --> 00:00:49.620
<v Speaker 2>It's a classic archetipal story.</v>

25
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 2>There's always Cain and Abel.</v>

26
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 2>There's always hostility between the two primary modes of operating in the</v>

27
00:00:55.891 --> 00:00:56.724
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

28
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

29
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.440
<v Speaker 2>and this is the,</v>

30
00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 2>this is the modern manifestation of that.</v>

31
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:01.501
<v Speaker 2>And it's partly,</v>

32
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:06.501
<v Speaker 2>it's partly a good thing in some sense because it's useful to be deeply</v>

33
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 2>challenged.</v>

34
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.430
<v Speaker 2>It's good to have an enemy because the enemy makes you think,</v>

35
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 2>the enemy tells you things that no one else will tell you.</v>

36
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 2>It's the [inaudible].</v>

37
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.760
<v Speaker 2>It's an advert adverse.</v>

38
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It's an ad.</v>

39
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.370
<v Speaker 2>It's the adversary that that that that stops you from being merely inert and so</v>

40
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 2>postmodernism plays that role.</v>

41
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

42
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 2>it's extraordinarily critical but,</v>

43
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 2>but things can go too far and and,</v>

44
00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.240
<v Speaker 2>and the motives and things can go too far.</v>

45
00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 2>When they go too far,</v>

46
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:37.914
<v Speaker 2>they reverse.</v>

47
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.300
<v Speaker 2>That's what happens and hopefully they're reversing now hopefully</v>

48
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.543
<v Speaker 1>as being mainly</v>

49
00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>we seem to be seeing something that has a different form today that might be,</v>

50
00:01:58.061 --> 00:02:00.070
<v Speaker 1>is more associated with the feminine.</v>

51
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Can you speak to that and also what is the nature of its power over men that it</v>

52
00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.920
<v Speaker 1>seems to be able to silence us.</v>

53
00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.931
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

54
00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 2>so the question is that the totalitarian forms that we've seen primarily in the</v>

55
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:18.650
<v Speaker 2>past have been male and,</v>

56
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 2>but maybe we're seeing something different now.</v>

57
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.630
<v Speaker 2>I really don't think it's different.</v>

58
00:02:23.631 --> 00:02:24.464
<v Speaker 2>I think it's,</v>

59
00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.270
<v Speaker 2>it's other common kind that's expanded in its dominion.</v>

60
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 2>So you imagine that there is an essential feminine pathology just as there is an</v>

61
00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:39.380
<v Speaker 2>essential masculine pathology and the essential feminine Pathology Freud mapped</v>

62
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:39.591
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

63
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:43.550
<v Speaker 2>It's the oedipal mother and the mother is the mother.</v>

64
00:02:43.551 --> 00:02:45.710
<v Speaker 2>That gets too close to her children.</v>

65
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.341
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

66
00:02:46.341 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 2>And intermingles herself with them too,</v>

67
00:02:48.411 --> 00:02:53.411
<v Speaker 2>too great a degree that in her attempts to protect them undermines them fatally.</v>

68
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And so there's a classic representation of the feminine in the West and the</v>

69
00:02:59.471 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 2>classic representation is married.</v>

70
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.351
<v Speaker 2>And here,</v>

71
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>here's one of the representations.</v>

72
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 2>It's lovely and it's derived at least in part from the story of Mary and the</v>

73
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 2>snake in the garden of Eden.</v>

74
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.790
<v Speaker 2>And so Mary has her foot on a serpent and she's holding Christ off to the side</v>

75
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.113
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

76
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>Well that's exactly what mothers have always done.</v>

77
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a biological portrait of human women is they hold their infants out of the</v>

78
00:03:24.221 --> 00:03:27.250
<v Speaker 2>reach of the terrible Serpentine Predator.</v>

79
00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Obviously that's what we do.</v>

80
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.113
<v Speaker 2>Well that's fine,</v>

81
00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 2>but adults aren't infants and neither are children.</v>

82
00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.690
<v Speaker 2>And if you treat them like they are,</v>

83
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 2>you undermine them.</v>

84
00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:40.150
<v Speaker 2>Ew,</v>

85
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 2>ew,</v>

86
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.260
<v Speaker 2>ew,</v>

87
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.800
<v Speaker 2>ew.</v>

88
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Pathologize them.</v>

89
00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 2>You turn them into old infants.</v>

90
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 2>That's an ugly thing.</v>

91
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's the Friday in nightmare.</v>

92
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.863
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

93
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.310
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

94
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 2>in this happens in therapy very frequently.</v>

95
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

96
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 2>you can be tangled into a terrible relationship with your father.</v>

97
00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 2>That's often either because he was absent,</v>

98
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 2>abusive or tyrannical,</v>

99
00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.010
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

100
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 2>But that the standard pathology with mom is she did everything for you.</v>

101
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:09.071
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

102
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 2>what's left for you to do nothing including never leaving.</v>

103
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.333
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

104
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 2>And that's the motivation.</v>

105
00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

106
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>for the woman who's nothing but protective mother,</v>

107
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 2>there's no role outside of nurturing,</v>

108
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.940
<v Speaker 2>of nurturing,</v>

109
00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:30.783
<v Speaker 2>nurturing,</v>

110
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.511
<v Speaker 2>of nurture,</v>

111
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:32.261
<v Speaker 2>and of infants,</v>

112
00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:32.801
<v Speaker 2>of nurturer,</v>

113
00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:33.634
<v Speaker 2>of infants.</v>

114
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.061
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

115
00:04:34.061 --> 00:04:35.230
<v Speaker 2>you just keep them infants.</v>

116
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.393
<v Speaker 2>They'll never leave.</v>

117
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Am I kill you in night in your sleep?</v>

118
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 2>But they'll never leave.</v>

119
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.501
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

120
00:04:44.501 --> 00:04:44.861
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

121
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

122
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:50.260
<v Speaker 2>it's so comical watching the feminists postmodernist in particular rattle on</v>

123
00:04:50.261 --> 00:04:55.261
<v Speaker 2>about the absence of gender reality and act out the archetipal devouring mother</v>

124
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 2>at exactly the same time for them.</v>

125
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.481
<v Speaker 2>For them,</v>

126
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:06.481
<v Speaker 2>the world is divided into predators and infants and the predators are evil and</v>

127
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:10.990
<v Speaker 2>need to be stopped and the infants need to be cared for.</v>

128
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:12.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

129
00:05:12.461 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 2>that's what the mother does,</v>

130
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.050
<v Speaker 2>but adults are not infants</v>

131
00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.070
<v Speaker 2>and all you do is destroy them when you treat them that way,</v>

132
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.740
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're adolescents and just starting to develop,</v>

133
00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>you know there's,</v>

134
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 2>there's a rule that I attempted to abide by when I had small children and the</v>

135
00:05:29.981 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 2>rule was don't do anything for your children that they can do themselves.</v>

136
00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 2>And it's annoying that rule because it takes you like 15 seconds to,</v>

137
00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 2>to dress a two year old,</v>

138
00:05:41.411 --> 00:05:43.300
<v Speaker 2>but you let the two year old dress himself.</v>

139
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:47.740
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's 15 minutes or 20 minutes or half an hour.</v>

140
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:48.880
<v Speaker 2>You chase them around the house.</v>

141
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 2>But if you let them learn to dress themselves,</v>

142
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:53.100
<v Speaker 2>then you don't have to dress themselves any.</v>

143
00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 2>Do you address them anymore and they can do it and you do that with setting the</v>

144
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 2>table and you do that with everything.</v>

145
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:58.521
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

146
00:05:58.521 --> 00:05:58.881
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

147
00:05:58.881 --> 00:05:59.331
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

148
00:05:59.331 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>You do that now while I care for you so much.</v>

149
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 2>Let me do that for you.</v>

150
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 2>It's like I don't care for you at all when I say that I don't care for you at</v>

151
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

152
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stop doing everything I possibly can for you as rapidly as I</v>

153
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:11.540
<v Speaker 2>possibly can say.</v>

154
00:06:11.541 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Well that's great.</v>

155
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 2>That's how you work in an old age home.</v>

156
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.710
<v Speaker 2>Do not do anything for the inhabitants that they can do themselves cause you rob</v>

157
00:06:19.711 --> 00:06:21.830
<v Speaker 2>them of the last vestiges of their independence.</v>

158
00:06:21.831 --> 00:06:22.400
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

159
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 2>It's what you do when you're a manager.</v>

160
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 2>If you're a good manager,</v>

161
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:29.651
<v Speaker 2>you make yourself Sir perf Lewis by extending autonomy and independence to the</v>

162
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 2>people that you manage so that they can take over the whole job.</v>

163
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.400
<v Speaker 2>You don't do that by doing everything for people and you certainly don't do that</v>

164
00:06:37.401 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 2>by dividing the world archetipal Lee and uncritically into predators.</v>

165
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Those who have more and victims,</v>

166
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 2>infants,</v>

167
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.820
<v Speaker 2>those who have nothing and acting like all you can ever do is protect them.</v>

168
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.893
<v Speaker 2>You don't protect,</v>

169
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.381
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

170
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't protect people.</v>

171
00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 2>You can only make them strong.</v>

172
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

173
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 2>You cannot protect them.</v>

174
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 2>You can make them strong and then they can protect themselves,</v>

175
00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 2>but then they don't need you.</v>

176
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

177
00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.540
<v Speaker 2>and there's the underground pathological element of the devouring mother.</v>

178
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:06.051
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

179
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:06.741
<v Speaker 2>never leave me.</v>

180
00:07:06.741 --> 00:07:07.574
<v Speaker 2>Here's the deal.</v>

181
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>I'll do everything for you.</v>

182
00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:10.700
<v Speaker 2>You just never leave.</v>

183
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.230
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

184
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.640
<v Speaker 2>That's sleeping with your mother,</v>

185
00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.571
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

186
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 2>That's the Friday at nightmare.</v>

187
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

188
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.620
<v Speaker 2>You don't invite your child into your bed.</v>

189
00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:19.521
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

190
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:21.860
<v Speaker 2>You distinguish between them and you,</v>

191
00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 2>you distinguished between them and your husband and you facilitate their</v>

192
00:07:25.941 --> 00:07:26.774
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>

193
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.740
<v Speaker 2>A part of the reason why it's useful to have a mother and a father is because</v>

194
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 2>the mother has to fall insanely in love with the infant or she throwed out the</v>

195
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:35.270
<v Speaker 2>window.</v>

196
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.541
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

197
00:07:35.541 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Because they're,</v>

198
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 2>they're insanely demanding and they're always right.</v>

199
00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:39.831
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

200
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Because the right way to treat an infant,</v>

201
00:07:41.331 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 2>especially before nine months,</v>

202
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 2>is I'll do everything for you and you're always right in your needs.</v>

203
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:47.780
<v Speaker 2>Take priority over everyone's one else's.</v>

204
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.730
<v Speaker 2>And anybody that threatens you is terrible.</v>

205
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:50.990
<v Speaker 2>Exactly right.</v>

206
00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:51.951
<v Speaker 2>But after,</v>

207
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:52.131
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

208
00:07:52.131 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 2>once the kid is ambulatory and starting to be independent,</v>

209
00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 2>that's the wrong attitude.</v>

210
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:57.650
<v Speaker 2>The attitude then is no,</v>

211
00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.750
<v Speaker 2>get the hell on with it.</v>

212
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 2>And men who are less prone to negative emotion and less compassionate are much</v>

213
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:08.930
<v Speaker 2>better at fostering that kind of independence.</v>

214
00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:12.890
<v Speaker 2>And so it's usually then when they step into the family and start playing with</v>

215
00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:16.850
<v Speaker 2>the kids rough and tumble play and pushing them forward and saying,</v>

216
00:08:16.851 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

217
00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:18.171
<v Speaker 2>get on with it.</v>

218
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:18.830
<v Speaker 2>You can do it,</v>

219
00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.663
<v Speaker 2>you can do it.</v>

220
00:08:20.010 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's very hard for a mother to play both those roles because she has to</v>

221
00:08:23.181 --> 00:08:23.451
<v Speaker 2>fall.</v>

222
00:08:23.451 --> 00:08:27.400
<v Speaker 2>So in love with her infant that it's difficult for her to be universal care</v>

223
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:28.540
<v Speaker 2>giver and disciplinary.</v>

224
00:08:28.541 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 2>And at the same time,</v>

225
00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:30.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

226
00:08:30.101 --> 00:08:32.630
<v Speaker 2>cause the roles or the roles run contrary to one another.</v>

227
00:08:32.631 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 2>So now women have entered the political sphere right on Mohs and so they're</v>

228
00:08:36.651 --> 00:08:40.340
<v Speaker 2>going to bring their essential nature with them all the while saying there's no</v>

229
00:08:40.341 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 2>such thing as essential nature.</v>

230
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:42.351
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

231
00:08:42.351 --> 00:08:42.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

232
00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:43.490
<v Speaker 2>there is.</v>
