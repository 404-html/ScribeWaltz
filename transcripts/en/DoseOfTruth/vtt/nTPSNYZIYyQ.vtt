<v Speaker 1>What are your thoughts on students taking Adderall?</v>

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>Are there any long term effects?</v>

3
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.150
<v Speaker 1>There are long term studies of the utility of Adderall for attention deficit</v>

4
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:18.841
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

5
00:00:18.841 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>hyperactivity,</v>

6
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>and the results are basically negative.</v>

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.030
<v Speaker 1>There is no evidence that the medications help with academic performance over</v>

8
00:00:27.031 --> 00:00:27.864
<v Speaker 1>the long run.</v>

9
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.473
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Adderall is an amphetamine.</v>

12
00:00:31.441 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 1>It is addictive.</v>

13
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>It can sensitize you to other dopamine agonists.</v>

14
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.180
<v Speaker 1>So I would generally say it's something to be avoided.</v>

15
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>You also want to really watch it in combination with marijuana,</v>

16
00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:43.351
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

17
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>or psychedelics because you can get unlucky and trigger a psychotic episode.</v>

18
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>And that is not a good thing because once you have one psychotic episode,</v>

19
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>you're a bit on the broken side and it's hard to put yourself back to the other.</v>

20
00:00:55.171 --> 00:00:59.370
<v Speaker 1>So I would say use it sparingly,</v>

21
00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:00.300
<v Speaker 1>if at all.</v>

22
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

23
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>it's not a good plan.</v>

24
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And especially not something good to be doing habitually.</v>
