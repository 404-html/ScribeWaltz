1
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.590
<v Speaker 1>Cause there's a limit to your strengths,</v>

2
00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>but God only knows to some degree what that limit is.</v>

3
00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:11.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

4
00:00:11.801 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>people can be unbelievably tough,</v>

5
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.130
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably tough.</v>

6
00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.780
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's even the more admirable for human beings to be tough because</v>

7
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>we're so conscious of how we can be hurt and we're so conscious of what that</v>

8
00:00:24.671 --> 00:00:25.870
<v Speaker 1>hurt can lead to.</v>

9
00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:26.650
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you can have your family taken away from you and you can be destroyed.</v>

11
00:00:29.981 --> 00:00:33.010
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that you can be courageous in the face of that at all,</v>

12
00:00:33.011 --> 00:00:35.440
<v Speaker 1>it's something that is absolutely unbelievable,</v>

13
00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:36.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

14
00:00:36.101 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 1>And people deserve a lot more credit,</v>

15
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I think then people give themselves,</v>

16
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>because the fact that we can be honorable under conditions of life and death,</v>

17
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:47.531
<v Speaker 1>Of suffering.</v>

19
00:00:47.531 --> 00:00:48.160
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

20
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.410
<v Speaker 1>that's a testament to the human spirit.</v>

21
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>And there's a profound anti-human ethos,</v>

22
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 1>I think that pervades our culture.</v>

23
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.080
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

24
00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>that considers human beings cancer's on the planet,</v>

25
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:00.850
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

26
00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:02.860
<v Speaker 1>and that there should be less of us.</v>

28
00:01:02.861 --> 00:01:07.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the same spirit that motivated the guy who wrote the book about it better</v>

29
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>to have never been.</v>

30
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:09.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

31
00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't see it that way.</v>

32
00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:10.601
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

33
00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>I think people do pretty well for,</v>

35
00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:17.980
<v Speaker 1>for having their leg caught in a bear trap and their head caught in a vice,</v>

37
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 1>they're actually doing pretty well because life is really hard.</v>

38
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:25.030
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that we're not absolutely brutal and murderous all the time is</v>

39
00:01:25.031 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>really something remarkable given what we actually have to contend with,</v>

40
00:01:28.851 --> 00:01:33.610
<v Speaker 1>that we can go out of our way to be honest and generous and altruistic and to</v>

41
00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:34.630
<v Speaker 1>care for each other.</v>

42
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Under unbelievably dire circumstances and to act notably sometimes under the</v>

44
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:41.050
<v Speaker 1>most trying conditions,</v>

45
00:01:41.051 --> 00:01:41.291
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:43.390
<v Speaker 1>and soldier Knutson's Gulag archipelago.</v>

47
00:01:43.391 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>He tells story after story of people who acted a bismuth Lee,</v>

48
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>but also people who under the worst threats imaginable,</v>

49
00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.550
<v Speaker 1>never sacrifice their character and know when reading about that is really,</v>

50
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>while it really makes you wonder,</v>

51
00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.201
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

52
00:01:59.201 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>that's what it does.</v>
