1
00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.090
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house</v>

2
00:00:10.091 --> 00:00:10.691
<v Speaker 1>of his master.</v>

3
00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:14.530
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and the Lord made all</v>

4
00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:15.940
<v Speaker 1>that he did to prosper in his hand.</v>

5
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>So that's an echo of the idea that we encountered earlier about walking with</v>

6
00:00:19.271 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.230
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

8
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>So Adam walked with God before he ate the fruit with eve and then he wouldn't</v>

9
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>walk with God and they had Noah walked with God and Abraham walked with God.</v>

10
00:00:28.751 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is,</v>

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.350
<v Speaker 1>well that's that alignment with the highest ideal.</v>

12
00:00:32.351 --> 00:00:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something like that.</v>

13
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.773
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

14
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>we could think about that as a metaphysical claim as well.</v>

15
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it is.</v>

16
00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:45.961
<v Speaker 1>I've got thousands of letters now in the last year from people who have told me</v>

18
00:00:47.291 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>that they were in a pit.</v>

19
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly right.</v>

20
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.390
<v Speaker 1>And that they decided that they were going to try to put their lives together</v>

21
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.490
<v Speaker 1>and that it worked.</v>

22
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.480
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really something,</v>

23
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:01.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>and they write surprised.</v>

25
00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:03.311
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

26
00:01:03.311 --> 00:01:03.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

27
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 1>I decided that I was going to work hard at what I was doing and I wasn't going</v>

28
00:01:06.741 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>to lie any more than absolutely necessary.</v>

29
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.290
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd give it a try for a few months,</v>

30
00:01:11.291 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.870
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of good things started to happen.</v>

32
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:14.704
<v Speaker 1>To me,</v>

33
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it's like maybe that's how the world works now.</v>

34
00:01:17.651 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it doesn't work like that all the time.</v>

35
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.231
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

36
00:01:20.231 --> 00:01:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Because you can get sliced off at the knees.</v>

37
00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:27.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's an arbitrary element to existence that you can't wish away,</v>

38
00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that there are,</v>

39
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that there aren't bad strategies and good strategies.</v>

40
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.960
<v Speaker 1>So I do think that one of the most fundamental existential questions is like if</v>

41
00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.390
<v Speaker 1>things aren't going well for you and your life is,</v>

42
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>are you absolutely certain that you're doing absolutely everything you can to</v>

43
00:01:48.021 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>put things in order?</v>

44
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're not,</v>

45
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.570
<v Speaker 1>then you shouldn't complain because you don't know to what degree you're</v>

46
00:01:53.571 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>actually contributing or even causing the circumstance.</v>

47
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.441
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

48
00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>that's a very annoying thing to think,</v>

49
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not trying to blame the victim,</v>

50
00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.251
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

51
00:02:01.251 --> 00:02:04.100
<v Speaker 1>I know that people end up with lung cancer because they were exposed to</v>

52
00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>asbestos.</v>

53
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to,</v>

55
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.860
<v Speaker 1>although I also know too that if you have lung cancer because you've been</v>

56
00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:11.030
<v Speaker 1>exposed to asbestos,</v>

57
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.190
<v Speaker 1>that can be a tragedy or it can be hell.</v>

58
00:02:13.191 --> 00:02:13.971
<v Speaker 1>And to some degree,</v>

59
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>that depends on how you conduct yourself.</v>

60
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:17.150
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

61
00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>I know that's pretty gloomy possibilities,</v>

62
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:19.671
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:02:19.671 --> 00:02:20.504
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

64
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.371
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

65
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>so Joseph is a slave,</v>

66
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>but it turns out that he's a,</v>

67
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.300
<v Speaker 1>he hasn't sacrifice the integrity of his character.</v>

68
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:30.410
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out that being,</v>

69
00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that he's not a slave.</v>

70
00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just that everyone around him thinks he's a slave,</v>

71
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.113
<v Speaker 1>but he's not.</v>

72
00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>So that's pretty interesting.</v>

73
00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.310
<v Speaker 1>He was a goodly person and well favored.</v>

74
00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:02:42.581 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>so he's a good guy and he's an impressive specimen as well.</v>

76
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.900
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty interesting given the current political climate,</v>

77
00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:51.734
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

78
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon</v>

79
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Joseph and she said,</v>

80
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.370
<v Speaker 1>lie with me.</v>

81
00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:01.060
<v Speaker 1>That means that actually has two meanings.</v>

82
00:03:01.061 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

83
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:02.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

84
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 1>but he refused</v>

85
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.880
<v Speaker 1>and said unto his master's wife,</v>

86
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:10.480
<v Speaker 1>behold,</v>

87
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.313
<v Speaker 1>my master</v>

88
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.260
<v Speaker 1>does not know what's with me in the house and he's committed all that he has to</v>

89
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.094
<v Speaker 1>my hand.</v>

90
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 1>There is no one greater in this house than I neither has.</v>

91
00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:24.520
<v Speaker 1>He kept back anything from me,</v>

92
00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>but you because you are his wife.</v>

93
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.320
<v Speaker 1>How then can I do this great wickedness,</v>

94
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.251
<v Speaker 1>wickedness,</v>

95
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.570
<v Speaker 1>and sin against God.</v>

96
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.470
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass as she speak to Joseph Day by day that he harkened not unto</v>

97
00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 1>her to lie by her or be with her.</v>

98
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It's being sexually harassed.</v>

99
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:43.413
<v Speaker 1>Joseph.</v>

100
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.830
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass.</v>

101
00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

102
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:46.280
<v Speaker 1>it's right,</v>

103
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.961
<v Speaker 1>it's right.</v>

104
00:03:46.961 --> 00:03:47.231
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

105
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:47.860
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

106
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 1>look at the painting.</v>

107
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his</v>

108
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 1>business and there was none of the men of the house they're within.</v>

109
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And she caught him by his garment saying,</v>

110
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:04.954
<v Speaker 1>lie with me.</v>

111
00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>And he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out.</v>

112
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's kind of embarrassing for poor Joseph,</v>

113
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:13.054
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

114
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>And a bit on the suspicious side.</v>

115
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and</v>

116
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:20.380
<v Speaker 1>was fled forth,</v>

117
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.380
<v Speaker 1>that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them.</v>

118
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

119
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:24.461
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

120
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>he has brought into Hebrew to mark us.</v>

121
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:27.460
<v Speaker 1>He came in unto me,</v>

122
00:04:27.461 --> 00:04:28.061
<v Speaker 1>lie with me,</v>

123
00:04:28.061 --> 00:04:30.460
<v Speaker 1>and I cried with a loud voice.</v>

124
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.320
<v Speaker 1>So what is it Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned?</v>

125
00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>That's the proper commentary on that.</v>

126
00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 1>And it came to pass when he heard that,</v>

127
00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got</v>

128
00:04:43.511 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>himself out and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife.</v>

129
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>So that's the Faro,</v>

130
00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:50.410
<v Speaker 1>which he spake unto him,</v>

131
00:04:50.411 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

132
00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.090
<v Speaker 1>after this manner,</v>

133
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:53.290
<v Speaker 1>did thy servant to me,</v>

134
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>his wrath was kindled and Joseph's master took him and put him in prison.</v>

135
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>A place where the king's prisoners were,</v>

136
00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.861
<v Speaker 1>was,</v>

137
00:04:59.861 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>were bound,</v>

138
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>and he was there in the prison.</v>

139
00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

140
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 1>that sort of sucks.</v>

141
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:08.761
<v Speaker 1>It's like first his brothers betray him and throw him in a pit and then he gets</v>

142
00:05:09.521 --> 00:05:10.301
<v Speaker 1>made a slave,</v>

143
00:05:10.301 --> 00:05:12.070
<v Speaker 1>which is probably better than being in the pet.</v>

144
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.480
<v Speaker 1>And then he becomes sort of like king slave.</v>

145
00:05:14.481 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>So that's working out pretty well and now someone lies about him,</v>

146
00:05:17.531 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>he gets betrayed again and now it's into the prison with them.</v>

147
00:05:19.901 --> 00:05:20.734
<v Speaker 1>And so it's this,</v>

148
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.881
<v Speaker 1>it's this again,</v>

149
00:05:21.881 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

150
00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing.</v>

151
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:28.030
<v Speaker 1>It's [inaudible] with the Rock and then down in its order,</v>

152
00:05:28.031 --> 00:05:28.900
<v Speaker 1>chaos,</v>

153
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.741
<v Speaker 1>order,</v>

154
00:05:29.741 --> 00:05:30.450
<v Speaker 1>chaos.</v>

155
00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to think,</v>

156
00:05:31.751 --> 00:05:31.901
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

157
00:05:31.901 --> 00:05:32.780
<v Speaker 1>are you the order?</v>

158
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>Are you the chaos or you the thing that's moving between them because that's the</v>

159
00:05:37.271 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 1>right thing to be.</v>

160
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.450
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise you're just ordering.</v>

161
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>That's a really bad idea.</v>

162
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>Or you're just chaos and that's a really bad idea.</v>

163
00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.240
<v Speaker 1>You can be the thing that's dynamically mediating between them and that's what</v>

164
00:05:49.241 --> 00:05:50.074
<v Speaker 1>he's doing.</v>

165
00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the</v>

166
00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.140
<v Speaker 1>sight of the keeper of the prison.</v>

167
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>That's no easy thing to do,</v>

168
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 1>I would think.</v>

169
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

170
00:05:58.971 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're thrown in prison and now the jailer likes you.</v>

171
00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.081
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

172
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>How exactly are you going to manage that as much good thing to think about</v>

173
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 1>because you might think,</v>

174
00:06:07.581 --> 00:06:08.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

175
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>if you were really in dire straits,</v>

176
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>how is it that you should conduct yourself so that you have the highest</v>

177
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 1>probability of having things work out?</v>

178
00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's not saying,</v>

179
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

180
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Joseph took over the thumb screw,</v>

181
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 1>and started using that on the other prisoners that that's not the indication</v>

183
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:24.021
<v Speaker 1>here at all.</v>

184
00:06:24.021 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>It's that he's doing something.</v>

185
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.030
<v Speaker 1>He's acting like a person who isn't a prisoner,</v>

186
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.130
<v Speaker 1>even though he's in the prison,</v>

187
00:06:31.131 --> 00:06:34.280
<v Speaker 1>just like he was acting like someone who wasn't a slave when he was a slave.</v>

188
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.863
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

189
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it makes you wonder who you can be despite the fact that other people think that</v>

190
00:06:45.201 --> 00:06:47.360
<v Speaker 1>you're whatever you appear to be.</v>
