00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:00.933
<v Speaker 1>Right</v>

2
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.900
<v Speaker 1>David Maxwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I scored the Zeros percentile for</v>

3
00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:12.420
<v Speaker 1>conscientious in the 84th for</v>
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism.</v>

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>How do I improve these scores?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:13.831 --> 00:00:15.840
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the first thing David you might want</v>

6
00:00:15.841 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>to think about is like if all of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>scores were low,</v>

7
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.110
<v Speaker 1>then there's some possibility that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're being too hard on yourself.</v>

8
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:26.520
<v Speaker 1>And what I would recommend Danny's get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of friends to fill out the</v>

9
00:00:26.521 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>questionnaire for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for you to describe you and then see if</v>

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's any agreement to see if</v>

11
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>they've.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are easier on you than you are</v>

12
00:00:35.281 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

13
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.440
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume that you are rather low</v>
<v Speaker 1>in conscientiousness.</v>

14
00:00:40.441 --> 00:00:42.450
<v Speaker 1>The next question would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well how young are you?</v>

15
00:00:42.451 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Because younger people tend to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>lowered conscientiousness,</v>

16
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>so if you're like 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's low but it's not</v>

17
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're like 40 and you're not</v>

18
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>depressed and zero is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's low</v>

19
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.823
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

20
00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.350
<v Speaker 1>If you are that low in</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness,</v>

21
00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I would recommend is</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

22
00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:06.441
<v Speaker 1>make a plan and be learn how to use a</v>
<v Speaker 1>schedule a calendar and do it badly to</v>

23
00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>begin with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like electronic calendar,</v>

24
00:01:08.131 --> 00:01:10.710
<v Speaker 1>like Google calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the best thing I know of,</v>

25
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>to improve conscientious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a plan so that you've got</v>

26
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:19.071
<v Speaker 1>something to a mat and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a scheduler and maybe you have to,</v>

27
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to someone to help keep you on</v>

28
00:01:23.071 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the other question would be,</v>

29
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>do you have other personality traits</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really high,</v>

30
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>like openness because if you're really</v>
<v Speaker 1>high in openness,</v>

31
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.400
<v Speaker 1>then it might be that you're more</v>
<v Speaker 1>inclined towards being motivated by</v>

32
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:38.280
<v Speaker 1>spontaneous interest and in the artistic</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

33
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And if you're really high in</v>
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

34
00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to be motivated by</v>
<v Speaker 1>being around people you know.</v>

35
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>So it also may be that in order to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious about something,</v>

36
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>you have to pick a domain that you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>suited to like socializing or artistic</v>

37
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 1>endeavor and try to work on being</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious in those domains.</v>

38
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>
