1
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.860
<v Speaker 1>I would like to move on to,</v>

2
00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:08.521
<v Speaker 1>if you have time,</v>

3
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.440
<v Speaker 1>I would like to move on to</v>

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>question about religion because I'm really interested in,</v>

5
00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.183
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

6
00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>in myths and religion.</v>

7
00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:18.214
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

8
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>one thing that's,</v>

9
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.351
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

10
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:24.511
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

11
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>if you call something a myth then it's probably not,</v>

12
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

13
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 1>it's not a not alive anymore perhaps.</v>

14
00:00:31.561 --> 00:00:31.891
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:33.480
<v Speaker 1>if you're actually calling it the myth,</v>

16
00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 1>if you really believe in it,</v>

17
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>you're not believing that it is a myth.</v>

18
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.230
<v Speaker 1>And so where we are now,</v>

19
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.601
<v Speaker 1>we've,</v>

20
00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>we've been studying the,</v>

21
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.701
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:00:41.701 --> 00:00:44.580
<v Speaker 1>the Bible like scientifically and,</v>

23
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.080
<v Speaker 1>and so we'd be construct,</v>

24
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.510
<v Speaker 1>my first subject in university was religious studies and then you deconstruct</v>

25
00:00:51.511 --> 00:00:55.730
<v Speaker 1>the Bible and you learn about [inaudible] when everything was written and</v>

26
00:00:55.731 --> 00:00:56.091
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

27
00:00:56.091 --> 00:00:58.160
<v Speaker 1>But what would you do right now?</v>

28
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.783
<v Speaker 1>You sort of,</v>

29
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>you making the Bible in your Bible lectures,</v>

30
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>you making it accessible for people that of our our age or our,</v>

31
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

32
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.753
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

33
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

34
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.410
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

35
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>and people who would,</v>

36
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't think would match,</v>

37
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:20.390
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't have naturally turned to the Bible for counseling.</v>

38
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.153
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

39
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.890
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

40
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>cured completely.</v>

41
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just an indication of how surreal the current circumstances really are.</v>

42
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.320
<v Speaker 2>I've been selling out the theater that I booked in Toronto for these biblical</v>

43
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 2>lectures and it's all full of,</v>

44
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.120
<v Speaker 2>it's almost all young man.</v>

45
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I can not that young,</v>

46
00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:37.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

47
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>they're between say 18 and 30,</v>

48
00:01:40.041 --> 00:01:40.791
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

49
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Although they're,</v>

50
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

51
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 2>there's women in there and there's older people too,</v>

52
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:44.690
<v Speaker 2>but that's the main audience.</v>

53
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:45.524
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

54
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:46.580
<v Speaker 2>well that's crazy.</v>

55
00:01:46.581 --> 00:01:46.791
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

56
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:48.500
<v Speaker 2>That's impossible that that's happening.</v>

57
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 2>But it's an attempt to revive a Phi the myth.</v>

58
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.893
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

59
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>So what's your,</v>

60
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.770
<v Speaker 1>what's your take take on why?</v>

61
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.680
<v Speaker 1>Why is uh,</v>

62
00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I asked,</v>

63
00:02:02.981 --> 00:02:03.550
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 1>we should dork is this,</v>

65
00:02:04.571 --> 00:02:05.381
<v Speaker 1>when I interviewed him,</v>

66
00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:10.381
<v Speaker 1>like there are people there were worried about the postmodern challenge to</v>

67
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:11.211
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

68
00:02:11.211 --> 00:02:12.044
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

69
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>like deconstructing everything.</v>

70
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.990
<v Speaker 1>And so you look for something from in,</v>

71
00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:16.470
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

72
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>in your,</v>

73
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.993
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

74
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And what I see you doing,</v>

75
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>and I would like you to your thoughts on it,</v>

76
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.100
<v Speaker 1>is that you are bringing some,</v>

77
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.830
<v Speaker 1>like a firm you're trying to bring in sort of a firmer foothold.</v>

78
00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.003
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

79
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.551
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

80
00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:35.260
<v Speaker 2>That it's like I'm journeying to the bottom of the ocean to rescue the father</v>

81
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:35.830
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>

82
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.630
<v Speaker 2>from the fire breathing whale.</v>

83
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

84
00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly it.</v>

85
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:40.090
<v Speaker 2>It's like the thing is,</v>

86
00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:42.640
<v Speaker 2>is that when everything shakes,</v>

87
00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.070
<v Speaker 2>then you look for the foundation.</v>

88
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.940
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

89
00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

90
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 2>And to me,</v>

91
00:02:47.151 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Speaker 2>the foundation,</v>

92
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

93
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 2>the thing the West got right is the divinity of the individual.</v>

94
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.393
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

95
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

96
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.830
<v Speaker 2>And it's the myth idea.</v>

97
00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 2>This is partly where I had a discussion with Sam Harris.</v>

98
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.021
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

99
00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:03.550
<v Speaker 2>that was quite a difficult discussion,</v>

100
00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

101
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 2>to discussions.</v>

102
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.740
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in the best of physical health when I had them,</v>

103
00:03:08.741 --> 00:03:09.431
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

104
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's life.</v>

105
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.270
<v Speaker 2>But you talk when you talk about myth,</v>

106
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

107
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like untruth,</v>

108
00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>but I think about it sort of as Metta truth.</v>

109
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 2>It's truer than true in some sense because it consists of abstractions that have</v>

110
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 2>guided human behavior properly for forever.</v>

111
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 2>In so far as human beings have been successful.</v>

112
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.433
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

113
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 2>and even in so far as we define success,</v>

114
00:03:34.181 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>it's embedded within these mythological ideas,</v>

115
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 2>which are ideas that we act out essentially not ideas that we hold or,</v>

116
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 2>or believe or state their ideas that we act out.</v>

117
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.060
<v Speaker 2>And the idea of the divine individual is at the center of our law,</v>

118
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:49.631
<v Speaker 2>which is why,</v>

119
00:03:49.631 --> 00:03:50.231
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

120
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:51.910
<v Speaker 2>even if you're accused of murder,</v>

121
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 2>even if there's overwhelming evidence against you,</v>

122
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 2>you still have value that the state cannot nearly trample on.</v>

123
00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

124
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.891
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

125
00:04:02.891 --> 00:04:03.311
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

126
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:04.210
<v Speaker 2>it's unbelievable.</v>

127
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 2>That's the case because you know,</v>

128
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 2>the typical barbaric society,</v>

129
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:09.731
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

130
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 2>which is what we're trying to reproduce very rapidly,</v>

131
00:04:12.131 --> 00:04:15.220
<v Speaker 2>is the one that assumes that if you're accused of something,</v>

132
00:04:15.221 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 2>we might as well just shoot you on the off chance that you're guilty.</v>

133
00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 2>That's a way easier to,</v>

134
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 2>to adopt that as a principal.</v>

135
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 2>And it,</v>

136
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.170
<v Speaker 2>and it's certainly satiates the Ma,</v>

137
00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.320
<v Speaker 2>the blood lust of the mob much more effectively.</v>

138
00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.060
<v Speaker 2>The idea that we could have constructed a worldview that put the pathetic week</v>

139
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:36.450
<v Speaker 2>malevolent,</v>

140
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 2>insufficient,</v>

141
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable individual at the center of the value structure is just,</v>

142
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.620
<v Speaker 2>it's an accomplishment who's grandier cannot possibly be overstated.</v>

143
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.600
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

144
00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.390
<v Speaker 2>we are the beneficiaries of that system.</v>

145
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 2>We live within its protective confo confines and we're doing everything we</v>

146
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:59.830
<v Speaker 2>possibly can to destroy it as rapidly as possible.</v>

147
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.293
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

148
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.843
<v Speaker 1>so you,</v>

149
00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.153
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

150
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.260
<v Speaker 1>which it was a one of my idols growing up and uh,</v>

151
00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.470
<v Speaker 1>I read the hero with a thousand faces,</v>

152
00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.221
<v Speaker 1>isn't too,</v>

153
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:15.940
<v Speaker 1>is a power of myth lectures.</v>

154
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

155
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>because uh,</v>

156
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean as,</v>

157
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:18.520
<v Speaker 1>as a lot of young men,</v>

158
00:05:18.521 --> 00:05:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I loved Star Wars and the Lord of the rings and then you sort of,</v>

159
00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>you read his work and you find out that,</v>

160
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:24.671
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

161
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:29.390
<v Speaker 1>so your [inaudible] he based his storyline or he changed his storyline,</v>

162
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.720
<v Speaker 1>fit more into the hero where the,</v>

163
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.080
<v Speaker 1>the monomyth and be the hero's journey story.</v>

164
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.750
<v Speaker 1>And he said that you need,</v>

165
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.870
<v Speaker 1>you need sort of a living myth or theology to be,</v>

166
00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>to have psychological health and spiritual health.</v>

167
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:54.460
<v Speaker 1>You need to live with enough sort of a living mythology.</v>

168
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

169
00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.721
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

170
00:05:55.721 --> 00:05:55.931
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 2>Big while the methodology tells you who you really are.</v>

172
00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

173
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.081
<v Speaker 2>Like you know,</v>

174
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

175
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 2>you really are a divine son of God.</v>

176
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean people,</v>

177
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.473
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

178
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.130
<v Speaker 2>people and and you know,</v>

179
00:06:07.131 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you actually know that because you feel guilty about not living up to your</v>

180
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:10.964
<v Speaker 2>potential.</v>

181
00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 2>Why in the world would you possibly feel that?</v>

182
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 2>But everyone feels that if they have any sense at all,</v>

183
00:06:16.821 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 2>unless they're narcissistic or psychopathic,</v>

184
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.920
<v Speaker 2>everyone feels that burden of the perfection to which they have to perfection to</v>

185
00:06:24.171 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 2>which they have not yet aspired Nora attained.</v>

186
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

187
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 2>and that's a testament to the,</v>

188
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 2>to the overwhelming potential that characterizes each individual.</v>

189
00:06:33.201 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 2>And that's really what I'm trying to point out in the biblical lectures.</v>

190
00:06:36.591 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 2>There's these continual stories about the nature of humanity and the nature of</v>

191
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 2>proper being in the face of the tragedy and malevolence of life.</v>

192
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.380
<v Speaker 2>And the Bible is Western,</v>

193
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 2>the Western world's attempt to,</v>

194
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:52.060
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

195
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.050
<v Speaker 2>to formulate that as a,</v>

196
00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.320
<v Speaker 2>as a comprehensible set of stories and also a set of principles for behavior.</v>

197
00:07:00.341 --> 00:07:01.110
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

198
00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.020
<v Speaker 2>it's the collective struggle of our,</v>

199
00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:08.200
<v Speaker 2>of our imagination stretched across tens of thousands of years,</v>

200
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 2>maybe hundreds of thousands of years,</v>

201
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe even more than that.</v>

202
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

203
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 2>cause some of these stories,</v>

204
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:13.890
<v Speaker 2>the Snore,</v>

205
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 2>the story of confronting the malevolence serpent,</v>

206
00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.190
<v Speaker 2>like I believe that in one form or another,</v>

207
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.840
<v Speaker 2>that story is if you also consider it as something that could be acted out that</v>

208
00:07:23.841 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 2>stories at least 60 million years old.</v>

209
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.670
<v Speaker 2>So because Lynn is veiled,</v>

210
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:35.680
<v Speaker 2>this anthropologist at Ucla has demonstrated quite nicely that are tree dwelling</v>

211
00:07:36.591 --> 00:07:38.660
<v Speaker 2>relatives coevolved with snakes,</v>

212
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 2>and our continual battle with snakes and predatory reptiles was part of what</v>

213
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 2>gave us our acute vision.</v>

214
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.530
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

215
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:48.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

216
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:49.930
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
