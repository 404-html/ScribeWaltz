<v Speaker 1>Travis luke says,</v>

2
00:00:07.881 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Speaker 1>why are dragons in western culture bring yourself death and destruction that</v>

3
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>must be slain while in the east?</v>

4
00:00:13.311 --> 00:00:15.740
<v Speaker 1>They're portant of good fortune to be revered?</v>

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.780
<v Speaker 1>that's a great question,</v>

7
00:00:17.781 --> 00:00:18.614
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

8
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

9
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

10
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.813
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon,</v>

11
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.493
<v Speaker 1>the Dragon,</v>

12
00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.510
<v Speaker 1>I already defined the dragon at some point,</v>

13
00:00:26.511 --> 00:00:30.560
<v Speaker 1>partly from a book I read a while back on dragons as a tree cat,</v>

14
00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>snake bird.</v>

15
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:35.690
<v Speaker 1>The idea in the book was that the Dragon was a imagistic representation of the</v>

16
00:00:35.691 --> 00:00:37.280
<v Speaker 1>class of all predators,</v>

17
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 1>which means also might be why dragons.</v>

18
00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.043
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

19
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.150
<v Speaker 1>also breathe fire because fire was undoubtedly a common destructive agent in our</v>

20
00:00:46.221 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary past.</v>

21
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.010
<v Speaker 1>But the dragon is the most primordial cysts symbol of that which looks beyond,</v>

22
00:00:53.931 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>which is known.</v>

23
00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:56.511
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

24
00:00:56.511 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>it's even more primordial than that because it even is that which lurks beyond</v>

25
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>what is unknown in some sense.</v>

26
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Remember Don Rumsfeld,</v>

27
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>unknown,</v>

28
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>unknown unknowns.</v>

29
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.901
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:07.110
<v Speaker 1>that's basically the drag.</v>

31
00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>There's some unknowns that pop up that you can master right away and you can</v>

32
00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 1>kind of think of those as known unknown's.</v>

33
00:01:13.011 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 1>But unknown unknowns are those things that pop up that you don't know about.</v>

34
00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>You didn't even,</v>

35
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>you had no idea whatsoever that they even existed anyways.</v>

36
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>What's the character of an unknown?</v>

37
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:24.944
<v Speaker 1>Unknown?</v>

38
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.141
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:01:25.141 --> 00:01:27.080
<v Speaker 1>part of it's terrifying because it can,</v>

40
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>it can,</v>

41
00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.060
<v Speaker 1>it can do you in,</v>

42
00:01:29.061 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

43
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>but part of it's also positive and and because it,</v>

44
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.160
<v Speaker 1>anything that's truly unknown brings it with it.</v>

45
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>A tremendous amount of new possibility.</v>

46
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 1>That's why dragons hoard gold or why they also heard princesses or guard</v>

47
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>princesses hoard,</v>

48
00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 1>I would say is the right word.</v>

49
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.230
<v Speaker 1>So I don't think the dragon in the West is a fully negative symbol because the</v>

50
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 1>dragon has gold associated with it or virgin.</v>

51
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>The reason for that is that the hero who confronts the Dragon gets the Virgin</v>

52
00:01:57.761 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>and that hasn't changed.</v>

53
00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.840
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

54
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a story as old as time and I don't think it'll ever change as long as</v>

55
00:02:03.651 --> 00:02:08.651
<v Speaker 1>there are human beings now why the Chinese put stress on the positive side and</v>

56
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:14.930
<v Speaker 1>the West put stress on the negative side is difficult to say.</v>

57
00:02:14.931 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 1>I might say because the Chinese got organized so early,</v>

58
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I have a sneaking suspicion that it was easier for them to see.</v>

59
00:02:24.351 --> 00:02:26.660
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of chaos is something positive,</v>

60
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 1>something necessary and positive as a counterbalance to the tremendous</v>

61
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.530
<v Speaker 1>organizational weight of their state.</v>

62
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.873
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.983
<v Speaker 1>that's the best,</v>

64
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.480
<v Speaker 1>best answer that I've been able to formulate.</v>

65
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.823
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

66
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.503
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

67
00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.161
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

68
00:02:43.161 --> 00:02:45.410
<v Speaker 1>the dragon is a very complex and ambivalence symbol.</v>

69
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

70
00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.810
<v Speaker 1>it combines everything into one symbol,</v>

71
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:48.950
<v Speaker 1>positive and negative,</v>

72
00:02:48.951 --> 00:02:51.470
<v Speaker 1>and then you can stress the positive or you can stress the negative.</v>

73
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.610
<v Speaker 1>You could also say to some degree that whether a dragon is positive or negative</v>

74
00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.430
<v Speaker 1>depends to some degree on the manner in which you approach it.</v>

75
00:03:00.431 --> 00:03:05.431
<v Speaker 1>Because the psychological reality is that dragons approached voluntarily,</v>

76
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:06.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>small are most likely to be positive.</v>

78
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really good thing to know in your life.</v>

79
00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

80
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:12.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a good reason.</v>

81
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a good rule of thumb to help you stop avoiding things that you shouldn't</v>

82
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:21.610
<v Speaker 1>avoid so that they don't grow and magnified beyond your capacity to deal with</v>

83
00:03:21.611 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
