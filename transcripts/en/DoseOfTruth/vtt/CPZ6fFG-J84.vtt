1
00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Your advice is there they are kind of fatherly.</v>

2
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Is that something that comes with the territory of being a psychologist or is</v>

3
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:18.780
<v Speaker 1>this your wife would say?</v>

4
00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:20.111
<v Speaker 1>Well it's both.</v>

5
00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Both being a professor at least in principle and being at psychologist,</v>

6
00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:25.030
<v Speaker 1>a clinical psychologist.</v>

7
00:00:25.031 --> 00:00:27.640
<v Speaker 1>So I'm at a hybrid of those two things.</v>

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>And I was also trained like I've read,</v>

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.353
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>deeply in the clinical literature,</v>

11
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.620
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalytic,</v>

12
00:00:35.621 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>existential humanist,</v>

13
00:00:37.001 --> 00:00:39.640
<v Speaker 1>there's all sorts of different streams of clinical thinking,</v>

14
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.570
<v Speaker 1>all of which have something very valuable to offer,</v>

15
00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:44.404
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

16
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.180
<v Speaker 1>But I was trained technically as a behavioral psychologist and one of the things</v>

17
00:00:49.181 --> 00:00:54.181
<v Speaker 1>that are behavioral psychologist is trained to do is to take a large problem and</v>

18
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:58.570
<v Speaker 1>to break it down into units that are small enough to actually manage</v>

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.433
<v Speaker 1>practically.</v>

20
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 1>And so I've always considered my teaching in that light is my goal is to take</v>

21
00:01:04.391 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 1>high level abstractions and to break them down until they're practically</v>

22
00:01:08.681 --> 00:01:09.514
<v Speaker 1>applicable.</v>

23
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And so I suppose so that,</v>

24
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

25
00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>that's both educational.</v>

26
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.940
<v Speaker 1>So that's the professorial side and psychologically meaningful.</v>

27
00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>So that's the clinical psychology side because clinical psychologists fortify</v>

28
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.621
<v Speaker 1>the individual,</v>

29
00:01:23.621 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 1>that's really their role.</v>

30
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.640
<v Speaker 1>And to the degree that that's a fatherly role?</v>

31
00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:31.360
<v Speaker 1>Well partly that's a consequence of the fact that I have been a father.</v>

32
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 1>I still am and that um,</v>

33
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm of the age where that's an appropriate way of interacting with people,</v>

34
00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.750
<v Speaker 1>but it's also in the same category in some sense as like,</v>

35
00:01:43.751 --> 00:01:48.751
<v Speaker 1>because the purpose of a father psychologically is to fortify the courage of his</v>

36
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.973
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

37
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>And so that's appropriate for me given the stage of the development of my</v>

38
00:01:55.871 --> 00:01:56.291
<v Speaker 1>career.</v>

39
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:57.124
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

40
00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.380
<v Speaker 1>you talked about the importance for people to sort out early on where they want</v>

41
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:04.594
<v Speaker 1>to go with their life.</v>

42
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Why is this important?</v>

43
00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.811
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

44
00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:10.390
<v Speaker 1>well we've done some practical work on this too.</v>

45
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.850
<v Speaker 1>I have this program called future authoring,</v>

46
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>which is part of the self authoring suite and it's available to everyone online.</v>

47
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>I developed with my colleagues about 15 years ago and our goal was to produce</v>

48
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.200
<v Speaker 1>high quality psychological interventions for mass audiences at an extremely low</v>

49
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:34.000
<v Speaker 1>cost and to do it in a way that was least likely to cause negative consequences.</v>

50
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>So that was the framework and the futuring future authoring program helps people</v>

51
00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:40.810
<v Speaker 1>develop a vision for their life.</v>

52
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:45.811
<v Speaker 1>And so you're asked to imagine that you were taking care of yourself properly,</v>

53
00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>so you're taking responsibility for yourself,</v>

54
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.770
<v Speaker 1>not taking the easy way out or or being nice to yourself or bolstering your self</v>

55
00:02:53.771 --> 00:02:54.790
<v Speaker 1>esteem or any of that,</v>

56
00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:59.791
<v Speaker 1>but taking responsibility for your life and that and envision who you could be</v>

57
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>if you could be who you should be three to five years down the road.</v>

58
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>Just to ask yourself,</v>

59
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:06.641
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:10.570
<v Speaker 1>if I could have what I wanted and needed and if I was acting in the world</v>

61
00:03:10.571 --> 00:03:11.404
<v Speaker 1>properly,</v>

62
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.390
<v Speaker 1>what would my friendships look like?</v>

63
00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>What would my intimate relationship look like?</v>

64
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:18.190
<v Speaker 1>How would I conduct myself with regards to my family?</v>

65
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>I've had lots of people come to my talks and say,</v>

66
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:20.651
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

67
00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I've really been trying to put together my family.</v>

68
00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.040
<v Speaker 1>We were fragmented badly,</v>

69
00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 1>and so I've been working for two years to bring everyone together and it's</v>

70
00:03:27.581 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>really working.</v>

71
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like people tell me that all the time,</v>

72
00:03:30.191 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>which is lovely thing to hear.</v>

73
00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

74
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>How should you construct your career?</v>

75
00:03:34.451 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>How should you educate yourself,</v>

76
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:38.260
<v Speaker 1>how you should resist temptation,</v>

77
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>the temptation of drugs and alcohol.</v>

78
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Take care of yourself mentally and physically.</v>

79
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Just have an image of if the world could be set up around you,</v>

80
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>starting with you in a way that would be best for you and for other people as</v>

81
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>what would that look like?</v>

83
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.130
<v Speaker 1>What without that sort of vision,</v>

84
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a target and you don't have any hope.</v>

85
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 1>And like people live on hope and your aim gives you hope.</v>

86
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>And so the nobler your aim,</v>

87
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 1>the more hope you have and you need hope,</v>

88
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>especially during times of catastrophe.</v>

89
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>And so it's extremely necessary for people to consider their character</v>

90
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>development because that's actually what sustains them through the difficulties</v>

91
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:17.194
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

92
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.400
<v Speaker 1>And it seems as if we've,</v>

93
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.320
<v Speaker 1>we've either never knew this in our education system or have forgotten it</v>

94
00:04:23.321 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>completely and we can't forget that because that's actually the purpose of</v>

95
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:27.971
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

96
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.580
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of education is the development of character.</v>

97
00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:31.653
<v Speaker 1>It's not the,</v>

98
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not mastery over a set of facts.</v>

99
00:04:34.151 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's some utility in that mastery,</v>

100
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.290
<v Speaker 1>if the facts are dead,</v>

101
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.830
<v Speaker 1>if they're just lying there and they're not given life by being integrated into</v>

102
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

103
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:45.910
<v Speaker 1>a noble narrative,</v>

104
00:04:45.911 --> 00:04:46.421
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

105
00:04:46.421 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 1>then there of no utility,</v>

106
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>they might even be harmful.</v>

107
00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:50.051
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

108
00:04:50.051 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>and we've done research,</v>

109
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

110
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 1>if university students do the future authoring program,</v>

111
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.980
<v Speaker 1>it decreases the probability they'll drop out of school by about 30%.</v>

112
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.100
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to have a particularly large effect on under achieving men.</v>

113
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 1>And we're not sure exactly why that gender,</v>

114
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>differential exist.</v>

116
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>But it might partly be because in the main women are outperforming men in</v>

117
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>academic environments.</v>

118
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>And so these programs seem to boost the performance of the lower lower</v>

119
00:05:21.971 --> 00:05:22.804
<v Speaker 1>performers.</v>

120
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.700
<v Speaker 1>But it also might be that men in particular won't engage in the world properly</v>

121
00:05:27.701 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>unless they have their own aims.</v>

122
00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>I was almost going to ask,</v>

124
00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:34.730
<v Speaker 1>why do you think men are until achieving or not living up to?</v>

125
00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:35.161
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

126
00:05:35.161 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

127
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

128
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:37.560
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is the,</v>

129
00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.610
<v Speaker 1>the contamination of competence with tyranny is that if every time you turn</v>

130
00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>around,</v>

131
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.430
<v Speaker 1>when you're attempting to win a competition,</v>

132
00:05:45.431 --> 00:05:46.091
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

133
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:47.470
<v Speaker 1>or take your place in the world,</v>

134
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.770
<v Speaker 1>the implicit or explicit accusation is that you're exercising tyranny and</v>

135
00:05:53.411 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>participating in an oppressive patriarchy.</v>

136
00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>And there's something wrong with you ethically for doing so.</v>

137
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>It's hardly,</v>

138
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 1>it's an invitation to the weak part of your character to take over.</v>

139
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

140
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

141
00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.870
<v Speaker 1>why should I try to do anything when everything I do is criticized and when I'm,</v>

142
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:09.581
<v Speaker 1>when I'm regarded?</v>

143
00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:09.811
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

144
00:06:09.811 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 1>and it's not only that,</v>

145
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:16.271
<v Speaker 1>because like I've met many men who really believed that their ambitions to take</v>

146
00:06:17.871 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>their place in the world are part of the oppressive patriarchal structure.</v>

147
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

148
00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

149
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.100
<v Speaker 1>that's responsible for,</v>

150
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.270
<v Speaker 1>for the dispossession of the dispossessed and the destruction of the,</v>

151
00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 1>of the ecological landscape.</v>

152
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>And that their best bet was just to do nothing just to sit there and do nothing</v>

153
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>because at least then they'd be harmless as if harmlessness is the most,</v>

154
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:40.790
<v Speaker 1>is the highest possible goal.</v>

155
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.830
<v Speaker 1>But if everything is oppressive power and that's wrong than powerlessness is the</v>

156
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 1>most impressive goal,</v>

157
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>but there's no life in that.</v>

158
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to sit here and be harmless.</v>

159
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:52.100
<v Speaker 1>So like I said,</v>

160
00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 1>this has become a mainstream view.</v>

161
00:06:55.371 --> 00:06:56.204
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

162
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

163
00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.690
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

164
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.260
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>

165
00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.130
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the hate can old completely.</v>

166
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:06.160
<v Speaker 1>There's certainly no shortage of pressure to make it become the mainstream will</v>

167
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:06.681
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>

168
00:07:06.681 --> 00:07:06.891
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

169
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 1>this is where I think to the universities play a terrible role because the</v>

170
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 1>universities have facilitated the development of these activists disciplines,</v>

171
00:07:15.591 --> 00:07:16.401
<v Speaker 1>women's studies,</v>

172
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 1>probably foremost among them.</v>

173
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

174
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>but social work,</v>

175
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.260
<v Speaker 1>anthropology,</v>

176
00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:22.243
<v Speaker 1>often,</v>

177
00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:22.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

178
00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:23.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

179
00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>English literature has become completely corrupt.</v>

180
00:07:25.371 --> 00:07:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Law is heading in that direction.</v>

181
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

182
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:33.170
<v Speaker 1>and you have one fifth of social scientists identifying themselves as Marxists,</v>

183
00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:38.171
<v Speaker 1>which I think is beyond reprehensible given the history of Marxism and this,</v>

184
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:39.950
<v Speaker 1>this patriarchal,</v>

185
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.601
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

187
00:07:41.601 --> 00:07:45.530
<v Speaker 1>This conceptual scheme that insists that Western cultures are fundamentally</v>

188
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.090
<v Speaker 1>oppressive?</v>

189
00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Patriarchies has become not only like holy writ in the universities,</v>

190
00:07:52.101 --> 00:07:55.670
<v Speaker 1>but it's spilling out into the mainstream with incredible rapidity.</v>

191
00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>And it's an absolutely horrible doctrine.</v>
