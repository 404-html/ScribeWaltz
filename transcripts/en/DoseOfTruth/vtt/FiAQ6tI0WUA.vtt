1
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:05.130
<v Speaker 1>So you would ask that.</v>

2
00:00:05.131 --> 00:00:05.964
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

3
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>the question is speech brings order out of chaos.</v>

4
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.921
<v Speaker 1>That's what I said,</v>

5
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>but it appears that speech brings chaos out of order as well.</v>

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.190
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is it does.</v>

7
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>There was only so many complications I can address in the talk simultaneously.</v>

9
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.513
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>if you look out,</v>

11
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>if you look at the most archaic of Archetipal Heroes,</v>

12
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>those heroes confront something that represents chaos.</v>

13
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>It's usually a monster,</v>

14
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.220
<v Speaker 1>the bears a treasure of some sort.</v>

15
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 1>And that's a symbolic representation of the class of all unexplored things,</v>

16
00:00:42.991 --> 00:00:43.231
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:43.231 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Because things that we have not yet explored are threatening and destructive,</v>

18
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 1>but also offer us infinite potential,</v>

19
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>but more elaborated hero stories,</v>

20
00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

21
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.930
<v Speaker 1>Also reverse that and say that,</v>

22
00:00:54.931 --> 00:00:55.111
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:55.111 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>there are times when the order has become so corrupt and rigid,</v>

24
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>that free speech fragments it into its parts so that it can rejuvenate itself.</v>

25
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And so mean the actually in the gospels,</v>

26
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.451
<v Speaker 1>that's the hero.</v>

27
00:01:06.451 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 1>That Christ is basically represented as,</v>

28
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>he's not so much the dragon confronting the dragon slayer who gathers the</v>

29
00:01:13.291 --> 00:01:13.681
<v Speaker 1>treasure,</v>

30
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:15.480
<v Speaker 1>although that's implicit in the,</v>

31
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>in the juxtaposition of Christ with the figure of like a serpent tile Satan.</v>

32
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>But Christ is the thing that stands up against the corrupt state and rejuvenated</v>

33
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>through speech.</v>

34
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.900
<v Speaker 1>And so technically speaking,</v>

35
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.191
<v Speaker 1>free speech,</v>

36
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>the logos is the thing that mediates between chaos and order.</v>

37
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.650
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about this is represented in,</v>

38
00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.161
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

39
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:35.431
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

40
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>in many cultures this idea,</v>

41
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>you can see it most specifically I would say in the Taoist conceptualization</v>

42
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.660
<v Speaker 1>because in the Dallas world being is made out of chaos and order,</v>

43
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:46.643
<v Speaker 1>Yin and Yang,</v>

44
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>masculine and feminine,</v>

45
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.140
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally it's chaos in order in order is the fact that wherever you go</v>

46
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>there are things you understand in order.</v>

47
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.180
<v Speaker 1>And Chaos is the fact that wherever you go there are things you don't</v>

48
00:01:57.181 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>understand.</v>

49
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.740
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea is that being is made out of the things that you understand and</v>

50
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.180
<v Speaker 1>the things that you don't understand.</v>

51
00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 1>And it's always that way,</v>

52
00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>which is why dow is the symbol of being per se.</v>

53
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.660
<v Speaker 1>And it's the case.</v>

54
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Your brain has adapted.</v>

55
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:11.581
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

56
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>it's partly why it has two hemispheres for the world that you understand in the</v>

57
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:15.631
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

58
00:02:15.631 --> 00:02:17.130
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand the world.</v>

59
00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>You understand roughly speaking,</v>

60
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>being handled by the left in the world.</v>

61
00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:22.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't understand roughly speaking,</v>

62
00:02:22.861 --> 00:02:24.060
<v Speaker 1>being handled by the right.</v>

63
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

64
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>it's that line down the middle.</v>

65
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.260
<v Speaker 1>That's dao,</v>

66
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.520
<v Speaker 1>that's meaning.</v>

67
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.250
<v Speaker 1>And if you have one foot in chaos and one foot in order,</v>

68
00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 1>you're maximizing information flow and rejuvenating yourself at the same time</v>

69
00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:37.800
<v Speaker 1>that you're maintaining your structure.</v>

70
00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.210
<v Speaker 1>And you will report on that internally as engagement in the world.</v>

71
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.890
<v Speaker 1>It's the most fundamental orienting sense that you have and it's deeply</v>

72
00:02:46.891 --> 00:02:48.570
<v Speaker 1>instantiated neurologically,</v>

73
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.920
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably deeply.</v>

74
00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And so it really is the case from an evolutionary perspective that reality is</v>

75
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:56.130
<v Speaker 1>chaos and order.</v>

76
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.990
<v Speaker 1>It's that to which you're adapted.</v>

77
00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes you're speaking on behalf of chaos and sometimes you were</v>

78
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>speaking on behalf of border.</v>

79
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>It's more complicated than that too though.</v>

80
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Because when we have a dialog say and,</v>

81
00:03:07.621 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>and we're,</v>

82
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>we're mutually attempting to climb towards the truth instead of convincing each</v>

83
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>other that we're right,</v>

84
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.823
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

85
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>then what we're doing is engaging in the simile.</v>

86
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Tanium is fragmentation of old and archaic belief systems and they're updated.</v>

87
00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.830
<v Speaker 1>And you can experience that because someone will say something that sets you</v>

88
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>back and then you'll get what they're saying and it'll click together.</v>

89
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>And what you're experiencing is the death of a,</v>

90
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.801
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>

91
00:03:32.801 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>of an old conceptualization structure,</v>

92
00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>its disintegration,</v>

93
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>and then it's reconfiguration in a tighter,</v>

94
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>in a tighter order.</v>

95
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>And people love that.</v>

96
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:42.971
<v Speaker 1>They live for that.</v>

97
00:03:42.971 --> 00:03:43.171
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

98
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:43.520
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

99
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.650
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

100
00:03:44.651 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 1>it's what keeps you alive.</v>

101
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>And you can experience that in a deep conversation,</v>

102
00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>a truthful conversation,</v>

103
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>a meeting of the minds and soul.</v>

104
00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>And people love that.</v>

105
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:53.854
<v Speaker 1>It's curative.</v>

106
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>All psychotherapists know this because what you do in psychotherapy as well,</v>

107
00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.970
<v Speaker 1>in addition to helping people face the things that they're most afraid of so</v>

108
00:04:03.971 --> 00:04:05.230
<v Speaker 1>that they can overcome them,</v>

109
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>is to allow them to tell someone the truth.</v>

110
00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>What happened to you all?</v>

111
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:11.314
<v Speaker 1>Listen.</v>

112
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.580
<v Speaker 1>So they tell you and they take themselves apart and put themselves together.</v>

113
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.061
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:04:16.061 --> 00:04:20.710
<v Speaker 1>they're speaking the truth about what happened and it puts them together.</v>

115
00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:21.800
<v Speaker 1>It's at the no,</v>

116
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:22.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

117
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.680
<v Speaker 1>the two fundamental elements of psychotherapy are let's find what you're afraid</v>

118
00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 1>of an avoiding and help you confront it so that you can gather the information</v>

119
00:04:30.881 --> 00:04:35.881
<v Speaker 1>that's there and let's allow you to lay your story out in all of its catastrophe</v>

120
00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:40.420
<v Speaker 1>in detail so that you can straighten yourself out through speech.</v>

121
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what happens in psychotherapy.</v>

122
00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So when it should happen in every real relationship,</v>

123
00:04:46.031 --> 00:04:46.390
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

124
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.270
<v Speaker 1>it's the spiritual purpose of marriage fundamentally,</v>

125
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:49.511
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

126
00:04:49.511 --> 00:04:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Because you faced someone who's different than you that you're tied to and</v>

127
00:04:53.381 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>cannot run from.</v>

128
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>And so you can reveal your really,</v>

129
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.881
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

130
00:04:57.881 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a critical,</v>

131
00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a critical part of marriage because if you can run from someone,</v>

132
00:05:02.651 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 1>they will never show you their true face.</v>

133
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>Because if someone shows you their true face,</v>

134
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>you will run.</v>

135
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you say in a marriage ceremony,</v>

136
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>I will allow you to show me your true face and I will not run.</v>

137
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>And unless you mean that you'll never be married,</v>

138
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.770
<v Speaker 1>you'll never understand what it means and you'll never reap the benefits of it,</v>

139
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>which are practical,</v>

140
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:25.721
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

141
00:05:25.721 --> 00:05:28.240
<v Speaker 1>but also spiritual and psychological.</v>

142
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason for the vow,</v>

143
00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:34.180
