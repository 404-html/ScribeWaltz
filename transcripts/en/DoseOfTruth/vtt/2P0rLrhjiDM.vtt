1
00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rogers was a phenomenologist.</v>

2
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>It's useful to know what that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you hear people use words all</v>

3
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why?</v>

4
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably not usually like phenomenology</v>

5
00:00:21.031 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>or existentialism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>postmodernism and structuralism and all</v>

6
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
<v Speaker 1>It's frequently the case that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that easy to figure out what</v>

8
00:00:31.011 --> 00:00:33.770
<v Speaker 1>the dark cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because they don't know.</v>

9
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually quite difficult to</v>

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.060
<v Speaker 1>make a reasonable conceptual distinction</v>
<v Speaker 1>between all those different modes of</v>

11
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:46.061
<v Speaker 1>thinking and phenomenology came out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophy and its earliest advocate was</v>

12
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.560
<v Speaker 1>a guy named Edmund and its most famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>proponent was probably heidegger,</v>

13
00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>heidegger garden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of trouble because he ended up</v>

14
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:03.170
<v Speaker 1>supporting the Nazis at least to some</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

15
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty good reason to get in</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble.</v>

16
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>All things considered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.030
<v Speaker 1>although you know most people in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

18
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.490
<v Speaker 1>so not that's any excuse obviously.</v>

19
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to exactly get your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>around what the phenomenologists are</v>

20
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was reading about David chalmers this</v>

21
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.180
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how many of you know about</v>

22
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:33.330
<v Speaker 1>David Chalmers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a philosopher who started the</v>

23
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Tucson conventions on consciousness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>chalmers.</v>

24
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure what I think about</v>
<v Speaker 1>gentleman.</v>

25
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>He's very charismatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got a way with words and setting up</v>

26
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:50.900
<v Speaker 1>those convention center has done a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal for the study of consciousness.</v>

27
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.360
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I think that what he pointed</v>

28
00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 1>out to scientists was obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was funny,</v>

29
00:01:59.121 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>

30
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>when psychology was primarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>behaviorist,</v>

31
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.460
<v Speaker 1>which was back in the fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it came as a big shock to psychologists</v>

32
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 1>when certain psychologist started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about cognition.</v>

33
00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.300
<v Speaker 1>They called that the cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and you know,</v>

34
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>I think it was obvious to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but psychologists at that point that</v>

35
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>people fought and I think it was perhaps</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same situation with philosophers and</v>

36
00:02:23.171 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious to everybody that</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness was a tough nut to crack.</v>

37
00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:32.411
<v Speaker 1>But the philosophers kind of ignored it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and chalmers brought it back into the</v>

38
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 1>academic mainstream.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phenomenologists are really all</v>

39
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>about consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just accepted as a fact.</v>

40
00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm rather than trying to deny its</v>
<v Speaker 1>existence because it can't be easily</v>

41
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>reduced to its material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Substrate.</v>

42
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Chalmers big point was that he couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why evolution couldn't have</v>

43
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 1>produced creatures exactly like us who</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no conscious awareness that you</v>

44
00:02:58.341 --> 00:03:03.341
<v Speaker 1>called them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally said that the existence of</v>

45
00:03:03.881 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is an enduring mystery.</v>

46
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's true.</v>

47
00:03:08.801 --> 00:03:10.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure that we've got anywhere in</v>

48
00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>terms of figuring out exactly what</v>
<v Speaker 1>consciousness is,</v>

49
00:03:13.241 --> 00:03:17.440
<v Speaker 1>despite a lot of time and effort put</v>
<v Speaker 1>into it and despite a lot of tremendous</v>

50
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>amount of work done on the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>

51
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:23.980
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenologists are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just took it as a fact.</v>

52
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heidegger believe that western</v>

53
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>philosophy had lost its way really since</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time of the Greeks,</v>

54
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:35.150
<v Speaker 1>and he thought that phenomenology or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>philosophies,</v>

55
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 1>primary field of focus should be being</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

56
00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>not reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but being.</v>

57
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's not easy to understand what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>meant by being,</v>

58
00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>the phenomenal field.</v>

59
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>The idea of a phenomenal field somewhat</v>
<v Speaker 1>captures it.</v>

60
00:03:53.141 --> 00:03:55.850
<v Speaker 1>So</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Heidegger,</v>

61
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 1>reality was what you experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he sort of,</v>

62
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>you sort of tip the tables instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuming an objective world and then</v>

63
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:07.090
<v Speaker 1>deriving the subjective from it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He presumed that</v>

64
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>the entirety of your experiences were</v>
<v Speaker 1>real</v>

65
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.800
<v Speaker 1>and that included your emotions and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>felt motivational states and your dreams</v>

66
00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 1>and your fantasies and even your</v>
<v Speaker 1>delusions.</v>

67
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that people like</v>

68
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.070
<v Speaker 1>heidegger thought that all the elements</v>
<v Speaker 1>of lived reality belonged in the same</v>

69
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:37.350
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you thought that</v>

70
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.560
<v Speaker 1>dreams and the reality that you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>shared with other people were</v>

71
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.800
<v Speaker 1>indistinguishable from one another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be just as pathological to a</v>

72
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.690
<v Speaker 1>phenomenologist as to anyone else,</v>

73
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:56.780
<v Speaker 1>but they were trying to get back to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>central mystery of life,</v>

74
00:04:56.781 --> 00:05:01.670
<v Speaker 1>which is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something rather than nothing.</v>

75
00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We experienced it</v>

76
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 1>and that's the place where Roger Starts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the presumptions of,</v>

77
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>of the Rogerian is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that in order to help someone,</v>

78
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.160
<v Speaker 1>you have to put yourself in their shoes</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally.</v>

79
00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>So you have to try to see the world from</v>
<v Speaker 1>their perspective,</v>

80
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>and that means adopting</v>
<v Speaker 1>the viewpoint.</v>

81
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>It means adopting the reality that</v>
<v Speaker 1>manifests itself to them</v>

82
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.340
<v Speaker 1>so that you can develop an empathic</v>
<v Speaker 1>understanding,</v>

83
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.000
<v Speaker 1>body focused understanding of the person</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're talking to you.</v>
