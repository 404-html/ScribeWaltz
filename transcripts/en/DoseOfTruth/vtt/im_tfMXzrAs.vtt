1
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.510
<v Speaker 1>And this is something else I wanted to talk to you about.</v>

2
00:00:08.511 --> 00:00:09.630
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're,</v>

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.790
<v Speaker 1>you're an admirer of Eric.</v>

4
00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:10.901
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

5
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:12.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm an n of Carl Young.</v>

6
00:00:12.081 --> 00:00:12.321
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:13.160
<v Speaker 1>And that's the norm.</v>

8
00:00:13.161 --> 00:00:16.160
<v Speaker 1>And connection is really interesting cause I think he's a bloody genius.</v>

9
00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the great mother's a great book and I really a great warning that</v>

10
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>book and also the origins and history of consciousnesses.</v>

11
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.380
<v Speaker 1>What am I most influential book.</v>

12
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

13
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>That's so interesting.</v>

14
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I read an essay you wrote,</v>

15
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember when it was fair.</v>

16
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:31.613
<v Speaker 1>Nyu.</v>

17
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.751
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

18
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>It's always been staggering to me that that book hasn't had the impact that it</v>

19
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:36.831
<v Speaker 1>should have had.</v>

20
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean you'll himself in the preface to that book who wrote that,</v>

21
00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:41.900
<v Speaker 1>that was the book that he wished that he would've written.</v>

22
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>It's very much associated with young symbols of transformation and it was a</v>

23
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>major influence on my book.</v>

24
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Maps of meaning,</v>

25
00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:52.970
<v Speaker 1>which was an attempt to outline the universal archetypes that that are portrayed</v>

26
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>in the kind of religious structures that you,</v>

27
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>that you put forward.</v>

28
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that I really see happening,</v>

29
00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell me what you think about this,</v>

30
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>and in Norman's book consciousness,</v>

31
00:01:02.271 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>which is masculine,</v>

32
00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:06.080
<v Speaker 1>symbolically masculine for a variety of reasons,</v>

33
00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

34
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>is viewed as rising up against the countervailing force of tragedy from an</v>

35
00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>underlying co feminine,</v>

36
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>Symbolically Feminine unconsciousness,</v>

37
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:16.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

38
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that can always be pulled back into that unconsciousness.</v>

39
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 1>That would be the microcosm of that would be the Friday and eatable mother</v>

40
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>familial dynamic where the mother was so over protective and all encompassing</v>

41
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>that she interferes with the development of the competence,</v>

42
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>not only of her sons,</v>

43
00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>but also of her daughters,</v>

44
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 1>of her children in general.</v>

45
00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.690
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that that's the dynamic that's being played out in our</v>

46
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:39.710
<v Speaker 1>society right now,</v>

47
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:40.640
<v Speaker 1>is that there's this,</v>

48
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:41.261
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

49
00:01:41.261 --> 00:01:43.850
<v Speaker 1>it's related in some way that I don't understand to this,</v>

50
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.720
<v Speaker 1>to this insistence that all forms of masculine authority or nothing by</v>

51
00:01:47.721 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical power.</v>

52
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.800
<v Speaker 1>So the symbolic representation is tyrannical father with no appreciation for the</v>

53
00:01:55.371 --> 00:02:00.110
<v Speaker 1>benevolent father and benevolent mother with no appreciation whatsoever for the</v>

54
00:02:00.111 --> 00:02:01.130
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical mother.</v>

55
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.521
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

56
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:02.354
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>

57
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And cause I thought of videology is as fragmentary mythologies.</v>

58
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.870
<v Speaker 1>That's where they get their archetype archetypal in psychological power,</v>

59
00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:09.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>And so in a balanced representation,</v>

61
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>you have the terrible mother and the great mother as as noise and laid out so</v>

62
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:18.570
<v Speaker 1>nicely and you have the terrible father and the great father.</v>

63
00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:21.620
<v Speaker 1>So that's the fact that culture bangles you have to death well.</v>

64
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>It's also promoting you and developing you.</v>

65
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 1>You have to see that as balanced.</v>

66
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:28.040
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the heroic and adversarial individual.</v>

67
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.960
<v Speaker 1>But in the postmodern world,</v>

68
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>and this seems to be something that's increasingly seeping out into the culture</v>

69
00:02:34.011 --> 00:02:34.491
<v Speaker 1>at large,</v>

70
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>you have nothing but the tyrannical father.</v>

71
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but the destructive force of masculine consciousness and nothing but the</v>

72
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:42.584
<v Speaker 1>benevolent,</v>

73
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:43.671
<v Speaker 1>benevolent,</v>

74
00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:44.301
<v Speaker 1>great mother.</v>

75
00:02:44.301 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>And it's a,</v>

76
00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 1>it's an appalling ideology.</v>

77
00:02:46.221 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that it's sucking the vitality went to,</v>

78
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.890
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you would expect symbolically.</v>

79
00:02:51.891 --> 00:02:53.930
<v Speaker 1>It's sucking the vitality of our culture.</v>

80
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 1>You see that with the increasing demolition of,</v>

81
00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.790
<v Speaker 1>of young men,</v>

82
00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

83
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>and not only young men in terms of their academic performance,</v>

84
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>which like they're falling way behind in elementary school way behind in junior</v>

85
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:08.500
<v Speaker 1>high and bailing out of the universities like mad.</v>

86
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

87
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.021
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

88
00:03:10.021 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

89
00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>well the public school education has become completely permeated by this kind of</v>

90
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 2>anti male propaganda.</v>

91
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:16.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

92
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 2>and to me public schools are just a form of imprisonment.</v>

93
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.421
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

94
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 2>right now are particularly destructive to young men who have a lot of physical</v>

95
00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

96
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Right now I identify as transgender,</v>

97
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Gay Mike Myself,</v>

98
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

99
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.353
<v Speaker 2>But I do not,</v>

100
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 2>I do not require the entire world to alter itself okay.</v>

101
00:03:33.011 --> 00:03:33.161
<v Speaker 2>To,</v>

102
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:35.200
<v Speaker 2>to fit my particular on the self image.</v>

103
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.170
<v Speaker 2>I do believe in the power of hormones.</v>

104
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 2>I believe that men exist and women exist and are biologically different.</v>

105
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

106
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.480
<v Speaker 2>I think there is no cure for the cultural ills right now except if men start</v>

107
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:54.190
<v Speaker 2>standing up away and demanding that they be respected as men again.</v>

108
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>So I got a question about that.</v>

109
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

110
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.180
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things,</v>

111
00:03:58.181 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>we did a research project a year ago,</v>

112
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out if there was such a thing as political correctness from a</v>

113
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 1>psychometric perspective to find out is there the loose aggregation of beliefs</v>

114
00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:09.580
<v Speaker 1>actually clumped together statistically.</v>

115
00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And we actually found two factors,</v>

116
00:04:10.991 --> 00:04:11.890
<v Speaker 1>which I won't go into,</v>

117
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>but then we looked at things that predicted adherence to that.</v>

118
00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

119
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:16.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

120
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.620
<v Speaker 1>politically correct creed,</v>

121
00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>there were a couple that were surprising.</v>

122
00:04:19.781 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>One was being female was a predictor,</v>

123
00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.080
<v Speaker 1>the personality attributes associated with femininity.</v>

124
00:04:26.081 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>So that would be agreeableness and higher levels of negative emotion.</v>

125
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:32.650
<v Speaker 1>We're also both independent predictors but so were symptoms of personality</v>

126
00:04:32.651 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

127
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was really important because part of what I see happening is</v>

128
00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.010
<v Speaker 1>that like,</v>

129
00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>I think that women whose relationship with men have,</v>

130
00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.760
<v Speaker 1>has been seriously pathologized,</v>

131
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:47.320
<v Speaker 1>cannot distinguish between male authority and competence and male tyrannical</v>

132
00:04:47.321 --> 00:04:47.980
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

133
00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Like they failed to differentiate because all they see is the oppressive mail.</v>

134
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.860
<v Speaker 1>And then they may have had experiences that,</v>

135
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.900
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

136
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.733
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

137
00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>there were experiences with men might've been rough enough so that that</v>

138
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:00.830
<v Speaker 1>differentiation never occurred because it,</v>

139
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:01.930
<v Speaker 1>it has to occur.</v>

140
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And you have to have a lot of experience with men and good men do before that</v>

141
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:06.574
<v Speaker 1>will occur.</v>

142
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.080
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that we're also increasingly dominated by a view of</v>

143
00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>masculinity that's mostly characteristic of women who have terrible personality</v>

144
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>disorders and who are unable to have healthy relationships with men.</v>

145
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

146
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.050
<v Speaker 1>But here's the problem.</v>

147
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.123
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

148
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.200
<v Speaker 1>this is something my wife has pointed out to.</v>

149
00:05:23.201 --> 00:05:23.591
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

150
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:23.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:05:23.771 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>man are going to have to stand up for themselves.</v>

152
00:05:25.601 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 1>But here's the problem.</v>

153
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 1>I know how to stand up to a man who's,</v>

154
00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

155
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.030
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

156
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:33.790
<v Speaker 1>unfairly trespassed against me.</v>

157
00:05:33.791 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I know that is because the parameters for my resistance are quite</v>

158
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:38.554
<v Speaker 1>well defined,</v>

159
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.330
<v Speaker 1>which is we talk,</v>

160
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:41.164
<v Speaker 1>we argue,</v>

161
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.243
<v Speaker 1>we push,</v>

162
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.900
<v Speaker 1>and then it becomes physical,</v>

163
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

164
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.941
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

165
00:05:44.941 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>if we move beyond the boundaries of civil discourse,</v>

166
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>we know what the next step is.</v>

167
00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:50.021
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

168
00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:51.610
<v Speaker 1>That's forbidden in,</v>

169
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:53.100
<v Speaker 1>in discourse with women.</v>

170
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.440
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't think that men can control crazy women.</v>

171
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:57.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think,</v>

172
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:58.370
<v Speaker 1>I really don't believe it.</v>

173
00:05:58.371 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that they have to throw their hands up in,</v>

174
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:01.241
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

175
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

176
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>in what?</v>

177
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>

178
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

179
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.390
<v Speaker 1>It's not even disbelief.</v>

180
00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>It's that the cultural,</v>

181
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.940
<v Speaker 1>there's no step forward that you can take under those circumstances because if</v>

182
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>the man is offensive enough and crazy enough,</v>

183
00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.950
<v Speaker 1>the reaction becomes physical right away.</v>

184
00:06:15.951 --> 00:06:20.300
<v Speaker 1>Or at least the threat is there and when men are talking to each other in any</v>

185
00:06:20.301 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>serious manner,</v>

186
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>that underlying thread and physicality is always there,</v>

187
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.950
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a real conversation and keeps the thing civilized to some</v>

188
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

189
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

190
00:06:28.941 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're talking to a man who wouldn't fight with you under any circumstances</v>

191
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:34.304
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

192
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.580
<v Speaker 1>then you're talking to someone to whom you have absolutely no respect,</v>

193
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.240
<v Speaker 1>but I can't see any way.</v>

194
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.100
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

195
00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.431
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

196
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:45.431
<v Speaker 1>there's a woman in in Toronto who's been organizing this movement,</v>

197
00:06:45.471 --> 00:06:48.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say against me and some other people who are going to do with free speech</v>

198
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:54.160
<v Speaker 1>event and she managed to organize quite effectively and she's quite ofensive.</v>

199
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.431
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

200
00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:56.750
<v Speaker 1>she compared us to Nazis,</v>

201
00:06:56.751 --> 00:06:57.381
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

202
00:06:57.381 --> 00:06:57.770
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

203
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:58.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

204
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>publicly using the swastika,</v>

205
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:02.330
<v Speaker 1>which wasn't really something I was all that fond of,</v>

206
00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.430
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

207
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:08.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm defenseless against that kind of female insanity because the techniques that</v>

208
00:07:09.171 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>I would use against a man who was employing those tactics are forbidden to me.</v>

209
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know,</v>

210
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 1>like it seems to me that it isn't man that have to stand up and say enough of</v>

211
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

212
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:20.360
<v Speaker 1>even though that is what they should do.</v>

213
00:07:20.361 --> 00:07:24.740
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me that it's saying women who have to stand up against their crazy</v>

214
00:07:24.741 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 1>sisters and say,</v>

215
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:26.001
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

216
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.390
<v Speaker 1>enough of that enough man hating enough pathology,</v>

217
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.030
<v Speaker 1>enough bringing disgrace on us as a,</v>

218
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 1>as a gender.</v>

219
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>But the problem there,</v>

220
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:37.120
<v Speaker 1>and then I'll start my little tirade,</v>

221
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 1>is that most of the women I know who are sane are busy doing same things,</v>

222
00:07:42.021 --> 00:07:42.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

223
00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:42.771
<v Speaker 1>They're off.</v>

224
00:07:42.771 --> 00:07:43.670
<v Speaker 1>They have their career,</v>

225
00:07:43.671 --> 00:07:44.510
<v Speaker 1>they have their family,</v>

226
00:07:44.511 --> 00:07:48.080
<v Speaker 1>they're quite occupied and they don't seem to have the time or maybe even the</v>

227
00:07:48.081 --> 00:07:49.630
<v Speaker 1>interest to go after there.</v>

228
00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:51.710
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy harpy sisters.</v>

229
00:07:51.711 --> 00:07:54.160
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't see any regulating force for that,</v>

230
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.880
<v Speaker 1>that terrible femininity.</v>

231
00:07:55.881 --> 00:08:00.881
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me to be invading the culture and undermining the masculine</v>

232
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:04.250
<v Speaker 1>power of the culture in a way that's,</v>

233
00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 1>I think fatal.</v>

234
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:06.160
<v Speaker 1>I really do believe that.</v>

235
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 2>I too,</v>

236
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:07.990
<v Speaker 2>I too believe that these are,</v>

237
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 2>this is symptomatic of the decline of Western culture and,</v>

238
00:08:11.131 --> 00:08:11.411
<v Speaker 2>and we,</v>

239
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:11.631
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

240
00:08:11.631 --> 00:08:13.210
<v Speaker 2>and it will just go down flat.</v>

241
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't think people realize that,</v>

242
00:08:14.831 --> 00:08:15.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:08:15.290 --> 00:08:17.050
<v Speaker 2>masculinity is still exists.</v>

244
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

245
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.670
<v Speaker 2>In the world as a code among jihadists.</v>

246
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:21.100
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

247
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.590
<v Speaker 2>And when you have passionate masculinity.</v>

248
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

249
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:25.510
<v Speaker 2>Circling the borders,</v>

250
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:27.790
<v Speaker 2>like the huns in the vandals during the Roman empire,</v>

251
00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:28.660
<v Speaker 2>that that's what I see.</v>

252
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.910
<v Speaker 2>I see this culture rotting from within.</v>

253
00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

254
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:32.400
<v Speaker 2>And this Oh,</v>

255
00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:32.981
<v Speaker 2>link itself,</v>

256
00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 2>literally now my island overview of why we're having these problems.</v>

257
00:08:36.471 --> 00:08:37.060
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

258
00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:40.030
<v Speaker 2>and it comes from the fact that I'm the product of an immigrant family.</v>

259
00:08:40.031 --> 00:08:43.900
<v Speaker 2>All four of my grandparents and my mother were born in Italy.</v>

260
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.500
<v Speaker 2>So I remember from my earliest years in this factory town in upstate New York</v>

261
00:08:47.501 --> 00:08:47.850
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

262
00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.050
<v Speaker 2>but my relatives came to work in the shoe factory.</v>

263
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.760
<v Speaker 2>I can remember still.</v>

264
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

265
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:52.721
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

266
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:54.880
<v Speaker 2>the life of the agrarian era.</v>

267
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.111
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

268
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 2>Which we now,</v>

269
00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 2>which was for most of human history,</v>

270
00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:02.740
<v Speaker 2>the agrarian era where there was the world of men and the world of women and</v>

271
00:09:03.301 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 2>they sex has had very little to do with each other.</v>

272
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 2>Each had power and status and its own realm.</v>

273
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

274
00:09:10.030 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

275
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:10.621
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

276
00:09:10.621 --> 00:09:11.810
<v Speaker 2>and they laughed at each other in,</v>

277
00:09:11.811 --> 00:09:12.644
<v Speaker 2>in essence,</v>

278
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 2>the way the women had enormous power.</v>

279
00:09:14.881 --> 00:09:15.151
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

280
00:09:15.151 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 2>the old women rule,</v>

281
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.191
<v Speaker 2>not the young,</v>

282
00:09:17.191 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 2>beautiful woman like today,</v>

283
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 2>but the older you were,</v>

284
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.440
<v Speaker 2>the more you had control over our everyone,</v>

285
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 2>including the mating and marriage.</v>

286
00:09:24.590 --> 00:09:25.423
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

287
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.580
<v Speaker 2>there were no doctors.</v>

288
00:09:26.581 --> 00:09:26.811
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

289
00:09:26.811 --> 00:09:27.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

290
00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:27.900
<v Speaker 2>so that you had the,</v>

291
00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:28.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

292
00:09:28.151 --> 00:09:28.261
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

293
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:31.740
<v Speaker 2>and the old women were like midwives and knew all the ins and outs of this and I</v>

294
00:09:31.741 --> 00:09:33.420
<v Speaker 2>inherited knowledge about pregnancy and all,</v>

295
00:09:33.421 --> 00:09:34.250
<v Speaker 2>all these other things.</v>

296
00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:34.770
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

297
00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:35.820
<v Speaker 2>I can remember this.</v>

298
00:09:35.821 --> 00:09:36.400
<v Speaker 2>And they say,</v>

299
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:36.590
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

300
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.620
<v Speaker 2>and the joy that women had with each other all day long.</v>

301
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:41.070
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

302
00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Cooking with each other,</v>

303
00:09:42.211 --> 00:09:42.900
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

304
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:44.600
<v Speaker 2>I companions to each other.</v>

305
00:09:44.610 --> 00:09:45.031
<v Speaker 2>Talking,</v>

306
00:09:45.031 --> 00:09:45.690
<v Speaker 2>conversing.</v>

307
00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:49.320
<v Speaker 2>My mother remembered as a small trial in Italy when it was time to do the</v>

308
00:09:49.321 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>laundry,</v>

309
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:51.390
<v Speaker 2>they would take the laundry up,</v>

310
00:09:51.391 --> 00:09:51.811
<v Speaker 2>the mount,</v>

311
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 2>up the hill to the fountain,</v>

312
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.120
<v Speaker 2>it will soar,</v>

313
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.841
<v Speaker 2>go okay and,</v>

314
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:55.591
<v Speaker 2>and do it by hand.</v>

315
00:09:55.591 --> 00:09:56.251
<v Speaker 2>They would sing,</v>

316
00:09:56.251 --> 00:09:57.660
<v Speaker 2>they would pick nick and so on.</v>

317
00:09:57.661 --> 00:09:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

318
00:09:58.050 --> 00:10:01.330
<v Speaker 2>And we get a glimpse of that in the Odyssey when a dcs is,</v>

319
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:01.621
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

320
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.400
<v Speaker 2>is thrown up naked on the shorts and fail you all right.</v>

321
00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:04.611
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

322
00:10:04.611 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 2>and he hears the sound of women,</v>

323
00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 2>young women laughing and singing and it's Nausicaa the princess bringing the</v>

324
00:10:11.071 --> 00:10:13.500
<v Speaker 2>women to do the laundry where he's exactly the same thing.</v>

325
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

326
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 2>so there was a,</v>

327
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 2>each,</v>

328
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:18.120
<v Speaker 2>each gender had its own hierarchy,</v>

329
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:19.290
<v Speaker 2>its own values,</v>

330
00:10:19.291 --> 00:10:20.310
<v Speaker 2>his own way of talking.</v>

331
00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 2>And the sex is rarely intersected.</v>

332
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Like I can remember in my childhood,</v>

333
00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.470
<v Speaker 2>on a holiday,</v>

334
00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:26.100
<v Speaker 2>typical,</v>

335
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 2>it could be Christmas,</v>

336
00:10:27.121 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 2>it could be a thanksgiving,</v>

337
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:28.980
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

338
00:10:28.980 --> 00:10:31.530
<v Speaker 2>all the women would be cooking all day long.</v>

339
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Everyone would sit down to eat.</v>

340
00:10:32.970 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

341
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.830
<v Speaker 2>And then after that.</v>

342
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.071
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

343
00:10:35.071 --> 00:10:36.750
<v Speaker 2>The women who were retired on monster,</v>

344
00:10:36.751 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 2>the kitchen and the men would go,</v>

345
00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

346
00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 2>I would look into a window and see all the men,</v>

347
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:41.911
<v Speaker 2>the men,</v>

348
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:43.080
<v Speaker 2>would it be all outside,</v>

349
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.210
<v Speaker 2>usually gather on the car.</v>

350
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:45.651
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

351
00:10:45.651 --> 00:10:48.900
<v Speaker 2>And then a time when cars didn't work as well as inner today with the hood up.</v>

352
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

353
00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:51.750
<v Speaker 2>And the men would be standing with our hands on their hips like that.</v>

354
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's staring at the engine.</v>

355
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:54.171
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>

356
00:10:54.171 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 2>I went,</v>

357
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

358
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.890
<v Speaker 2>That's how I learned.</v>

359
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:56.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

360
00:10:56.340 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 2>Men where we refreshing themselves by studying something technical and</v>

361
00:11:00.091 --> 00:11:03.060
<v Speaker 2>mechanical after being with a women for during the dinner.</v>

362
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:03.241
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

363
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:03.740
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>

364
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:07.920
<v Speaker 2>So all of these problems of today are the direct consequence of women's</v>

365
00:11:07.921 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 2>emancipation and freedom from housework,</v>

366
00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.750
<v Speaker 2>thanks to capitalism.</v>

367
00:11:12.780 --> 00:11:12.961
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

368
00:11:12.961 --> 00:11:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Which made it possible for women to have jobs.</v>

369
00:11:15.301 --> 00:11:18.150
<v Speaker 2>I said that home for the very first time in the 19th century,</v>

370
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 2>no longer to be dependent on a husband or father or brother.</v>

371
00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

372
00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.730
<v Speaker 2>And so this great,</v>

373
00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 2>great thing that's happened to us and allowing us to be totally as sup and self</v>

374
00:11:28.771 --> 00:11:33.771
<v Speaker 2>supporting independent agents has produced all this animosity between men and</v>

375
00:11:34.171 --> 00:11:38.070
<v Speaker 2>women because the women women's feel unhappy women today and the,</v>

376
00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:38.913
<v Speaker 2>wherever I go,</v>

377
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:42.390
<v Speaker 2>whether it's Italy or Brazil or England or America,</v>

378
00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:42.620
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

379
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Or Toronto.</v>

380
00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.210
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

381
00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:44.390
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

382
00:11:44.390 --> 00:11:44.671
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

383
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:45.000
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

384
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 2>the upper middle class professional women are unhappy,</v>

385
00:11:47.761 --> 00:11:48.420
<v Speaker 2>miserable.</v>

386
00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.710
<v Speaker 2>They want and they don't know what,</v>

387
00:11:49.711 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 2>why they're unhappy.</v>

388
00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>They want to blame it.</v>

389
00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>

390
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:52.850
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

391
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:54.760
<v Speaker 2>The must change men,</v>

392
00:11:54.761 --> 00:11:58.960
<v Speaker 2>it must become more like women know that is the wrong way to go.</v>

393
00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.231
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

394
00:11:59.231 --> 00:12:00.670
<v Speaker 2>It's when men are men,</v>

395
00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

396
00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 2>And understand themselves as men are secure as men,</v>

397
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 2>then you are going to be happier</v>

398
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:08.410
<v Speaker 2>than a weak man.</v>

399
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:09.461
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

400
00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

401
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 2>And especially all these quislings okay.</v>

402
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:12.580
<v Speaker 2>Spouting feminists.</v>

403
00:12:12.581 --> 00:12:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

404
00:12:12.810 --> 00:12:13.750
<v Speaker 2>I want to hear that.</v>

405
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:14.101
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

406
00:12:14.101 --> 00:12:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean it makes me sick,</v>

407
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.630
<v Speaker 2>but here's the point.</v>

408
00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:16.090
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>

409
00:12:16.090 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 2>men and women have never worked side by side ever.</v>

410
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 2>Maybe under farms.</v>

411
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:21.251
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

412
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:23.320
<v Speaker 2>When you were like maybe one person is in the potato field,</v>

413
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:25.930
<v Speaker 2>the other ones over here and the commitment during tomatoes or whatever.</v>

414
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

415
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

416
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:27.311
<v Speaker 2>you had,</v>

417
00:12:27.311 --> 00:12:28.630
<v Speaker 2>you had families and working,</v>

418
00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.620
<v Speaker 2>working side by side,</v>

419
00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 2>exhausted with each other.</v>

420
00:12:31.150 --> 00:12:32.130
<v Speaker 2>No time to have it.</v>

421
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Any clash of this.</v>

422
00:12:33.221 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 2>It was a collaborative effort on farms and so on.</v>

423
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Never in all of human history have men and women been working side by side and</v>

424
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:43.960
<v Speaker 2>women are now the pressure about silicon valley.</v>

425
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 2>They're also sexist.</v>

426
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh there there's,</v>

427
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:47.740
<v Speaker 2>they don't allow women in and so on.</v>

428
00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:52.330
<v Speaker 2>The men are being men in silicon valley don't like and the women and the women</v>

429
00:12:52.331 --> 00:12:53.164
<v Speaker 2>are demanding that,</v>

430
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.340
<v Speaker 2>oh this is terrible.</v>

431
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.310
<v Speaker 2>You're being say maybe the sexes.</v>

432
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:56.561
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

433
00:12:56.561 --> 00:12:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Have their own particular form of rhetoric.</v>

434
00:12:59.021 --> 00:13:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Their own particular form of identity.</v>

435
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
