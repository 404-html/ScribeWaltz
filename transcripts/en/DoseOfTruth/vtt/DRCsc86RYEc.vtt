1
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:07.600
<v Speaker 1>Peter pan doesn't grow up.</v>

2
00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't establish a relationship with Wendy who's actually real.</v>

3
00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.900
<v Speaker 1>He has to settle for Tinkerbell who you know is a ferry and they don't exist.</v>

4
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And so she's really in some sense of figure of his imagination because he won't</v>

5
00:00:20.981 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>mature,</v>

6
00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.410
<v Speaker 1>he can't have an actual relationship with,</v>

7
00:00:23.411 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>with a genuine person.</v>

8
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So we have to satisfy himself with,</v>

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>while it's something like a fantasy actually.</v>

10
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.640
<v Speaker 1>So seriously it is.</v>

11
00:00:30.641 --> 00:00:31.301
<v Speaker 1>It is like that.</v>

12
00:00:31.301 --> 00:00:31.991
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

13
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>it's a toned down a lot in the movie version obviously,</v>

15
00:00:36.221 --> 00:00:36.701
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

16
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>that's what's underlying it.</v>

17
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.650
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

18
00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:40.570
<v Speaker 1>well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow up?</v>

19
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.710
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is the only figure of authority that's around for him is his</v>

20
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.573
<v Speaker 1>captain Hook.</v>

21
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.110
<v Speaker 1>And he doesn't like Captain Hook.</v>

22
00:00:47.111 --> 00:00:49.090
<v Speaker 1>And that's because captain hook is a tyrant.</v>

23
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>He's brutal,</v>

24
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:51.041
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>and he's also a coward because he's,</v>

26
00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 1>he's lost a hand already to a crocodile with a clock in its stomach.</v>

27
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos in time.</v>

28
00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:00:59.081 --> 00:01:01.390
<v Speaker 1>that's the dragon that lives underneath everything.</v>

30
00:01:01.391 --> 00:01:05.150
<v Speaker 1>It's like the basilisk in Harry Potter and now Damn Crocodile's already got a</v>

31
00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:05.980
<v Speaker 1>piece of him,</v>

32
00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the case.</v>

33
00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:09.130
<v Speaker 1>Like that crocodile has got a piece of me,</v>

34
00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.340
<v Speaker 1>you know I'm older than 50 and so time is already God its grip on me.</v>

35
00:01:14.501 --> 00:01:18.970
<v Speaker 1>And you know part of the problem of being adult is that you also have to take</v>

36
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.500
<v Speaker 1>the fact that your finite and limited into account and if you're terrified by</v>

37
00:01:23.501 --> 00:01:23.801
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

38
00:01:23.801 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 1>which people tend to be,</v>

39
00:01:24.911 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 1>then it can easily turn you into a tyrant because you're afraid of everything or</v>

40
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>disgusted by everything and you have to ramp up the amount you control it.</v>

41
00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.710
<v Speaker 1>And so Peter Pan looks at Captain Hook and he thinks there's no damn way.</v>

42
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:37.210
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to end up as.</v>

43
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.800
<v Speaker 1>She's got a bad role model,</v>

44
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

45
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>So Captain Hook and Stalin in this sort of devouring monster are good</v>

46
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:48.370
<v Speaker 1>representations of the negative or tyrannical element of the great father her.</v>

47
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:51.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's the tyrannical element of the dominance hierarchy.</v>

48
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Captain Hook there at the bottom on the right hand side.</v>

49
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.890
<v Speaker 1>He's quite an interesting character because he's basically a tyrant.</v>

50
00:01:56.891 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And the Peter Pan Story is very interesting because Peter Pan Pan sorta means</v>

51
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:01.924
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

52
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 1>And Peter Pan is the sort of person who wants to retain the dynamic potential of</v>

53
00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:10.054
<v Speaker 1>childhood.</v>

54
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Because when you're a child you're not anything but you couldn't be anything.</v>

55
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>So you're pretty much only potential.</v>

56
00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.321
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

57
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:21.700
<v Speaker 1>well why should you sacrifice that potential to become something actual?</v>

58
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Cause in some sense it's actually a limiting process.</v>

59
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:25.361
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

60
00:02:25.361 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>and I mean this in the most concrete possible way,</v>

61
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.180
<v Speaker 1>you have more neural connections when you're born than you do at any other time</v>

62
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:35.020
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

63
00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 1>And most of those die by the time you're too.</v>

64
00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 1>So you go through this tremendous pruning process from when you're born,</v>

65
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:43.120
<v Speaker 1>from when,</v>

66
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.750
<v Speaker 1>til two so it's like you're dying into your childhood personality.</v>

67
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.501
<v Speaker 1>And then again,</v>

68
00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happens at the end of adolescence between say 16 and 20 when,</v>

69
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.320
<v Speaker 1>which is also the peak time for risk for the emergence of schizophrenia.</v>

70
00:02:56.321 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>And some people think that's the pruning process gone wrong.</v>

71
00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

72
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.760
<v Speaker 1>as an adolescent,</v>

73
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:05.761
<v Speaker 1>you also shed childhood potential to become the limited but specialized in</v>

74
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 1>potentially useful thing that you will become.</v>

75
00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.081
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>

76
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:11.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.124
<v Speaker 1>is it worth it?</v>

78
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 1>Is it worth shedding that potential?</v>

79
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>And Peter Pan's answer to that is,</v>

80
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

81
00:03:16.271 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

82
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.320
<v Speaker 1>he wants to remain in Neverland as a magical boy forever.</v>

83
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>And he's king of the lost boys,</v>

84
00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:23.440
<v Speaker 1>which I would say it's not a very,</v>

85
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 1>that's not much of a dominance hierarchy,</v>

86
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

87
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:26.650
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>

88
00:03:26.651 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>you're the king king of the King of the losers,</v>

89
00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

90
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>people who can't get their act together and mature.</v>

91
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.601
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

92
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 1>And you notice in Peter Pan,</v>

93
00:03:35.861 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>the individual is the hero and hero stories and is the initiate an initiatory</v>

94
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:40.714
<v Speaker 1>routines.</v>

95
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And so the hero is the person who is attempting to become a complete biological</v>

96
00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:52.081
<v Speaker 1>and historical entity personality so that they're capable not only of,</v>

97
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.290
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

98
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

99
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

100
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>adopting independent existence,</v>

101
00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 1>but if adopting independent existence that's productive and that's productive in</v>

102
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>a way that's also a benefit to the community.</v>

103
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So it's a particular pattern of development and that that needs to be catalyzed</v>

104
00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:10.870
<v Speaker 1>by human societies.</v>

105
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Because in order for a society to,</v>

106
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>to maintain its structure and for the people within it to thrive,</v>

107
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.520
<v Speaker 1>the developing individuals have to mature to the point where they can take care</v>

108
00:04:21.521 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>of themselves in a way that doesn't disrupt the whole social structure.</v>

109
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.380
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the path.</v>

110
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural path for human beings.</v>

111
00:04:28.361 --> 00:04:31.960
<v Speaker 1>I would say to some degree because we're such intensely social creatures,</v>

112
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.880
<v Speaker 1>but because we're also quite malleable and complex and also grounded in history</v>

113
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>and cultural creatures,</v>

114
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.970
<v Speaker 1>it's also something that has to be taught both from the perspective of imitation</v>

115
00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:44.230
<v Speaker 1>and explicitly.</v>

116
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 1>And so a lot of initiation rights for example,</v>

117
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.010
<v Speaker 1>are predicated on the idea that you take the person out of their childhood</v>

118
00:04:51.011 --> 00:04:51.844
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

119
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>you destroy their personality usually as a consequence of some cause,</v>

120
00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 1>a traumatic encounter.</v>

121
00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And then you refill them with the cultural norms and that makes them an adult.</v>

122
00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.641
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

123
00:05:03.641 --> 00:05:03.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:03.911 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>to some degree that's what you guys are doing in a very slow way.</v>

125
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.430
<v Speaker 1>When you make the transition from high school say to university or the</v>

126
00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>transition from high school to a,</v>

127
00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.113
<v Speaker 1>to a job.</v>

128
00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.841
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

129
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:14.411
<v Speaker 1>in our culture,</v>

130
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:18.550
<v Speaker 1>we don't have the kind of abrupt ceremonies though that are designed to catalyze</v>

131
00:05:18.551 --> 00:05:19.520
<v Speaker 1>that transformation.</v>

132
00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.051
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

133
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:21.370
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's an okay thing and,</v>

134
00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe it's not an okay thing.</v>

135
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.101
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

136
00:05:24.101 --> 00:05:27.460
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Freud pointed out and he's absolutely right about this,</v>

137
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.583
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

138
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 1>is that because human beings have such a long dependency period,</v>

139
00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.720
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy for us to grow up.</v>

140
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes it takes a shock in order for that to happen.</v>

141
00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the boom potential problems with having a dependency period as</v>

142
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 1>long as the human dependency period is that it never ends and that you stay</v>

143
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 1>immature forever.</v>

144
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>And really,</v>

145
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>I believe that that's the central Eda pulled problem that Freud talked about.</v>

146
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>And I believe also that it's a real problem.</v>

147
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Now whether Freud formulated it,</v>

148
00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

149
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:01.130
<v Speaker 1>with precise accuracy,</v>

150
00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 1>that's a different story.</v>

151
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:02.661
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

152
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.890
<v Speaker 1>you've got to give the guy a break.</v>

153
00:06:03.891 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 1>At least he formulated and,</v>

154
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:05.301
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

155
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:05.460
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

156
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.230
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

157
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean I was much more impressed with Freud and he DePaul theorizing after I did</v>

158
00:06:11.091 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>clinical work for a long time because a large number of my patients,</v>

159
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 1>their primary problem is getting the hell out of their family.</v>

160
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:18.890
<v Speaker 1>They just can't do it.</v>

161
00:06:18.891 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 1>And so for them the world is the family.</v>

162
00:06:22.041 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing that matters.</v>

163
00:06:23.301 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>It's often parental opinion or something like that and they just cannot break</v>

164
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:27.374
<v Speaker 1>free of it.</v>

165
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.273
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

166
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

167
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>initiation ceremonies in part were designed to catalyze that,</v>

168
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.010
<v Speaker 1>that break so that your,</v>

169
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 1>your mother in particular but also your father to some degree,</v>

170
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.170
<v Speaker 1>we're no longer the dominant figures have influenced your,</v>

171
00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 1>your personal mother and father were no longer the dominant figures of influence</v>

172
00:06:44.361 --> 00:06:45.194
<v Speaker 1>in your life.</v>

173
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:50.560
<v Speaker 1>So because really that's what he maturation means in some sense is that when you</v>

174
00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.010
<v Speaker 1>become an adult,</v>

175
00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 1>the opinions of your parents are as important as the opinions of any other</v>

176
00:06:57.111 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>reasonable people that hypothetically care for you.</v>

177
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:01.370
<v Speaker 1>But no more important than that.</v>

178
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 1>University is one of those patriarchal institution that's gives with one hand</v>

179
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>and takes away with another.</v>

180
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:07.401
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

181
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>So when you come here,</v>

182
00:07:08.541 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>there's thousands of you,</v>

183
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:10.820
<v Speaker 1>there's tens of thousands of view.</v>

184
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense as an individual you're rather faceless and you're also in some</v>

185
00:07:15.291 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>sense at the bottom of the power hierarchy in the university,</v>

186
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:19.160
<v Speaker 1>I think more than you should be,</v>

187
00:07:19.161 --> 00:07:19.994
<v Speaker 1>but whatever you,</v>

188
00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 1>you are at the bottom of it.</v>

189
00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.423
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

190
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a crushing institutional weight that comes along with being part of such</v>

191
00:07:26.301 --> 00:07:27.890
<v Speaker 1>a big university in particular.</v>

192
00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:28.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

193
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:30.830
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard on students in their first year.</v>

194
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:31.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

195
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 1>it's always seemed to me that it's better for first year students to go to a</v>

196
00:07:34.581 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 1>smaller place where the institutional weight is not so heavy.</v>

197
00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:39.351
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

198
00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>I've tested u of t students in their first year with things like the Beck</v>

199
00:07:42.981 --> 00:07:47.981
<v Speaker 1>depression inventory and about 30% of u of t students meet criteria for</v>

200
00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:49.580
<v Speaker 1>hospitalized depression.</v>

201
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>

202
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:07:51.021 --> 00:07:51.290
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

204
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.680
<v Speaker 1>but that's also because the back is way more sensitive to that than it should</v>

205
00:07:54.681 --> 00:07:54.920
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

206
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 1>At least that you know,</v>

207
00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think its criteria for when you should be hospitalized are</v>

208
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:00.201
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>

209
00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that the depression and the anxiety is quite high.</v>

210
00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.401
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

211
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:05.211
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

212
00:08:05.211 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>of course you're benefiting from going to university.</v>

213
00:08:07.461 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the kind of bipolar nature of the symbol.</v>

214
00:08:10.551 --> 00:08:11.630
<v Speaker 1>It's the tire and intent.</v>

215
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 1>It's benevolent tradition.</v>

216
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

217
00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:16.010
<v Speaker 1>it's molding you.</v>

219
00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:19.640
<v Speaker 1>You could even say it's crushing you because an educational system does that,</v>

220
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:21.350
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's like,</v>

221
00:08:21.351 --> 00:08:21.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

222
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>unless you allow yourself to get crushed by it,</v>

223
00:08:23.931 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get the benefit.</v>

224
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's the paradoxical relationship that individuals have with culture</v>

225
00:08:29.750 --> 00:08:30.381
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

226
00:08:30.381 --> 00:08:31.610
<v Speaker 1>And at all time.</v>

227
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:32.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

228
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 1>without culture you're nothing but with culture you have to be a cog in some</v>

229
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

230
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.150
<v Speaker 1>And so the tension between those two things is continual and constant.</v>

231
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 1>You could think about it as an existential constant.</v>

232
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Ever since there's been complex human societies and maybe even when there were</v>

233
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.880
<v Speaker 1>only tribal human societies,</v>

234
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:52.250
<v Speaker 1>that's been a problem for the individual.</v>

235
00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:53.330
<v Speaker 1>So culture,</v>

236
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:54.081
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>

237
00:08:54.081 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy is a solution and a problem and nature.</v>

238
00:08:57.691 --> 00:08:58.381
<v Speaker 1>The unknown,</v>

239
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory is a solution and a problem.</v>

240
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>And then the third category,</v>

241
00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:04.201
<v Speaker 1>while you see,</v>

242
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you a couple of things about these images.</v>

243
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.021
<v Speaker 1>So the one in the right,</v>

244
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 1>that's the devouring father,</v>

245
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:10.410
<v Speaker 1>that's also giving birth.</v>

246
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.670
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

247
00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 1>your personalities are being devoured by the university,</v>

248
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

249
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>a new personalities coming emerging as a consequence of that.</v>

250
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:21.630
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully it's a better personality than the previous one.</v>

251
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 1>If you can tolerate the tension of being transformed,</v>

252
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>the heat and the pressure,</v>

253
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.360
<v Speaker 1>then hopefully you come out,</v>

254
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

255
00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.580
<v Speaker 1>you come out though,</v>

256
00:09:29.581 --> 00:09:30.301
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

257
00:09:30.301 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>The process is worth it.</v>
