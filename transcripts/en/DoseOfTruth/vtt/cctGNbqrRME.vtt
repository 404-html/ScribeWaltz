1
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.470
<v Speaker 1>Now this occurrence is extending over a protracted period of time.</v>

2
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>And as the elder gods are threatened,</v>

3
00:00:13.511 --> 00:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>they're also breeding and mating and producing new forms,</v>

4
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.070
<v Speaker 1>and they produce a great,</v>

5
00:00:18.071 --> 00:00:20.470
<v Speaker 1>great grandson whose name is Marta.</v>

6
00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:20.891
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

7
00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Marta has a lot of very interesting attributes.</v>

8
00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>The attributes are described in the Enuma Elish in the following manner.</v>

9
00:00:27.011 --> 00:00:32.011
<v Speaker 1>So this is what Mark's father sees when his wife Damn Kina gives birth to</v>

10
00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:33.274
<v Speaker 1>Marduk.</v>

11
00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>So when he,</v>

12
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>who's Marnix father saw his son,</v>

13
00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.540
<v Speaker 1>he rejoiced,</v>

14
00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>he beamed,</v>

15
00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>his heart was filled with joy.</v>

16
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>He distinguished him and conferred upon him double equality with the gods.</v>

17
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:46.001
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

18
00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:49.690
<v Speaker 1>so that's the first indication that whatever Martech represents is something</v>

19
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>that's elevated beyond the normal status of a primordial density,</v>

20
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.020
<v Speaker 1>so that he was highly exalted and surpassed them in everything artfully arranged</v>

21
00:00:59.021 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>beyond comprehension,</v>

22
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 1>where his members not fit for human understanding,</v>

23
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 1>hard to look upon for his eyes,</v>

24
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>forward his ears when his lips move,</v>

25
00:01:08.351 --> 00:01:09.790
<v Speaker 1>fire blazed forth.</v>

26
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Each of his four years grew large and likewise his eyes to see everything he was</v>

27
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>exalted among God's surpassing was his form.</v>

28
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.540
<v Speaker 1>His members were gigantic.</v>

29
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.190
<v Speaker 1>He was surpassing in height.</v>

30
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.191
<v Speaker 1>Mary Youtube,</v>

31
00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>Mary you to one of his names,</v>

32
00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 1>son of the son,</v>

33
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:26.260
<v Speaker 1>God the son,</v>

34
00:01:26.261 --> 00:01:27.460
<v Speaker 1>God of the Gods.</v>

35
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Complex bit of poetry.</v>

37
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>It says a bunch of things.</v>

38
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:32.801
<v Speaker 1>It says,</v>

39
00:01:32.801 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>whatever Martech is is the offspring of the gods.</v>

41
00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Whatever Marta is is characterized by heightened awareness,</v>

42
00:01:41.321 --> 00:01:41.531
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:41.531 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>Because he has four years and four eyes and they're large.</v>

44
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Whatever Martech is characterized by as the status that surpasses that of his</v>

45
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:49.924
<v Speaker 1>father's.</v>

46
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Speaker 1>Whatever he's characterized by is associated with the power of speech,</v>

47
00:01:54.881 --> 00:01:55.541
<v Speaker 1>real power.</v>

48
00:01:55.541 --> 00:01:57.520
<v Speaker 1>Because when he speaks fire spurts,</v>

49
00:01:57.521 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>fourth mark is also huge.</v>

50
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.360
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly,</v>

51
00:02:01.361 --> 00:02:04.090
<v Speaker 1>he's associated in this particular poem with the Sun.</v>

52
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

53
00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.801
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:07.390
<v Speaker 1>the sun dominates consciousness,</v>

55
00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:07.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Because we're conscious during the day.</v>

57
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 1>Most of our brain is visual cortex.</v>

58
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.630
<v Speaker 1>So we're visual creatures.</v>

59
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.320
<v Speaker 1>So when the sun rises is when the day begins.</v>

60
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>So martech is also associated with whatever.</v>

61
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:21.280
<v Speaker 1>Danny dominates the day,</v>

62
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 1>and that's the daddy of consciousness.</v>

63
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And there's more to the story of the Sun,</v>

64
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

65
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 1>Because the sun is also something that rises and sets repeatedly.</v>

66
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 1>And that means that the daddy that dominates consciousness is characterized by a</v>

67
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:35.080
<v Speaker 1>cyclical nature.</v>

68
00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.861
<v Speaker 1>That's a son.</v>

69
00:02:35.861 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 1>Myth.</v>

70
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Sunrises in the morning,</v>

71
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.520
<v Speaker 1>renewed as a consequence of fighting a terrible battle in the night with the</v>

72
00:02:42.521 --> 00:02:45.190
<v Speaker 1>enemies of everything that's associated with consciousness.</v>

73
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>A Classic Solar Myth.</v>

74
00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 1>So absolute entire Matt give rise to the world of the gods,</v>

75
00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.160
<v Speaker 1>the activity of the world of Gods reawakens tie amat she decides to destroy</v>

76
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.454
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

77
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>but at that moment,</v>

78
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.860
<v Speaker 1>the gods give birth to Marduk.</v>

79
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.231
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

80
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>that's a typical Motif,</v>

81
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>which is that the hero's always born at the time of maximal crisis.</v>

82
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.170
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is,</v>

83
00:03:14.171 --> 00:03:15.004
<v Speaker 1>in part,</v>

84
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.963
<v Speaker 1>it's simple.</v>

85
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.690
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

86
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 1>if your culture is dealing well with the forces of the unknown so that</v>

87
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:22.330
<v Speaker 1>everything is static,</v>

88
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.021
<v Speaker 1>static,</v>

89
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 1>but productive,</v>

90
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>so that problems themselves don't arise,</v>

91
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>there's no reason for the hero,</v>

92
00:03:28.181 --> 00:03:28.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:03:28.421 --> 00:03:30.040
<v Speaker 1>There's no reason to confront the unknown.</v>

94
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>It's only when crisis backends that the birth of the hero is necessary.</v>

95
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Marduk constitutes the birth of the hero.</v>
