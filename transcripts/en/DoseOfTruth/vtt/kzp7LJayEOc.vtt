<v Speaker 1>Jake says,</v>

2
00:00:07.571 --> 00:00:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I've been incredibly inspired by you love what you do and would like to</v>

3
00:00:10.361 --> 00:00:12.070
<v Speaker 1>enlighten people in a similar manner.</v>

4
00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Be careful what you wish for it is,</v>

5
00:00:14.561 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 1>is it appropriate to aim to have as much as an impact as you or more so?</v>

6
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.763
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the idea is formulated wrong in some sense.</v>

8
00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.133
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

10
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.033
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

11
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>it's good to have people that</v>

12
00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.270
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

13
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.110
<v Speaker 1>you admire,</v>

14
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:34.973
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

15
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

16
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.200
<v Speaker 1>who can serve as models and I'm not claiming that I'm necessarily in that</v>

17
00:00:41.511 --> 00:00:41.961
<v Speaker 1>category,</v>

18
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:43.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's good to have people like that.</v>

19
00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:48.431
<v Speaker 1>But what you want to figure out to do two D to do is how to manifest the ideal</v>

20
00:00:49.071 --> 00:00:51.020
<v Speaker 1>within the confines of your own life,</v>

21
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

22
00:00:51.381 --> 00:00:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Because you're a particular sort of person.</v>

23
00:00:53.331 --> 00:00:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And so the way that you're going to live your life best,</v>

24
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:02.291
<v Speaker 1>it's very unlikely that it would be associated in any important way with the way</v>

25
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>that I've chosen to live my life unless we have very similar temperaments,</v>

26
00:01:06.111 --> 00:01:07.040
<v Speaker 1>which is possible.</v>

27
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:07.874
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

28
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.140
<v Speaker 1>relatively unlikely</v>

29
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>because the odds against that are,</v>

30
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.890
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

31
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.910
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily high.</v>

32
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>the odds of any two people having the same temperament are very,</v>

34
00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.963
<v Speaker 1>are very high.</v>

35
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>So what you can do is aim to,</v>

36
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>to Orient yourself towards a high good that you can conceive up to discipline</v>

37
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 1>yourself to tell the truth and all of that.</v>

38
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>And then what I would say is that as your life unfolds,</v>

39
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>you'll have the amount of influence that you should have,</v>

40
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>whatever that happens to be.</v>

41
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:40.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 1>some people live pretty local lives.</v>

43
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Like my life for example,</v>

44
00:01:44.701 --> 00:01:47.190
<v Speaker 1>is much more public than my wife's life.</v>

45
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that her contribution is somehow lesser.</v>

46
00:01:51.811 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean she's been unbelievably good with our kids.</v>

47
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 1>My daughter was very ill and my wife was extraordinarily good with her and was a</v>

48
00:01:58.471 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>great mother and it's been a tremendous help to me as a very honest person and a</v>

49
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:03.721
<v Speaker 1>wise person.</v>

50
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:04.770
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

51
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 1>that all has an impact.</v>

52
00:02:06.181 --> 00:02:09.690
<v Speaker 1>It's just not as obvious because while the kids really love her and now she's</v>

53
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:13.200
<v Speaker 1>got grandkids and God only knows what the consequence of that is going to be</v>

54
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>across successive generations,</v>

55
00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.981
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

56
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>she isn't interested in the public life.</v>

57
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm a journalist of hours to interviewer quite recently about what the last</v>

58
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 1>year's been liking her preferences to not do that.</v>

59
00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 1>And that's fine.</v>

60
00:02:29.581 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Like she has her own destiny and her own way of being in the world.</v>

61
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:37.830
<v Speaker 1>And there's nothing to say that it's lesser in any sense of the word at all.</v>
