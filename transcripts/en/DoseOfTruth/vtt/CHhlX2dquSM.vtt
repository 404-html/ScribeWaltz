<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

2
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.590
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

3
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.423
<v Speaker 2>bye.</v>

4
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.901
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

6
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:18.980
<v Speaker 2>we've the inimitable and disdain Dr. Jordan Peterson.</v>

7
00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't been following the last couple of years,</v>

8
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:25.280
<v Speaker 2>he might be hiding on Rankin serving some of the sixth string dimension.</v>

9
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.610
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want to go into too much detail,</v>

10
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.080
<v Speaker 2>but I'm very honored and privileged to be able to have a bit of a conversation</v>

11
00:00:33.081 --> 00:00:34.770
<v Speaker 2>with them today.</v>

12
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.650
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

13
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.220
<v Speaker 2>there's just one or two questions that I'd like to ask you with regards to the</v>

14
00:00:40.221 --> 00:00:40.790
<v Speaker 2>fiasco.</v>

15
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.130
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

16
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 2>the kept the caffeine human interview and talking about journalistic integrity</v>

17
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 2>and how that sort of rent up.</v>

18
00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

19
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:53.570
<v Speaker 2>what you were talking about yesterday in the VIP area about the media now</v>

20
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 2>sending out a memo saying this is not how to do interviews.</v>

21
00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.730
<v Speaker 2>What are your thoughts?</v>

22
00:00:58.731 --> 00:01:02.360
<v Speaker 2>Can you elaborate on the demise of journalistic integrity or the death of</v>

23
00:01:02.361 --> 00:01:03.194
<v Speaker 2>journalistic?</v>

24
00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

25
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.630
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

26
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.640
<v Speaker 3>I don't know so much if there's,</v>

27
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 3>if you can characterize it yet as a demise.</v>

28
00:01:09.161 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 3>It's certainly a transmutation because journalism is taking all sorts of new</v>

29
00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:12.731
<v Speaker 3>forms.</v>

30
00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:17.731
<v Speaker 3>It's emerging and many new forms online and in print and also on youtube and in</v>

31
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:19.414
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>

32
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.970
<v Speaker 3>We're definitely in the midst of a technological revolution.</v>

33
00:01:21.971 --> 00:01:26.860
<v Speaker 3>And I think that there's a proclivity on the part of the traditional media,</v>

34
00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:27.670
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

35
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

36
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.173
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

37
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.303
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

38
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.323
<v Speaker 3>to panic,</v>

39
00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 3>to fail,</v>

40
00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.880
<v Speaker 3>and to use increasingly desperate means of attracting attention while that's</v>

41
00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:37.714
<v Speaker 3>occurring.</v>

42
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 3>And it's easier to attract attention in the short term with heavily polarized</v>

43
00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:46.480
<v Speaker 3>views and opinion pieces and that sort of thing.</v>

44
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 3>And it's like clickbait,</v>

45
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.761
<v Speaker 3>I suppose it's,</v>

46
00:01:48.761 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

47
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.570
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

48
00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.931
<v Speaker 3>It's the,</v>

49
00:01:49.931 --> 00:01:50.380
<v Speaker 3>it's the,</v>

50
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 3>it's the mainstream media equivalent of clickbait.</v>

51
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.970
<v Speaker 3>It might be a reasonable short term strategy,</v>

52
00:01:54.971 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 3>but it's a deadly longterm strategy for any credible news organization because</v>

53
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.580
<v Speaker 3>credible news organizations live and die by their reputation and reputation is,</v>

54
00:02:03.581 --> 00:02:04.570
<v Speaker 3>are easily lost.</v>

55
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.050
<v Speaker 3>And so I think that what happened with the Channel Four interview was,</v>

56
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

57
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.250
<v Speaker 3>it was an example of journalistic reputation being lost because there was almost</v>

58
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:19.480
<v Speaker 3>a complete disconnect between the person that Kathy Newman thought she was</v>

59
00:02:19.481 --> 00:02:21.220
<v Speaker 3>talking to and me.</v>

60
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:22.330
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

61
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

62
00:02:22.661 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 3>she should have noticed that I would say,</v>

63
00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.240
<v Speaker 3>let's say she had reason to be hostile and suspicious to begin with.</v>

64
00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

65
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

66
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.860
<v Speaker 3>we could,</v>

67
00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:30.820
<v Speaker 3>we could give her that,</v>

68
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.410
<v Speaker 3>but hypothetically by a few minutes into the interview with seven or eight</v>

69
00:02:35.411 --> 00:02:38.530
<v Speaker 3>minutes after four or five questions didn't go the way that she thought they</v>

70
00:02:38.531 --> 00:02:39.364
<v Speaker 3>might go,</v>

71
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 3>I would have been much more appropriate for her to default back to a normal</v>

72
00:02:44.291 --> 00:02:49.291
<v Speaker 3>conversational tech instead of treating the encounter like a forum for victory.</v>

73
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.610
<v Speaker 3>I think that was her mistake fundamentally.</v>

74
00:02:52.611 --> 00:02:56.790
<v Speaker 3>And the mistake of what many journalists is to think about it as something as a,</v>

75
00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 3>as a forum to attain victory.</v>

76
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Oh my son could gels to journalistic</v>

77
00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.363
<v Speaker 2>Justin.</v>

78
00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.181
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

79
00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:02.870
<v Speaker 3>It was dominance,</v>

80
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:03.180
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy,</v>

81
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 3>maneuver match essentially.</v>

82
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

83
00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.541
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

84
00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:08.360
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't want to play that game particularly.</v>

85
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.300
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

86
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 2>So when um,</v>

87
00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.620
<v Speaker 2>there was feedback afterwards and she had said that she thought the interview</v>

88
00:03:13.621 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 2>went well and she didn't know what the role cast is about God.</v>

89
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.483
<v Speaker 2>Who was about,</v>

90
00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.620
<v Speaker 2>do you see from the Union perspective?</v>

91
00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Cause that,</v>

92
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.880
<v Speaker 2>cause that's my background.</v>

93
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at it from is there the capacity and the propensity because self</v>

94
00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:27.420
<v Speaker 2>reflection does,</v>

95
00:03:27.421 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 2>does a person not to see it.</v>

96
00:03:28.511 --> 00:03:28.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

97
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:29.281
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

98
00:03:29.281 --> 00:03:30.180
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know.</v>

99
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.021
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

100
00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:34.440
<v Speaker 3>I would say if you're thinking about it from a union perspective,</v>

101
00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:36.420
<v Speaker 3>that it was a good example of animus possession.</v>

102
00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.810
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

103
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:37.800
<v Speaker 3>You can see that quite,</v>

104
00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.960
<v Speaker 3>there are many examples of that online.</v>

105
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

106
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 3>I've actually thought about making a video about that because anonymous</v>

107
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.140
<v Speaker 3>possession is a thing that's very difficult to describe,</v>

108
00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:47.040
<v Speaker 3>but you can actually,</v>

109
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.980
<v Speaker 3>you can see it and certainly that's what happened with Kathy Newman.</v>

110
00:03:49.981 --> 00:03:51.510
<v Speaker 3>It was blatantly on display.</v>

111
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:52.800
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

112
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.280
<v Speaker 3>I really don't know how she has responded to this.</v>

113
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:57.300
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

114
00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.133
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

115
00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.720
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how you respond to something like that.</v>

116
00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:04.890
<v Speaker 3>I tried to put myself in her shoes and to imagine that I was the recipient of,</v>

117
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.610
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

118
00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 3>let's say lots of worldwide negative publicity essentially,</v>

119
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

120
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.500
<v Speaker 3>and thousands of cutting comments,</v>

121
00:04:13.501 --> 00:04:13.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

122
00:04:13.741 --> 00:04:17.520
<v Speaker 3>ranging from pretty damning to extraordinarily damaging.</v>

123
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.421
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

124
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.810
<v Speaker 3>there's the odd comment that is in favor of what you did and stood up for her</v>

125
00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 3>combative nature and all of the outcome.</v>

126
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.690
<v Speaker 3>But I just don't know how you respond to that psychologically.</v>

127
00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.573
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

128
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.830
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

129
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:29.663
<v Speaker 3>it's gotta be,</v>

130
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.200
<v Speaker 3>you either shut it out,</v>

131
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 3>which isn't helpful because you don't learn anything or you let it in,</v>

132
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:36.210
<v Speaker 3>in which case it has to be devastating.</v>

133
00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.463
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

134
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.593
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

135
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:39.240
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>

136
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Is there a notion,</v>

137
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

138
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

139
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.160
<v Speaker 2>if we go back to the young perspective of perhaps the transcendent function</v>

140
00:04:46.651 --> 00:04:49.680
<v Speaker 2>coming into play where you are trying to hold the tension of opposites but</v>

141
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you're actually not doing that effectively?</v>

142
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.651
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

143
00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:58.420
<v Speaker 3>the problem is I think in her situation is that because that that interview</v>

144
00:04:58.421 --> 00:05:03.421
<v Speaker 3>failed so dramatically and so publicly that for her to bridge the gap between</v>

145
00:05:03.521 --> 00:05:04.660
<v Speaker 3>her current persona,</v>

146
00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:05.231
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

147
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 3>and the reality that was manifested in that video would require a very</v>

148
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 3>comprehensive personality overhaul.</v>

149
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 3>And that's a very unpleasant thing to do.</v>

150
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:19.140
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of falling apart and burning away that accompanies that because it</v>

151
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:23.350
<v Speaker 3>isn't clear to me that she was wrong on a superficial level.</v>

152
00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:24.161
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

153
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 3>maybe she was having an off day,</v>

154
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.500
<v Speaker 3>like it's possible,</v>

155
00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

156
00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.900
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

157
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

158
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.480
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think that that video would have had the carrying power it had if it</v>

159
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.350
<v Speaker 3>was merely indicative of an otherwise competent journalist.</v>

160
00:05:37.351 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 3>Having a bad day.</v>

161
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

162
00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.460
<v Speaker 3>It seems to me that was a manifestation of a style that she's used quite</v>

163
00:05:42.461 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 3>successfully in the past,</v>

164
00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.513
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

165
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.240
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

166
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.240
<v Speaker 3>that has had its short term expedient advantages.</v>

167
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.110
<v Speaker 3>But that is a,</v>

168
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.440
<v Speaker 3>is not a credible strategy for someone who's playing a deep and honest game.</v>

169
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 3>So there's a lot of,</v>

170
00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.000
<v Speaker 3>my sense was that the video indicated that there was a lot of work to be done,</v>

171
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.120
<v Speaker 3>but not only on her part because you know,</v>

172
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.013
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>

173
00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:11.420
<v Speaker 3>she was involved in that personally,</v>

174
00:06:11.421 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 3>but she was also the,</v>

175
00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:13.551
<v Speaker 3>the mouthpiece,</v>

176
00:06:13.551 --> 00:06:14.031
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

177
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 3>of an entire organization that was oriented to words,</v>

178
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 3>having her do exactly what she did and,</v>

179
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:21.224
<v Speaker 3>and the,</v>

180
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:22.371
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

181
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 3>what I expected to happen was that why have the interview and then channel four</v>

182
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:29.630
<v Speaker 3>would chop it and cut it according to their tastes,</v>

183
00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.690
<v Speaker 3>which is essentially what they did for the broadcast and that the rest of it</v>

184
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.381
<v Speaker 3>would disappear.</v>

185
00:06:33.381 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 3>I think it was unbelievably naive of them to put it up online,</v>

186
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 3>but they did.</v>

187
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:40.123
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

188
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:41.750
<v Speaker 3>well do they credit to some,</v>

189
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:43.363
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

190
00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

191
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:48.343
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

192
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 3>Maybe.</v>

193
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.360
<v Speaker 3>I think it was more,</v>

194
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.900
<v Speaker 3>they thought it went fine and then didn't understand what the fuss was about.</v>

195
00:06:53.901 --> 00:06:57.720
<v Speaker 3>And then where they genuinely outraged that she was quote,</v>

196
00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.670
<v Speaker 3>victimized.</v>

197
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.690
<v Speaker 3>Or was that just a cynical ploy to,</v>

198
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.840
<v Speaker 3>to spin the narrative in,</v>

199
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:04.200
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

200
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 3>in an acceptable direction?</v>

201
00:07:05.481 --> 00:07:05.811
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

202
00:07:05.811 --> 00:07:05.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

203
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 3>a little of column a and a little of column B,</v>

204
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.721
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

205
00:07:08.721 --> 00:07:09.890
<v Speaker 3>but that also failed,</v>

206
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 3>which was quite interesting because for about four days after the interview,</v>

207
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.570
<v Speaker 3>the narrative that victim narrative was picked up by many newspapers and spun</v>

208
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:18.021
<v Speaker 3>heart,</v>

209
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

210
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.530
<v Speaker 3>that there was security threats and that she was now in danger and there's no</v>

211
00:07:21.531 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 3>credible evidence for that whatsoever.</v>

212
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 3>But that came out,</v>

213
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 3>there was a flurry of activity around that and then that just got criticized to</v>

214
00:07:28.701 --> 00:07:30.560
<v Speaker 3>death and disappeared as a strategy.</v>

215
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

216
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>so would you say that it's possibly a part of the collective shadow manifesting</v>

217
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 2>in projecting itself and maybe it was just become country?</v>

218
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.993
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

219
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:43.980
<v Speaker 2>I guess that the torch bearer for,</v>

220
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:44.441
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

221
00:07:44.441 --> 00:07:45.610
<v Speaker 3>I think that's often the case,</v>

222
00:07:45.611 --> 00:07:45.821
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

223
00:07:45.821 --> 00:07:46.654
<v Speaker 3>I mean the media,</v>

224
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:48.880
<v Speaker 3>the media chases as much as it leads.</v>

225
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.560
<v Speaker 3>And so it's,</v>

226
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:50.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

227
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.730
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

228
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:52.150
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

229
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.700
<v Speaker 3>a positive feedback loop between the media and the,</v>

230
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:55.890
<v Speaker 3>and the partners.</v>

231
00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.081
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

232
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:56.591
<v Speaker 3>that's partly,</v>

233
00:07:56.591 --> 00:07:59.620
<v Speaker 3>I think what's driving polarization is exactly that.</v>

234
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 3>And I think that the interview was an example of what's driving polarization.</v>

235
00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:06.970
<v Speaker 3>And that's partly why people sat up and took notice of it.</v>

236
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:07.271
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

237
00:08:07.271 --> 00:08:07.571
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

238
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:08.530
<v Speaker 3>this is where we're at.</v>

239
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.070
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

240
00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:09.431
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

241
00:08:09.431 --> 00:08:10.150
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>

242
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

243
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.830
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

244
00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:13.480
<v Speaker 2>is there a place to bridge this polarization?</v>

245
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:17.890
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps that the perspective of holding,</v>

246
00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.040
<v Speaker 2>holding the tension of opposites and being able to see critically both sides.</v>

247
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:26.190
<v Speaker 2>There's a philosophy that I followed for years.</v>

248
00:08:26.191 --> 00:08:30.070
<v Speaker 2>I'm Daniel Dennett who's saying that you're wanting to engage in a discussion</v>

249
00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:30.904
<v Speaker 2>with someone and,</v>

250
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:31.721
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

251
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:32.410
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

252
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.460
<v Speaker 2>move or progress the conversation forward.</v>

253
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:36.780
<v Speaker 2>That there are some steps to that including,</v>

254
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:37.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

255
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:37.900
<v Speaker 2>always.</v>

256
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:38.733
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

257
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.580
<v Speaker 2>what you say in chapter nine of your book is act as if the person that you're</v>

258
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.980
<v Speaker 2>talking to you or just need to have something to offer.</v>

259
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.370
<v Speaker 2>And it didn't seem apparent that that was the case and that,</v>

260
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.243
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

261
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.110
<v Speaker 3>well that's the mistake I think.</v>

262
00:08:51.111 --> 00:08:51.291
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

263
00:08:51.291 --> 00:08:52.124
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

264
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 3>the two people who are engaged in the process of dialectic,</v>

265
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:57.210
<v Speaker 3>let's say you have to be of goodwill,</v>

266
00:08:57.690 --> 00:08:57.991
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

267
00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:58.161
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

268
00:08:58.161 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 3>and they have to be oriented I would say towards peace and they can be oriented</v>

269
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:02.791
<v Speaker 3>towards victory.</v>

270
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:04.950
<v Speaker 3>But then of course that's a combat and it doesn't,</v>

271
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 3>perhaps it's sometimes the case that there are times when one conversation,</v>

272
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 3>it should be combat,</v>

273
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's not very often that that should be the case.</v>

274
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:14.311
<v Speaker 3>Most of the time.</v>

275
00:09:14.311 --> 00:09:15.144
<v Speaker 3>It should be,</v>

276
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:16.890
<v Speaker 3>what would you call it,</v>

277
00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:17.783
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

278
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.973
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

279
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 3>peacemaking that you're devoted to because especially if you're discussing</v>

280
00:09:23.401 --> 00:09:28.401
<v Speaker 3>something important and it should be assuming that you're able to trust the</v>

281
00:09:28.411 --> 00:09:28.951
<v Speaker 3>other person,</v>

282
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 3>which means they have to bring goodwill into the situation.</v>

283
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.410
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to do is bridge the gap because that's what forestalls</v>

284
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:34.981
<v Speaker 3>conflict,</v>

285
00:09:34.981 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

286
00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 3>If you can't solve the problem,</v>

287
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.820
<v Speaker 3>then what you have is,</v>

288
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.860
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

289
00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 3>is you have conflict.</v>

290
00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:40.441
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

291
00:09:40.441 --> 00:09:40.921
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

292
00:09:40.921 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

293
00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.140
<v Speaker 3>and maybe you're ready for that.</v>

294
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:43.860
<v Speaker 3>And that's,</v>

295
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 3>I suppose if you're ready for that,</v>

296
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 3>well then that's,</v>

297
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.621
<v Speaker 3>that's how it goes.</v>

298
00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:48.640
<v Speaker 3>But a wise person we'll,</v>

299
00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk for a long time before they engage in actual conflict.</v>

300
00:09:53.250 --> 00:09:53.730
<v Speaker 3>So yes.</v>

301
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Speaking of conflict,</v>

302
00:09:54.771 --> 00:09:57.920
<v Speaker 2>do you think that in times of crises and chaos and conflict,</v>

303
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.860
<v Speaker 2>that's an architypes rise up and spring forth?</v>

304
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.870
<v Speaker 2>Like perhaps that trickster archetype?</v>

305
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:04.940
<v Speaker 3>Well that's Milo Yiannopoulos.</v>

306
00:10:04.941 --> 00:10:05.680
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

307
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:05.860
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

308
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.550
<v Speaker 3>And comedians play that role all the time.</v>

309
00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:09.850
<v Speaker 3>And comedians play a disproportionate role on,</v>

310
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:10.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

311
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:10.870
<v Speaker 3>on Youtube.</v>

312
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:12.320
<v Speaker 3>I would say in guiding the dialogue,</v>

313
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:13.850
<v Speaker 3>most of the people that I know,</v>

314
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:16.250
<v Speaker 3>they're astute political commentators on,</v>

315
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.000
<v Speaker 3>on Youtube and hoof attracted large following of a very large number of them are</v>

316
00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:20.720
<v Speaker 3>comedians.</v>

317
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.830
<v Speaker 2>Would you call yourself,</v>

318
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:22.100
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

319
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:23.170
<v Speaker 2>in October because you,</v>

320
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.450
<v Speaker 2>you do last night I was,</v>

321
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.040
<v Speaker 3>what do you know a wise person?</v>

322
00:10:27.041 --> 00:10:29.470
<v Speaker 3>Make sure they stay dissociated from the archetypes</v>

323
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.920
<v Speaker 2>even if it gets put onto them because you,</v>

324
00:10:32.921 --> 00:10:36.390
<v Speaker 2>you do seem to be the penultimate tell father pick up of the surrogate father.</v>

325
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:37.251
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

326
00:10:37.251 --> 00:10:38.160
<v Speaker 3>that's not too bad.</v>

327
00:10:38.161 --> 00:10:39.620
<v Speaker 3>That if that's the archetype,</v>

328
00:10:39.621 --> 00:10:40.460
<v Speaker 3>that's not too bad,</v>

329
00:10:40.461 --> 00:10:40.761
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

330
00:10:40.761 --> 00:10:41.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's,</v>

331
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:42.270
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

332
00:10:42.270 --> 00:10:43.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm of the right age for that.</v>

333
00:10:43.911 --> 00:10:44.120
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

334
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.780
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

335
00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:45.290
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

336
00:10:45.290 --> 00:10:46.550
<v Speaker 3>my discussions too,</v>

337
00:10:46.551 --> 00:10:48.140
<v Speaker 3>people are salutary so that,</v>

338
00:10:48.141 --> 00:10:48.770
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

339
00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.620
<v Speaker 3>that's a reasonable role to play.</v>

340
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:54.740
<v Speaker 3>I would say there's not too much psychological danger in that.</v>

341
00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:55.720
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

342
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.400
<v Speaker 2>and just one final question,</v>

343
00:10:57.401 --> 00:11:01.360
<v Speaker 2>just in terms of your meteoric rise in the last two years,</v>

344
00:11:01.361 --> 00:11:02.194
<v Speaker 2>I'll just say,</v>

345
00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:06.480
<v Speaker 2>how has the start and being,</v>

346
00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

347
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:07.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

348
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.770
<v Speaker 2>I was out there in the line,</v>

349
00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:09.610
<v Speaker 2>the cues this today,</v>

350
00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.480
<v Speaker 2>even just,</v>

351
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm misquoting the um,</v>

352
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.300
<v Speaker 2>archable Peyto down.</v>

353
00:11:13.301 --> 00:11:13.661
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

354
00:11:13.661 --> 00:11:14.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

355
00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:15.110
<v Speaker 2>he's quite handsome.</v>

356
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.680
<v Speaker 2>He's a quite good looking fellow in real life.</v>

357
00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

358
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.820
<v Speaker 2>young men were quivering at the knees yesterday saying,</v>

359
00:11:21.821 --> 00:11:22.271
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>

360
00:11:22.271 --> 00:11:23.410
<v Speaker 2>I've just met Jordan Peterson.</v>

361
00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:24.940
<v Speaker 2>Elderly women were like,</v>

362
00:11:24.941 --> 00:11:25.330
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

363
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.163
<v Speaker 2>I wish she wasn't married.</v>

364
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.830
<v Speaker 2>How do you take all that with a grain of salt,</v>

365
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.390
<v Speaker 2>with humility,</v>

366
00:11:31.391 --> 00:11:34.120
<v Speaker 2>knowing that there's a spectrum between humility and Hubris?</v>

367
00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.590
<v Speaker 2>I do know that you have close people in your core that</v>

368
00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:39.431
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

369
00:11:39.431 --> 00:11:39.581
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

370
00:11:39.581 --> 00:11:39.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

371
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:43.960
<v Speaker 3>I was a psychotherapist for a very long time and you get accustomed to dealing</v>

372
00:11:43.961 --> 00:11:44.320
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>

373
00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.370
<v Speaker 3>with the variance of that,</v>

374
00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:46.204
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

375
00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:46.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

376
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.830
<v Speaker 3>you stay detached.</v>

377
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:49.143
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean,</v>

378
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean detached in that you don't care,</v>

379
00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.240
<v Speaker 3>but you have to not have to stay outside of the drama in some sense.</v>

380
00:11:57.671 --> 00:11:58.170
<v Speaker 3>I guess.</v>

381
00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Like it isn't that you don't take it seriously,</v>

382
00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 3>but you see it for what it is.</v>

383
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:04.601
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

384
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:05.830
<v Speaker 3>If people are star struck,</v>

385
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:06.210
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

386
00:12:06.210 --> 00:12:09.310
<v Speaker 3>they're struck by a projection of their own imagination in large part.</v>

387
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:09.581
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

388
00:12:09.581 --> 00:12:11.080
<v Speaker 3>And I can see that in people's faces.</v>

389
00:12:11.081 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

390
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:14.260
<v Speaker 3>And I try very rapidly to get over that.</v>

391
00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:15.120
<v Speaker 3>And also,</v>

392
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.340
<v Speaker 3>so if someone comes up to me and they're nervous and they're sort of,</v>

393
00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:20.090
<v Speaker 3>let's say starstruck,</v>

394
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 3>for lack of a better word,</v>

395
00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 3>I can usually eliminate that immediately because I just talked to them very</v>

396
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:29.110
<v Speaker 3>directly and then they calm down and then we have a conversation that's much</v>

397
00:12:29.111 --> 00:12:29.740
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

398
00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:30.573
<v Speaker 3>It's much better.</v>

399
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.301
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

400
00:12:31.301 --> 00:12:33.790
<v Speaker 2>I do see you doing that are very intense.</v>

401
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.753
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

402
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

403
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:37.751
<v Speaker 2>Dr. Peterson.</v>

404
00:12:37.751 --> 00:12:41.740
<v Speaker 2>I am very grateful and thankful you having done this interview with me and I</v>

405
00:12:41.741 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 2>really appreciate,</v>

406
00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.450
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

407
00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:44.290
<v Speaker 2>the synchronicity.</v>

408
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:44.591
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

409
00:12:44.591 --> 00:12:47.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm going by you and a lot because I'm Indian,</v>

410
00:12:48.070 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 2>but the synchronicity of being here and being allowed to do that.</v>

411
00:12:50.711 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 2>Do you do find that that's the part of your life as well?</v>

412
00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Which the synchronicity.</v>

413
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.273
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

414
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.190
<v Speaker 3>you have no idea.</v>

415
00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.720
<v Speaker 3>I would love to hear a story.</v>

416
00:12:58.721 --> 00:12:59.201
<v Speaker 3>I heard y'all go,</v>

417
00:12:59.201 --> 00:12:59.310
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

418
00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 2>stories and the tap tap through to the car and the owl and you didn't go further</v>

419
00:13:04.471 --> 00:13:04.861
<v Speaker 2>into that.</v>

420
00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:07.830
<v Speaker 2>But I'd like to know if you care to share.</v>

421
00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:08.860
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

422
00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>

423
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:10.780
<v Speaker 3>they're too complex to layout.</v>

424
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.500
<v Speaker 3>Most of them have been associated with frog imagery.</v>

425
00:13:14.501 --> 00:13:15.040
<v Speaker 3>I would say it,</v>

426
00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 3>but I can't say more than that because it's just too complicated.</v>

427
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.011
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

428
00:13:18.011 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 3>it's like trying to explain a dream.</v>

429
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:20.171
<v Speaker 3>It's very,</v>

430
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:21.004
<v Speaker 3>very hard.</v>

431
00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Remember the dream that you recounted and I'm big on the Chantilly in the middle</v>

432
00:13:24.721 --> 00:13:24.821
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

433
00:13:24.821 --> 00:13:25.380
<v Speaker 2>did you,</v>

434
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:27.360
<v Speaker 2>did you end up resolving that?</v>

435
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:28.421
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
