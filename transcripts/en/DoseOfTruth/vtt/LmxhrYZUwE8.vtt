1
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.080
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've thought</v>

2
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.623
<v Speaker 1>a bit of a tangent,</v>

3
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.450
<v Speaker 1>but I'll move back to the mortal afterwards.</v>

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

5
00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I really liked the psycho analyst and I liked the idea that you have a psyche</v>

6
00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 1>that's inside of you and that that is structured in partly consciously and in</v>

7
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:25.700
<v Speaker 1>part conch unconsciously.</v>

8
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.300
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that's really cool and I've learned a lot from the</v>

9
00:00:29.301 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>psychoanalyst,</v>

10
00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:31.131
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

11
00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:36.131
<v Speaker 1>there is a funny consequence of thinking the way they think and you do think the</v>

12
00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:36.891
<v Speaker 1>way they think,</v>

13
00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:37.880
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't know it.</v>

14
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Like we tend to think that a lot of us is inside our head.</v>

15
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

16
00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.330
<v Speaker 1>that's the psyche model basically.</v>

17
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>But the more I've practiced as a clinical psychologist,</v>

18
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.171
<v Speaker 1>the last,</v>

19
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:50.150
<v Speaker 1>I've actually been convinced that that's true.</v>

20
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.711
<v Speaker 1>So I could say,</v>

21
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:52.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.530
<v Speaker 1>let's say I want to know about your personality.</v>

23
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.431
<v Speaker 1>We think,</v>

24
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:55.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:56.420
<v Speaker 1>I want to know you.</v>

26
00:00:56.421 --> 00:00:58.910
<v Speaker 1>I want to know about your subjectivity.</v>

27
00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:00.380
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to know what's inside of you.</v>

28
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't actually what you do.</v>

29
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:02.591
<v Speaker 1>Want to know if,</v>

30
00:01:02.591 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

31
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.010
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing clinical work,</v>

32
00:01:04.011 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 1>say with someone you want to know,</v>

33
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.660
<v Speaker 1>did they have any friends?</v>

34
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 1>That's really important because if you're miserable and anxious and badly placed</v>

35
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>in life and misbehaving,</v>

36
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons that all of that can occur is because you don't have any</v>

37
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:20.361
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

38
00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:21.194
<v Speaker 1>You don't know anyone,</v>

39
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>and that's not something that's inside you.</v>

40
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

41
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 1>it's you localized in a broader sphere.</v>

42
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:29.331
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>

43
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:29.571
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>do you have a job and well,</v>

45
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:32.840
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about the job.</v>

46
00:01:32.841 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you actually make enough money with your job?</v>

47
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>Is it satisfying for you in any way?</v>

48
00:01:37.071 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Are you bullied all the time?</v>

49
00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:39.224
<v Speaker 1>When you're at work?</v>

50
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Does it provoke anxiety?</v>

51
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Is it a career that allows you to go somewhere?</v>

52
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Are you overwork?</v>

53
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.270
<v Speaker 1>but let's start with just the first question.</v>

55
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a job?</v>

56
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>if the answer to that is no,</v>

58
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>you have a serious problem and that would enough.</v>

59
00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.860
<v Speaker 1>Might be too depressed you and make you anxious and hopeless and nihilistic and</v>

60
00:01:57.861 --> 00:01:58.694
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

61
00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:59.751
<v Speaker 1>And you could say,</v>

62
00:01:59.751 --> 00:01:59.961
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:02.660
<v Speaker 1>you're not reacting very well to not having a job,</v>

64
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's kind of a foolish objection.</v>

65
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Even though some of it might be true.</v>

66
00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.660
<v Speaker 1>One problem is,</v>

67
00:02:07.661 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 1>is that you're not reacting very well to not having a job.</v>

68
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>But another problem is that you don't have a job and that actually constitutes a</v>

69
00:02:14.061 --> 00:02:14.894
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>

70
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to eat.</v>

72
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a place to live.</v>

73
00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 1>So those aren't psychological problems.</v>

74
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:20.601
<v Speaker 1>Precisely,</v>

75
00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:23.450
<v Speaker 1>even though a psychological problem could make it worse.</v>

76
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>are you as educated as you should be?</v>

78
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.710
<v Speaker 1>That's another question.</v>

79
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.540
<v Speaker 1>How do you handle drugs and alcohol?</v>

80
00:02:29.541 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Are they taking you down a bad pathway?</v>

81
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.533
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

82
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.463
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

83
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 1>what about intimate relationships be have one,</v>

84
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.380
<v Speaker 1>you have a plan for one or they,</v>

85
00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.690
<v Speaker 1>is that a never ending series of catastrophes or something that you avoid</v>

86
00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:42.524
<v Speaker 1>completely.</v>

87
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.670
<v Speaker 1>That's a big problem.</v>

88
00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>And maybe people don't,</v>

89
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>aren't attracted to you for one reason or another.</v>

90
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 1>And you could think about that as a psychological problem,</v>

91
00:02:49.851 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's an interpersonal problem.</v>

92
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>And the degree to which that's a psychological problem is,</v>

93
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>is certainly an unspecified.</v>

94
00:02:58.251 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>When you first begin talk to somebody,</v>

95
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>what about your family?</v>

96
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you have a family?</v>

97
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's hard to be in the world all by yourself.</v>

98
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

99
00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>It makes things a lot more stressful.</v>

100
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.840
<v Speaker 1>Even though having a family can also be extraordinarily stressful.</v>

101
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't,</v>

102
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>do you have plans to have children?</v>

103
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>How are you doing with your parents?</v>

104
00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you get along with your siblings?</v>

105
00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.261
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

106
00:03:17.261 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 1>all of that.</v>

107
00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.500
<v Speaker 1>All of that to me is more fundamental.</v>

108
00:03:20.501 --> 00:03:21.670
<v Speaker 1>And it's outside of you.</v>

109
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
<v Speaker 1>Those are elements of your experience more broadly conceptualized more than they</v>

110
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>are objects of your psychology or of your internal experience.</v>

111
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

112
00:03:31.891 --> 00:03:32.724
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like</v>

113
00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:37.521
<v Speaker 1>while a person is,</v>

114
00:03:37.521 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.450
<v Speaker 1>is it is a creature that exists at multiple levels of analysis,</v>

116
00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

117
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Something might go wrong with you at a cellular level,</v>

118
00:03:45.351 --> 00:03:47.750
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you're born with a genetic abnormality,</v>

119
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.060
<v Speaker 1>so something's wrong with you molecularly,</v>

120
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.670
<v Speaker 1>or you have something wrong with a major Oregon.</v>

121
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe there's something wrong with you psychologically.</v>

122
00:03:55.371 --> 00:03:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're in a pathological family or maybe you're stuck in a pathological</v>

123
00:03:59.721 --> 00:04:04.721
<v Speaker 1>social system and and figuring out what's why you're suffering means going up</v>

124
00:04:06.051 --> 00:04:07.250
<v Speaker 1>and down those different levels.</v>

125
00:04:07.251 --> 00:04:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Trying to specify the appropriate level for analysis and also the appropriate</v>

126
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:12.260
<v Speaker 1>level for intervention.</v>

127
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:13.880
<v Speaker 1>And for me as a,</v>

128
00:04:13.881 --> 00:04:14.481
<v Speaker 1>as I've said,</v>

129
00:04:14.481 --> 00:04:17.990
<v Speaker 1>even though I'm a great admirer of the psychoanalysts and I do things like dream</v>

130
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:18.471
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

131
00:04:18.471 --> 00:04:23.270
<v Speaker 1>which I really find you an incredibly useful and enlightening the first,</v>

132
00:04:23.271 --> 00:04:24.890
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental level of analysis is,</v>

133
00:04:24.891 --> 00:04:25.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

134
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:26.750
<v Speaker 1>what's your experience structured like?</v>

135
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.973
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

136
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.750
<v Speaker 1>And that isn't localized in you.</v>

137
00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Now the behaviorists do that too because what's one of the things I really liked</v>

138
00:04:33.831 --> 00:04:35.690
<v Speaker 1>about the behavioral approach to psychotherapy,</v>

139
00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:36.111
<v Speaker 1>it's very,</v>

140
00:04:36.111 --> 00:04:37.400
<v Speaker 1>very concrete and practical.</v>

141
00:04:37.401 --> 00:04:38.720
<v Speaker 1>It's like they'll say,</v>

142
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:39.554
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

143
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:43.070
<v Speaker 1>there's certain things that you need to have in order to live properly and maybe</v>

144
00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:46.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the skills or the wherewithal wherewithal to accumulate them and</v>

145
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 1>we'll break them down into tiny little pieces and you'll practice.</v>

146
00:04:49.551 --> 00:04:49.731
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

147
00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:50.564
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

148
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 1>with someone who doesn't have any friends,</v>

149
00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:57.431
<v Speaker 1>then you do a micro analysis of their social skills saying maybe an analysis of</v>

150
00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:01.550
<v Speaker 1>the kinds of anxiety that are stopping them from going out and meeting people</v>

151
00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.120
<v Speaker 1>and then you address those things practically one by one you tried to get the</v>

152
00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:06.230
<v Speaker 1>person to have some friends.</v>

153
00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.650
<v Speaker 1>He tried to figure out how they can establish an intimate relationship.</v>

154
00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:12.080
<v Speaker 1>You see if you can help them sort out their family,</v>

155
00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 1>you do what you can about their employment.</v>

156
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:18.320
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's only tangentially related to really in some sense to the</v>

157
00:05:18.321 --> 00:05:19.490
<v Speaker 1>structure of their psyche.</v>

158
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.380
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you'll see if you work as a clinician or as a counselor is</v>

159
00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:27.410
<v Speaker 1>that most of the time people come and see you because they have problems,</v>

160
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:29.270
<v Speaker 1>not because they have psychological problems.</v>

161
00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.480
<v Speaker 1>And those things are not that easy to distinguish.</v>

162
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

163
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:34.820
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of the psychoanalytic idea,</v>

164
00:05:34.821 --> 00:05:35.271
<v Speaker 1>sort of like,</v>

165
00:05:35.271 --> 00:05:36.860
<v Speaker 1>well if you just start your act together,</v>

166
00:05:36.861 --> 00:05:38.270
<v Speaker 1>everything would work out for you.</v>

167
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

168
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.063
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

169
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.420
<v Speaker 1>there's some truth in that,</v>

170
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.153
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

171
00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.601
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

172
00:05:49.601 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 1>if you're 55 years old and you've just been laid off work</v>

173
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>and maybe through no fault of your own,</v>

174
00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious how much getting your act together,</v>

175
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:04.310
<v Speaker 1>it's going to help you find another job because the actual problem that you're</v>

176
00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>facing me have relatively little to do with you.</v>

177
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:12.110
<v Speaker 1>And that would especially be the case if you're maybe on the bottom half of the</v>

178
00:06:12.111 --> 00:06:14.150
<v Speaker 1>intelligence distribution for example.</v>

179
00:06:14.151 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't as easy for you just to go out and pick up new skills at the</v>

180
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>drop of a hat,</v>

181
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

182
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>And that gets harder as you get older because your Iq actually declines quite</v>

183
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>substantially as you get older.</v>

184
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.360
<v Speaker 1>The working or the the fluid intelligence part anyways,</v>

185
00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 1>exercise can keep that at bay,</v>

186
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:31.911
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

187
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>It's the best way to keep that at bay.</v>

188
00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:35.263
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

189
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.210
<v Speaker 1>you can think from the phenomenological viewpoint of your experience as a whole</v>

190
00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.390
<v Speaker 1>instead of you being a subject in an objective world.</v>

191
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:45.920
<v Speaker 1>And so here's another way of,</v>

192
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.930
<v Speaker 1>here's something that's quite useful.</v>

193
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You'll,</v>

194
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Elon talked about this because he was moving towards a phenomenological</v>

195
00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:52.460
<v Speaker 1>perspective later in his life.</v>

196
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.570
<v Speaker 1>The last book he wrote was called mysterium connectionists and he talked about</v>

197
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:01.490
<v Speaker 1>three conjunctions that needed to take place in order for someone to be well</v>

198
00:07:01.491 --> 00:07:03.200
<v Speaker 1>constituted psychologically.</v>

199
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.560
<v Speaker 1>And you know how Piaget talked about learning that you could not only follow</v>

200
00:07:08.931 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>rules but that you could make rules for new games is sort of the highest level</v>

201
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:13.190
<v Speaker 1>of moral development.</v>

202
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I would say young extended the Piagetian moral continuum up past what Piaget had</v>

203
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>envisioned.</v>

204
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:22.333
<v Speaker 1>Now he didn't,</v>

205
00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do that cause he wasn't trying to extend Piaget's model.</v>

206
00:07:25.401 --> 00:07:26.234
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

207
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:30.260
<v Speaker 1>but you can think about it the same way and it's not easy to come up with a</v>

208
00:07:30.261 --> 00:07:35.261
<v Speaker 1>moral motive being say that transcends the ability to make rules for new games.</v>

209
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.190
<v Speaker 1>That's damn smart man.</v>

210
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:37.471
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

211
00:07:37.471 --> 00:07:37.700
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

212
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a major home run by Piaget as far as I'm concerned.</v>

213
00:07:40.851 --> 00:07:42.920
<v Speaker 1>But Young said something like this said,</v>

214
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

215
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.460
<v Speaker 1>when you're going through the process of psychological integration,</v>

216
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of conceptualizing it.</v>

217
00:07:50.301 --> 00:07:55.301
<v Speaker 1>And he thought about this as symbolically as male female pairings.</v>

218
00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.910
<v Speaker 1>Because as I've tried to point out the most,</v>

219
00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 1>one of the most fundamental character categories that are mythological</v>

220
00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:06.110
<v Speaker 1>imagination uses to structure the world is the category of masculine and</v>

221
00:08:06.111 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 1>feminine.</v>

222
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.060
<v Speaker 1>And in moves that around,</v>

223
00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.331
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

224
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:08.581
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

225
00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:09.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a fundamental metaphor.</v>

226
00:08:09.741 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 1>So you can move that around anywhere.</v>

227
00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And so young thought,</v>

228
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:16.280
<v Speaker 1>well one of the things that you're trying to do is to get your thoughts and your</v>

229
00:08:16.281 --> 00:08:18.140
<v Speaker 1>emotions integrated.</v>

230
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:19.431
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

231
00:08:19.431 --> 00:08:19.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

232
00:08:19.761 --> 00:08:21.560
<v Speaker 1>the Classic Enlightenment Viewpoint,</v>

233
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.760
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking,</v>

234
00:08:22.761 --> 00:08:26.000
<v Speaker 1>is something like passion is the enemy of reason,</v>

235
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.231
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

236
00:08:27.231 --> 00:08:29.330
<v Speaker 1>And so to the degree that your rational,</v>

237
00:08:29.331 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of a Friday of viewpoint.</v>

238
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:35.060
<v Speaker 1>It's cause he got your emotions under control and there's some truth in that,</v>

239
00:08:35.061 --> 00:08:36.620
<v Speaker 1>but not enough truth.</v>

240
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.540
<v Speaker 1>I like the Piagetian idea better,</v>

241
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:39.490
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>

242
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:39.690
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

243
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

244
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what happens.</v>

245
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:41.870
<v Speaker 1>What happens if,</v>

246
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing the proper game is that you integrate your emotions</v>

247
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.851
<v Speaker 1>underneath.</v>

248
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:48.290
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking something like that.</v>

249
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.510
<v Speaker 1>So they're all working in the same direction,</v>

250
00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:50.841
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

251
00:08:50.841 --> 00:08:52.220
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

252
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>you can make your anxiety work against you or for you.</v>

253
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.490
<v Speaker 1>And one of the ways I did it,</v>

254
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I made a program called the future authoring program that I think helps people</v>

255
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 1>do that because one of the things you see when you're talking to people and</v>

256
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>they're trying to solve problems is that they're afraid to face the problem.</v>

257
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.890
<v Speaker 1>And so then their anxiety is working against them.</v>

258
00:09:10.891 --> 00:09:12.090
<v Speaker 1>And you can think about it as a,</v>

259
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.640
<v Speaker 1>as antagonistic to rationality,</v>

260
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.291
<v Speaker 1>but then I could say,</v>

261
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:16.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

262
00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 1>why don't you think for a while about what your life would be like if you didn't</v>

263
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>face this problem?</v>

264
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think that through,</v>

265
00:09:24.061 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>if you have a problem and you really think through what the consequences are</v>

266
00:09:28.291 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 1>going to be in three to five years of not facing it,</v>

267
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to get more afraid of not facing it,</v>

268
00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:33.954
<v Speaker 1>then facing it.</v>

269
00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's great because then your anxiety instead of standing in front of you,</v>

270
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>instead of you having a dragon that's guarding the path in front of you,</v>

271
00:09:41.881 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 1>where you have one chasing you down the path from behind,</v>

272
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.560
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot more useful.</v>

273
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.143
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

274
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:48.721
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:53.721
<v Speaker 1>that's just a minimal example of the utility of getting your emotions and your,</v>

276
00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 1>and your thoughts aligned the same way.</v>

277
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens with aggression.</v>

278
00:09:59.100 --> 00:09:59.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

279
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.690
<v Speaker 1>one of the most common reasons that people come and seek psychotherapy really is</v>

280
00:10:03.691 --> 00:10:04.950
<v Speaker 1>because they're too agreeable.</v>

281
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:07.350
<v Speaker 1>But what that means is they're not assertive enough.</v>

282
00:10:07.351 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>They have an integrated their capacity for aggression.</v>

283
00:10:09.511 --> 00:10:12.190
<v Speaker 1>And so other people can push them around and,</v>

284
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.730
<v Speaker 1>and they're very conflict avoidant.</v>

285
00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:15.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

286
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.920
<v Speaker 1>and so the consequences of that across time is that you don't stand up for</v>

287
00:10:19.921 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>yourself well enough and you get taken advantage of and that spirals badly</v>

288
00:10:24.481 --> 00:10:24.991
<v Speaker 1>downward.</v>

289
00:10:24.991 --> 00:10:29.991
<v Speaker 1>And so partly what you do when you're doing assertiveness training with people</v>

290
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 1>is you find out what they're angry about.</v>

291
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 1>And there are usually Angley angry if they're not assertive enough because other</v>

292
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 1>people are taking advantage of them.</v>

293
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Or You could say because they're not putting their own necessities forward with</v>

294
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:43.741
<v Speaker 1>enough force.</v>

295
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to distinguish between those two things.</v>

296
00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:47.011
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

297
00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:48.440
<v Speaker 1>you try,</v>

298
00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 1>you get them to talk about what they're angry about that often makes them cry</v>

299
00:10:51.810 --> 00:10:53.460
<v Speaker 1>often many times.</v>

300
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.850
<v Speaker 1>And then you get them to kind of envision what they would want to have in stead,</v>

301
00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:01.830
<v Speaker 1>which they're often afraid to do because people are afraid to think about what</v>

302
00:11:01.831 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 1>they want because that makes it more clear when they're not getting it.</v>

303
00:11:05.521 --> 00:11:06.630
<v Speaker 1>And that's painful,</v>

304
00:11:06.631 --> 00:11:06.871
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

305
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they're afraid of hoping so they won't specify a clear aim.</v>

306
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.041
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>

307
00:11:11.041 --> 00:11:13.310
<v Speaker 1>you get them to think about what they might want.</v>

308
00:11:13.330 --> 00:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>Instead you get them to think about the costs of not pursuing that and then you</v>

309
00:11:17.581 --> 00:11:22.581
<v Speaker 1>help them develop strategies for integrating their aggression and with their</v>

310
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:27.930
<v Speaker 1>thinking so that they can come up with a plan to approach the world in a more</v>

311
00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:28.770
<v Speaker 1>confident way.</v>

312
00:11:28.770 --> 00:11:29.551
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

313
00:11:29.551 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>someone might come to me and say,</v>

314
00:11:30.721 --> 00:11:32.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm being bullied badly at work.</v>

315
00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:34.080
<v Speaker 1>And so then I'll say,</v>

316
00:11:34.081 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

317
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 1>what are your options?</v>

318
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.620
<v Speaker 1>You have to put up with it.</v>

319
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Well we'll,</v>

320
00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.361
<v Speaker 1>we'll figure that out.</v>

321
00:11:39.361 --> 00:11:40.081
<v Speaker 1>Cause maybe you do,</v>

322
00:11:40.081 --> 00:11:41.190
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't have options,</v>

323
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 1>but here's how to find out.</v>

324
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Get your damn CV together so it's pristine,</v>

325
00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:46.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

326
00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:46.990
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

327
00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:51.150
<v Speaker 1>it's ready to go get over your fear of a new interview because it people are</v>

328
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:52.140
<v Speaker 1>generally afraid of that.</v>

329
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Get over your,</v>

330
00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 1>of applying for a new job.</v>

331
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Start thinking about what it would mean to have a different job.</v>

332
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Start thinking about what it would mean to have a better job even because maybe</v>

333
00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 1>your fear is just making you stuck here.</v>

334
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you one thing,</v>

335
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 1>if someone's picking on you at work and you don't have options,</v>

336
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.543
<v Speaker 1>you lose.</v>

337
00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:12.640
<v Speaker 1>So you get the person to start building a strategy.</v>

338
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:12.971
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

339
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

340
00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to tell this person to stop,</v>

341
00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.990
<v Speaker 1>you have to know how to make them stop and one and the one thing you need for</v>

342
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:21.220
<v Speaker 1>sure is an option.</v>

343
00:12:21.610 --> 00:12:22.443
<v Speaker 1>And if you can't,</v>

344
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have an option,</v>

345
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:27.700
<v Speaker 1>then maybe we start thinking about the fact that you need some more training or</v>

346
00:12:27.701 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 1>something like that because you cannot negotiate if you don't have any power.</v>

347
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.460
<v Speaker 1>So because while,</v>

348
00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.730
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're dealing with someone who's really out to get you or really</v>

349
00:12:36.731 --> 00:12:37.564
<v Speaker 1>disagreeable,</v>

350
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 1>if you don't have a leg to stand on and they'll just push you over and maybe</v>

351
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:43.180
<v Speaker 1>they'll jump on youtube because that's what they're like and they enjoy it</v>

352
00:12:43.181 --> 00:12:43.591
<v Speaker 1>anyways.</v>

353
00:12:43.591 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 1>So it's no joke.</v>

354
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.780
<v Speaker 1>So you'll put your options behind you and then you start to think about</v>

355
00:12:49.781 --> 00:12:50.351
<v Speaker 1>strategies.</v>

356
00:12:50.351 --> 00:12:51.161
<v Speaker 1>So I tell people,</v>

357
00:12:51.161 --> 00:12:51.970
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

358
00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 1>if you're being harassed at work,</v>

359
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.020
<v Speaker 1>you document it every time it happens and you write it out.</v>

360
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So you've got like 20 stories about it and it's fully documented.</v>

361
00:12:59.861 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 1>And then you go confront the person at some point,</v>

362
00:13:02.171 --> 00:13:06.340
<v Speaker 1>but with at least three pieces of evidence and you have some sense of what you</v>

363
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:09.310
<v Speaker 1>tell them about what will happen if they don't stop.</v>

364
00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 1>So you have to figure out,</v>

365
00:13:10.751 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

366
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:12.280
<v Speaker 1>if they don't stop,</v>

367
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.473
<v Speaker 1>what are you gonna do about it?</v>

368
00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.033
<v Speaker 1>Leave.</v>

369
00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:16.330
<v Speaker 1>Not if you can't leave.</v>

370
00:13:16.570 --> 00:13:17.090
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

371
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>you have to be able to,</v>

372
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.160
<v Speaker 1>what is it wield a big stick and speak softly,</v>

373
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.630
<v Speaker 1>but you see that way.</v>

374
00:13:22.631 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

375
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:25.210
<v Speaker 1>that's how you take your aggression,</v>

376
00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:30.211
<v Speaker 1>which is an absolutely necessary part of your psyche and manifest it up into a</v>

377
00:13:30.491 --> 00:13:33.220
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated means of dealing with the world.</v>

378
00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.450
<v Speaker 1>You don't just suppress it.</v>

379
00:13:34.451 --> 00:13:34.691
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>

380
00:13:34.691 --> 00:13:38.200
<v Speaker 1>well I should be able to put up with it or I wish I wasn't so angry or</v>

381
00:13:38.201 --> 00:13:38.530
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

382
00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:39.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like forget that.</v>

383
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 1>That's all that'll happen is your blood pressure will stay high and you'll die</v>

384
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:44.651
<v Speaker 1>of a heart attack.</v>

385
00:13:44.651 --> 00:13:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Because anger for example,</v>

386
00:13:45.791 --> 00:13:49.660
<v Speaker 1>is a very toxic emotion and it does cause heart damage over time.</v>

387
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:53.140
<v Speaker 1>It's the only emotion that we really know that's been linked to things like</v>

388
00:13:53.141 --> 00:13:55.190
<v Speaker 1>cardiovascular risk and anger is,</v>

389
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:58.720
<v Speaker 1>is toxic because it's like you're driving a car,</v>

390
00:13:58.721 --> 00:13:58.960
<v Speaker 1>you've,</v>

391
00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.780
<v Speaker 1>you're stepping on the gas and pushing on the brake at the same time because</v>

392
00:14:01.781 --> 00:14:06.400
<v Speaker 1>anger tells you to run away and to attack at the same time cause you don't know</v>

393
00:14:06.401 --> 00:14:07.234
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen.</v>

394
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:08.080
<v Speaker 1>And so it,</v>

395
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:12.280
<v Speaker 1>it really amps up the physiological demand on your body.</v>

396
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.593
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>

397
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.670
<v Speaker 1>including your heart and your musculature.</v>

398
00:14:15.671 --> 00:14:17.860
<v Speaker 1>So if you stay like that for like 10 years,</v>

399
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:22.690
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to age 20 years and that's a bad plan.</v>

400
00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:24.423
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

401
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

402
00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:26.621
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:14:26.621 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 1>you take your underground emotions and you integrate them into a sophisticated</v>

404
00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.780
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
