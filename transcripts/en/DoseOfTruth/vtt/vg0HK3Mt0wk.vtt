1
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Could you hazard a guess when you're up is clamping down on speech critical of</v>

2
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:13.680
<v Speaker 1>Islam when you slam is causing lots of problems with rape,</v>

3
00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:14.041
<v Speaker 1>gangs,</v>

4
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.641
<v Speaker 1>terrorism,</v>

5
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>and generally being a menace?</v>

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.153
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

7
00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I suppose if there's,</v>

9
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

10
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 1>let's say if I was going to oppose that statement,</v>

11
00:00:27.751 --> 00:00:28.321
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

12
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:31.470
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps it's a propagandistic,</v>

13
00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.093
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

14
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

15
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.870
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy to blame what's happening in Europe on Islamic immigrants?</v>

16
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>I guess part of the problem is,</v>

17
00:00:42.541 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>

18
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>at least as far as I can tell,</v>

19
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>the news has become sufficiently unreliable because it's so polarized that we</v>

20
00:00:48.421 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>can't really tell what's going on.</v>

21
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason that Europe is clamping down on speech critical of Islam is</v>

23
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 1>partly the same reason that the entire Western world is clamping down on speech.</v>

24
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>That's critical of anything that is associated with group identity,</v>

25
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much any set of ideas that unites people.</v>

26
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

27
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>it's a consequence of the collective decision that we've made that</v>

28
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism and,</v>

29
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

30
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker 1>conflict avoidance constitute the two highest virtues and they Trump everything</v>

31
00:01:22.201 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>else including free speech.</v>

32
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Now why that's happened?</v>

33
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.331
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

34
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to say.</v>

35
00:01:28.951 --> 00:01:29.784
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.680
<v Speaker 1>I suspect to some degree that it's a consequence of women becoming involved in</v>

38
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:35.700
<v Speaker 1>the political system,</v>

39
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>which is something that we've never experienced before and women are more</v>

40
00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:40.794
<v Speaker 1>agreeable</v>

41
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>by nature then man and,</v>

42
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 1>and variable people are,</v>

43
00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.790
<v Speaker 1>are compassionate towards those,</v>

44
00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>they see a suffering and that seems to include any minority,</v>

45
00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:54.910
<v Speaker 1>especially when you combine that with the kind of neo Marxist doctrine,</v>

46
00:01:54.911 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>the claims that anyone who has an advantage swiped it.</v>

47
00:01:58.141 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think in the Islamic situation you'd get a real conflict there because</v>

48
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.010
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously the case that many Islamic practices are not commensurate with</v>

49
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.430
<v Speaker 1>postmodern neo Marxist feminism let's say.</v>

50
00:02:11.431 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>But they seem to get a free pass.</v>

51
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:18.051
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's because the idea that all cultures are equal trumps the</v>

52
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 1>requirement for human rights for women.</v>

53
00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.750
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

54
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.750
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the other thing that's even darker is that there's a fair bit of</v>

55
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:33.021
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary fervor in the more radical end of the left political spectrum.</v>

56
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>And that radical server is devoted towards tearing down the patriarchy.</v>

57
00:02:37.621 --> 00:02:40.200
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's basically Western civilization.</v>

58
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>And so if,</v>

59
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.880
<v Speaker 1>because Islam isn't part of Western civilization,</v>

60
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Speaker 1>then it can be seen as an ally in that,</v>

61
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 1>in that attempt.</v>

62
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.590
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

63
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:50.850
<v Speaker 1>that's what it looks like to me.</v>

64
00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

65
00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.943
<v Speaker 1>I also think,</v>

66
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>that ignorance and,</v>

68
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>and all of that contribute,</v>

69
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>it isn't obvious that people who</v>

70
00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>are afraid of such things as Islamophobia really understand anything about</v>

71
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>Islam.</v>

72
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't say I understand anything about Islam,</v>

73
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>even though I've read a fair bit about it,</v>

74
00:03:09.071 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to put yourself inside a different belief system.</v>

75
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm somewhat apprehensive about Islam because it looks to me like it's a</v>

76
00:03:20.111 --> 00:03:25.111
<v Speaker 1>totalizing system as well as a religion and it's a totalizing system because</v>

77
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.330
<v Speaker 1>everything has to come under its purview,</v>

78
00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.970
<v Speaker 1>including law and,</v>

79
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.903
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

80
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.490
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

81
00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 1>everything that goes along with that.</v>

82
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>There's no separation between church and state.</v>

83
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And so I don't see how that's commensurate with a western moment of existence.</v>

84
00:03:38.561 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think people want to have that conversation because they want to</v>

85
00:03:42.311 --> 00:03:42.551
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

86
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:43.384
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

87
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.931
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

88
00:03:43.931 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 1>everyone diverse as they are.</v>

89
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And important as that diversity is apparently such that everyone has to be</v>

90
00:03:50.471 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 1>represented equally.</v>

91
00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>The diversity isn't really of anything about anything fundamental and we can all</v>

92
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.660
<v Speaker 1>get along without a problem.</v>

93
00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:59.460
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

94
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.293
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

95
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid that that's extraordinarily naive.</v>

96
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.140
<v Speaker 1>And then I suppose there's also an element of something like Western guilt,</v>

97
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.670
<v Speaker 1>I guess perhaps for what has been described as our imperialists past.</v>

98
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.243
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

99
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.243
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

100
00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 1>there's been a very longterm assault</v>

101
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.383
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

102
00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.830
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

103
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:24.870
<v Speaker 2>what would you call moral</v>

104
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>on the morality of the West.</v>

105
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.530
<v Speaker 1>We're often viewed as the rapers and pillagers of the world.</v>

106
00:04:31.531 --> 00:04:34.130
<v Speaker 1>And that sort of goes along with the environmentalist ethos.</v>

107
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:38.520
<v Speaker 1>And so I think we do have a fair bit of guilt about that,</v>

108
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>whether it's warranted or not.</v>

109
00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

110
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

111
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.670
<v Speaker 1>history is a bloody nightmare and it doesn't matter where you look.</v>

112
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:48.810
<v Speaker 1>And I would say at least the West has brought advantages along with its</v>

113
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:49.890
<v Speaker 1>disadvantages.</v>

114
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

115
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.710
<v Speaker 1>and I think that our attitude towards individuality is fundamentally correct and</v>

116
00:04:55.711 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>absolutely vital.</v>

117
00:04:56.971 --> 00:05:00.870
<v Speaker 1>And I would also say that the only countries in the world that are essentially</v>

118
00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:01.710
<v Speaker 1>worth living in,</v>

119
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.000
<v Speaker 1>in any real sense are the ones that are predicated on the Judeo Christian</v>

120
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 1>tradition and manifested in western the western body of laws.</v>

121
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.843
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

122
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.780
<v Speaker 1>but there's still plenty of guilt and there's plenty of people who,</v>

123
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.131
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

124
00:05:17.131 --> 00:05:17.964
<v Speaker 1>who are,</v>

125
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>what contemptuous of being as we discussed in the last question,</v>

126
00:05:23.551 --> 00:05:27.330
<v Speaker 1>and also angry with the political system because they're powerless or maybe</v>

127
00:05:27.331 --> 00:05:30.030
<v Speaker 1>they'd been hurt by male authority figures.</v>

128
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

129
00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>and that happens very frequently.</v>

130
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:37.341
<v Speaker 1>And so they have absolutely no trust in higher in hierarchical structures.</v>

131
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:42.981
<v Speaker 1>And there you might add to that to certain amount of laziness because the thing</v>

132
00:05:43.231 --> 00:05:46.620
<v Speaker 1>about hierarchical structures is that they impose values on people.</v>

133
00:05:46.621 --> 00:05:49.350
<v Speaker 1>And then in order to progress in that value structure that you have to</v>

134
00:05:49.351 --> 00:05:51.480
<v Speaker 1>discipline yourself and work hard,</v>

135
00:05:51.481 --> 00:05:55.830
<v Speaker 1>and many of the radical leftists happened to be very low in conscientiousness.</v>

136
00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 1>And so they don't in hard work and they don't believe that people get to where</v>

137
00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>they're going by hard work.</v>

138
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.830
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

139
00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:04.341
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

140
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.001
<v Speaker 1>one other thing,</v>

141
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>there's a group of people I think who are basically personality disordered.</v>

142
00:06:08.541 --> 00:06:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And those are the ones that have never had a positive relationship with anything</v>

143
00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:13.700
<v Speaker 1>that was masculine.</v>

144
00:06:13.701 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And so whenever they see anything masculine that has motive power,</v>

145
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>and that would include authority and competence,</v>

146
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:21.500
<v Speaker 1>not just power,</v>

147
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>they assume that that's tyrannical.</v>

148
00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.770
<v Speaker 1>And it's part of the postmodern assumption that all power higher,</v>

149
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.020
<v Speaker 1>all hierarchies are hierarchies of power.</v>

150
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Speaker 1>When the truth of the matter is,</v>

151
00:06:31.721 --> 00:06:35.720
<v Speaker 1>is that hierarchies in the West are usually hierarchies of authority and</v>

152
00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:36.554
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>

153
00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.371
<v Speaker 1>And they're like,</v>

154
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>they're oriented towards getting a certain task done and they actually do get</v>

155
00:06:40.761 --> 00:06:41.660
<v Speaker 1>the task done,</v>

156
00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:47.670
<v Speaker 1>but were dubious about our own ethical.</v>

157
00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.633
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

158
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.073
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

159
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.293
<v Speaker 1>Integrity.</v>

160
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:57.350
<v Speaker 1>And I guess that's also why it's a particular importance for people to try to</v>

161
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>act on asleep.</v>

162
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.440
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't act honestly,</v>

163
00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>and then you start to doubt your own integrity and then when people come after</v>

164
00:07:04.281 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

165
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be weak.</v>

166
00:07:05.871 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really bad idea.</v>
