1
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.370
<v Speaker 1>For San Juan and say thank you so much.</v>

2
00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>Those an amazing talk.</v>

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>And I was wondering if you could elaborate.</v>

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:12.960
<v Speaker 1>What I notice a lot,</v>

5
00:00:12.961 --> 00:00:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I go here to EBC is that a lot of students and young people,</v>

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>they're often desensitized to,</v>

7
00:00:18.391 --> 00:00:18.871
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

8
00:00:18.871 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>the atrocities that communism or ideologies that forge terrorism.</v>

9
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it's some sort of Stockholm syndrome that I'm seeing where it's like</v>

10
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.640
<v Speaker 1>people are just there,</v>

11
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>they're like trapped and they can't do,</v>

12
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>they feel in a way they can't do anything about it.</v>

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>And then they start to like la,</v>

14
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.430
<v Speaker 1>like like communism or they start to see more social sort of adopt socialist</v>

15
00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>policies that in the end we'll get them killed,</v>

16
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.844
<v Speaker 1>we'll get them hurt.</v>

17
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.690
<v Speaker 1>I was wonder if you kind of like elaborate on what you think can be done about</v>

18
00:00:48.691 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>that or even if something can be done in that respect.</v>

19
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

20
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I think something can be done.</v>

21
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've been trying to educate people about the horrors of</v>

22
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.010
<v Speaker 2>the Nazi regime and,</v>

23
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.920
<v Speaker 2>and the Soviet regime in particular,</v>

24
00:01:03.921 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 2>I've concentrated mostly on those two cars,</v>

25
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 2>but that's good enough.</v>

26
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.340
<v Speaker 2>And trying to let people know that it was through the fault of people,</v>

27
00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 2>much like them,</v>

28
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 2>that those systems are rows and,</v>

29
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>and that there are steps you can take to limit the probability that you would</v>

30
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 2>participate in such a thing and that those steps are associated with trying to</v>

31
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.810
<v Speaker 2>be truthful in your speech and actions because the stability of those systems</v>

32
00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:36.890
<v Speaker 2>depends on the willingness of individuals to lie and,</v>

33
00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.080
<v Speaker 2>and also on your willingness to take responsibility for the malevolence in your</v>

34
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:42.914
<v Speaker 2>own heart.</v>

35
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 2>That manifests itself in those social movements.</v>

36
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.910
<v Speaker 2>And so that when I've done,</v>

37
00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.450
<v Speaker 2>when I do my lectures,</v>

38
00:01:53.451 --> 00:01:54.530
<v Speaker 2>when I do talks like this,</v>

39
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.760
<v Speaker 2>when I put them on Youtube,</v>

40
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.820
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to do is exactly that because that was the best pathway forward</v>

41
00:02:01.731 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 2>through such things that I could think up over 20 years of thinking about it.</v>

42
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.333
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

43
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.840
<v Speaker 2>no one is so habituated to suffering that they can read the Gulag archipelago,</v>

44
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.840
<v Speaker 2>which is actually quite hard to read without having an effect them like your</v>

45
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:24.740
<v Speaker 2>psychopathic.</v>

46
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 2>If that book doesn't affect you,</v>

47
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

48
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 2>it should,</v>

49
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.150
<v Speaker 2>if you read it properly,</v>

50
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 2>it affects you deeply.</v>

51
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 2>And it's not the only example of that kind of literature.</v>

52
00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Speaker 2>So the people who are habituated aren't,</v>

53
00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:41.510
<v Speaker 2>they've just been shown low resolution representations of things they don't</v>

54
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 2>understand that looked vaguely bad.</v>

55
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 2>They don't know a damn thing about them.</v>

56
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:51.520
<v Speaker 2>And our education system has done a tremendously appalling job of educating</v>

57
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:55.940
<v Speaker 2>young people about the absolute catastrophe of radical leftism.</v>

58
00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 2>Now it's not much better with regards to say the actions of the Nazis,</v>

59
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>although I would say on average people are more aware of that,</v>

60
00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.623
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

61
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 2>But it's shallow,</v>

62
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.820
<v Speaker 2>shallow knowledge.</v>

63
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 2>So you make the knowledge deep and deep knowledge changes people and wakes them</v>

64
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

65
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.151
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

66
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

67
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 2>the only reason that I ever got convinced that they're that good and evil were</v>

68
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.363
<v Speaker 2>real,</v>

69
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

70
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 2>more real than anything else,</v>

71
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.660
<v Speaker 2>wasn't because I learned that God was real.</v>

72
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.693
<v Speaker 2>That's hard.</v>

73
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.280
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

74
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.960
<v Speaker 2>that's hard.</v>

75
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to learn that you have to find examples of transcendent good.</v>

76
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

77
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>they're rare,</v>

78
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 2>evil.</v>

79
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 2>All you have to do is look,</v>

80
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.550
<v Speaker 2>read history a bit and read it like it's about you.</v>

81
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.010
<v Speaker 2>And there's no way that you can do that without a transformation.</v>

82
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.780
<v Speaker 2>But people won't do it was like,</v>

83
00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 2>do you want to imagine yourself as an Auschwitz guard?</v>

84
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 2>That's a rough thing you see because you have to figure out,</v>

85
00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.981
<v Speaker 2>see young said,</v>

86
00:03:53.981 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 2>if you confronted the shadow,</v>

87
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 2>which is the dark side of people,</v>

88
00:03:56.891 --> 00:03:57.880
<v Speaker 2>the aggressive side,</v>

89
00:03:57.881 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 2>the malevolent side that it,</v>

90
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 2>it really reaches all the way down to hell.</v>

91
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.180
<v Speaker 2>And Dante sort of was trying to put four of the same thing when he wrote the</v>

92
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:07.870
<v Speaker 2>inferno,</v>

93
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

94
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.310
<v Speaker 2>With the levels of evil.</v>

95
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.611
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

96
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was a voyage through the levels of evil,</v>

97
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:12.561
<v Speaker 2>right to the bottom.</v>

98
00:04:12.561 --> 00:04:14.170
<v Speaker 2>And he thought the bottom was betrayal.</v>

99
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good.</v>

100
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.040
<v Speaker 2>The most.</v>

101
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.270
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

102
00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 2>the center of malevolence is betrayal.</v>

103
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 2>I liked that because to be traced someone,</v>

104
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.110
<v Speaker 2>you have to get them to trust you.</v>

105
00:04:23.111 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 2>And Trust is a moral virtue.</v>

106
00:04:24.641 --> 00:04:24.851
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

107
00:04:24.851 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's courageous.</v>

108
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:26.960
<v Speaker 2>Trust cause it,</v>

109
00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

110
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 2>it puts you in alignment with other people in Lousy and to move forward into</v>

111
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:30.791
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

112
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 2>And if you'd be trained that you really,</v>

113
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:33.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like a knife in the,</v>

114
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 2>it's like a knife in the heart through the back.</v>

115
00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's someone who loves,</v>

116
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.501
<v Speaker 2>loves you,</v>

117
00:04:38.501 --> 00:04:39.334
<v Speaker 2>betrays you,</v>

118
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.070
<v Speaker 2>and especially if they betray you for your virtues.</v>

119
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.660
<v Speaker 2>That's a really nice twist.</v>

120
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.033
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

121
00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.160
<v Speaker 2>I believe because I think that people are capable of good,</v>

122
00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 2>that if they know enough about evil that that will straighten them out.</v>

123
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.523
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

124
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 2>but who wants that?</v>

125
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.511
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

126
00:04:58.511 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the things I really like about young.</v>

127
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>He's often regarded as a new age thinker.</v>

128
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 2>That's wrong.</v>

129
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.850
<v Speaker 2>He's no new age thinker.</v>

130
00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:08.760
<v Speaker 2>He knew that the,</v>

131
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.150
<v Speaker 2>the pathway to enlightenment was barred by the necessity of a passage through</v>

132
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 2>hell and that no one was going to do that.</v>

133
00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:21.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why there isn't a world full of enlightened people.</v>

134
00:05:21.941 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 2>You might say like if it was just a matter of doing nice things,</v>

135
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 2>following your blessed,</v>

136
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 2>let's say however you might put it,</v>

137
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.020
<v Speaker 2>then why wouldn't everyone walk up the stairway to heaven?</v>

138
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 2>That isn't how it works.</v>

139
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:38.950
<v Speaker 2>That's not how it works at all.</v>

140
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you can be convinced of the necessity for moral action until you</v>

141
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 2>understand exactly how dark and terrible things can get and that it's your fault</v>

142
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 2>that they're getting that way.</v>

143
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.770
<v Speaker 2>Who wants to think that.</v>
