1
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go back to the pigeon hole thing</v>

2
00:00:08.911 --> 00:00:10.680
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you clean your room when your</v>

3
00:00:10.681 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>spouse doesn't share that goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

4
00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:19.820
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's another one of those questions.</v>

5
00:00:19.821 --> 00:00:22.370
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to answer because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the details,</v>

6
00:00:22.371 --> 00:00:24.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you clean your room?</v>

7
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>What goals does your spouse have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the first take.</v>

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there some commonality?</v>

9
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be maybe your spouse as much</v>

10
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:37.280
<v Speaker 1>more disorderly than you or less</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientious or irritated at you for</v>

11
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

12
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you could do is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

13
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>try to lead by example and see how that</v>
<v Speaker 1>works.</v>

14
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>But you may have to argue and fight it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

15
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.433
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.590
<v Speaker 1>break it down into sub tasks and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and see if you can distribute the tasks</v>

17
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and negotiate you have to negotiate.</v>

18
00:00:58.011 --> 00:01:02.760
<v Speaker 1>And without further information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say much more than that.</v>

19
00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can say why you're doing it,</v>

20
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.070
<v Speaker 1>what you think the goal we're and goal</v>
<v Speaker 1>was and that you'd like some help and</v>

21
00:01:08.071 --> 00:01:10.110
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's something you could offer</v>
<v Speaker 1>in return.</v>

22
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you can't negotiate at all with your</v>

23
00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you have a much broader problem</v>

24
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:18.210
<v Speaker 1>than how do you clean your room when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're supposed doesn't share that goal</v>

25
00:01:18.211 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>because the real problem would be how do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you learn to negotiate with your spouse?</v>

26
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.280
<v Speaker 1>I could talk about that a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to negotiate with someone is</v>

28
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.030
<v Speaker 1>be able to say no.</v>

29
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.510
<v Speaker 1>The second thing is to have something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>offer.</v>

30
00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.870
<v Speaker 1>The third thing is to find out what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want and to know what you want.</v>

31
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because often people,</v>

32
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.140
<v Speaker 1>especially with people that love them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

33
00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.280
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you really knew,</v>

34
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>if you really love me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you'd know what I want.</v>

35
00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:47.461
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

36
00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:50.760
<v Speaker 1>that's just wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person that you are in love with or</v>

37
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.420
<v Speaker 1>living with isn't any smarter than you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you pretty much always have to</v>

38
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:58.110
<v Speaker 1>tell people straight out what you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to let them be really</v>

39
00:01:58.111 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>stupid about giving it to you for quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while.</v>

40
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So sometimes I've recommended to my</v>

41
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>clients that they take their wife or</v>
<v Speaker 1>husband out on a date and of course</v>

42
00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 1>they're all skeptical about that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>cynical about it and then they go on a</v>

43
00:02:11.821 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>date and they have a terrible time and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come back and say,</v>

44
00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.260
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told you that was a stupid idea,</v>

45
00:02:16.261 --> 00:02:18.280
<v Speaker 1>and I tell them that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

46
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna do anything romantic</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your spouse for the next 40 years.</v>

47
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.800
<v Speaker 1>That's your plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan is that it's like you</v>

48
00:02:25.801 --> 00:02:30.450
<v Speaker 1>might have to go out to a movie after</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't been good to each other for</v>

49
00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>like five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might have to go out to movie 10</v>

50
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:36.690
<v Speaker 1>times movie and dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say before it starts to become fun</v>

51
00:02:36.691 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's hard to do that sort of</v>

52
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:40.164
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

53
00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.840
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People think those things are easy and</v>

54
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.020
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

55
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.080
<v Speaker 1>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn to negotiate with your</v>

56
00:02:51.301 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>spouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very difficult thing to do.</v>

57
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'm figuring out what you want is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good way to start.</v>

58
00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.640
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
