1
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.560
<v Speaker 1>And of course we're absolutely keenly aware of that in the modern world because</v>

2
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>we're possessed by this sense that all of our frenetic activity,</v>

3
00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>all of our frenetic motivated activity is producing alterations in the world</v>

4
00:00:19.431 --> 00:00:24.431
<v Speaker 1>order such that nature itself is going to be destroyed and eliminate us,</v>

5
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

6
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.970
<v Speaker 1>That's classic Sumerian fear and nothing's changed in the last 5,000 years.</v>

7
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>The Sumerians presumed that once the elder gods were constructed and started</v>

8
00:00:36.621 --> 00:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>moving around on the planet,</v>

9
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.590
<v Speaker 1>that their activity,</v>

10
00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>they're mindless activity.</v>

11
00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:42.651
<v Speaker 1>Because remember,</v>

12
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>these aren't well integrated motivational forces.</v>

13
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:48.380
<v Speaker 1>They're more like primordial beasts right there.</v>

14
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.470
<v Speaker 1>Unintegrated activity risks plunging everything back and chaos.</v>

15
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Well tie match the representative of chaos,</v>

16
00:00:56.781 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>this generative chaos.</v>

17
00:00:57.861 --> 00:00:59.360
<v Speaker 1>But so what the Sumerian say?</v>

18
00:00:59.361 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.880
<v Speaker 1>the elder gods because a lot of racket,</v>

20
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.970
<v Speaker 1>they move around the planet and they upset time at and she decides that enough</v>

21
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.390
<v Speaker 1>is enough and she's going to wipe them out.</v>

22
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.480
<v Speaker 1>So she's sitting at the bottom of the ocean,</v>

23
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.800
<v Speaker 1>fuming away as the elder gods go about their business and then they take one</v>

24
00:01:23.121 --> 00:01:25.670
<v Speaker 1>step too many and they kill Appsu.</v>

25
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Who's her husband?</v>

26
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.531
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

27
00:01:27.531 --> 00:01:30.050
<v Speaker 1>the Sumerian creation myth doesn't say much about this,</v>

28
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:34.760
<v Speaker 1>but we know that Appsu is the male con sort of chaos that makes it mortar.</v>

29
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.350
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is the elder gods destroy order itself.</v>

30
00:01:39.351 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>They destroy culture itself.</v>

31
00:01:40.731 --> 00:01:42.050
<v Speaker 1>And as soon as you destroy culture,</v>

32
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>all hell breaks loose.</v>

33
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what happens in this scenario creation myth.</v>

34
00:01:45.181 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>So Tye,</v>

35
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:46.941
<v Speaker 1>Maddie,</v>

36
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:47.774
<v Speaker 1>Mergis,</v>

37
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>she's going to wipe everything out and the world will revert back to its</v>

38
00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 1>primordial non-existence state.</v>

39
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Now the older guards get wind of this,</v>

40
00:01:56.781 --> 00:01:59.930
<v Speaker 1>and of course they're just terrified because they know that this thing that gave</v>

41
00:01:59.931 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 1>rise to them,</v>

42
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.761
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>

43
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>the matrix of being can easily wipe them out at a moment's notice.</v>

44
00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>And so despite the fact that they're trans,</v>

45
00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.641
<v Speaker 1>transpersonal,</v>

46
00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>and immortal,</v>

47
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>and characterized by a certain amount of power in the face of absolute chaos,</v>

48
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:13.700
<v Speaker 1>they're insufficient.</v>
