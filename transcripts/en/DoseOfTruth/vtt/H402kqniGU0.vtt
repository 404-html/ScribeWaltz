1
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.223
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.490
<v Speaker 1>What happens when you're facing by something that you really don't understand?</v>

3
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.300
<v Speaker 1>Partly what happens is each of who you partner,</v>

4
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>why you don't hear any popping up,</v>

5
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of dramatic theories about what they might have.</v>

6
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:46.584
<v Speaker 1>Really be humble,</v>

7
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>There's paranoia and doubt and cynicism and bitterness and all of that,</v>

9
00:00:52.111 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>but that's your right hemisphere time,</v>

10
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>naked picture of reality into generating these fantasies.</v>

11
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Trying to come up with an account that makes sense of what happened and that's</v>

12
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>the way the company cope with radically new information.</v>

13
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>Something like that,</v>

14
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.490
<v Speaker 1>except the TV more complicated,</v>

15
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>and I'm telling you all this because I want to specify how is what.</v>

16
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.610
<v Speaker 1>I want to specify why it's necessary to go to the deepest level of analysis and</v>

17
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:22.020
<v Speaker 1>to try to understand what's there.</v>

18
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.480
<v Speaker 1>The more mysterious something is,</v>

19
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>the more you have to use your imagination.</v>

20
00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>In some senses it's representative because you do need to,</v>

21
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.020
<v Speaker 1>what did you fantasize and hypothesize about?</v>

22
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.903
<v Speaker 1>Gaffney dream.</v>

23
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.863
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

24
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>you'll this office,</v>

25
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.540
<v Speaker 1>but dreams</v>

26
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>concentrated on what we eat.</v>

27
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>So the part of your brain tells me,</v>

28
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.790
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

29
00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:50.420
<v Speaker 1>some things in the normal world,</v>

30
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't work perfectly because what you know doesn't work perfectly.</v>

31
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 1>And so you started recruiting errors along the way and then your right</v>

32
00:01:58.551 --> 00:01:59.900
<v Speaker 1>hemisphere collects those areas.</v>

33
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>It starts to try to figure out what to do about them.</v>

34
00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.931
<v Speaker 1>If you wait,</v>

35
00:02:02.931 --> 00:02:05.060
<v Speaker 1>people have on their CP and the dreaming,</v>

36
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.830
<v Speaker 1>the most common emotion they related to his anxiety and it's because at night</v>

37
00:02:09.831 --> 00:02:13.310
<v Speaker 1>what you do is tried to reconfigure what you know to take into account what you</v>

38
00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

39
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>And that's an anxiety provoking process and use notion with regards to dream</v>

40
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:19.620
<v Speaker 1>analysis,</v>

41
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>it was the same with sport to some degree was that you could,</v>

42
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>if people were facing an attractable mystery,</v>

43
00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.790
<v Speaker 1>they didn't know how to proceed.</v>

44
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

45
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.770
<v Speaker 1>then you come and see me,</v>

46
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 1>you're not happy in your job that you don't want to give it up because of the</v>

47
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>security or like it's a complicated situation and you can't see any way forward.</v>

48
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.631
<v Speaker 1>Then I might say,</v>

49
00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:37.220
<v Speaker 1>well do you dream?</v>

50
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.900
<v Speaker 1>And if you said yes,</v>

51
00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>some people drink a lot.</v>

52
00:02:40.101 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>And remember it.</v>

53
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.290
<v Speaker 1>And we might take a look at your dreams to see if he could catch the new story</v>

54
00:02:45.291 --> 00:02:49.130
<v Speaker 1>that's emerging Hunter d your knowledge about where it is that you might go.</v>

55
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:50.151
<v Speaker 1>And that can be very,</v>

56
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:55.130
<v Speaker 1>very illuminating and people differ in the complexity and sophistication of</v>

57
00:02:55.131 --> 00:02:56.810
<v Speaker 1>their drinks and their ability to remember that.</v>

58
00:02:56.811 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 1>But we also might fucking your fantasies.</v>

59
00:02:58.591 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>So maybe know you have your fantasy about what you really liked to say to your</v>

60
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>boss and it's a fairly Weldon,</v>

61
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm seeing in your head embarrassed about it because it's kind of violence and</v>

62
00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

63
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.690
<v Speaker 1>tell me about the fantasy.</v>

64
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.680
<v Speaker 1>Do you lay it out?</v>

65
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.560
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

66
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.660
<v Speaker 1>We can take weekend at the seeds of who you might be calm because maybe you're</v>

67
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.831
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

68
00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm standing up for yourself and not for your boss.</v>

69
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:22.670
<v Speaker 1>It's time to retire,</v>

70
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>And so you have this fantasy that you rooted in the then ladies out at the</v>

72
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.630
<v Speaker 1>landscape of what look like if you find it,</v>

73
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you just got up enough courage to march in there and say exactly what you had to</v>

74
00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:34.774
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

75
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And so that's something you want.</v>

76
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.240
<v Speaker 1>And if you're thinking about changing careers and we want to figure out what you</v>

77
00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:40.691
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

78
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>and so she can look up when you're fantasizing about what you wanted,</v>

79
00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>maybe you could find some seeds of what you want.</v>

80
00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:47.381
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

81
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be happy in the next job regardless of what you do unless</v>

83
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:54.640
<v Speaker 1>you become somewhat more assertive because he was just carried the same problem</v>

84
00:03:54.641 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>into your next jobs would be the problem.</v>

85
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.580
<v Speaker 1>And the problem is this,</v>

86
00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:03.581
<v Speaker 1>that you're not doing enough of what you really need to do to thrive in work and</v>

87
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:05.200
<v Speaker 1>you can try to solve that problem.</v>

88
00:04:05.201 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>And then we started figuring out whether that would also mean that you would</v>

89
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:09.010
<v Speaker 1>have to shift careers.</v>

90
00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.820
<v Speaker 1>And so that's how you can use to be analysis of say,</v>

91
00:04:11.821 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>fantasies and dreams to shed light on,</v>

92
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.560
<v Speaker 1>on how it is that the person might conduct themselves.</v>

93
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.793
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

94
00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:27.140
<v Speaker 1>this is where it gets tricky.</v>

95
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.250
<v Speaker 1>Casey hasn't got treats,</v>

96
00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.863
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

97
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.550
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

98
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.100
<v Speaker 1>So here's another way that you can figure out how to act in the world.</v>

99
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Let's say your your child,</v>

100
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>and there's a lot here.</v>

101
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.720
<v Speaker 1>So how do you handle that?</v>

102
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:55.621
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:04:55.621 --> 00:04:57.300
<v Speaker 1>you stay the simplified environment,</v>

104
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.453
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

105
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.430
<v Speaker 1>You don't crawl out onto the street with your 10 months old.</v>

106
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.960
<v Speaker 1>Parents aren't like you do that.</v>

107
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.561
<v Speaker 1>They keep you in.</v>

108
00:05:04.561 --> 00:05:07.650
<v Speaker 1>The family did and they keep you close to them.</v>

109
00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>And what you do is,</v>

110
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.150
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

111
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.890
<v Speaker 1>which isn't very much mostly it's how quick things in your vote and investigate</v>

112
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.160
<v Speaker 1>cause that's her,</v>

113
00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what kids do.</v>

114
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.930
<v Speaker 1>And at the smiling kids to play a little bit,</v>

115
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.270
<v Speaker 1>but it's a frat house piece of knowledge and it's easily disrupted.</v>

116
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 1>And when it's disrupted,</v>

117
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:28.773
<v Speaker 1>you cry.</v>

118
00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's a signal of the disruption.</v>

119
00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.000
<v Speaker 1>And then your parents move in.</v>

120
00:05:33.001 --> 00:05:37.290
<v Speaker 1>If they're a greater knowledge and they fix whatever the problems and what you</v>

121
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:42.291
<v Speaker 1>do is you watch and imitate what I'd like you to know what the rep can you,</v>

122
00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:44.850
<v Speaker 1>cause you're not sophisticated enough to know what they're up to.</v>

123
00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:48.060
<v Speaker 1>No child can you give a full town with the behavior of the parents?</v>

124
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.511
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

125
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Parents should give a full account of her own.</v>

126
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

127
00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.160
<v Speaker 1>You certainly country expect that from a child.</v>

128
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.790
<v Speaker 1>But children obviously grow up to take care of their own children.</v>

129
00:05:56.791 --> 00:06:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Just like animals grow up to take care of their own offspring,</v>

130
00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>never knowing what they're doing.</v>

131
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

132
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:08.160
<v Speaker 1>So you learn by mutation and what that means is that collectively we've faced</v>

133
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>things that we didn't understand for very,</v>

134
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:17.660
<v Speaker 1>very long period of time and we've figured out how to act so that it works.</v>

135
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.400
<v Speaker 1>But we don't know.</v>

136
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the rules that underlie that makes up you don't know exactly what</v>

137
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:23.864
<v Speaker 1>that means.</v>

138
00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.430
<v Speaker 1>We just figured it out.</v>

139
00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.680
<v Speaker 1>So there's was a way of being a good product.</v>

140
00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Let's say there's a way being a good mother,</v>

141
00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>mostly you understand what that is.</v>

142
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>We you fail.</v>

143
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:37.131
<v Speaker 1>Or when your child,</v>

144
00:06:37.131 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 1>he accuses you of failing at it,</v>

145
00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

146
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>Because it's only in the failure that you realized that you deviate from</v>

147
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:44.160
<v Speaker 1>whatever the ideal is because you're not,</v>

148
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>who the hell knows what the rules are for being a good father?</v>

149
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to detail them,</v>

150
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.190
<v Speaker 1>but you know when you failed.</v>

151
00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.771
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

152
00:06:51.771 --> 00:06:56.290
<v Speaker 1>so you know how to be a controlling and you know that because you imitated your</v>

153
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:56.691
<v Speaker 1>father.</v>

154
00:06:56.691 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 1>And he indicated his father,</v>

155
00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:59.190
<v Speaker 1>his father,</v>

156
00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.140
<v Speaker 1>and it's like waiting way back as far as you can possibly joke.</v>

157
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.280
<v Speaker 1>That's the rule.</v>

158
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>We also know that,</v>

159
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:05.781
<v Speaker 1>and here's,</v>

160
00:07:05.781 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>here's an example of what have a cloth called colleague at the University of</v>

161
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>Toronto who spends a maternal behavior tracks and you're actually very</v>

162
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated.</v>

163
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>They have somewhat of a cultural state pass on through imitators.</v>

164
00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:22.330
<v Speaker 1>But if you take rap cops away from their mother and,</v>

165
00:07:22.331 --> 00:07:23.160
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

166
00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>and treat the Webinar so that they live in,</v>

167
00:07:25.581 --> 00:07:26.540
<v Speaker 1>which is not that easy,</v>

168
00:07:26.541 --> 00:07:31.460
<v Speaker 1>by the way is feeding them and giving them enough water and warmth and so forth</v>

169
00:07:31.461 --> 00:07:32.000
<v Speaker 1>isn't enough.</v>

170
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.490
<v Speaker 1>You also have to attend it to them.</v>

171
00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 1>You have to touch the plaintiff and won't they die anyways.</v>

172
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:41.120
<v Speaker 1>If you take the rep hops away from their mother and then you let those routes</v>

173
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.950
<v Speaker 1>grow up and after round tops and then those that grow up and have red pumps,</v>

174
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:46.843
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

175
00:07:46.850 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>you find that the maternal behavior is disruptive for three generations.</v>

176
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.970
<v Speaker 1>So that shows you why you need that imitative continuity in order to keep</v>

177
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that's implicit propagating into a culture.</v>

178
00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.810
<v Speaker 1>So once it's disruptive,</v>

179
00:08:02.811 --> 00:08:05.700
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to locals once again ask.</v>

180
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.063
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

181
00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.500
<v Speaker 1>we've learned how to be good and bad by trial and error for very long periods of</v>

182
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:17.624
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

183
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.940
<v Speaker 1>We've learned that with imaging that from the people that we see who are good</v>

184
00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:24.083
<v Speaker 1>and bad,</v>

185
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.060
<v Speaker 1>we've learned how to embody that.</v>

186
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 1>And so we carry that with us in our actions.</v>

187
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Now you actually include this in quite a sophisticated way,</v>

188
00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>even though if you can't describe it exactly.</v>

189
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:41.480
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you go to a party and there's someone that gets annoying and</v>

190
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:44.820
<v Speaker 1>they're annoying because they tell jokes that aren't funny and they've been help</v>

191
00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:46.270
<v Speaker 1>license conversation and,</v>

192
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:50.600
<v Speaker 1>and they don't pay any attention to anyone else because they're full of micro</v>

193
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.473
<v Speaker 1>errors.</v>

194
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 1>That made me socially tolerable.</v>

195
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:54.943
<v Speaker 1>And so what,</v>

196
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.910
<v Speaker 1>what they are doing is easy.</v>

197
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Anything from her in person,</v>

198
00:08:58.860 --> 00:08:59.580
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

199
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.450
<v Speaker 1>That's why they were annoying,</v>

200
00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.933
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

201
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.940
<v Speaker 1>because they're not engaging the way they should be hated.</v>

202
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And you can tell that because they're annoying.</v>

203
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means is that you have an ideal that you're expecting from</v>

204
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 1>other people all the time.</v>

205
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.500
<v Speaker 1>That that isn't the case.</v>

206
00:09:13.501 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Because wherever we go,</v>

207
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 1>we meet people and we expect that they will act out the ideal.</v>

208
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:21.680
<v Speaker 1>And when they don't want we knows.</v>

209
00:09:22.650 --> 00:09:25.710
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean you can say what it is cause you know you might go home</v>

210
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:27.750
<v Speaker 1>with your partner and say I was that person.</v>

211
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:28.640
<v Speaker 1>So in the way,</v>

212
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:30.650
<v Speaker 1>and then you guess a bunch out.</v>

213
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

214
00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:35.430
<v Speaker 1>But it's hard to specify it because you don't move the ideal that you don't know</v>

215
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 1>exactly what it was to break through.</v>

216
00:09:36.871 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to meet this articulate,</v>

217
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 1>but you do have the an ideal in mind.</v>

218
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

219
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:47.150
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is stuff we can act out and conceptualizing this deal before</v>

220
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 1>we could describe the words what that ideal he is.</v>
