00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.870
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to lots of business people about leadership and there's a literature</v>

2
00:00:10.871 --> 00:00:11.441
<v Speaker 1>on leadership,</v>

3
00:00:11.441 --> 00:00:13.150
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a good literature.</v>

4
00:00:13.151 --> 00:00:13.351
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

5
00:00:13.351 --> 00:00:14.320
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty shallow.</v>

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.071
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:15.071 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 1>partly because it's not that easy to define leadership and partly because there</v>

8
00:00:18.431 --> 00:00:19.270
<v Speaker 1>are different,</v>

9
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.760
<v Speaker 1>people have different temperaments and different temperaments can be leaders.</v>

11
00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.350
<v Speaker 1>They just do it in different ways.</v>

12
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Now there's something in common about being a leader.</v>

13
00:00:28.631 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

14
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.540
<v Speaker 1>and I would say one is that if you're a natural leader,</v>

15
00:00:31.541 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 1>you actually know where you're going,</v>

16
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Cause what are you going to do lead people in circles.</v>

18
00:00:36.311 --> 00:00:38.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe they'll follow you but you're not a leader.</v>

19
00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:39.280
<v Speaker 1>You're just a charlatan.</v>

20
00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.010
<v Speaker 1>So you have to know where you're going and then you have to be able to</v>

21
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:45.280
<v Speaker 1>communicate that and then people have to trust you.</v>

22
00:00:45.281 --> 00:00:46.770
<v Speaker 1>So you actually have to be honest,</v>

23
00:00:46.771 --> 00:00:47.950
<v Speaker 1>cause people aren't that stupid.</v>

24
00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.720
<v Speaker 1>At least not for a long period of time.</v>

25
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.090
<v Speaker 1>And then where are you going?</v>

26
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 1>Has to have some value because otherwise,</v>

27
00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:55.960
<v Speaker 1>why would anyone want to go along with you?</v>

28
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.363
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

29
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.361
<v Speaker 1>and then you might say,</v>

30
00:00:58.361 --> 00:00:58.881
<v Speaker 1>well what,</v>

31
00:00:58.881 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>what are the attributes then that make you a leader?</v>

32
00:01:01.091 --> 00:01:05.290
<v Speaker 1>And I would say well they're characterological fundamentally and this is not</v>

33
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.330
<v Speaker 1>naive optimism or,</v>

34
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>or or casual demoralizing.</v>

35
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>It has nothing to do with that.</v>

36
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.221
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:17.221
<v Speaker 1>we know for example that conscientious that the personality trait is a good</v>

38
00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:20.770
<v Speaker 1>predictor of long term success in in most occupations,</v>

39
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>not all but most.</v>

40
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>And that one of the things that's associated with conscientiousness is that</v>

41
00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>people keep their word,</v>

42
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:26.980
<v Speaker 1>they're trustworthy.</v>

43
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's certainly one element of a leader,</v>

44
00:01:29.351 --> 00:01:31.450
<v Speaker 1>especially across any reasonable amount of time.</v>

45
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.310
<v Speaker 1>You have to be able to trust the person.</v>

46
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.570
<v Speaker 1>They can even be harsh,</v>

47
00:01:34.571 --> 00:01:34.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

48
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.540
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter because you can see harsh leaders and kind leaders,</v>

49
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.280
<v Speaker 1>but as long as they do what they say they will do and then you can follow them</v>

50
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and you know that the future payoff is,</v>

51
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.670
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

52
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.540
<v Speaker 1>is secure,</v>

53
00:01:46.541 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

54
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that character,</v>

55
00:01:50.081 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>logical development is more important to leadership then primogenitor I think</v>

56
00:01:54.401 --> 00:01:55.234
<v Speaker 1>that's the right word.</v>

57
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

58
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.880
<v Speaker 1>premo genesis anyways,</v>

59
00:01:57.881 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>being a first born,</v>

60
00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.730
<v Speaker 1>that's a very crucial psychological realization that its character,</v>

61
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:06.370
<v Speaker 1>logical development that makes you favored of God.</v>

62
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.141
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

63
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:11.800
<v Speaker 1>And I do think we've forgotten this in many ways because there isn't a lot of</v>

64
00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>emphasis in our education system on characterological development.</v>

65
00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.631
<v Speaker 1>And that's very,</v>

66
00:02:16.631 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>very surprising to me.</v>

67
00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:21.040
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe it's partly because in our fractured society,</v>

68
00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:24.560
<v Speaker 1>we can't agree on what constitutes a reasonable character,</v>

69
00:02:24.561 --> 00:02:25.900
<v Speaker 1>a logical goal.</v>

70
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>So we just throw up our hands and don't educate our kids to any degree at all,</v>

71
00:02:31.751 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 1>especially in schools about what an admirable person is like,</v>

72
00:02:34.961 --> 00:02:36.130
<v Speaker 1>or even let them know that,</v>

73
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

74
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:38.200
<v Speaker 1>maybe you should actually try to be one.</v>

75
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 1>You know that that's actually the most important possible thing that you could</v>

76
00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 1>learn.</v>
