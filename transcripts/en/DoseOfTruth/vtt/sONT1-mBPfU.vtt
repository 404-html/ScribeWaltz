<v Speaker 1>Metaphysical store</v>

2
00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.953
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

3
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.920
<v Speaker 1>How it seems to have happened to us is that over the last five years,</v>

4
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

5
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>we invented a new way of looking at the world as a materialist</v>

6
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.020
<v Speaker 1>and that is exactly the view of story.</v>

7
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 1>It's different than that.</v>

8
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a new technology and the problem seems to be that the emergence of that</v>

9
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>which has made us wealthy,</v>

10
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>technologically powerful.</v>

11
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

12
00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

13
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>

14
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>fundamental way metaphysics of our basic story</v>

15
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>need to have this idea in the lady 1900 leaving that the conflict between the</v>

16
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:01.860
<v Speaker 1>scientists worldview and the religious world view,</v>

17
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.070
<v Speaker 1>a designated religious will view</v>

18
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.990
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

19
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>He described that as the debit card and he believed that because that had</v>

20
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:10.491
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>

21
00:01:10.491 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>we had lost our moorings or ethical moorings and that our society is going to</v>

22
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 1>wash away for that between nihilism and totalitarianism.</v>

23
00:01:17.421 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 1>That's a con and neat.</v>

24
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>You died quite young,</v>

25
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>believed that in order to recover from that and find our marriage,</v>

26
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.020
<v Speaker 1>that we were going to have to replace the gods that we once believed in,</v>

27
00:01:30.021 --> 00:01:30.441
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

28
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>or your God,</v>

29
00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>but we want to plead it with some notion of our own divinity.</v>

30
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Take responsibility for creating our own doubters.</v>

31
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>That was his idea is superman,</v>

32
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>the Overman now yo was very interested in niches,</v>

33
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Speaker 1>diagnosis because he knew that we lived inside stories and the stories had</v>

34
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>certain accidents of value and then our faith and our fundamental story had been</v>

35
00:01:51.741 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>shaken not least by our scientific,</v>

36
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>the rising of scientific knowledge,</v>

37
00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.780
<v Speaker 1>and he was interested in trying to figure out how people might find themselves</v>

38
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.510
<v Speaker 1>reoriented so they didn't turn to nihilism,</v>

39
00:02:02.511 --> 00:02:02.901
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

40
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>or two to telecare.</v>

41
00:02:03.981 --> 00:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>Ian Utopian world news bucket put themselves back in the story,</v>

42
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>but he didn't buy the niches prognosis for cure because yoga was influenced by</v>

43
00:02:14.721 --> 00:02:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Freud and Freud.</v>

44
00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.510
<v Speaker 1>You out that</v>

45
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.170
<v Speaker 1>people didn't create their own values.</v>

46
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.300
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that because you have to nature you and the nature manifests itself</v>

47
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 1>within you regardless of your choice.</v>

48
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.930
<v Speaker 1>There's things that you can't get yourself to do and know that,</v>

49
00:02:35.241 --> 00:02:35.481
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

50
00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Because it was a matter of creating your own values.</v>

51
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:38.211
<v Speaker 1>You just think,</v>

52
00:02:38.211 --> 00:02:41.570
<v Speaker 1>well you can wake up one morning and you could just tell yourself what to do.</v>

53
00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.690
<v Speaker 1>Like go to the gym three times a week so that you know you're in good shape.</v>

54
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.940
<v Speaker 1>Stop eating junk or quit drinking and bang just cause you've got control over</v>

55
00:02:50.061 --> 00:02:55.061
<v Speaker 1>yourself and well obviously that's just not the case and that's because there</v>

56
00:02:55.281 --> 00:02:58.970
<v Speaker 1>are all sorts of things operating inside of you that have their own autonomy.</v>

57
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>They're all own nature that you Glen,</v>

58
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>he will have to contend with it.</v>

59
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you went back inside the human psyche,</v>

60
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

61
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.280
<v Speaker 1>to look at the fantasies that we spontaneously generated,</v>

62
00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>disagree with of the world,</v>

63
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.830
<v Speaker 1>to see if he can find out what the pattern constituted.</v>

64
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.533
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>

65
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.760
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to tell you this little story.</v>

66
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So this is the idea.</v>

67
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.263
<v Speaker 1>This is partly,</v>

68
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>he's stories are parked of your ride from thousands or even can have tens of</v>

69
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.340
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years of watching how people act it successfully and unsuccessfully</v>

70
00:03:34.341 --> 00:03:36.830
<v Speaker 1>in the world and extracting patterns.</v>

71
00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.880
<v Speaker 1>So the patterns get extracted,</v>

72
00:03:40.881 --> 00:03:45.230
<v Speaker 1>they get more abstract and they get less real in some sense,</v>

73
00:03:45.231 --> 00:03:46.850
<v Speaker 1>but they get more broadly applicable.</v>

74
00:03:46.851 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>So let me tell you first story.</v>

75
00:03:49.191 --> 00:03:52.520
<v Speaker 1>So this is from the opening chapter opening parts of geography.</v>

76
00:03:52.521 --> 00:03:54.040
<v Speaker 1>So there's an idea in genesis,</v>

77
00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.480
<v Speaker 1>this is roughly how the idea is laid out and it's an idea that is expressed in</v>

78
00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.490
<v Speaker 1>consultancy all over the world in different forms.</v>

79
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.480
<v Speaker 1>So the first time you had is that there's sorts of two domains,</v>

80
00:04:04.481 --> 00:04:05.720
<v Speaker 1>major fee,</v>

81
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.610
<v Speaker 1>there's potential chaos and there's order having more.</v>

82
00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.151
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

83
00:04:11.151 --> 00:04:11.984
<v Speaker 1>Now that's,</v>

84
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the,</v>

85
00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.810
<v Speaker 1>that's the structure of reality.</v>

86
00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.100
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Dow was getting yet that's the same thing that you're hemispheres</v>

87
00:04:19.101 --> 00:04:23.180
<v Speaker 1>are matching order and chaos and that's what the world's made up.</v>

88
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

90
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>there's a third factor.</v>

91
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:28.680
<v Speaker 1>And the third factor is the thing that immediately if we noticed too,</v>

92
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.230
<v Speaker 1>and that would be,</v>

93
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.070
<v Speaker 1>that's equivalent.</v>

94
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.771
<v Speaker 1>I think one,</v>

95
00:04:31.771 --> 00:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>one are people mean when they talk about consciousness because that seems to be</v>

96
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 1>what consciousness,</v>

97
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.083
<v Speaker 1>dubs,</v>

98
00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 1>consciousness establishes order your conscious,</v>

99
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 1>you make decisions,</v>

100
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.950
<v Speaker 1>you make it a world.</v>

101
00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.080
<v Speaker 1>But while you're being conscious in attempting,</v>

102
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.220
<v Speaker 1>you're attending what you don't yet understand and haven't asked her.</v>

103
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Speaker 1>So you face with something going and potential and you transform that</v>

104
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 1>effortfully in carefully to what you understand and what you couldn't have that.</v>

105
00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.510
<v Speaker 1>So that's what your consciousness does.</v>

106
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>And the Genesis you see that portrayed,</v>

107
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.330
<v Speaker 1>you sees death portrayed as something that's defined because if dividing spirit,</v>

108
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.340
<v Speaker 1>so that's basically Gallois y'all was y'all was,</v>

109
00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:10.101
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

110
00:05:10.101 --> 00:05:11.420
<v Speaker 1>The process by which you all,</v>

111
00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:13.910
<v Speaker 1>what generates the world is being turned her.</v>

112
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 1>This is the Christianization of that story is the term of the logos and the</v>

113
00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:20.570
<v Speaker 1>logos is the capacity for attentive,</v>

114
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.530
<v Speaker 1>communicative,</v>

115
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.330
<v Speaker 1>truthful speech.</v>

116
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:26.390
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a deep idea at the beginning of genesis step</v>

117
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>whenever defining consciousness is that which uses truthful,</v>

118
00:05:32.341 --> 00:05:37.341
<v Speaker 1>communicated speech to encounter the chaos of the unknown and to transform it</v>

119
00:05:37.711 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 1>and to have that border.</v>

120
00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a technical description of the structure of reality and it's an</v>

121
00:05:44.521 --> 00:05:47.850
<v Speaker 1>ethical injunction as well because what happens in the opening chapters of</v>

122
00:05:47.851 --> 00:05:52.530
<v Speaker 1>genesis is that God use the logos to create the world out of that preexisted</v>

123
00:05:52.531 --> 00:05:54.210
<v Speaker 1>chaos and he,</v>

124
00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.370
<v Speaker 1>and when he does that in stages,</v>

125
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>he pronounces it good.</v>

126
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an idea there [inaudible] idea</v>

127
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>because one of the things he might ask yourself,</v>

128
00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the things that the mass murderers asking themselves all the</v>

129
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:16.991
<v Speaker 1>time is being justified or is it something against which you should strive and</v>

130
00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:20.533
<v Speaker 1>destroy?</v>

131
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very good question because life is very,</v>

132
00:06:24.501 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>very difficult and it's full of suffering and it's full of new trail and it's</v>

133
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>full of malevolence and it's not an unreasonable proposition.</v>

134
00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.730
<v Speaker 1>He questioned whether it would be better if you're not thinking of all the</v>

135
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.740
<v Speaker 1>assistants and the people who take the steps to doing the terrible things that</v>

136
00:06:40.851 --> 00:06:41.900
<v Speaker 1>they ended up doing.</v>

137
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 1>Answer that question in the affirmative.</v>

138
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>They believe that life itself is so unbearable in its fundamental structure that</v>

139
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 1>normally should it not exist,</v>

140
00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>but that the right response to it is to take revenge against the fact that its</v>

141
00:06:55.161 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

142
00:06:57.370 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of the answer to how you get to where you have to go if you're</v>

143
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:04.760
<v Speaker 1>going to render down and drive it for camp blocks on the city,</v>

144
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 1>on city sidewalks,</v>

145
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.550
<v Speaker 1>it's a deep,</v>

146
00:07:07.551 --> 00:07:09.620
<v Speaker 1>deep bro and it's justifiable,</v>

147
00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.990
<v Speaker 1>but the hypothesis it's laid out in genesis,</v>

148
00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.860
<v Speaker 1>which is an amazing hypothesis,</v>

149
00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:19.870
<v Speaker 1>is that despite the fragility of the world and the vulnerability of the world,</v>

150
00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:21.100
<v Speaker 1>and it's called cleverly,</v>

151
00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 1>let's say towards malevolence,</v>

152
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 1>if you encountered with consciousness and counters the potential that the world</v>

153
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 1>is extracted from and he does that truthfully,</v>

154
00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:34.040
<v Speaker 1>then what is created as a consequence is good.</v>

155
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that's the host.</v>

156
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>That's the most fundamental act of faith and I think that's the fundamental</v>

157
00:07:40.131 --> 00:07:41.680
<v Speaker 1>ethical question that lives,</v>

158
00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 1>it's that underlies the entire corpus of the stories in which our culture and</v>

159
00:07:46.161 --> 00:07:48.350
<v Speaker 1>all of them are paid.</v>

160
00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.453
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

161
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>are you willing to act out the proposition that being is good?</v>

162
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:55.190
<v Speaker 1>If you abide by the truth,</v>

163
00:07:56.030 --> 00:07:58.940
<v Speaker 1>and what's interesting is that it's an existential question,</v>

164
00:07:58.941 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 1>Nate.</v>

165
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.800
<v Speaker 1>It's not a question that you can that can be answered by fact because no one can</v>

166
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>prove it to you because they can't.</v>

167
00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.650
<v Speaker 1>They can't tell you what your life is going to be like if you do that because</v>

168
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 1>you're the only person that can find out.</v>

169
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you can find out is essentially by risking everything you can</v>

170
00:08:15.711 --> 00:08:16.101
<v Speaker 1>decide,</v>

171
00:08:16.101 --> 00:08:16.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

172
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:21.221
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to separately proposition that truthful being is that being that</v>

173
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 1>producers what's good,</v>

174
00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:24.590
<v Speaker 1>and then I'm going to abide by that.</v>

175
00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.260
<v Speaker 1>But then the springs things will how to you,</v>

176
00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:31.330
<v Speaker 1>because it isn't necessarily the case that if you attempt to abide by your own</v>

177
00:08:31.491 --> 00:08:32.324
<v Speaker 1>truth,</v>

178
00:08:32.330 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>that everything that happens to every second is going to be demonstrative proof</v>

179
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>that that's the right pathway.</v>

180
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.850
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna get yourself in all sorts of trouble.</v>

181
00:08:40.851 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 1>If you do that,</v>

182
00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.310
<v Speaker 1>you know that perfectly well because there's uncomfortable conversations that</v>

183
00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.210
<v Speaker 1>you should probably have heard a few people.</v>

184
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>And if you have those uncomfortable conversations,</v>

185
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not like there's big,</v>

186
00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.460
<v Speaker 1>it's just going to be roses and sunshine.</v>

187
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 1>While you're having the discussion.</v>

188
00:08:54.110 --> 00:08:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Quite the contrary.</v>

189
00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.040
<v Speaker 1>The truth is a very disruptive force,</v>

190
00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:01.250
<v Speaker 1>especially people that are living inside an illusion.</v>

191
00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.070
<v Speaker 1>And so it is,</v>

192
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a statement.</v>

193
00:09:04.011 --> 00:09:04.251
<v Speaker 1>It's an,</v>

194
00:09:04.251 --> 00:09:06.950
<v Speaker 1>if it's a metaphysical statement of faith.</v>
