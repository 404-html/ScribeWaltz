00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.041
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>

3
00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:15.330
<v Speaker 2>and welcome to simulation.</v>

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.803
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>

5
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:23.291
<v Speaker 1>Hello.</v>

6
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Hello everyone.</v>

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm your host Allen sock yarn.</v>

8
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I'll be your beacon of curiosity this evening.</v>

9
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Simulation Paris together,</v>

10
00:00:32.831 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>global leaders with humanities,</v>

11
00:00:34.781 --> 00:00:39.781
<v Speaker 1>most thought provoking questions and we hope to fill Levi stadium.</v>

12
00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>We hope to scale these thought provoking conversations up to the size of Levi</v>

13
00:00:45.761 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>stadium because if the national football,</v>

14
00:00:49.121 --> 00:00:49.954
<v Speaker 1>we can do it.</v>

15
00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>So can the scientists,</v>

16
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:52.264
<v Speaker 1>am I right?</v>

17
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

18
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.993
<v Speaker 2>Through it.</v>

19
00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.491
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

20
00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>You guys know who your guest is.</v>

21
00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:03.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.180
<v Speaker 1>let's give him a little bit of San Francisco Bay area La.</v>

23
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.943
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

25
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

27
00:01:12.661 --> 00:01:13.494
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

28
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.551
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

29
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:15.384
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

30
00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.690
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

31
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of noise for a bunch of lefties.</v>

32
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.211
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

33
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:09.631
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

34
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:10.464
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

35
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.593
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

36
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>that's completely overwhelming.</v>

37
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

38
00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:15.683
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

39
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

40
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco Barrier welcomes you.</v>

41
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.773
<v Speaker 1>Huge welcome.</v>

42
00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you see the lobster?</v>

43
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

44
00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>I sit in the last year.</v>

45
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

46
00:02:32.821 --> 00:02:33.091
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

47
00:02:33.091 --> 00:02:33.924
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

48
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

49
00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.510
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

51
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Lobsters everywhere.</v>

52
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>I guess they just made the lobster Emoji.</v>

53
00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:39.493
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

54
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.090
<v Speaker 1>that seems syncronous right.</v>

55
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Seems like a synchronous event.</v>

56
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:43.544
<v Speaker 1>It's quite funny.</v>

57
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

58
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.610
<v Speaker 1>I want the one where you're riding the lobster,</v>

59
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 1>you can buy those posters if you're really into that sort of thing.</v>

60
00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 2>New fetishes.</v>

61
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

62
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

63
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jordan,</v>

64
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>where do we even start?</v>

65
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:02.131 --> 00:03:02.964
<v Speaker 1>you're the interviewer.</v>

67
00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Amazing,</v>

68
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>amazing work over the last year.</v>

69
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>You for me,</v>

70
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.730
<v Speaker 1>someone that you remind me of is Tony Robbins.</v>

71
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.983
<v Speaker 1>I think he's taller.</v>

72
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.853
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

73
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>someone that knows how to</v>

74
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>inspire people to self actualization.</v>

75
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>And I find that to be deeply needed in our world.</v>

76
00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:34.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you've been doing and it's brilliant.</v>

77
00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful.</v>

78
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 1>And I think this is why you bring people together like this.</v>

79
00:03:38.741 --> 00:03:39.574
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

80
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.910
<v Speaker 1>so something that you brought to the attention of so many people is the</v>

81
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>dominance or competence hierarchy.</v>

82
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Y W let's maybe talk about what's,</v>

83
00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:56.540
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference?</v>

84
00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.600
<v Speaker 1>Dominance or competence hierarchy.</v>

85
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>I kind of like competence hierarchy.</v>

86
00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

87
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.800
<v Speaker 1>it's better.</v>

88
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

90
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Well I got this colleague,</v>

91
00:04:03.731 --> 00:04:08.731
<v Speaker 1>his name is Daniel Higgins and I've been working with him for like 25 years.</v>

92
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:12.160
<v Speaker 1>He helped me design the self authoring suite,</v>

93
00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 1>which is a series of programs,</v>

94
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:18.850
<v Speaker 1>writing programs that are online that helped people write about their lives,</v>

95
00:04:18.851 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 1>their past.</v>

96
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>And their present,</v>

97
00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.230
<v Speaker 1>their virtues and their faults and to make a plan for the future.</v>

98
00:04:24.231 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

99
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:25.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

100
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.891
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a lot.</v>

101
00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

102
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.701
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

103
00:04:27.701 --> 00:04:28.534
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

104
00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.630
<v Speaker 1>he has a master's degree in MIT in engineering.</v>

105
00:04:31.631 --> 00:04:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And then he went to Harvard.</v>

106
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:35.800
<v Speaker 1>He was a student of mine there and he got a phd in experimental psychology.</v>

107
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:39.460
<v Speaker 1>And we've been working on these psychological interventions online ever since.</v>

108
00:04:39.461 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And we talk fairly frequently.</v>

109
00:04:42.011 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>And I'd been using the term dominance hierarchy a lot,</v>

110
00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>which it's something that's used by biologists very regularly,</v>

111
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:48.701
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Because most social animals,</v>

113
00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>even animals that aren't social,</v>

114
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.120
<v Speaker 1>any animals that have to compete for occupation of a specific territorial space</v>

115
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>tend to organize themselves into fairly predictable hierarchies.</v>

116
00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

117
00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

118
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.410
<v Speaker 1>it's a biological universal that's a good way of thinking about it,</v>

119
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>which is something really important to know,</v>

120
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:07.421
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

121
00:05:07.421 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>Because if you don't know that,</v>

122
00:05:08.771 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 1>then you might think that hierarchical organizations are some secondary</v>

123
00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>consequence of a sociopolitical structure and economic structure or something</v>

124
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:16.000
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

125
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

126
00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Speaker 1>that's just not true.</v>

127
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>It isn't even a little bit true.</v>

128
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably not true.</v>

129
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.930
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

130
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

131
00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.290
<v Speaker 1>this is partly why in rural and 12 rules for life,</v>

132
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about the nervous system of crustaceans and in rule number one,</v>

133
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.130
<v Speaker 1>because the neural biological systems that we have evolved or that have evolved</v>

134
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 1>to deal with dominance,</v>

135
00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:39.851
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

136
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.271
<v Speaker 1>placement,</v>

137
00:05:40.271 --> 00:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>and I'll get to the competence issue in a minute,</v>

138
00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.440
<v Speaker 1>are at least a third of a billion years old,</v>

139
00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.450
<v Speaker 1>and that's far longer than theirs.</v>

140
00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

141
00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:50.050
<v Speaker 1>that's there weren't trees a third of a billion years ago.</v>

142
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:51.100
<v Speaker 1>So dominance,</v>

143
00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:51.611
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies,</v>

144
00:05:51.611 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical organizations among animals are older than trees.</v>

145
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no blaming them on capitalism,</v>

146
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

147
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

148
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.191
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

149
00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:58.940
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

150
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.151
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

151
00:05:59.151 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 3>seriously,</v>

152
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 3>hierarchies have problems that they're problematic social structures,</v>

153
00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:04.930
<v Speaker 3>but you can't blame them on,</v>

154
00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.133
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

155
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.801
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

156
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>

157
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.053
<v Speaker 3>on cultural,</v>

158
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.370
<v Speaker 3>you can't blame them on culture.</v>

159
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.410
<v Speaker 3>Anyways,</v>

160
00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 3>we were talking about dominance hierarchies and Dr. Higgins said,</v>

161
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.740
<v Speaker 3>you can't call them dominance hierarchies.</v>

162
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

163
00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.083
<v Speaker 3>why not?</v>

164
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.080
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

165
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.501
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

166
00:06:20.501 --> 00:06:20.741
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

167
00:06:20.741 --> 00:06:24.890
<v Speaker 3>unless you're in an organization where you can put a dog leash around someone's</v>

168
00:06:24.891 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 3>neck and lead them around,</v>

169
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 3>it's not a dominance hierarchy.</v>

170
00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.120
<v Speaker 3>And I thought he's kind of blunt as he might've notice by that comment kind of</v>

171
00:06:32.121 --> 00:06:33.320
<v Speaker 3>shocked me a because,</v>

172
00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.760
<v Speaker 3>because it was so blunt.</v>

173
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.660
<v Speaker 3>There's lots of that that happens in San Francisco.</v>

174
00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:37.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

175
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.861
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

176
00:06:43.861 --> 00:06:44.611
<v Speaker 3>Well the thing is,</v>

177
00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:44.911
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

178
00:06:44.911 --> 00:06:49.911
<v Speaker 3>you know that that's actually an operable comment because dominance is just as</v>

179
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 3>old as sexuality,</v>

180
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 3>perhaps.</v>

181
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps not quite as old.</v>

182
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not quite as old as sexuality,</v>

183
00:06:55.131 --> 00:06:57.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's old enough so that the two things get tangled together.</v>

184
00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 3>Very,</v>

185
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.740
<v Speaker 3>very inevitably.</v>

186
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:01.443
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

187
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 3>he said two things that I thought were really interesting and the first was</v>

188
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:06.404
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

189
00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

190
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 3>human organizations are sufficiently complex,</v>

191
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:13.800
<v Speaker 3>so the dominance is an insufficient means of establishing hierarchy gold</v>

192
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.643
<v Speaker 3>priority.</v>

193
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:15.661
<v Speaker 3>That's good.</v>

194
00:07:15.661 --> 00:07:16.081
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

195
00:07:16.081 --> 00:07:16.561
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

196
00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:17.970
<v Speaker 3>I knew that as soon as he said that,</v>

197
00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:18.271
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>

198
00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:19.000
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

199
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't be using the term dominance hierarchy because friends de wall,</v>

200
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.080
<v Speaker 3>who's Dutch primatologist wrote a series of excellent books on the emergence of</v>

201
00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:29.340
<v Speaker 3>morality and chimpanzees.</v>

202
00:07:29.341 --> 00:07:30.420
<v Speaker 3>I would highly recommend them.</v>

203
00:07:30.421 --> 00:07:31.590
<v Speaker 3>They're very interesting books.</v>

204
00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 3>One of the things do all noted was that in chimpanzee hierarchies,</v>

205
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.690
<v Speaker 3>the brutal males can rise to the top,</v>

206
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 3>but they tend to have very short lived empires and to meet very,</v>

207
00:07:43.221 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 3>very violent deaths.</v>

208
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.960
<v Speaker 3>And so his conclusion was that in order,</v>

209
00:07:48.961 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 3>even for a chimpanzee hierarchy to be stable across time,</v>

210
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.290
<v Speaker 3>then they top chimp had to be quite pro social.</v>

211
00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:59.490
<v Speaker 3>So first of all had to engage in sufficient reciprocal behavior so that he had</v>

212
00:07:59.491 --> 00:08:00.960
<v Speaker 3>allies among other males.</v>

213
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.821
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

214
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:02.511
<v Speaker 3>Because otherwise,</v>

215
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:06.670
<v Speaker 3>if you're like top chimp and your cavemen strongman type,</v>

216
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 3>and you've established dominance merely as a matter of intimidation and</v>

217
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:11.864
<v Speaker 3>strength,</v>

218
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 3>then if you have an off day,</v>

219
00:08:13.191 --> 00:08:16.250
<v Speaker 3>two of your slightly weaker opponents can tear you to pieces,</v>

220
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 3>which is exactly what the chimps do because they're quite brutal in there.</v>

221
00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.240
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence that chimpanzees have any internal regulation of the</v>

222
00:08:24.271 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 3>violence that they'll use to shift dominance,</v>

223
00:08:26.641 --> 00:08:27.570
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy position.</v>

224
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.610
<v Speaker 3>And so you end up castrated,</v>

225
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.261
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

226
00:08:30.261 --> 00:08:31.071
<v Speaker 3>by your opponents,</v>

227
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 3>which is something that the wall noted in the RNM zoo.</v>

228
00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 3>So he found that the stable chimp troops had males at the helm.</v>

229
00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

230
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.943
<v Speaker 3>Who were,</v>

231
00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:41.340
<v Speaker 3>who had friendships,</v>

232
00:08:41.341 --> 00:08:46.100
<v Speaker 3>because chimps actually have social friendships really that can stretch across</v>

233
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 3>many years,</v>

234
00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 3>decades even,</v>

235
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 3>and that they track them very well,</v>

236
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:53.360
<v Speaker 3>very reciprocal and their behavior tended to treat the females relatively well</v>

237
00:08:53.361 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 3>by chimp standards and also tended to pay a fair,</v>

238
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 3>a fair amount of attention to the infants,</v>

239
00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 3>which is an unbelievably important finding,</v>

240
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:00.751
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

241
00:09:00.751 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Because it,</v>

242
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 3>it indicates at a,</v>

243
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:04.710
<v Speaker 3>at a level that's below the human,</v>

244
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:09.711
<v Speaker 3>let's say that there's an ethic associated with leadership that isn't a mere</v>

245
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.280
<v Speaker 3>consequence of raw power.</v>

246
00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:12.181
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

247
00:09:12.181 --> 00:09:14.290
<v Speaker 3>so that was the first thing that Higgins pointed out in.</v>

248
00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 3>The second thing was that he thought,</v>

249
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:17.110
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

250
00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:17.943
<v Speaker 3>and I haven't,</v>

251
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.680
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how true this is yet.</v>

252
00:09:19.681 --> 00:09:24.681
<v Speaker 3>He thought that some of what the pathologists who had used the term dominance</v>

253
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:30.560
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy to apply to animals might have been doing was using an intrinsically</v>

254
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:35.661
<v Speaker 3>Marxist framework to interpret animal behavior and to overestimate the degree to</v>

255
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:38.390
<v Speaker 3>which dominance was actually the,</v>

256
00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:38.780
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

257
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.270
<v Speaker 3>the core foundation of hierarchical organizations,</v>

258
00:09:42.271 --> 00:09:44.660
<v Speaker 3>even among animals and the first ones,</v>

259
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 3>the first objection he had,</v>

260
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 3>that's definitely the case.</v>

261
00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.090
<v Speaker 3>This is true.</v>

262
00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:48.923
<v Speaker 3>The second one,</v>

263
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:49.960
<v Speaker 3>it's an interest.</v>

264
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.793
<v Speaker 3>Competence.</v>

265
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:51.241
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

266
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:51.511
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

267
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 3>Well the idea that that it's pure power is an unstable basis for,</v>

268
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.681
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>

269
00:09:55.681 --> 00:09:56.580
<v Speaker 3>for uh,</v>

270
00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 3>stable hierarchy.</v>

271
00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.700
<v Speaker 3>That's well documented and I think that has probably moved into the realm of</v>

272
00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:04.290
<v Speaker 3>empirically verifiable fact.</v>

273
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:08.940
<v Speaker 3>The second one that the initial idea that it was dominance per se that was at</v>

274
00:10:08.941 --> 00:10:13.050
<v Speaker 3>the basis of hierarchical arrangements was in part a quasi I Marxist</v>

275
00:10:13.051 --> 00:10:14.670
<v Speaker 3>interpretation or projection.</v>

276
00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 3>I think that's disputable because I think what happens is that as you go down</v>

277
00:10:19.231 --> 00:10:19.910
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

278
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

279
00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.700
<v Speaker 3>the Fila genetic chain to simpler and simpler animals,</v>

280
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:26.040
<v Speaker 3>it looks more and more like power.</v>

281
00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 3>Physical Prowess essentially is the determining factor.</v>

282
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 3>It certainly seems to be the case among lobsters,</v>

283
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:32.791
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

284
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:33.624
<v Speaker 3>crustaceans,</v>

285
00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:36.340
<v Speaker 3>they're of interest because they have seen their lobster.</v>

286
00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.333
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

287
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 3>they have relatively simple nervous systems relatively,</v>

288
00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:45.090
<v Speaker 3>they're still very complex with large neurons that are easily observable and uh,</v>

289
00:10:45.270 --> 00:10:48.390
<v Speaker 3>and a neurochemistry that differs from humans but is the same.</v>

290
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.640
<v Speaker 3>It's similar in very interesting ways.</v>

291
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:55.641
<v Speaker 3>And maybe an example of using skills that aren't power based or things like</v>

292
00:10:55.980 --> 00:11:00.360
<v Speaker 3>creativity to be able to find ways to get food or get what you want.</v>

293
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:03.390
<v Speaker 3>You might want to figure out how you would define competence.</v>

294
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:07.020
<v Speaker 3>And so there's a psychometric answer to that.</v>

295
00:11:07.021 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 3>So I can metric psychometricians are psychologists who are particularly</v>

296
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 3>interested in measurement and then also in measurement and prediction.</v>

297
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.560
<v Speaker 3>And so one of the things you want to predict are the various human outcomes,</v>

298
00:11:16.561 --> 00:11:17.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

299
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 3>like economic success,</v>

300
00:11:18.511 --> 00:11:18.991
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

301
00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:19.824
<v Speaker 3>or or,</v>

302
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:21.450
<v Speaker 3>or subjective wellbeing,</v>

303
00:11:21.451 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 3>which is something that Sam Harris is quite excited about.</v>

304
00:11:24.151 --> 00:11:26.460
<v Speaker 3>10 or general quality of life.</v>

305
00:11:26.461 --> 00:11:27.570
<v Speaker 3>These things are hard to measure,</v>

306
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 3>but you can measure economic success.</v>

307
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

308
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:31.480
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

309
00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.730
<v Speaker 3>and what you find is that,</v>

310
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.540
<v Speaker 3>well there are a variety of features that predict economic success in the</v>

311
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:37.374
<v Speaker 3>Western world.</v>

312
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:40.410
<v Speaker 3>The most outstanding of those are Iq.</v>

313
00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.000
<v Speaker 3>So that's straight intelligence.</v>

314
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:46.500
<v Speaker 3>And intelligence is something like processing speed and working memory capacity.</v>

315
00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:50.070
<v Speaker 3>So it's the ability to manipulate variables,</v>

316
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:52.800
<v Speaker 3>a number of variables simultaneously at relatively high speeds.</v>

317
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 3>That's their abstract variables.</v>

318
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 3>And that so that,</v>

319
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

320
00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.240
<v Speaker 3>there's still people who debate about the existence of Iq,</v>

321
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:04.660
<v Speaker 3>but they're called fools fundamentally because,</v>

322
00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:05.380
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

323
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:05.681
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

324
00:12:05.681 --> 00:12:06.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's no,</v>

325
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.450
<v Speaker 3>there's absolutely no doubt that Iq is the most documented phenomena in the</v>

326
00:12:10.451 --> 00:12:12.550
<v Speaker 3>social sciences except for one thing.</v>

327
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 3>There's one only one thing I've ever seen that that is,</v>

328
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 3>has been measured more powerfully and accurately.</v>

329
00:12:17.921 --> 00:12:21.550
<v Speaker 3>And that was the correlation between inequality across counties in the United</v>

330
00:12:21.550 --> 00:12:24.430
<v Speaker 3>States and male homicide rate because that correlation is about 0.9.</v>

331
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.180
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

332
00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:26.013
<v Speaker 3>like that's just,</v>

333
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:31.310
<v Speaker 3>you'd never see that the correlation between Iq and success depending on how you</v>

334
00:12:31.541 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 3>measure academic success,</v>

335
00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:34.390
<v Speaker 3>learning speed,</v>

336
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.410
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

337
00:12:35.410 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 3>economic success,</v>

338
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:37.260
<v Speaker 3>success as a,</v>

339
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.910
<v Speaker 3>as a manager and administrator success as an entrepreneur,</v>

340
00:12:39.911 --> 00:12:42.070
<v Speaker 3>you're an entrepreneur or creative agent.</v>

341
00:12:42.730 --> 00:12:46.360
<v Speaker 3>The correlation between that and Iq is about 0.5 which is about</v>

342
00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.530
<v Speaker 3>three times roughly speaking.</v>

343
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

344
00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:53.403
<v Speaker 3>three times,</v>

345
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:58.680
<v Speaker 3>two to three times as powerful as the most typical next powerful order of</v>

346
00:12:58.931 --> 00:13:00.790
<v Speaker 3>effects that science social scientists measure.</v>

347
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 3>So Iq is at walloping effect.</v>

348
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:06.040
<v Speaker 3>So I accused the first one hardly surprising.</v>

349
00:13:06.041 --> 00:13:06.874
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

350
00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 3>especially as the environment gets more complex because Iq predicts performance</v>

351
00:13:12.311 --> 00:13:15.370
<v Speaker 3>in complex jobs better than it predicts performance in simple jobs.</v>

352
00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 3>And a simple job is one where you learn it and then you repeat what you've</v>

353
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:19.901
<v Speaker 3>learned.</v>

354
00:13:19.901 --> 00:13:22.150
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a complex job is a job that changes every day.</v>

355
00:13:22.151 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 3>So I suspect most of you in the audience have complex job and performance in</v>

356
00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.920
<v Speaker 3>well I suspect so you know,</v>

357
00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:30.973
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

358
00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:35.500
<v Speaker 3>and maybe performance with complex thinking as well as long as the environment</v>

359
00:13:35.501 --> 00:13:36.010
<v Speaker 3>that you're,</v>

360
00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 3>that you're operating in changes on a relatively frequent basis than you have to</v>

361
00:13:40.211 --> 00:13:42.280
<v Speaker 3>have an eye high Iq to manage it effectively.</v>

362
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:44.110
<v Speaker 3>That's basically what Iq measures.</v>

363
00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 3>And then the next most,</v>

364
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:46.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

365
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.700
<v Speaker 3>relevant predictor is trait conscientiousness,</v>

366
00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:49.690
<v Speaker 3>which is not a trait.</v>

367
00:13:49.691 --> 00:13:50.830
<v Speaker 3>We understand that all,</v>

368
00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:53.560
<v Speaker 3>we have no measures of conscientiousness that work.</v>

369
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:55.870
<v Speaker 3>We've got a couple of week ones,</v>

370
00:13:55.871 --> 00:14:00.460
<v Speaker 3>but no measures that really work better than self report and other report could</v>

371
00:14:00.461 --> 00:14:03.820
<v Speaker 3>being meticulous be a good way to explain conscientiousness.</v>

372
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 3>Meticulousness is associated with orderliness and orderliness is one of the</v>

373
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:09.160
<v Speaker 3>aspects of conscientiousness,</v>

374
00:14:09.161 --> 00:14:10.390
<v Speaker 3>but conscientious people.</v>

375
00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:14.050
<v Speaker 3>The best way to sum up a conscientious person is that they're very good at</v>

376
00:14:14.051 --> 00:14:16.450
<v Speaker 3>keeping contract with themselves and others.</v>

377
00:14:16.451 --> 00:14:19.890
<v Speaker 3>So what a conscientious person will do is first of all say that they'll do some</v>

378
00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:20.440
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

379
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:21.430
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first thing,</v>

380
00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:22.900
<v Speaker 3>but then they'll actually do it.</v>

381
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.430
<v Speaker 3>So they seem to be able to,</v>

382
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:26.740
<v Speaker 3>and they seem to be able to crucial.</v>

383
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

384
00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:28.061
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

385
00:14:28.061 --> 00:14:28.510
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

386
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:28.691
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

387
00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:32.140
<v Speaker 3>it's crucial if it's especially crucial if you're a manager and administrator,</v>

388
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:34.000
<v Speaker 3>it's not so crucial if you're an entrepreneur,</v>

389
00:14:34.001 --> 00:14:37.330
<v Speaker 3>if you want to hold yourself to achieving goals.</v>

390
00:14:37.420 --> 00:14:38.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

391
00:14:38.170 --> 00:14:38.291
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

392
00:14:38.291 --> 00:14:38.521
<v Speaker 3>Well they,</v>

393
00:14:38.521 --> 00:14:38.740
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

394
00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:39.281
<v Speaker 3>they tend to be,</v>

395
00:14:39.281 --> 00:14:41.740
<v Speaker 3>if you want to work your way up the competence hierarchy,</v>

396
00:14:41.741 --> 00:14:44.710
<v Speaker 3>probably a good way to do that is to say I'm going to do something and do it.</v>

397
00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:45.071
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

398
00:14:45.071 --> 00:14:45.340
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

399
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 3>well that's the thing that these are these,</v>

400
00:14:47.051 --> 00:14:47.884
<v Speaker 3>this isn't,</v>

401
00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:50.410
<v Speaker 3>this isn't rocket science,</v>

402
00:14:50.411 --> 00:14:51.244
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

403
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:51.880
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

404
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.060
<v Speaker 3>market surgery as,</v>

405
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:53.450
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

406
00:14:53.450 --> 00:14:53.781
<v Speaker 3>as,</v>

407
00:14:53.781 --> 00:14:54.614
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

408
00:14:55.310 --> 00:14:58.460
<v Speaker 3>one of the favorite characters of a show I like in Canada tends to say that</v>

409
00:14:58.730 --> 00:15:01.220
<v Speaker 3>that's the trailer park boys rocket surgery,</v>

410
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:03.920
<v Speaker 3>which I think is really funny anyways.</v>

411
00:15:03.921 --> 00:15:04.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

412
00:15:04.390 --> 00:15:04.851
<v Speaker 3>Lord for,</v>

413
00:15:04.851 --> 00:15:07.490
<v Speaker 3>so for a social science finding,</v>

414
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.050
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty damn self evident,</v>

415
00:15:09.051 --> 00:15:09.321
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

416
00:15:09.321 --> 00:15:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Smart people who work hard do better.</v>

417
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.610
<v Speaker 3>And but what that,</v>

418
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:13.280
<v Speaker 3>what that,</v>

419
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.470
<v Speaker 3>what's also really cool about that and this,</v>

420
00:15:15.490 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 3>it isn't viewed this way very often.</v>

421
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

422
00:15:17.630 --> 00:15:22.190
<v Speaker 3>let's say that you were going to psychometrically validate the integrity of an</v>

423
00:15:22.191 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 3>economic system.</v>

424
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:24.621
<v Speaker 3>So you'd say,</v>

425
00:15:24.621 --> 00:15:28.190
<v Speaker 3>well you take the smart people in the hardworking people and see if they do</v>

426
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:28.521
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

427
00:15:28.521 --> 00:15:29.540
<v Speaker 3>And if the answer is no,</v>

428
00:15:29.541 --> 00:15:30.830
<v Speaker 3>then the system is rotten,</v>

429
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:31.821
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

430
00:15:31.821 --> 00:15:32.031
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

431
00:15:32.031 --> 00:15:32.930
<v Speaker 3>doesn't that make sense?</v>

432
00:15:32.931 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Because you'd expect,</v>

433
00:15:34.190 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 3>you'd hope if a system is functioning that faster,</v>

434
00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 3>harder working people would be better at whatever it does.</v>

435
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.560
<v Speaker 3>And it turns out that in our culture,</v>

436
00:15:42.561 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 3>in the western culture,</v>

437
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 3>the correlation between conscientiousness plus Iq,</v>

438
00:15:47.571 --> 00:15:51.590
<v Speaker 3>you have to wait the two and longterm life success is as high as 0.7,</v>

439
00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:56.840
<v Speaker 3>which is walloping walloping correlation given how much chance also contributes</v>

440
00:15:56.841 --> 00:15:57.471
<v Speaker 3>to success,</v>

441
00:15:57.471 --> 00:15:57.681
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

442
00:15:57.681 --> 00:16:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Because you can be working hard and very smart and then you get cancer and die.</v>

443
00:16:01.041 --> 00:16:02.030
<v Speaker 3>And that's the end of that.</v>

444
00:16:02.031 --> 00:16:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Like there are lots of random events in life that interfere with your movement</v>

445
00:16:05.991 --> 00:16:06.710
<v Speaker 3>forward.</v>

446
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:11.710
<v Speaker 3>And so there's an eradicable degree of chance that that prediction is not going</v>

447
00:16:12.411 --> 00:16:13.244
<v Speaker 3>to overcome.</v>

448
00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 3>Plus we're not that good at measuring success.</v>

449
00:16:15.801 --> 00:16:16.091
<v Speaker 3>So there's,</v>

450
00:16:16.091 --> 00:16:19.130
<v Speaker 3>there's error on the success end of the measurement as well.</v>

451
00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:21.920
<v Speaker 3>But IQ and conscientiousness goes a long ways.</v>

452
00:16:21.921 --> 00:16:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

453
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

454
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:23.810
<v Speaker 3>and that's competence,</v>

455
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:24.431
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

456
00:16:24.431 --> 00:16:24.980
<v Speaker 3>And then we,</v>

457
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.830
<v Speaker 3>the other thing we might think about with regards to defining a competence</v>

458
00:16:27.831 --> 00:16:32.831
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy is imagine that one of the things you want from the operators within a</v>

459
00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 3>hierarchy is that they maintain the hierarchy and they expand it so that it can</v>

460
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:40.160
<v Speaker 3>include other people.</v>

461
00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:40.851
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

462
00:16:40.851 --> 00:16:42.830
<v Speaker 3>And so competence,</v>

463
00:16:43.010 --> 00:16:46.490
<v Speaker 3>a good measure of competence would be the ability to work within the hierarchy</v>

464
00:16:46.491 --> 00:16:47.750
<v Speaker 3>while you're also expanding,</v>

465
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:49.520
<v Speaker 3>maintaining it and expanding it.</v>

466
00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.050
<v Speaker 3>And so that means that you would want to set up an economic system where smart,</v>

467
00:16:54.051 --> 00:16:58.190
<v Speaker 3>hardworking people were doing things that made other people who weren't them</v>

468
00:16:58.191 --> 00:16:59.024
<v Speaker 3>rich too.</v>

469
00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.490
<v Speaker 3>I think we're actually pretty good at that.</v>

470
00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:02.121
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

471
00:17:02.121 --> 00:17:03.440
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the statistics,</v>

472
00:17:03.441 --> 00:17:07.430
<v Speaker 3>here's a good one and this is why people shouldn't be as pessimistic as they are</v>

473
00:17:07.431 --> 00:17:08.060
<v Speaker 3>likely.</v>

474
00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:11.890
<v Speaker 3>It's a good feeling to make other people well off and have their wellbeing be</v>

475
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.220
<v Speaker 3>bought and lots of people,</v>

476
00:17:13.221 --> 00:17:16.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the things I've really been struck by with the people that I've</v>

477
00:17:16.401 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 3>known who are hyper competent is that one of the things they really like to do</v>

478
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:25.600
<v Speaker 3>is to find young people who need opportunities and open doors for them.</v>

479
00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:26.171
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a,</v>

480
00:17:26.171 --> 00:17:26.660
<v Speaker 3>it's a,</v>

481
00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:28.760
<v Speaker 3>it's a pleasure that's not well measured,</v>

482
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:29.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

483
00:17:29.061 --> 00:17:32.420
<v Speaker 3>but I know that like I've seen that among the professors that I've known,</v>

484
00:17:32.421 --> 00:17:33.410
<v Speaker 3>that I really admired,</v>

485
00:17:33.411 --> 00:17:36.890
<v Speaker 3>like they really like to mentor graduate schools and graduate students and</v>

486
00:17:36.891 --> 00:17:40.340
<v Speaker 3>develop their careers and entrepreneurs in silicon valley that I know the same</v>

487
00:17:40.341 --> 00:17:40.641
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

488
00:17:40.641 --> 00:17:43.250
<v Speaker 3>And good managers and administrators,</v>

489
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:45.110
<v Speaker 3>they're not playing a zero sum game.</v>

490
00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:47.150
<v Speaker 3>They're not opening the doors to everyone,</v>

491
00:17:47.151 --> 00:17:47.661
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't say.</v>

492
00:17:47.661 --> 00:17:51.330
<v Speaker 3>But they're definitely always looking around for competent people who are young</v>

493
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.010
<v Speaker 3>to provide opportunities to.</v>

494
00:17:53.011 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 3>And it's a real unsung virtue of capitalism that that sort of thing occurs and</v>

495
00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.290
<v Speaker 3>it's not rare.</v>

496
00:17:58.890 --> 00:17:59.723
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

497
00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:00.361
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

498
00:18:00.361 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 3>so well.</v>

499
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:01.800
<v Speaker 3>So back to the,</v>

500
00:18:02.010 --> 00:18:04.560
<v Speaker 3>to the ICU and conscientiousness connection is like,</v>

501
00:18:05.270 --> 00:18:06.103
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

502
00:18:06.850 --> 00:18:09.020
<v Speaker 3>like with regards to the say the,</v>

503
00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:13.230
<v Speaker 3>the broad capitalist that broad capitalists social and economic structure,</v>

504
00:18:13.231 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

505
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you guys know this,</v>

506
00:18:14.821 --> 00:18:18.720
<v Speaker 3>but the UN said is one of its millennial goals in the year 2000 to have the</v>

507
00:18:18.721 --> 00:18:22.170
<v Speaker 3>rates of poverty in the world by 50% within 15 years.</v>

508
00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:22.890
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

509
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:24.600
<v Speaker 3>And we hit that in 2012,</v>

510
00:18:24.601 --> 00:18:25.830
<v Speaker 3>three years ahead of schedule.</v>

511
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.910
<v Speaker 3>It was the fastest decrease in human poverty that has ever occurred in the</v>

512
00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:32.460
<v Speaker 3>history of the planet by a massive margin.</v>

513
00:18:32.610 --> 00:18:33.960
<v Speaker 3>And it hasn't quit.</v>

514
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.441
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>

515
00:18:34.441 --> 00:18:36.750
<v Speaker 3>Obesity is a bigger problem now than starvation.</v>

516
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:39.000
<v Speaker 3>It's like we should have party in the street for that,</v>

517
00:18:39.060 --> 00:18:39.241
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

518
00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:41.820
<v Speaker 3>There's more faculty than there are starving people.</v>

519
00:18:42.090 --> 00:18:42.780
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

520
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:44.580
<v Speaker 3>it's a perverse sort of victory,</v>

521
00:18:44.581 --> 00:18:45.414
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

522
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.980
<v Speaker 3>but it's a big one and about 300,000 people a day right now are being plugged</v>

523
00:18:49.981 --> 00:18:53.880
<v Speaker 3>into the electrical grid and the fastest growing economies are in sub Sahara</v>

524
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:54.060
<v Speaker 3>Africa,</v>

525
00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.050
<v Speaker 3>sub Saharan Africa.</v>

526
00:18:55.051 --> 00:18:59.580
<v Speaker 3>It's like there's some real reason to be thinking things are going great and</v>

527
00:18:59.581 --> 00:19:04.140
<v Speaker 3>they're having Amazon and Alibaba compete to provide them with those goods that</v>

528
00:19:04.141 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 3>they need every single day.</v>

529
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.441
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

530
00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 3>well they have cell phone technology that's really made a big difference and</v>

531
00:19:08.431 --> 00:19:12.810
<v Speaker 3>help stabilize the currencies and help them identify where the proper market is</v>

532
00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:16.470
<v Speaker 3>for their goods and their being plugged into youtube and watching Jordan B.</v>

533
00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.303
<v Speaker 3>Peterson videos now.</v>

534
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.761
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

535
00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 3>Well what can I say?</v>

536
00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.520
<v Speaker 3>So Jordan,</v>

537
00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:22.030
<v Speaker 3>Jordan.</v>

538
00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:23.310
<v Speaker 3>So competence hierarchies.</v>

539
00:19:23.311 --> 00:19:23.491
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

540
00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:24.120
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

541
00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:24.810
<v Speaker 3>it's better.</v>

542
00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:25.643
<v Speaker 3>It's better to think.</v>

543
00:19:25.890 --> 00:19:30.890
<v Speaker 3>It's better to think of a well functioning human hierarchy as one based on</v>

544
00:19:31.351 --> 00:19:32.070
<v Speaker 3>competence.</v>

545
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.690
<v Speaker 3>The other thing,</v>

546
00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:36.990
<v Speaker 3>like my colleague said to me was that you don't want to overestimate how much</v>

547
00:19:36.991 --> 00:19:38.250
<v Speaker 3>power people have,</v>

548
00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Speaker 3>let's say in a corporate environment because it's not obvious at all that the</v>

549
00:19:42.721 --> 00:19:45.240
<v Speaker 3>managers or the executives for that matter,</v>

550
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.790
<v Speaker 3>except in the rare cases where they're psychopathic,</v>

551
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.710
<v Speaker 3>have fewer strictures,</v>

552
00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:50.371
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

553
00:19:50.371 --> 00:19:52.680
<v Speaker 3>well sometimes you get psychopaths that rise to the top,</v>

554
00:19:52.681 --> 00:19:52.891
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

555
00:19:52.891 --> 00:19:53.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

556
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:54.540
<v Speaker 3>otherwise there wouldn't be psychopaths.</v>

557
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:55.200
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

558
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.800
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

559
00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:00.330
<v Speaker 3>it isn't obvious that people higher up in a competence hierarchy have fewer</v>

560
00:20:00.331 --> 00:20:03.630
<v Speaker 3>strictures on their moral behavior than people lower in the hierarchy.</v>

561
00:20:03.631 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

562
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:09.170
<v Speaker 3>Because my sense is that responsibility increases as you move up the hierarchy.</v>

563
00:20:10.141 --> 00:20:10.974
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

564
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.240
<v Speaker 3>and your degrees of freedom with regards to moral attitude also tend to decline</v>

565
00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:15.870
<v Speaker 3>because you're,</v>

566
00:20:15.870 --> 00:20:16.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

567
00:20:16.111 --> 00:20:17.020
<v Speaker 3>if you're a manager of,</v>

568
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.840
<v Speaker 3>well maybe you have 30 people working for you and they each only have one</v>

569
00:20:21.841 --> 00:20:22.674
<v Speaker 3>manager.</v>

570
00:20:22.890 --> 00:20:24.870
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that you're responsible to.</v>

571
00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:25.651
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

572
00:20:25.651 --> 00:20:26.550
<v Speaker 3>and you can't miss.</v>

573
00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:28.920
<v Speaker 3>You can't mistreat your people</v>

574
00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:36.140
<v Speaker 3>with any degree of consistency because the good ones leave the bad ones torture</v>

575
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:39.174
<v Speaker 3>you to death.</v>

576
00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.580
<v Speaker 3>And the whole thing collapses across time.</v>

577
00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:47.060
<v Speaker 3>And so the whole idea that what you have in a competence hierarchy is power</v>

578
00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:52.090
<v Speaker 1>is not a reasonable assumption as far as I can tell.</v>

579
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a big deal,</v>

580
00:20:53.591 --> 00:20:54.030
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

581
00:20:54.030 --> 00:20:54.320
<v Speaker 1>We read,</v>

582
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.480
<v Speaker 1>you've got to get that right.</v>

583
00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:56.860
<v Speaker 1>So it's a big deal.</v>

584
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.450
<v Speaker 1>And the word competence is an empowering word.</v>

585
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I've achieved the status that I have,</v>

586
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:06.040
<v Speaker 1>whoever's speaking these words,</v>

587
00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 1>by competence,</v>

588
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.990
<v Speaker 1>and then there's better mates,</v>

589
00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:12.731
<v Speaker 1>better food,</v>

590
00:21:12.731 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 1>less disease,</v>

591
00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:14.980
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

592
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.150
<v Speaker 1>to climb higher.</v>

593
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.530
<v Speaker 1>Now since you,</v>

594
00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:18.401
<v Speaker 1>since you bring this up,</v>

595
00:21:18.401 --> 00:21:21.580
<v Speaker 1>I think this is an important point and that I really wanted to ask you about,</v>

596
00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:26.970
<v Speaker 1>which is that what percentage of the competence hierarchies influenced by</v>

597
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:31.720
<v Speaker 1>potentially an exertion of oppression for giving?</v>

598
00:21:31.721 --> 00:21:32.880
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

599
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:34.120
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

600
00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:36.550
<v Speaker 1>let's go ahead and take our friendly lobster.</v>

601
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

602
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.790
<v Speaker 1>let's take the lobster for example.</v>

603
00:21:39.791 --> 00:21:40.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the lobsters,</v>

604
00:21:40.931 --> 00:21:43.840
<v Speaker 1>a sea floor dwelling preacher,</v>

605
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.580
<v Speaker 1>and the lobster has 20 shelters,</v>

606
00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.030
<v Speaker 1>but the lobster only inhabits two of the shelters.</v>

607
00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:57.720
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't enable the other lobsters to dwell or reside in the other 18</v>

608
00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:00.190
<v Speaker 1>shelters that it doesn't even use.</v>

609
00:22:01.690 --> 00:22:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Just as an example.</v>

610
00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

611
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

612
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.790
<v Speaker 1>we could,</v>

613
00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:13.990
<v Speaker 1>we could think about this.</v>

614
00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.220
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I've found very interesting about looking at archetipal</v>

615
00:22:18.221 --> 00:22:23.200
<v Speaker 1>representations of experiential reality is that there are always balanced.</v>

616
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:27.870
<v Speaker 1>And so the fundamental architectural representation of the hierarchy is the wise</v>

617
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.880
<v Speaker 1>king and the tyrant and every hierarchy can be reasonably represented with</v>

618
00:22:33.431 --> 00:22:36.190
<v Speaker 1>narratives involving the wise king and the tyrant.</v>

619
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:41.520
<v Speaker 1>So the wise king is the part of the hierarchy that sustains itself and expands</v>

620
00:22:42.821 --> 00:22:44.080
<v Speaker 1>and includes more people,</v>

621
00:22:44.081 --> 00:22:44.261
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

622
00:22:44.261 --> 00:22:45.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's a functioning polity.</v>

623
00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:51.180
<v Speaker 1>And the tyrant is the fact that people operating within that hierarchy can play</v>

624
00:22:51.371 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 1>zero sum games,</v>

625
00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.890
<v Speaker 1>can be willfully blind,</v>

626
00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.150
<v Speaker 1>can be malevolent,</v>

627
00:22:55.330 --> 00:22:56.560
<v Speaker 1>can play politics,</v>

628
00:22:56.561 --> 00:22:57.940
<v Speaker 1>can cease to be productive,</v>

629
00:22:57.941 --> 00:23:00.670
<v Speaker 1>can manipulate the system for their own devices and all of that.</v>

630
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.690
<v Speaker 1>And it's obviously the case that every human institution,</v>

631
00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:09.691
<v Speaker 1>especially as they scale falls prey to the [inaudible] part of the archetype.</v>

632
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:12.490
<v Speaker 1>That's why big things fall apart.</v>

633
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.110
<v Speaker 1>And so when you say,</v>

634
00:23:14.111 --> 00:23:16.480
<v Speaker 1>well to what degree is a hierarchy,</v>

635
00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:21.670
<v Speaker 1>to what degree does a hierarchy emerge because of tyrannical factors?</v>

636
00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:22.271
<v Speaker 1>The answer is,</v>

637
00:23:22.271 --> 00:23:23.650
<v Speaker 1>well it depends on the hierarchy,</v>

638
00:23:23.950 --> 00:23:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but generally a nontrivial amount that scales with size.</v>

639
00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:29.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

640
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:30.423
<v Speaker 1>But that,</v>

641
00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.380
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

642
00:23:32.410 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't to say that something is partially corrupt is a lot different than</v>

643
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:38.590
<v Speaker 1>saying that it's totally corrupt.</v>

644
00:23:38.591 --> 00:23:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

645
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:43.720
<v Speaker 1>There's this great story for those of you that don't know it in the brothers</v>

646
00:23:43.721 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Karamazov and the</v>

647
00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:47.330
<v Speaker 3>atheist Ivan,</v>

648
00:23:47.331 --> 00:23:50.360
<v Speaker 3>who's the most compelling character,</v>

649
00:23:50.361 --> 00:23:54.650
<v Speaker 3>I would say most charismatic character in the book is torturing his younger</v>

650
00:23:54.651 --> 00:23:55.011
<v Speaker 3>brother,</v>

651
00:23:55.011 --> 00:23:55.611
<v Speaker 3>Lee Osha,</v>

652
00:23:55.611 --> 00:24:00.611
<v Speaker 3>who's a monastic novitiates about religion and Dogma and God.</v>

653
00:24:00.981 --> 00:24:04.280
<v Speaker 3>And he's trying to convince Ellie Osha that if there is a god,</v>

654
00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.780
<v Speaker 3>he's so cruel that he's reprehensible in his fundamental element.</v>

655
00:24:09.350 --> 00:24:09.921
<v Speaker 3>And anyways,</v>

656
00:24:09.921 --> 00:24:14.510
<v Speaker 3>he tells this story about the Catholic Church and it's called the grand</v>

657
00:24:14.511 --> 00:24:15.051
<v Speaker 3>inquisitor.</v>

658
00:24:15.051 --> 00:24:15.561
<v Speaker 3>It's a very,</v>

659
00:24:15.561 --> 00:24:16.490
<v Speaker 3>very famous story.</v>

660
00:24:16.491 --> 00:24:17.360
<v Speaker 3>And in this story,</v>

661
00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 3>Christ come back,</v>

662
00:24:18.381 --> 00:24:22.010
<v Speaker 3>comes back to Earth to Seville in Spain at the height of the Spanish</v>

663
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:22.641
<v Speaker 3>inquisition.</v>

664
00:24:22.641 --> 00:24:23.474
<v Speaker 3>And he's,</v>

665
00:24:23.690 --> 00:24:27.380
<v Speaker 3>he reappears and he's doing miraculous things and you know,</v>

666
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.420
<v Speaker 3>dividing up the loaves and feeding the poor and healing the sick and being</v>

667
00:24:32.421 --> 00:24:33.710
<v Speaker 3>miraculous and wonderful.</v>

668
00:24:33.711 --> 00:24:38.090
<v Speaker 3>And the grand inquisitor who runs the Spanish inquisition promptly has him</v>

669
00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:39.500
<v Speaker 3>arrested and throws him in prison.</v>

670
00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.600
<v Speaker 3>And then he,</v>

671
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:40.810
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

672
00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:41.050
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

673
00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:41.590
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>

674
00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:41.890
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

675
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.960
<v Speaker 3>he decides he's going to be executed and he comes to visit them at night and he</v>

676
00:24:44.961 --> 00:24:45.231
<v Speaker 3>says,</v>

677
00:24:45.231 --> 00:24:45.531
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

678
00:24:45.531 --> 00:24:46.364
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

679
00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.210
<v Speaker 3>you were here 1500 years ago and you're,</v>

680
00:24:50.270 --> 00:24:53.600
<v Speaker 3>you were perfect and you put a moral burden on human beings that was way too</v>

681
00:24:53.601 --> 00:24:54.740
<v Speaker 3>great for anyone to carry.</v>

682
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:59.360
<v Speaker 3>And it's taken us 1500 bloody years to cobble together something out of your</v>

683
00:24:59.361 --> 00:25:02.960
<v Speaker 3>insanely positive example that normal human beings could live with.</v>

684
00:25:02.961 --> 00:25:07.160
<v Speaker 3>And we finally got it a little bit under control and damp and it down.</v>

685
00:25:07.161 --> 00:25:08.480
<v Speaker 3>And here you are back again,</v>

686
00:25:08.481 --> 00:25:11.480
<v Speaker 3>like setting up an impossible example for people.</v>

687
00:25:11.481 --> 00:25:12.530
<v Speaker 3>We just can't have that.</v>

688
00:25:12.531 --> 00:25:14.180
<v Speaker 3>We're going to do you in tomorrow.</v>

689
00:25:14.630 --> 00:25:15.200
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

690
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:15.530
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

691
00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Christ listens and is not particularly upset by all appearances about what's</v>

692
00:25:20.031 --> 00:25:20.481
<v Speaker 3>happening.</v>

693
00:25:20.481 --> 00:25:23.960
<v Speaker 3>And then the inquisitor who's an old man gets up to leave.</v>

694
00:25:23.961 --> 00:25:24.711
<v Speaker 3>And when he leaves,</v>

695
00:25:24.711 --> 00:25:28.360
<v Speaker 3>Christ stands up and kisses him on the lips and the inquisitor,</v>

696
00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:30.530
<v Speaker 3>it turns white with shock and then leaves.</v>

697
00:25:30.531 --> 00:25:31.221
<v Speaker 3>And when he leaves,</v>

698
00:25:31.221 --> 00:25:32.390
<v Speaker 3>he leaves the door open.</v>

699
00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:35.240
<v Speaker 3>And that's the brilliant part of this story because,</v>

700
00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:38.450
<v Speaker 3>and that's what made Dostoyevsky such an amazing genius,</v>

701
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:38.961
<v Speaker 3>I would say,</v>

702
00:25:38.961 --> 00:25:42.770
<v Speaker 3>is even though he could write a critique of the Catholic church,</v>

703
00:25:42.771 --> 00:25:46.550
<v Speaker 3>let's say the Christian Church is powerful and is intelligent as the grand</v>

704
00:25:46.551 --> 00:25:47.330
<v Speaker 3>inquisitor.</v>

705
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:52.330
<v Speaker 3>He also noticed that the dogmatic structure of the church still left the still</v>

706
00:25:53.121 --> 00:25:55.250
<v Speaker 3>left the door open for the divine individual.</v>

707
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:58.940
<v Speaker 3>It's like you don't get a hierarchy without getting a tyranny along with it,</v>

708
00:25:58.941 --> 00:25:59.241
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

709
00:25:59.241 --> 00:25:59.840
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

710
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.830
<v Speaker 3>but there's a hell of a difference between the 30 or so countries in the world</v>

711
00:26:03.831 --> 00:26:06.530
<v Speaker 3>where anyone with any sense would want to live.</v>

712
00:26:06.531 --> 00:26:11.270
<v Speaker 3>And the other hundred and 50 where that are basically run by barbaric thugs.</v>

713
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:15.080
<v Speaker 3>And it's important to keep the distinction between those two things in dine.</v>

714
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.561
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

715
00:26:15.561 --> 00:26:15.801
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

716
00:26:15.801 --> 00:26:18.740
<v Speaker 3>we've got some things that we should put together and clean up.</v>

717
00:26:18.741 --> 00:26:19.580
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

718
00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:23.330
<v Speaker 3>people are discriminated against for unfair reasons and that's to everyone's</v>

719
00:26:23.331 --> 00:26:23.990
<v Speaker 3>detriment,</v>

720
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.860
<v Speaker 3>obviously,</v>

721
00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:27.170
<v Speaker 3>but it's a multivariate problem.</v>

722
00:26:27.171 --> 00:26:28.080
<v Speaker 3>And the,</v>

723
00:26:28.270 --> 00:26:28.770
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

724
00:26:28.770 --> 00:26:29.190
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

725
00:26:29.190 --> 00:26:29.550
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

726
00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:34.550
<v Speaker 3>the positioning of someone in a hierarchy of competence is in part due to there.</v>

727
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:40.130
<v Speaker 3>What would you say to the historical context within which that hierarchy has</v>

728
00:26:40.131 --> 00:26:40.640
<v Speaker 3>emerged?</v>

729
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 3>But to say it's all a consequence of that is part of what I regard as</v>

730
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:46.950
<v Speaker 1>the radical leftist war on the idea of competence itself.</v>

731
00:26:47.070 --> 00:26:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Because I actually think that's the fundamental narrative driving the real</v>

732
00:26:51.061 --> 00:26:55.350
<v Speaker 1>radical leftists is that they hate the idea of competence itself.</v>

733
00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:57.210
<v Speaker 1>It's deeper than Orwell's comment.</v>

734
00:26:57.211 --> 00:26:58.480
<v Speaker 1>George Orwell's comment in,</v>

735
00:26:58.980 --> 00:26:59.270
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

736
00:26:59.270 --> 00:26:59.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

737
00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.350
<v Speaker 1>road to Wigan pier where he said,</v>

738
00:27:01.351 --> 00:27:01.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

739
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:05.670
<v Speaker 1>the problem with middleclass pretty socialist is that they don't like the poor.</v>

740
00:27:05.671 --> 00:27:06.930
<v Speaker 1>They just hate the rich,</v>

741
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.890
<v Speaker 1>which is like dead on man vicious vicious diagnosis.</v>

742
00:27:10.891 --> 00:27:11.760
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than that.</v>

743
00:27:11.761 --> 00:27:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

744
00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 1>is that the radical leftists don't like the oppressed.</v>

745
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:18.060
<v Speaker 1>They just hate the competent.</v>

746
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.350
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that.</v>

747
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:20.071
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

748
00:27:20.071 --> 00:27:23.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it's unbelievably pathological and dangerous.</v>

749
00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:24.270
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

750
00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:29.270
<v Speaker 1>So the more nuanced conversations like these rather than binary yes or no sort</v>

751
00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:34.170
<v Speaker 1>of reductionist conversations around complex topics like a competence hierarchy</v>

752
00:27:34.171 --> 00:27:37.440
<v Speaker 1>that's surface to fruition in the media sphere.</v>

753
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:41.520
<v Speaker 1>I think over time we will get to a point where more and more people have the</v>

754
00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:44.070
<v Speaker 1>really complex and nuanced conversation about this.</v>

755
00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:44.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

756
00:27:44.610 --> 00:27:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

757
00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:47.370
<v Speaker 1>how about the genetic fitness landscape?</v>

758
00:27:47.371 --> 00:27:48.204
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

759
00:27:48.330 --> 00:27:53.330
<v Speaker 1>is it fair to say that there are a bunch of different competence hierarchies</v>

760
00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:58.230
<v Speaker 1>across this plain of fitness competent?</v>

761
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

762
00:27:58.531 --> 00:27:59.970
<v Speaker 1>there are and there are one or the,</v>

763
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:00.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:05.370
<v Speaker 1>one of the bubbles could be who's ranked highest in the government or one of</v>

765
00:28:05.371 --> 00:28:09.240
<v Speaker 1>them is who's ranked highest in space or whose rank Tyson genetic engineering</v>

766
00:28:09.241 --> 00:28:11.430
<v Speaker 1>and or whatever field in whatever.</v>

767
00:28:11.431 --> 00:28:14.430
<v Speaker 1>But that's why ideas like multiple intelligence are so attractive,</v>

768
00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.040
<v Speaker 1>even though the idea of multiple intelligence is wrong,</v>

769
00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:17.971
<v Speaker 1>it's clear.</v>

770
00:28:17.971 --> 00:28:18.151
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

771
00:28:18.151 --> 00:28:18.984
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly,</v>

772
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:21.720
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly wrong intelligence.</v>

773
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:24.900
<v Speaker 1>The factor analysis have been done and we've known this since like 1920.</v>

774
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:25.230
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

775
00:28:25.230 --> 00:28:27.150
<v Speaker 1>it's not disputable if you,</v>

776
00:28:27.151 --> 00:28:27.480
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

777
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:27.691
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

778
00:28:27.691 --> 00:28:29.010
<v Speaker 1>here's how you make an Iq test.</v>

779
00:28:29.011 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 1>It's really easy and everyone should know this because you need,</v>

780
00:28:31.831 --> 00:28:33.240
<v Speaker 1>you need to know how these things work.</v>

781
00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.360
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that you took a universal library of questions.</v>

782
00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Any sort of question that required abstraction to solve could be a general</v>

783
00:28:40.651 --> 00:28:41.730
<v Speaker 1>knowledge question.</v>

784
00:28:41.731 --> 00:28:42.960
<v Speaker 1>It could be a vocabulary question,</v>

785
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:44.250
<v Speaker 1>could be a mathematical question.</v>

786
00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

787
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:48.540
<v Speaker 1>It could be a question about anything as long as it requires abstraction to</v>

788
00:28:48.541 --> 00:28:48.871
<v Speaker 1>solve.</v>

789
00:28:48.871 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 1>So you have a universal library of those questions.</v>

790
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Then imagine you took a hundred questions at random from that universal library</v>

791
00:28:56.550 --> 00:29:00.900
<v Speaker 1>and you gave them to 500 people and then you just totaled their scores,</v>

792
00:29:00.901 --> 00:29:01.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

793
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.890
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

794
00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:02.460
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>

795
00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.540
<v Speaker 1>total total discourse.</v>

796
00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Then you rank ordered the scores from highest performer to lowest performer.</v>

797
00:29:08.010 --> 00:29:08.843
<v Speaker 1>That's Iq.</v>

798
00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:09.803
<v Speaker 1>That's all there is to it.</v>

799
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.033
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

800
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.760
<v Speaker 1>And then what you'd find is if you took another hundred questions from the same</v>

801
00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:15.241
<v Speaker 1>library,</v>

802
00:29:15.241 --> 00:29:17.880
<v Speaker 1>randomly selected and gave them to the same 500 people,</v>

803
00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.870
<v Speaker 1>and you'd have to rank orders right from the top to the bottom,</v>

804
00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:26.190
<v Speaker 1>the correlation between the two rank orders would be about 0.9 unbelievably</v>

805
00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:26.460
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

806
00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:27.840
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievably stable.</v>

807
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.570
<v Speaker 1>And now if you correct that for age,</v>

808
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.463
<v Speaker 1>you get Iq.</v>

809
00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:32.370
<v Speaker 1>That's all there is to it.</v>

810
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.563
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

811
00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:35.430
<v Speaker 1>And so well now,</v>

812
00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:37.770
<v Speaker 1>so cause intelligences,</v>

813
00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.300
<v Speaker 1>and that's a single factor.</v>

814
00:29:39.301 --> 00:29:40.590
<v Speaker 1>If you do a factor analysis,</v>

815
00:29:40.591 --> 00:29:44.920
<v Speaker 1>which is a statistical technique that tells you how many different attributes</v>

816
00:29:44.921 --> 00:29:47.710
<v Speaker 1>that that rank ordering possesses,</v>

817
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you get one factor.</v>

818
00:29:49.390 --> 00:29:51.940
<v Speaker 1>So it's one that's that not multiple.</v>

819
00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Now there are multiple talents and there are multiple temperaments and that's</v>

820
00:29:57.611 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 1>where the big five model comes in.</v>

821
00:29:59.081 --> 00:29:59.741
<v Speaker 1>So people,</v>

822
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:03.550
<v Speaker 1>different extroversion and extroverts are more likely to be good at sales jobs.</v>

823
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 1>People differ in negative emotionality despite what the California Labor board</v>

824
00:30:08.170 --> 00:30:09.220
<v Speaker 1>ruled yesterday.</v>

825
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

826
00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:13.150
<v Speaker 1>people differ in sensitivity to negative emotion.</v>

827
00:30:13.151 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 1>Women are more sensitive on average to negative emotion than men.</v>

828
00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.590
<v Speaker 1>And the effect size of that is something like if you took a random woman and a</v>

829
00:30:20.591 --> 00:30:25.090
<v Speaker 1>random man out of the population and you had to lay a bet on who had higher</v>

830
00:30:25.091 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>levels of anxiety and emotional pain and you bet that it was the woman you'd be</v>

831
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:30.430
<v Speaker 1>right 60% of the time.</v>

832
00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's an interesting stat because men and women are more the same in</v>

833
00:30:34.641 --> 00:30:35.474
<v Speaker 1>emotional,</v>

834
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:38.560
<v Speaker 1>in sensitivity to negative emotion then different.</v>

835
00:30:39.010 --> 00:30:39.671
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

836
00:30:39.671 --> 00:30:40.210
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

837
00:30:40.210 --> 00:30:42.760
<v Speaker 1>there's an offset at the mean.</v>

838
00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.070
<v Speaker 1>And what that also means is that if you took the top 100 people,</v>

839
00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:52.180
<v Speaker 1>top one in a hundred people who are the most sensitive to negative emotion,</v>

840
00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:53.350
<v Speaker 1>they'd almost all be women.</v>

841
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Now you see the re,</v>

842
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.510
<v Speaker 1>you see the inverse of that in some sense with regards to criminality.</v>

843
00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.930
<v Speaker 1>So males are more aggressive than females.</v>

844
00:31:02.410 --> 00:31:03.880
<v Speaker 1>And it's about the same difference.</v>

845
00:31:03.881 --> 00:31:06.640
<v Speaker 1>If you take a random woman on a random man out of the population,</v>

846
00:31:06.641 --> 00:31:08.260
<v Speaker 1>you had to bet on who was the most aggressive.</v>

847
00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:09.190
<v Speaker 1>If you bet it was the man,</v>

848
00:31:09.191 --> 00:31:10.780
<v Speaker 1>you'd be right 60% of the time,</v>

849
00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:12.430
<v Speaker 1>which isn't that much of the time,</v>

850
00:31:12.431 --> 00:31:12.651
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

851
00:31:12.651 --> 00:31:13.000
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

852
00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.000
<v Speaker 1>it's deviation from 50 50 but it's not 90 10 it's just 60 40 but if you take the</v>

853
00:31:19.331 --> 00:31:22.840
<v Speaker 1>one in a hundred persons who's most aggressive,</v>

854
00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's the person you throw in prison,</v>

855
00:31:24.911 --> 00:31:25.630
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

856
00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:26.463
<v Speaker 1>they're all men.</v>

857
00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Nine out of 10 of them are men.</v>

858
00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:28.930
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things,</v>

859
00:31:28.931 --> 00:31:29.291
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

860
00:31:29.291 --> 00:31:32.140
<v Speaker 1>this goes to the complexity argument that you were talking about earlier,</v>

861
00:31:32.141 --> 00:31:34.040
<v Speaker 1>that it's hard for people to have a multivariate,</v>

862
00:31:34.510 --> 00:31:34.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

863
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>discussion because we like to collapse things into single causes,</v>

864
00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's also hard for people to understand the statistical reality of</v>

865
00:31:41.471 --> 00:31:45.820
<v Speaker 1>distribution because you can have two distributions that almost entirely overlap</v>

866
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.140
<v Speaker 1>and have walloping differences at the tails and the tails are where all the</v>

867
00:31:50.141 --> 00:31:50.741
<v Speaker 1>action is.</v>

868
00:31:50.741 --> 00:31:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Like who cares how aggressive you are as long as you don't shoot or stab</v>

869
00:31:54.701 --> 00:31:55.330
<v Speaker 1>someone,</v>

870
00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.440
<v Speaker 1>you get to be aggressive.</v>

871
00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.040
<v Speaker 1>But if you're so aggressive that,</v>

872
00:31:58.041 --> 00:31:59.350
<v Speaker 1>or you shoot or stab someone,</v>

873
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:02.620
<v Speaker 1>then you end up in prison and you're the person that we're concerned with.</v>

874
00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.750
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that's 1% of the population.</v>

875
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:05.081
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

876
00:32:05.081 --> 00:32:05.231
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

877
00:32:05.231 --> 00:32:06.064
<v Speaker 1>well they're all men.</v>

878
00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:11.580
<v Speaker 1>And you see this happens in less dramatic form too when you look at phenomena</v>

879
00:32:12.941 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 1>like a career selection.</v>

880
00:32:15.460 --> 00:32:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So it was just a data set released the other day.</v>

881
00:32:17.950 --> 00:32:21.850
<v Speaker 1>And this is the first time I'd seen this showing quite clearly that as this is a</v>

882
00:32:21.851 --> 00:32:26.851
<v Speaker 1>w this is a remarkable finding and it builds on some earlier research which the</v>

883
00:32:28.061 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 1>California Labor board also decided with pseudoscience,</v>

884
00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:35.110
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely 100% not pseudoscience.</v>

885
00:32:35.410 --> 00:32:36.460
<v Speaker 1>That is so wrong.</v>

886
00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:41.670
<v Speaker 1>No serious scientists debate the data that I'm describing that nobody has</v>

887
00:32:41.841 --> 00:32:44.000
<v Speaker 1>debated it since like 1990.</v>

888
00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:44.991
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

889
00:32:44.991 --> 00:32:46.550
<v Speaker 1>it's very well settled science.</v>

890
00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:47.883
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

891
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:52.580
<v Speaker 1>if you look out career choices between men and women,</v>

892
00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.630
<v Speaker 1>what you find is that they're driven in large part by temperamental differences.</v>

893
00:32:56.631 --> 00:32:57.980
<v Speaker 1>So that would be in the big five,</v>

894
00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:58.641
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

895
00:32:58.641 --> 00:32:59.241
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

896
00:32:59.241 --> 00:32:59.871
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

897
00:32:59.871 --> 00:33:04.280
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and openness and also by interest because the biggest</v>

898
00:33:04.281 --> 00:33:07.310
<v Speaker 1>difference between men and women that's been measured psychometrically forget</v>

899
00:33:07.311 --> 00:33:08.390
<v Speaker 1>about the physical differences.</v>

900
00:33:08.391 --> 00:33:12.350
<v Speaker 1>But the psychological differences is difference in interest and it's actually</v>

901
00:33:12.351 --> 00:33:13.184
<v Speaker 1>pretty big.</v>

902
00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:18.310
<v Speaker 1>And so men on average are more interested in things and women on average are</v>

903
00:33:18.681 --> 00:33:19.850
<v Speaker 1>more interested in people.</v>

904
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:21.830
<v Speaker 1>And it's a one standard deviation difference,</v>

905
00:33:21.831 --> 00:33:24.980
<v Speaker 1>which is a big difference by by the standards of these sorts of differences.</v>

906
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's enough to drive the f drive.</v>

907
00:33:28.610 --> 00:33:30.260
<v Speaker 1>A couple of phenomena phenomena.</v>

908
00:33:30.261 --> 00:33:31.094
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

909
00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:34.610
<v Speaker 1>most nurses are women phenomena to most engineers are men.</v>

910
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Why has nothing to do or very little to do,</v>

911
00:33:37.251 --> 00:33:37.910
<v Speaker 1>if any,</v>

912
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.520
<v Speaker 1>with differences in mathematical reasoning ability.</v>

913
00:33:40.970 --> 00:33:42.650
<v Speaker 1>And I mean that's being tracked too.</v>

914
00:33:42.651 --> 00:33:44.330
<v Speaker 1>So if you take junior high kids,</v>

915
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:44.961
<v Speaker 1>men and women,</v>

916
00:33:44.961 --> 00:33:45.794
<v Speaker 1>girls and boys,</v>

917
00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.090
<v Speaker 1>and you take only those who are off the charts in terms of their mathematical</v>

918
00:33:50.091 --> 00:33:50.924
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>

919
00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:52.730
<v Speaker 1>the gender difference isn't that great.</v>

920
00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:54.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a tiny edge for for boys,</v>

921
00:33:54.381 --> 00:33:55.011
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>

922
00:33:55.011 --> 00:33:57.290
<v Speaker 1>And it's even disputable whether that edge exists.</v>

923
00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.080
<v Speaker 1>So let's assume it doesn't for the sake of argument,</v>

924
00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.960
<v Speaker 1>if you track those kids across time,</v>

925
00:34:02.961 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 1>what you find is a disproportionate number of the men go into the stem fields</v>

926
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:07.490
<v Speaker 1>and hardly any of the women.</v>

927
00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:09.320
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is they're good at it,</v>

928
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:10.340
<v Speaker 1>but they're not interested in it.</v>

929
00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:12.050
<v Speaker 1>So [inaudible] then you might think,</v>

930
00:34:12.051 --> 00:34:13.630
<v Speaker 1>well that's socio-cultural white.</v>

931
00:34:13.650 --> 00:34:14.660
<v Speaker 1>We could change that.</v>

932
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:15.230
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

933
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.800
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

934
00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:16.460
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

935
00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:17.870
<v Speaker 1>Research has already been done.</v>

936
00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

937
00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:19.873
<v Speaker 1>what a,</v>

938
00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.630
<v Speaker 1>so imagine you could rank order countries by how gender neutral there are</v>

939
00:34:23.631 --> 00:34:25.460
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomic policies were.</v>

940
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And then you put the Scandinavian countries at the top for obvious reasons</v>

941
00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.220
<v Speaker 1>because they'd been pushing that for like three decades,</v>

942
00:34:31.221 --> 00:34:32.054
<v Speaker 1>four decades,</v>

943
00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.470
<v Speaker 1>and have made a lot of progress with it.</v>

944
00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

945
00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:38.480
<v Speaker 1>the biggest differences in temperament and interest in the world between men and</v>

946
00:34:38.481 --> 00:34:40.040
<v Speaker 1>women are in the Scandinavian countries.</v>

947
00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.570
<v Speaker 1>And the data now have revealed that there's a correlation between how gender</v>

948
00:34:44.571 --> 00:34:47.660
<v Speaker 1>neutral the country is and how big the differences are between the men and</v>

949
00:34:47.661 --> 00:34:48.080
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

950
00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:49.550
<v Speaker 1>And the difference is positive,</v>

951
00:34:49.610 --> 00:34:50.443
<v Speaker 1>not negative.</v>

952
00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:51.651
<v Speaker 1>And then you think,</v>

953
00:34:51.651 --> 00:34:51.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

954
00:34:51.801 --> 00:34:53.750
<v Speaker 1>is that reliable science or,</v>

955
00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:58.770
<v Speaker 1>or are the right wing conservatives driving this scientific agenda?</v>

956
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.910
<v Speaker 1>And answer to that is there are no right wing conservatives in psychology.</v>

957
00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:03.373
<v Speaker 1>There are none.</v>

958
00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:04.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious,</v>

959
00:35:04.911 --> 00:35:05.744
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

960
00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm dead serious about that.</v>

961
00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.473
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

962
00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:10.010
<v Speaker 1>so here's why this,</v>

963
00:35:10.011 --> 00:35:11.780
<v Speaker 1>here's why this research is reliable.</v>

964
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.900
<v Speaker 1>It's because the research is reliable because the people who generated the</v>

965
00:35:14.901 --> 00:35:15.980
<v Speaker 1>findings hated them.</v>

966
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.540
<v Speaker 1>They hated the findings.</v>

967
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:20.900
<v Speaker 1>They were completely biased in the other direction because everyone,</v>

968
00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:22.190
<v Speaker 1>everyone was hoping.</v>

969
00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who's a social scientist was hoping that as you flattened out the</v>

970
00:35:26.481 --> 00:35:29.270
<v Speaker 1>gender differences in the sociological landscape,</v>

971
00:35:29.570 --> 00:35:32.390
<v Speaker 1>you would decrease the personality differences,</v>

972
00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.470
<v Speaker 1>individual differences.</v>

973
00:35:33.471 --> 00:35:34.281
<v Speaker 1>And that's not what happened.</v>

974
00:35:34.281 --> 00:35:35.031
<v Speaker 1>You maximize them.</v>

975
00:35:35.031 --> 00:35:36.080
<v Speaker 1>Instead it's like,</v>

976
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:36.943
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

977
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.570
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't what we expected.</v>

978
00:35:38.571 --> 00:35:38.930
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

979
00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:39.763
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

980
00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.760
<v Speaker 1>people just didn't run to the publisher and publish these data sets.</v>

981
00:35:43.930 --> 00:35:46.560
<v Speaker 1>They were shocked by them and so they replicated them.</v>

982
00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:49.740
<v Speaker 1>And these have been replicated across samples of tens of thousands of people</v>

983
00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:49.881
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

984
00:35:49.881 --> 00:35:50.080
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

985
00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:51.510
<v Speaker 1>and dozens of countries.</v>

986
00:35:51.830 --> 00:35:53.330
<v Speaker 1>It's extraordinarily reliable.</v>

987
00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:53.960
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

988
00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.100
<v Speaker 1>as far as I'm concerned,</v>

989
00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:57.810
<v Speaker 1>apart from the hard biological end of this,</v>

990
00:35:57.811 --> 00:36:01.540
<v Speaker 1>of psychology where there's some unbelievably solid work done.</v>

991
00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:06.720
<v Speaker 1>It's the most solid social science that exists as far as I can tell the</v>

992
00:36:07.151 --> 00:36:08.050
<v Speaker 1>psychometric data.</v>

993
00:36:08.570 --> 00:36:10.160
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I think that is when,</v>

994
00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:12.090
<v Speaker 1>when I was starting my career,</v>

995
00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 1>I was looking for the most solid data because one of the things I wanted to do</v>

996
00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:22.650
<v Speaker 1>learn how to predict how peoples lives transformed and changed across time and,</v>

997
00:36:23.910 --> 00:36:27.060
<v Speaker 1>and what sort of Ma level of achievement they manage.</v>

998
00:36:27.061 --> 00:36:29.700
<v Speaker 1>So I was looking for the most reliable and valid measures.</v>

999
00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:32.980
<v Speaker 1>And it's clearly the psychometric measures are the most reliable and valid</v>

1000
00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:34.293
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

1001
00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.510
<v Speaker 1>No one disputes that.</v>

1002
00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:37.013
<v Speaker 1>So except like,</v>

1003
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:37.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1004
00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:39.740
<v Speaker 1>people in Women's studies and that just doesn't count.</v>

1005
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:41.440
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1006
00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.350
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1007
00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:43.760
<v Speaker 1>they don't have a methodology.</v>

1008
00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.153
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1009
00:36:45.550 --> 00:36:48.070
<v Speaker 1>so the fact that there's a dispute just doesn't matter.</v>

1010
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:49.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1011
00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:50.053
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

1012
00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:58.090
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] they have hypotheses,</v>

1013
00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:01.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1014
00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:02.540
<v Speaker 1>And then that's fine.</v>

1015
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:04.490
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with generating hypotheses.</v>

1016
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:05.810
<v Speaker 1>Don't get me wrong,</v>

1017
00:37:06.110 --> 00:37:07.340
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing wrong with theory,</v>

1018
00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:11.200
<v Speaker 1>but when you start to confuse theory with fact,</v>

1019
00:37:11.201 --> 00:37:11.890
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1020
00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:13.090
<v Speaker 1>then there's real trouble,</v>

1021
00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:14.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1022
00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:15.880
<v Speaker 1>your theory has to be constructed,</v>

1023
00:37:15.881 --> 00:37:19.260
<v Speaker 1>at least in part so that you can make a prediction of some sort so that you can</v>

1024
00:37:19.261 --> 00:37:22.490
<v Speaker 1>measure what your theory says that you can measure and so that you can predict</v>

1025
00:37:22.491 --> 00:37:23.450
<v Speaker 1>something with it.</v>

1026
00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.670
<v Speaker 1>And then to see whether or not your theory holds up.</v>

1027
00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's just hypothesis and that's fine,</v>

1028
00:37:28.241 --> 00:37:31.720
<v Speaker 1>but you don't get to impose it on everyone else because you get to state by</v>

1029
00:37:31.721 --> 00:37:33.700
<v Speaker 1>theater that your hypothesis is correct.</v>

1030
00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:35.183
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

1031
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:37.970
<v Speaker 1>it's reprehensible to do that.</v>

1032
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.863
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1033
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.310
<v Speaker 1>and that's being done an awful lot,</v>

1034
00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:41.443
<v Speaker 1>an awful lot.</v>

1035
00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:46.860
<v Speaker 1>So I always found it interesting to think about why there weren't any groups of</v>

1036
00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:52.890
<v Speaker 1>men that were trying to increase the amount of men that were in nursing or</v>

1037
00:37:54.170 --> 00:37:58.480
<v Speaker 1>dental hygienists or education or an education social work.</v>

1038
00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I always found that interesting.</v>

1039
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.530
<v Speaker 1>I always,</v>

1040
00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.080
<v Speaker 1>and then I there lower pain disciplines.</v>

1041
00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.253
<v Speaker 1>MMM.</v>

1042
00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.090
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1043
00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:09.850
<v Speaker 1>and then I recently started thinking about this in terms of sports with the NFL</v>

1044
00:38:09.851 --> 00:38:12.200
<v Speaker 1>and NBA and I was like,</v>

1045
00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.153
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>

1046
00:38:14.100 --> 00:38:19.100
<v Speaker 1>there are just less Asian people and Latino people and white people.</v>

1047
00:38:19.821 --> 00:38:20.300
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

1048
00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:25.120
<v Speaker 1>there's more black people that artist better athletes and are we going to</v>

1049
00:38:25.121 --> 00:38:25.954
<v Speaker 1>decrease?</v>

1050
00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1051
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Standards for people have different from eight that are Asian or Latino t to get</v>

1052
00:38:33.621 --> 00:38:35.280
<v Speaker 1>more primitive professional things.</v>

1053
00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.070
<v Speaker 1>He is funny</v>

1054
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:36.300
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1055
00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:37.060
<v Speaker 3>that the,</v>

1056
00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.230
<v Speaker 3>the discussion about,</v>

1057
00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:38.860
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1058
00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:41.320
<v Speaker 3>gender differences in occupational position,</v>

1059
00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:42.243
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

1060
00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:44.020
<v Speaker 3>is unbelievably narrow.</v>

1061
00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:44.771
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1062
00:38:44.771 --> 00:38:48.070
<v Speaker 3>it tends to focus on the highest corporate positions.</v>

1063
00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:49.540
<v Speaker 3>That's not all of it,</v>

1064
00:38:49.570 --> 00:38:52.660
<v Speaker 3>but it tends to focus on the highest corporate positions are the highest paid</v>

1065
00:38:52.661 --> 00:38:53.051
<v Speaker 3>positions.</v>

1066
00:38:53.051 --> 00:38:55.190
<v Speaker 3>But certainly it's quite interesting if,</v>

1067
00:38:55.191 --> 00:38:55.750
<v Speaker 3>if you're,</v>

1068
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:59.890
<v Speaker 3>if you're into this sort of thing I suppose to go online and just look up the</v>

1069
00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 3>labor statistics from,</v>

1070
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.810
<v Speaker 3>from the American federal government because they,</v>

1071
00:39:03.811 --> 00:39:04.270
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1072
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:05.980
<v Speaker 3>they rank order occupations by gender,</v>

1073
00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:06.610
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1074
00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.420
<v Speaker 3>proportion and blood brick layers or that's the,</v>

1075
00:39:10.421 --> 00:39:12.640
<v Speaker 3>that's the occupation that's the most gender skewed.</v>

1076
00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:14.730
<v Speaker 3>There's like no female brick layers and,</v>

1077
00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.180
<v Speaker 3>but no one cares about that.</v>

1078
00:39:16.181 --> 00:39:17.260
<v Speaker 3>And it's kind of interesting.</v>

1079
00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:17.741
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1080
00:39:17.741 --> 00:39:17.981
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1081
00:39:17.981 --> 00:39:21.160
<v Speaker 3>but it is interesting because it's not like brick layers don't make a good</v>

1082
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:21.850
<v Speaker 3>living,</v>

1083
00:39:21.850 --> 00:39:22.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1084
00:39:22.061 --> 00:39:24.520
<v Speaker 3>like the skilled trades people make a damn good living.</v>

1085
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:26.770
<v Speaker 3>But heavy machinery operators,</v>

1086
00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:28.030
<v Speaker 3>very few women there too.</v>

1087
00:39:28.330 --> 00:39:28.840
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1088
00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.940
<v Speaker 3>but the percentage of work related deaths,</v>

1089
00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:33.130
<v Speaker 3>93% well that's a problem.</v>

1090
00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:34.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1091
00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:38.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean that there's a bunch of reasons why men make more money on average than</v>

1092
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:39.010
<v Speaker 3>women do.</v>

1093
00:39:39.010 --> 00:39:40.300
<v Speaker 3>And one of them is that they're,</v>

1094
00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:41.950
<v Speaker 3>they're more willing to work outside.</v>

1095
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 3>That's when they're more willing to move.</v>

1096
00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:44.730
<v Speaker 3>That's another there.</v>

1097
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.610
<v Speaker 3>They work longer hours and if you worked 13% more hours,</v>

1098
00:39:48.611 --> 00:39:50.620
<v Speaker 3>you make 40% more money on that.</v>

1099
00:39:50.621 --> 00:39:51.311
<v Speaker 3>That's the stat.</v>

1100
00:39:51.311 --> 00:39:51.580
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1101
00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:54.220
<v Speaker 3>so that the effect of overtime is nonlinear.</v>

1102
00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.930
<v Speaker 3>13% more hours.</v>

1103
00:39:55.931 --> 00:39:57.340
<v Speaker 3>40% more income.</v>

1104
00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1105
00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:58.710
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1106
00:39:58.710 --> 00:39:59.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1107
00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.261
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1108
00:39:59.261 --> 00:39:59.531
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1109
00:39:59.531 --> 00:40:00.364
<v Speaker 3>Well you can,</v>

1110
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:02.320
<v Speaker 3>I think that's a good example of how,</v>

1111
00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:02.951
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1112
00:40:02.951 --> 00:40:06.160
<v Speaker 3>let's say you have a bunch of employees and you're trying to differentiate them</v>

1113
00:40:06.161 --> 00:40:06.994
<v Speaker 3>for promotion,</v>

1114
00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:07.811
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1115
00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:11.350
<v Speaker 3>and let's say they're all operating within a relatively narrow band.</v>

1116
00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:12.791
<v Speaker 3>Perhaps they aren't,</v>

1117
00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:14.740
<v Speaker 3>but let's say for this example they are,</v>

1118
00:40:14.870 --> 00:40:15.281
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1119
00:40:15.281 --> 00:40:19.620
<v Speaker 3>well the person who puts out 10% more self,</v>

1120
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.800
<v Speaker 3>evidently so,</v>

1121
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:22.810
<v Speaker 3>well this guy's around like 10% more.</v>

1122
00:40:23.350 --> 00:40:24.011
<v Speaker 3>That would be,</v>

1123
00:40:24.011 --> 00:40:26.560
<v Speaker 3>what about an extra 45 minutes a day,</v>

1124
00:40:26.561 --> 00:40:27.370
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1125
00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:30.520
<v Speaker 3>He goes the extra mile while he's going to get the promotion.</v>

1126
00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:32.830
<v Speaker 3>And so you also get this,</v>

1127
00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.570
<v Speaker 3>like it also looks,</v>

1128
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:35.950
<v Speaker 3>and this is worth thinking about too,</v>

1129
00:40:35.951 --> 00:40:38.710
<v Speaker 3>and this is part of the predo distribution problem,</v>

1130
00:40:38.711 --> 00:40:41.890
<v Speaker 3>is that success is disproportionately rewarded.</v>

1131
00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:43.571
<v Speaker 3>It's not linear.</v>

1132
00:40:43.571 --> 00:40:45.760
<v Speaker 3>So as you start to succeed,</v>

1133
00:40:45.761 --> 00:40:46.330
<v Speaker 3>the probe,</v>

1134
00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:51.160
<v Speaker 3>each success nonlinearly increases the probability of the next success.</v>

1135
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:51.881
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1136
00:40:51.881 --> 00:40:53.260
<v Speaker 3>So the door's open.</v>

1137
00:40:53.350 --> 00:40:53.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1138
00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:53.840
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1139
00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.101
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1140
00:40:54.101 --> 00:40:54.210
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

1141
00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:54.490
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1142
00:40:54.490 --> 00:40:55.090
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>

1143
00:40:55.090 --> 00:40:56.050
<v Speaker 3>And not one door,</v>

1144
00:40:56.051 --> 00:40:57.430
<v Speaker 3>but they open exponentially.</v>

1145
00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:58.061
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1146
00:40:58.061 --> 00:40:58.601
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

1147
00:40:58.601 --> 00:40:59.230
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1148
00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.100
<v Speaker 3>and as you fail,</v>

1149
00:41:00.101 --> 00:41:01.390
<v Speaker 3>they close exponentially.</v>

1150
00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:02.590
<v Speaker 3>So you might think,</v>

1151
00:41:02.591 --> 00:41:03.424
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1152
00:41:03.910 --> 00:41:04.743
<v Speaker 3>failure,</v>

1153
00:41:04.930 --> 00:41:05.800
<v Speaker 3>success,</v>

1154
00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:07.533
<v Speaker 3>linear,</v>

1155
00:41:07.570 --> 00:41:11.530
<v Speaker 3>it's like no failure success,</v>

1156
00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.550
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1157
00:41:12.550 --> 00:41:13.840
<v Speaker 3>So once you start to fail,</v>

1158
00:41:13.900 --> 00:41:14.740
<v Speaker 3>good luck to you,</v>

1159
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:15.490
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1160
00:41:15.490 --> 00:41:18.550
<v Speaker 3>Because each failure increases the probability of the next failure in a</v>

1161
00:41:18.551 --> 00:41:20.140
<v Speaker 3>nonlinear mash fashion.</v>

1162
00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 3>And that really,</v>

1163
00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.330
<v Speaker 3>if you're on a downhill trend,</v>

1164
00:41:22.331 --> 00:41:22.750
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1165
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.850
<v Speaker 3>that's really vicious and it's hard to get out of it.</v>

1166
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:27.910
<v Speaker 3>You see that happen to big companies when they start to go into a death spiral,</v>

1167
00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:29.410
<v Speaker 3>they can't pull themselves out of it.</v>

1168
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.000
<v Speaker 3>But by the same token,</v>

1169
00:41:31.001 --> 00:41:32.110
<v Speaker 3>when you start to succeed,</v>

1170
00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>each success increases</v>

1171
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:35.210
<v Speaker 1>the probability of the next week.</v>

1172
00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:37.280
<v Speaker 1>You actually even see that with lobsters.</v>

1173
00:41:37.610 --> 00:41:38.930
<v Speaker 1>So back to the crustaceans.</v>

1174
00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:39.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1175
00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.490
<v Speaker 1>they'd so interesting that some of these things are so fundamental that they</v>

1176
00:41:43.491 --> 00:41:44.990
<v Speaker 1>appear so low in the file,</v>

1177
00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:45.830
<v Speaker 1>a genetic change.</v>

1178
00:41:45.831 --> 00:41:46.850
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

1179
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 1>if you Kelly up,</v>

1180
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:51.950
<v Speaker 1>you watch a lobster engaged in sequence,</v>

1181
00:41:51.951 --> 00:41:53.450
<v Speaker 1>sequential dominance dispute.</v>

1182
00:41:53.451 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So basically physical challenges,</v>

1183
00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:57.373
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1184
00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 1>his probability if he loses the problem,</v>

1185
00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.230
<v Speaker 1>if he loses the battle,</v>

1186
00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:08.210
<v Speaker 1>the probability that he'll lose the next battle is higher than you would expect</v>

1187
00:42:08.211 --> 00:42:10.340
<v Speaker 1>if you just derived a linear function.</v>

1188
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:14.420
<v Speaker 1>That was a consequence of the telly of his previous victories and losses.</v>

1189
00:42:14.750 --> 00:42:15.680
<v Speaker 1>So because he's lost,</v>

1190
00:42:15.681 --> 00:42:18.560
<v Speaker 1>he's more likely to lose harder the next time,</v>

1191
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.790
<v Speaker 1>but if he wins,</v>

1192
00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:21.740
<v Speaker 1>he's statistically more likely to win.</v>

1193
00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:22.910
<v Speaker 1>So and,</v>

1194
00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:27.050
<v Speaker 1>and that also drives well that's a fundamental issue to that drives the</v>

1195
00:42:27.051 --> 00:42:32.030
<v Speaker 1>disproportionate distribution of productive goods and material resources,</v>

1196
00:42:32.031 --> 00:42:33.110
<v Speaker 1>which is a very big problem.</v>

1197
00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:36.130
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing to have an intelligent discussion about in our Dev site.</v>

1198
00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:38.480
<v Speaker 1>Definitely we're going to get there in this conversation as well.</v>

1199
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:42.110
<v Speaker 1>So just before we wrap up the point about big five and gender,</v>

1200
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:47.140
<v Speaker 1>I have a thought about this and it involves a company that is very close to us</v>

1201
00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:48.290
<v Speaker 1>here in the bay area,</v>

1202
00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:49.124
<v Speaker 1>Google.</v>

1203
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.050
<v Speaker 1>And the question about</v>

1204
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:57.730
<v Speaker 1>Google is could it potentially be in the interest of a company to want to bring</v>

1205
00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:06.430
<v Speaker 1>diverse people from around the world in to increase the creativity of their</v>

1206
00:43:06.831 --> 00:43:07.664
<v Speaker 1>output?</v>

1207
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you define diverse,</v>

1208
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 1>but I would say you guys have already done that in silicon valley.</v>

1209
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:12.021
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1210
00:43:12.021 --> 00:43:12.854
<v Speaker 1>well how many people,</v>

1211
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.100
<v Speaker 1>how many people in Silicon Valley or from the Indian Institute of Technology?</v>

1212
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:17.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1213
00:43:17.210 --> 00:43:17.541
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1214
00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:18.374
<v Speaker 1>they're everywhere.</v>

1215
00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1216
00:43:19.161 --> 00:43:20.690
<v Speaker 1>and and no wonder while,</v>

1217
00:43:20.691 --> 00:43:21.170
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

1218
00:43:21.170 --> 00:43:22.280
<v Speaker 1>but that's cognitive,</v>

1219
00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 1>that's that's cognitive ability.</v>

1220
00:43:23.811 --> 00:43:28.811
<v Speaker 1>Like look is if there's someone that's birth in a different part of the world</v>

1221
00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:31.040
<v Speaker 1>that has a different upbringing,</v>

1222
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.840
<v Speaker 1>that could potentially bring something unique,</v>

1223
00:43:32.841 --> 00:43:33.591
<v Speaker 1>a unique person.</v>

1224
00:43:33.591 --> 00:43:35.090
<v Speaker 1>There's no evidence for that whatsoever.</v>

1225
00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:38.241
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

1226
00:43:38.241 --> 00:43:39.170
<v Speaker 1>there's no,</v>

1227
00:43:39.171 --> 00:43:40.370
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence for that.</v>

1228
00:43:40.371 --> 00:43:41.630
<v Speaker 1>That is not how you get,</v>

1229
00:43:41.810 --> 00:43:43.850
<v Speaker 1>that's not the right definition of diversity.</v>

1230
00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:48.530
<v Speaker 1>But could it also be potentially that we are not measuring and focusing on that</v>

1231
00:43:48.531 --> 00:43:49.940
<v Speaker 1>in order to find that data?</v>

1232
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:51.643
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

1233
00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:53.301
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1234
00:43:53.301 --> 00:43:53.841
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1235
00:43:53.841 --> 00:43:55.370
<v Speaker 1>It's not because look,</v>

1236
00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.130
<v Speaker 1>measuring success is not an easy thing.</v>

1237
00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 1>And you think it should be meritocracy no matter what period.</v>

1238
00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:03.381
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1239
00:44:03.381 --> 00:44:03.680
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

1240
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.070
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

1241
00:44:04.070 --> 00:44:05.510
<v Speaker 1>there's always a fly in the ointment</v>

1242
00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:07.940
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

1243
00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:08.560
<v Speaker 1>There is.</v>

1244
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.830
<v Speaker 1>There's so the other thing,</v>

1245
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a good book that I would recommend reading called the great leveler by</v>

1246
00:44:13.971 --> 00:44:14.781
<v Speaker 1>Walter Shydel.</v>

1247
00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:15.471
<v Speaker 1>It's a new book,</v>

1248
00:44:15.471 --> 00:44:16.370
<v Speaker 1>relatively new book,</v>

1249
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:19.730
<v Speaker 1>and he details out the,</v>

1250
00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.680
<v Speaker 1>he details out the erratic ability of inequality.</v>

1251
00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:30.200
<v Speaker 1>So part of the problem with this process that we just described where success</v>

1252
00:44:30.201 --> 00:44:31.830
<v Speaker 1>breeds success and failure breeds</v>

1253
00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:32.311
<v Speaker 3>failure,</v>

1254
00:44:32.311 --> 00:44:37.311
<v Speaker 3>is that the people who are succeeding get a disproportionate share of the</v>

1255
00:44:38.010 --> 00:44:39.300
<v Speaker 3>resource pie,</v>

1256
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:40.143
<v Speaker 3>let's say.</v>

1257
00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.183
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1258
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:42.240
<v Speaker 3>so you know,</v>

1259
00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.440
<v Speaker 3>everyone knows that about money,</v>

1260
00:44:43.441 --> 00:44:43.770
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1261
00:44:43.770 --> 00:44:46.380
<v Speaker 3>Because the 12 richest people in the world,</v>

1262
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:49.800
<v Speaker 3>85 richest people in the world have as much money as the bottom 2 billion,</v>

1263
00:44:50.190 --> 00:44:51.570
<v Speaker 3>which seems while,</v>

1264
00:44:51.571 --> 00:44:52.710
<v Speaker 3>let's say unfair,</v>

1265
00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:53.640
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>

1266
00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:54.990
<v Speaker 3>it's certainly unequal.</v>

1267
00:44:55.230 --> 00:45:00.230
<v Speaker 3>Now whether it's I believe his Lord and this statistic is the eight richest have</v>

1268
00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:03.060
<v Speaker 3>equal to the bottom 3.5 billion.</v>

1269
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:03.371
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1270
00:45:03.371 --> 00:45:06.030
<v Speaker 3>well I think it's probably worse than it was when I looked at this about three</v>

1271
00:45:06.031 --> 00:45:06.481
<v Speaker 3>years ago.</v>

1272
00:45:06.481 --> 00:45:06.691
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1273
00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:07.250
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't,</v>

1274
00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.081
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't matter cause you,</v>

1275
00:45:08.081 --> 00:45:08.400
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1276
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.061
<v Speaker 3>you get the point.</v>

1277
00:45:09.061 --> 00:45:11.190
<v Speaker 3>But it's not crazy.</v>

1278
00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.670
<v Speaker 3>But the thing is is that this is not something that only applies to money.</v>

1279
00:45:15.540 --> 00:45:17.850
<v Speaker 3>It applies to everything that's creatively produced.</v>

1280
00:45:18.690 --> 00:45:23.310
<v Speaker 3>So the same rule applies to number of records sold by recording artists.</v>

1281
00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:25.890
<v Speaker 3>The same rule applies to number of books sold by novelists.</v>

1282
00:45:25.900 --> 00:45:29.100
<v Speaker 3>The same rule applies to number of goals scored by Nhl hockey players.</v>

1283
00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.700
<v Speaker 3>The same rule applies to the population of cities and the massive stars and the</v>

1284
00:45:32.701 --> 00:45:33.640
<v Speaker 3>size of trees in the,</v>

1285
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.533
<v Speaker 3>in the jungle.</v>

1286
00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:39.920
<v Speaker 3>It's like the inequality problem is way more troublesome again then mere</v>

1287
00:45:40.891 --> 00:45:41.724
<v Speaker 3>capitalism,</v>

1288
00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:44.550
<v Speaker 3>it's a terrible problem and Shydel is work,</v>

1289
00:45:44.551 --> 00:45:45.211
<v Speaker 3>which is really,</v>

1290
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:45.931
<v Speaker 3>really interesting.</v>

1291
00:45:45.931 --> 00:45:50.931
<v Speaker 3>He's traced back inequality 10 15,000 years using,</v>

1292
00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:52.410
<v Speaker 3>you can do it for example,</v>

1293
00:45:52.411 --> 00:45:55.440
<v Speaker 3>let's say you find a Neolithic burial site and there's 200 people in it,</v>

1294
00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:59.520
<v Speaker 3>so these people would be buried with their possessions and obviously some of</v>

1295
00:45:59.521 --> 00:46:00.031
<v Speaker 3>them decay,</v>

1296
00:46:00.031 --> 00:46:01.080
<v Speaker 3>but some of them don't.</v>

1297
00:46:01.081 --> 00:46:03.330
<v Speaker 3>And like some of them are buried with gold.</v>

1298
00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Well hardly any of them.</v>

1299
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:08.910
<v Speaker 3>And the tiny proportion of people who are born bird with gold are burned with a</v>

1300
00:46:08.911 --> 00:46:09.930
<v Speaker 3>lot of gold.</v>

1301
00:46:10.350 --> 00:46:14.130
<v Speaker 3>So you can even drive a Gini Coefficient estimate,</v>

1302
00:46:14.131 --> 00:46:16.500
<v Speaker 3>which is an estimate of inequality from burial sites.</v>

1303
00:46:16.501 --> 00:46:18.810
<v Speaker 3>And it looks like as soon as you get a surplus,</v>

1304
00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:19.710
<v Speaker 3>you get inequality.</v>

1305
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:22.320
<v Speaker 3>And that's a rough thing because you might think,</v>

1306
00:46:22.650 --> 00:46:25.710
<v Speaker 3>well even in hunter gatherer societies where there's no surplus,</v>

1307
00:46:25.711 --> 00:46:28.140
<v Speaker 3>there's still inequality cause there's inequality of friendship,</v>

1308
00:46:28.141 --> 00:46:30.990
<v Speaker 3>there's inequality of health and there's inequality of sexual access.</v>

1309
00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:32.063
<v Speaker 3>And those things are,</v>

1310
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:33.060
<v Speaker 3>they are not trivial.</v>

1311
00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:35.370
<v Speaker 3>But when you're thinking about it purely economically,</v>

1312
00:46:35.371 --> 00:46:36.490
<v Speaker 3>you start to get an inequality.</v>

1313
00:46:36.510 --> 00:46:38.400
<v Speaker 3>As soon as you get a surplus you think,</v>

1314
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:39.840
<v Speaker 3>oh that's interesting.</v>

1315
00:46:39.841 --> 00:46:44.250
<v Speaker 3>So there's a natural rule which is surplus generates inequality.</v>

1316
00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:45.091
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>

1317
00:46:45.091 --> 00:46:46.560
<v Speaker 3>so how do you solve that?</v>

1318
00:46:46.710 --> 00:46:47.880
<v Speaker 3>And Shy Dell's book says,</v>

1319
00:46:47.881 --> 00:46:48.714
<v Speaker 3>well that's easy.</v>

1320
00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:50.970
<v Speaker 3>You just get rid of the surplus.</v>

1321
00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:52.801
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1322
00:46:52.801 --> 00:46:53.880
<v Speaker 3>And that's not good.</v>

1323
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.921
<v Speaker 3>So like he,</v>

1324
00:46:54.921 --> 00:46:58.140
<v Speaker 3>he found and so one of the things he did was statistical analysis.</v>

1325
00:46:58.140 --> 00:46:59.490
<v Speaker 3>Cause one of the things he might ask is,</v>

1326
00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:03.990
<v Speaker 3>well let's say you have your measures of inequality and then you can track them</v>

1327
00:47:03.991 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 3>around the world and you can track whether or not the inequality is generated by</v>

1328
00:47:08.101 --> 00:47:10.200
<v Speaker 3>a right wing government or a left wing government.</v>

1329
00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.341
<v Speaker 3>And then you might hope,</v>

1330
00:47:11.341 --> 00:47:13.740
<v Speaker 3>well the left wing governments would ameliorate inequality.</v>

1331
00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.180
<v Speaker 3>There's no evidence for that at all.</v>

1332
00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:18.210
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look like inequality is with it.</v>

1333
00:47:18.211 --> 00:47:22.530
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't look like the amelioration of inequality is within the purview of</v>

1334
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.850
<v Speaker 3>political organization.</v>

1335
00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.321
<v Speaker 3>And you should like,</v>

1336
00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:29.120
<v Speaker 3>you should not hear that with any degree of happiness whatsoever because the</v>

1337
00:47:29.130 --> 00:47:33.910
<v Speaker 3>social science on inequality is also clear as inequality levels increase,</v>

1338
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.860
<v Speaker 3>society's destabilize.</v>

1339
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:37.630
<v Speaker 3>And the best indicator of that,</v>

1340
00:47:37.631 --> 00:47:39.820
<v Speaker 3>I already mentioned that that was work that was done by</v>

1341
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.550
<v Speaker 3>Martin Daly and Margo Wilson at McMaster university in Canada.</v>

1342
00:47:45.640 --> 00:47:48.730
<v Speaker 3>They're really interested in what drove male homicide because most homicide is</v>

1343
00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:49.330
<v Speaker 3>male,</v>

1344
00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 3>male on male.</v>

1345
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:51.490
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly young males.</v>

1346
00:47:51.550 --> 00:47:54.700
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly within race and it's mostly status competition,</v>

1347
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:55.420
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1348
00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:55.960
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1349
00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:00.220
<v Speaker 3>and the status competitions get intense where inequality increases.</v>

1350
00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:02.110
<v Speaker 3>So where everyone's poor.</v>

1351
00:48:02.290 --> 00:48:06.610
<v Speaker 3>So if you rank order American states and Canadian provinces by inequality,</v>

1352
00:48:07.270 --> 00:48:09.490
<v Speaker 3>the poor provinces where everyone's poor,</v>

1353
00:48:09.491 --> 00:48:12.700
<v Speaker 3>there's no male aggression and the rich provinces and states where everyone's</v>

1354
00:48:12.701 --> 00:48:13.031
<v Speaker 3>rich,</v>

1355
00:48:13.031 --> 00:48:15.490
<v Speaker 3>there's no male male homicide,</v>

1356
00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:19.360
<v Speaker 3>but the states and provinces where inequality is high,</v>

1357
00:48:19.450 --> 00:48:23.320
<v Speaker 3>the male homicide rates starts to climb up and it's probably the most aggressive</v>

1358
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:28.150
<v Speaker 3>males who get most aggressive most rapidly when inequality increases.</v>

1359
00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:30.130
<v Speaker 3>So there's a psychological component,</v>

1360
00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:33.520
<v Speaker 3>but inequality drives male homicide 0.9 is the correlation,</v>

1361
00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:36.730
<v Speaker 3>which means that you actually don't need any other explanation for male</v>

1362
00:48:36.731 --> 00:48:37.151
<v Speaker 3>homicide.</v>

1363
00:48:37.151 --> 00:48:39.400
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you throw in alcohol just just as a,</v>

1364
00:48:39.401 --> 00:48:40.720
<v Speaker 3>as an extraneous variable.</v>

1365
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:44.230
<v Speaker 3>You don't need any other explanation for the male homicide rate than inequality.</v>

1366
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:45.910
<v Speaker 3>It's a staggering work.</v>

1367
00:48:45.911 --> 00:48:47.380
<v Speaker 3>It's absolutely staggering work.</v>

1368
00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:49.040
<v Speaker 3>And so the,</v>

1369
00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:54.310
<v Speaker 3>the thing is is that a meritocracy will drive inequality and then you have a</v>

1370
00:48:54.311 --> 00:48:57.850
<v Speaker 3>problem because people stack up at zero and they can't get out of zero.</v>

1371
00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's what happens as inequality increases.</v>

1372
00:49:00.491 --> 00:49:03.100
<v Speaker 3>People think about when you're playing monopoly,</v>

1373
00:49:03.130 --> 00:49:03.963
<v Speaker 3>you know the game.</v>

1374
00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:07.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's a perfect example of how inequality emerges.</v>

1375
00:49:07.390 --> 00:49:08.770
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's equal to begin with.</v>

1376
00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Everybody basically plays a random game because monopolies basically a random</v>

1377
00:49:13.121 --> 00:49:13.421
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

1378
00:49:13.421 --> 00:49:14.410
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's some skill in it,</v>

1379
00:49:14.411 --> 00:49:15.890
<v Speaker 3>but not much so.</v>

1380
00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:17.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's a random game.</v>

1381
00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.770
<v Speaker 3>So what happens when everyone starts equal and you play a random game?</v>

1382
00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:22.630
<v Speaker 3>One person ends up with everything.</v>

1383
00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.250
<v Speaker 3>Everyone else stacks up at zero.</v>

1384
00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Now shy Dell's book basically shows the only way out of that is various forms of</v>

1385
00:49:28.961 --> 00:49:29.560
<v Speaker 3>war,</v>

1386
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.610
<v Speaker 3>including revolution.</v>

1387
00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:31.990
<v Speaker 3>And epidemics.</v>

1388
00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:32.680
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1389
00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.390
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing he's been able to track that.</v>

1390
00:49:34.550 --> 00:49:34.780
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1391
00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 3>and what happens is when you level everyone and then inequality decreases,</v>

1392
00:49:39.010 --> 00:49:39.311
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

1393
00:49:39.311 --> 00:49:40.144
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1394
00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:41.373
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1395
00:49:43.270 --> 00:49:45.280
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't seem like a really great solution.</v>

1396
00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:48.520
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] and this seems to be even more and more pressing with the</v>

1397
00:49:48.521 --> 00:49:51.100
<v Speaker 3>proliferation of artificial intelligence,</v>

1398
00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:52.330
<v Speaker 3>robotics,</v>

1399
00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.400
<v Speaker 3>genetic engineering,</v>

1400
00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.330
<v Speaker 3>neuroprosthetics,</v>

1401
00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.380
<v Speaker 3>nanotechnology,</v>

1402
00:49:55.570 --> 00:49:59.920
<v Speaker 3>and the race between China and the United States and Russia colonizing Mars.</v>

1403
00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.240
<v Speaker 3>What is going,</v>

1404
00:50:01.241 --> 00:50:06.241
<v Speaker 3>how do we actually end up coming to a global consensus on what to do as eight</v>

1405
00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:10.290
<v Speaker 3>people equate and wealth to the bottom 12.</v>

1406
00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:15.070
<v Speaker 3>I don't see why we have to have an intelligent discussion about this because on</v>

1407
00:50:15.071 --> 00:50:15.790
<v Speaker 3>the one hand,</v>

1408
00:50:15.790 --> 00:50:20.790
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty obvious that modern economies are doing a damn good job of lifting</v>

1409
00:50:20.981 --> 00:50:22.810
<v Speaker 3>people rapidly out of abject poverty.</v>

1410
00:50:23.290 --> 00:50:23.740
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1411
00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.880
<v Speaker 3>But at the same time,</v>

1412
00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:26.500
<v Speaker 3>the inequality of,</v>

1413
00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:31.740
<v Speaker 3>of the economic inequality by some measures at least is increasing and that does</v>

1414
00:50:32.211 --> 00:50:33.770
<v Speaker 3>have this destabilizing effect.</v>

1415
00:50:34.310 --> 00:50:35.370
<v Speaker 3>And so then the question is what,</v>

1416
00:50:35.371 --> 00:50:36.290
<v Speaker 3>what do you do about it?</v>

1417
00:50:36.590 --> 00:50:36.861
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1418
00:50:36.861 --> 00:50:40.280
<v Speaker 3>it's really hard because in a meritocracy,</v>

1419
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 3>part of that's driven by,</v>

1420
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:43.783
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1421
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:45.800
<v Speaker 3>segregation by intelligence.</v>

1422
00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:52.240
<v Speaker 3>And then that's likely exaggerated by the provision of computational power</v>

1423
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:56.600
<v Speaker 3>because it really smart person with a computer is way smarter than a really</v>

1424
00:50:56.601 --> 00:51:00.830
<v Speaker 3>smart person without a computer and is and is way smarter than a person who</v>

1425
00:51:00.831 --> 00:51:03.290
<v Speaker 3>isn't so smart either with or without a computer.</v>

1426
00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:03.711
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1427
00:51:03.711 --> 00:51:06.350
<v Speaker 3>So the computational technology looks like it's a multiplier.</v>

1428
00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm sure many of you already know now because there's a huge difference</v>

1429
00:51:10.131 --> 00:51:13.730
<v Speaker 3>between someone who can really use a computer and someone who's barely computer</v>

1430
00:51:13.731 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 3>literate and lots of way more people are barely computer literate literate than</v>

1431
00:51:18.081 --> 00:51:18.650
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1432
00:51:18.650 --> 00:51:19.790
<v Speaker 3>So here's a good stat.</v>

1433
00:51:19.830 --> 00:51:21.560
<v Speaker 3>This is like,</v>

1434
00:51:21.561 --> 00:51:22.730
<v Speaker 3>I'm really familiar,</v>

1435
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:25.910
<v Speaker 3>I've really familiarized myself with the ICU literature and had said dismal,</v>

1436
00:51:25.911 --> 00:51:26.780
<v Speaker 3>horrible literature.</v>

1437
00:51:26.810 --> 00:51:27.350
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

1438
00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:30.680
<v Speaker 3>but you really need to know it because it's a solid literature unfortunately.</v>

1439
00:51:30.681 --> 00:51:31.560
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

1440
00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
<v Speaker 3>one of the most terrifying statistics I ever came across was one detailing out</v>

1441
00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:41.450
<v Speaker 3>the rationale of the United States Armed Forces for not allowing the induct.</v>

1442
00:51:41.660 --> 00:51:44.840
<v Speaker 3>You can't induct anyone into the armed forces in the US if they have an Iq of</v>

1443
00:51:44.841 --> 00:51:45.680
<v Speaker 3>less than 83.</v>

1444
00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:46.971
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1445
00:51:46.971 --> 00:51:49.880
<v Speaker 3>So let's just take that apart for a minute because it's a horrifying thing.</v>

1446
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:54.470
<v Speaker 3>So the US armed forces has been in the forefront of intelligence research since</v>

1447
00:51:54.590 --> 00:51:59.510
<v Speaker 3>World War One because they were on board early with the idea that especially</v>

1448
00:51:59.511 --> 00:52:02.540
<v Speaker 3>during war time when you're ramping up quickly that you need to sort people</v>

1449
00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:07.400
<v Speaker 3>effectively and essentially without prejudice so that you can build up the</v>

1450
00:52:07.401 --> 00:52:09.380
<v Speaker 3>officer corps so you don't lose the damn war.</v>

1451
00:52:09.381 --> 00:52:09.651
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1452
00:52:09.651 --> 00:52:12.440
<v Speaker 3>So there's real motivation to get it right,</v>

1453
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.711
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1454
00:52:12.711 --> 00:52:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's life and death issue.</v>

1455
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:15.230
<v Speaker 3>So they used Iq,</v>

1456
00:52:15.590 --> 00:52:17.750
<v Speaker 3>they did a lot of the early psychometric work on Iq.</v>

1457
00:52:18.140 --> 00:52:18.411
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1458
00:52:18.411 --> 00:52:19.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's the first thing.</v>

1459
00:52:19.311 --> 00:52:19.490
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

1460
00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:21.470
<v Speaker 3>they're motivated to find an accurate predictor.</v>

1461
00:52:21.471 --> 00:52:22.790
<v Speaker 3>So they settled on Iq.</v>

1462
00:52:23.270 --> 00:52:28.190
<v Speaker 3>The second thing was the United States armed forces also really motivated to get</v>

1463
00:52:28.191 --> 00:52:29.750
<v Speaker 3>people into the armed forces.</v>

1464
00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.970
<v Speaker 3>Peace time or war time or time.</v>

1465
00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Well for obvious reasons,</v>

1466
00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.400
<v Speaker 3>peace time because,</v>

1467
00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.770
<v Speaker 3>well first of all you got to keep the armed forces going.</v>

1468
00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:37.604
<v Speaker 3>And second,</v>

1469
00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:41.360
<v Speaker 3>you can use the armed forces during peace time as a way of taking people out of</v>

1470
00:52:41.361 --> 00:52:45.080
<v Speaker 3>the underclass and moving them up into the working class or the middle class.</v>

1471
00:52:45.081 --> 00:52:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1472
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.630
<v Speaker 3>You can use it as a training mechanism and,</v>

1473
00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:50.000
<v Speaker 3>and so there's left and right.</v>

1474
00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:50.990
<v Speaker 3>Can agree on that.</v>

1475
00:52:50.991 --> 00:52:51.231
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1476
00:52:51.231 --> 00:52:51.411
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1477
00:52:51.411 --> 00:52:54.560
<v Speaker 3>it's a reasonable way of promoting social mobility.</v>

1478
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:55.603
<v Speaker 3>So again,</v>

1479
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:56.451
<v Speaker 3>the armed forces,</v>

1480
00:52:56.451 --> 00:53:00.860
<v Speaker 3>even in peace time is very motivated to get as many people in as they possibly</v>

1481
00:53:00.861 --> 00:53:01.400
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

1482
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.930
<v Speaker 3>And it's difficult as well.</v>

1483
00:53:03.110 --> 00:53:04.550
<v Speaker 3>It's not that easy to recruit people,</v>

1484
00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.740
<v Speaker 3>so you don't want to throw people out if you don't have to.</v>

1485
00:53:07.630 --> 00:53:08.990
<v Speaker 3>So what's the upshot of all that?</v>

1486
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:13.220
<v Speaker 3>While after a hundred years essentially of of statistic,</v>

1487
00:53:13.221 --> 00:53:14.780
<v Speaker 3>careful statistical analysis,</v>

1488
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:18.170
<v Speaker 3>the armed forces concluded that if you had an Iq of 83 or less,</v>

1489
00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:22.370
<v Speaker 3>there wasn't anything you could possibly be trained to do in the military at any</v>

1490
00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.280
<v Speaker 3>level of the organization that wasn't positively counterproductive.</v>

1491
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.721
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1492
00:53:27.721 --> 00:53:28.051
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

1493
00:53:28.051 --> 00:53:28.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1494
00:53:28.291 --> 00:53:28.800
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

1495
00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:29.820
<v Speaker 1>83 okay.</v>

1496
00:53:29.850 --> 00:53:30.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1497
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:31.193
<v Speaker 1>One in 10,</v>

1498
00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:35.550
<v Speaker 1>one in 10 that's one in 10 people.</v>

1499
00:53:36.690 --> 00:53:40.350
<v Speaker 1>And that what that really means that as far as I can tell is if you imagine that</v>

1500
00:53:40.351 --> 00:53:44.250
<v Speaker 1>the military is approximately as complex as the broader society,</v>

1501
00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:46.500
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a reasonable proposition,</v>

1502
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 1>then there's no place in our cognitively complex society for one in 10 people.</v>

1503
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.710
<v Speaker 1>So what are we going to do about that?</v>

1504
00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.810
<v Speaker 1>The answer is no one knows.</v>

1505
00:53:55.020 --> 00:53:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Say well shovel money down the hierarchy.</v>

1506
00:53:57.181 --> 00:53:59.850
<v Speaker 1>It's like the problem isn't lack of money.</v>

1507
00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:01.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean sometimes that's the problem,</v>

1508
00:54:01.441 --> 00:54:03.690
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is rarely absolute poverty.</v>

1509
00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.340
<v Speaker 1>It's rarely that it is sometimes,</v>

1510
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:06.443
<v Speaker 1>but rarely.</v>

1511
00:54:06.630 --> 00:54:08.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not that easy to move money down the hierarchy.</v>

1512
00:54:09.330 --> 00:54:10.380
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

1513
00:54:10.381 --> 00:54:11.760
<v Speaker 1>it's not that easy to manage money.</v>

1514
00:54:12.930 --> 00:54:15.090
<v Speaker 1>So it's a vicious problem,</v>

1515
00:54:15.091 --> 00:54:15.420
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1516
00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:18.120
<v Speaker 1>And so it's hard to train people to become creative,</v>

1517
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:20.430
<v Speaker 1>adaptive problem solvers as possible.</v>

1518
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.373
<v Speaker 1>You can do it,</v>

1519
00:54:23.040 --> 00:54:23.790
<v Speaker 1>you cannot do it.</v>

1520
00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:26.340
<v Speaker 1>You can interfere with their conquerors ability,</v>

1521
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:27.900
<v Speaker 1>but you can't.</v>

1522
00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:28.800
<v Speaker 1>You can't do that.</v>

1523
00:54:28.801 --> 00:54:29.760
<v Speaker 1>It's training doesn't work.</v>

1524
00:54:29.761 --> 00:54:31.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not as well as six months,</v>

1525
00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:32.970
<v Speaker 1>but it could work in six years.</v>

1526
00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:33.210
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1527
00:54:33.210 --> 00:54:34.043
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work.</v>

1528
00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.001
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

1529
00:54:36.001 --> 00:54:37.770
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work like the data on.</v>

1530
00:54:37.771 --> 00:54:39.030
<v Speaker 1>That's crystal clear as well.</v>

1531
00:54:39.031 --> 00:54:39.241
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

1532
00:54:39.241 --> 00:54:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I can give you an example.</v>

1533
00:54:40.231 --> 00:54:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So I knew a bunch of people who run MBA programs and I've had discussions with</v>

1534
00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:48.800
<v Speaker 1>them because the thing about an MBA program is it's,</v>

1535
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:49.621
<v Speaker 1>if it's selective,</v>

1536
00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:50.640
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to get in.</v>

1537
00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like getting into Harvard.</v>

1538
00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:53.670
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to get into Harvard.</v>

1539
00:54:53.940 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 1>You have to have an Iq that places you at least at the 99th percentile,</v>

1540
00:54:57.870 --> 00:55:01.110
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to be really good at at least one or two other things.</v>

1541
00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:04.020
<v Speaker 1>So it's really hard to get in.</v>

1542
00:55:04.770 --> 00:55:05.011
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1543
00:55:05.011 --> 00:55:05.491
<v Speaker 1>so you think,</v>

1544
00:55:05.491 --> 00:55:05.880
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1545
00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.320
<v Speaker 1>why hire a Harvard graduate?</v>

1546
00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:07.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1547
00:55:07.681 --> 00:55:08.940
<v Speaker 1>it's the quality of the education.</v>

1548
00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:09.331
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1549
00:55:09.331 --> 00:55:09.451
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1550
00:55:09.451 --> 00:55:10.284
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

1551
00:55:10.410 --> 00:55:11.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that it's really hard to get it.</v>

1552
00:55:12.150 --> 00:55:17.070
<v Speaker 1>All of the value of the Ivy League education is in the screening before the,</v>

1553
00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.173
<v Speaker 1>before the,</v>

1554
00:55:18.270 --> 00:55:18.780
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1555
00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:20.190
<v Speaker 1>before the education starts.</v>

1556
00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that people,</v>

1557
00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 1>people go to Harvard and they get educated,</v>

1558
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.520
<v Speaker 1>but they'd get just as educated if they went somewhere else.</v>

1559
00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:27.301
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1560
00:55:27.301 --> 00:55:32.301
<v Speaker 1>it's like every university contains more information than any student can ever</v>

1561
00:55:32.881 --> 00:55:34.050
<v Speaker 1>possibly process.</v>

1562
00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.400
<v Speaker 1>If you're super smart,</v>

1563
00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:37.620
<v Speaker 1>you can be dropped into a state college.</v>

1564
00:55:37.621 --> 00:55:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Some are low level state college,</v>

1565
00:55:39.001 --> 00:55:41.010
<v Speaker 1>he's spending four years in the library,</v>

1566
00:55:41.790 --> 00:55:42.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1567
00:55:42.031 --> 00:55:42.440
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

1568
00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:42.901
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

1569
00:55:42.901 --> 00:55:44.010
<v Speaker 1>Read the whole library.</v>

1570
00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:44.963
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1571
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.781
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1572
00:55:45.781 --> 00:55:46.290
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1573
00:55:46.290 --> 00:55:48.060
<v Speaker 1>so in the data on this is quite clear.</v>

1574
00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:48.894
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1575
00:55:48.950 --> 00:55:50.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's the same with private schools.</v>

1576
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:53.910
<v Speaker 1>The reason that people who go to private schools do better than people who go to</v>

1577
00:55:53.911 --> 00:55:56.310
<v Speaker 1>public schools is because generally speaking,</v>

1578
00:55:56.311 --> 00:55:58.650
<v Speaker 1>the people who go into private schools are smarter.</v>

1579
00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:00.780
<v Speaker 1>It's not the education that's any better.</v>

1580
00:56:01.290 --> 00:56:04.740
<v Speaker 1>And so we radically overestimate the degree to which training works.</v>

1581
00:56:05.130 --> 00:56:07.080
<v Speaker 1>So now you can train people to be stupid.</v>

1582
00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:07.860
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

1583
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.410
<v Speaker 1>but training them to be smarter than they are is really,</v>

1584
00:56:10.411 --> 00:56:10.681
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

1585
00:56:10.681 --> 00:56:11.514
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

1586
00:56:11.790 --> 00:56:12.840
<v Speaker 1>So like I said,</v>

1587
00:56:12.841 --> 00:56:13.920
<v Speaker 1>it's a dismal literature.</v>

1588
00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:19.340
<v Speaker 1>And Liberals see the liberals think everyone's roughly equal and there's a job</v>

1589
00:56:19.531 --> 00:56:19.921
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.</v>

1590
00:56:19.921 --> 00:56:20.850
<v Speaker 1>You just have to train them.</v>

1591
00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:21.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like no wrong.</v>

1592
00:56:22.290 --> 00:56:23.470
<v Speaker 1>And the Conservatives think,</v>

1593
00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:23.951
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1594
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:24.130
<v Speaker 1>there's</v>

1595
00:56:24.130 --> 00:56:26.710
<v Speaker 3>a job for everyone if they just get off their ass and work.</v>

1596
00:56:26.711 --> 00:56:26.981
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1597
00:56:26.981 --> 00:56:27.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1598
00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:27.880
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1599
00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:28.713
<v Speaker 3>that's wrong too.</v>

1600
00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Even though if you work,</v>

1601
00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:31.893
<v Speaker 3>that's better.</v>

1602
00:56:32.530 --> 00:56:34.180
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

1603
00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:35.740
<v Speaker 3>so that's on the conservative end,</v>

1604
00:56:35.770 --> 00:56:40.090
<v Speaker 3>but the liberals won't take into account individual differences while obviously</v>

1605
00:56:40.091 --> 00:56:42.550
<v Speaker 3>that's part of what the whole politically correct discussion is about.</v>

1606
00:56:42.790 --> 00:56:43.960
<v Speaker 3>It's like everyone's the same.</v>

1607
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:44.913
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1608
00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.053
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1609
00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:46.840
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1610
00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.673
<v Speaker 3>they're not,</v>

1611
00:56:50.890 --> 00:56:51.723
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to find it.</v>

1612
00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.833
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>

1613
00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:54.460
<v Speaker 3>it's really annoying.</v>

1614
00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:55.870
<v Speaker 3>I would say like,</v>

1615
00:56:55.871 --> 00:56:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I love,</v>

1616
00:56:56.350 --> 00:56:56.580
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>

1617
00:56:56.580 --> 00:56:57.820
<v Speaker 3>love to come to silicon valley.</v>

1618
00:56:57.821 --> 00:56:58.451
<v Speaker 3>I've been here many,</v>

1619
00:56:58.451 --> 00:57:02.070
<v Speaker 3>many times and like it's really something to come here and,</v>

1620
00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:03.383
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1621
00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:04.293
<v Speaker 3>and meet.</v>

1622
00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:08.020
<v Speaker 3>There's so many people here who off the scales intelligence and they're all</v>

1623
00:57:08.410 --> 00:57:09.101
<v Speaker 3>clustered together,</v>

1624
00:57:09.101 --> 00:57:12.670
<v Speaker 3>which is why this place is so unbelievably rich and so unbelievably productive.</v>

1625
00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:13.713
<v Speaker 3>One of the reasons,</v>

1626
00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:14.681
<v Speaker 3>but it's very,</v>

1627
00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:19.090
<v Speaker 3>it's also very annoying that it's so left leaning because one of the things that</v>

1628
00:57:19.091 --> 00:57:24.091
<v Speaker 3>the left leaning Silicon Valley geniuses should understand that is that they're</v>

1629
00:57:25.030 --> 00:57:29.320
<v Speaker 3>the beneficiary of a genetic lottery and they should take that seriously.</v>

1630
00:57:29.320 --> 00:57:29.651
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1631
00:57:29.651 --> 00:57:29.821
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1632
00:57:29.821 --> 00:57:30.001
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1633
00:57:30.001 --> 00:57:30.641
<v Speaker 3>You worked hard.</v>

1634
00:57:30.641 --> 00:57:30.911
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1635
00:57:30.911 --> 00:57:31.631
<v Speaker 3>Your entrepreneurial.</v>

1636
00:57:31.631 --> 00:57:31.901
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1637
00:57:31.901 --> 00:57:32.561
<v Speaker 3>You're on point.</v>

1638
00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:34.090
<v Speaker 3>You put into your 60 hours a week,</v>

1639
00:57:34.330 --> 00:57:34.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1640
00:57:34.571 --> 00:57:35.950
<v Speaker 3>you do everything you could do.</v>

1641
00:57:35.951 --> 00:57:39.160
<v Speaker 3>You have an Iq of 150 and like that's not your doing,</v>

1642
00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:40.480
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1643
00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 3>That's something that happened to you.</v>

1644
00:57:42.430 --> 00:57:44.200
<v Speaker 3>And so you can't be saying,</v>

1645
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.790
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1646
00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:45.020
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1647
00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:45.731
<v Speaker 3>it's all me.</v>

1648
00:57:45.731 --> 00:57:46.150
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1649
00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:46.983
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1650
00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:47.943
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>

1651
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:52.240
<v Speaker 3>It's all you and the genius that you were granted as a,</v>

1652
00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:53.223
<v Speaker 3>as an infant.</v>

1653
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:54.040
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1654
00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:54.670
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

1655
00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 3>That's what's driving it.</v>

1656
00:57:55.990 --> 00:58:00.460
<v Speaker 3>Now that doesn't mean I think that people have disproportionate intelligence</v>

1657
00:58:00.461 --> 00:58:03.370
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't be rewarded disproportionately.</v>

1658
00:58:03.550 --> 00:58:07.180
<v Speaker 3>It's possible that they should because it might be in the best interest of</v>

1659
00:58:07.181 --> 00:58:12.181
<v Speaker 3>everyone else to dump as much money as possible to the top 2% of the cognitive</v>

1660
00:58:12.791 --> 00:58:15.670
<v Speaker 3>strata because they're going to be most generative with it.</v>

1661
00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.193
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

1662
00:58:17.310 --> 00:58:18.760
<v Speaker 3>and even if it's not fair,</v>

1663
00:58:18.761 --> 00:58:19.511
<v Speaker 3>because you might say,</v>

1664
00:58:19.511 --> 00:58:19.751
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1665
00:58:19.751 --> 00:58:21.250
<v Speaker 3>just because he won the genetic lottery,</v>

1666
00:58:21.251 --> 00:58:23.410
<v Speaker 3>does that mean that you should have more money than anyone else?</v>

1667
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1668
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:24.101
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1669
00:58:24.101 --> 00:58:25.750
<v Speaker 3>not on the grounds of fairness,</v>

1670
00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 3>but if you have to distribute money while who are you going to distribute it to?</v>

1671
00:58:30.250 --> 00:58:30.551
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1672
00:58:30.551 --> 00:58:34.180
<v Speaker 3>and I think ti was it Ted who ran CNN,</v>

1673
00:58:34.330 --> 00:58:35.163
<v Speaker 3>Ted Turner,</v>

1674
00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.620
<v Speaker 3>he estimated that if you tried as hard as you could in your entire life,</v>

1675
00:58:38.621 --> 00:58:42.340
<v Speaker 3>there was no way that you could spend more than $400 million.</v>

1676
00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:45.730
<v Speaker 3>And so like let's say you have more money than that at your disposal,</v>

1677
00:58:45.731 --> 00:58:48.700
<v Speaker 3>well hopefully you're going to do some halfways intelligent things with it.</v>

1678
00:58:48.701 --> 00:58:52.150
<v Speaker 3>And hopefully you would expect that the more intelligent people would do more</v>

1679
00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:54.670
<v Speaker 3>than halfway intelligent things with it.</v>

1680
00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.690
<v Speaker 3>So if you have to have unequal distribution than a meritocracy is probably the</v>

1681
00:58:58.691 --> 00:58:59.524
<v Speaker 3>best way to do it.</v>

1682
00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:01.540
<v Speaker 3>But it still leaves you with this terrible problem,</v>

1683
00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:04.030
<v Speaker 3>which is what do you do with all the people who stack up at zero?</v>

1684
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:07.750
<v Speaker 3>And the answer isn't have contempt for them because they don't work as hard as</v>

1685
00:59:07.751 --> 00:59:08.080
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1686
00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:08.351
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

1687
00:59:08.351 --> 00:59:08.501
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1688
00:59:08.501 --> 00:59:09.370
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of them don't,</v>

1689
00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:09.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1690
00:59:09.851 --> 00:59:12.730
<v Speaker 3>because conscientiousness also predicts success.</v>

1691
00:59:12.910 --> 00:59:14.410
<v Speaker 3>So among the poor,</v>

1692
00:59:14.411 --> 00:59:16.060
<v Speaker 3>there are people who don't work,</v>

1693
00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:16.931
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1694
00:59:16.931 --> 00:59:21.920
<v Speaker 3>but you never want to underestimate the contribution of cognitive ability.</v>

1695
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:23.270
<v Speaker 1>So it's rough,</v>

1696
00:59:23.271 --> 00:59:23.601
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1697
00:59:23.601 --> 00:59:26.150
<v Speaker 1>and we don't take it seriously and we don't know what to do about it.</v>

1698
00:59:26.151 --> 00:59:28.910
<v Speaker 1>And yet it's clear that as inequality increases,</v>

1699
00:59:28.911 --> 00:59:30.230
<v Speaker 1>society's destabilized.</v>

1700
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.213
<v Speaker 1>That's clear.</v>

1701
00:59:31.610 --> 00:59:33.650
<v Speaker 1>So it's something that has to be dealt with and,</v>

1702
00:59:33.651 --> 00:59:34.790
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know how to deal with it.</v>

1703
00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:38.900
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how to efficiently move resources to the bottom end of the</v>

1704
00:59:38.930 --> 00:59:41.900
<v Speaker 1>competence hierarchy so that things don't destabilize.</v>

1705
00:59:42.650 --> 00:59:43.483
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1706
00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:43.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1707
00:59:43.761 --> 00:59:44.810
<v Speaker 1>and I've worked with people,</v>

1708
00:59:44.811 --> 00:59:45.740
<v Speaker 1>lots of people who are,</v>

1709
00:59:45.980 --> 00:59:49.430
<v Speaker 1>who are at the bottom end of the hierarchy in my clinical practice.</v>

1710
00:59:49.431 --> 00:59:50.061
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1711
00:59:50.061 --> 00:59:51.620
<v Speaker 1>like cocaine addicts for example,</v>

1712
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:52.160
<v Speaker 1>low [inaudible],</v>

1713
00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:52.641
<v Speaker 1>low Iq,</v>

1714
00:59:52.641 --> 00:59:53.480
<v Speaker 1>cocaine addicts,</v>

1715
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

1716
00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:56.240
<v Speaker 1>not all cocaine addicts have low Iq by the way.</v>

1717
00:59:56.241 --> 00:59:57.051
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1718
00:59:57.051 --> 00:59:57.291
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1719
00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:57.861
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1720
00:59:57.861 --> 00:59:58.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1721
00:59:58.420 --> 00:59:58.830
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1722
00:59:58.830 --> 00:59:59.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a triple whammy,</v>

1723
00:59:59.811 --> 01:00:00.201
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

1724
01:00:00.201 --> 01:00:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're a cocaine addict,</v>

1725
01:00:01.281 --> 01:00:02.630
<v Speaker 1>you probably also an alcoholic.</v>

1726
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:06.170
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're a cocaine addict and you're an alcoholic and you're sort of on</v>

1727
01:00:06.171 --> 01:00:07.970
<v Speaker 1>the low end of the cognitive distribution,</v>

1728
01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:09.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like you have pretty damn rough life.</v>

1729
01:00:09.590 --> 01:00:11.000
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things going wrong for you.</v>

1730
01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>And you're really lucky if you're flat broke because as soon as you get money,</v>

1731
01:00:15.201 --> 01:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>you are so done,</v>

1732
01:00:16.131 --> 01:00:17.060
<v Speaker 1>you cannot believe it.</v>

1733
01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So like when your unemployment check comes in and you're a cocaine addict,</v>

1734
01:00:22.041 --> 01:00:24.260
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic who isn't employed,</v>

1735
01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.440
<v Speaker 1>the probability that three days later you're going to end up face down in the</v>

1736
01:00:27.441 --> 01:00:28.340
<v Speaker 1>ditch is really,</v>

1737
01:00:28.341 --> 01:00:29.174
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>

1738
01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:30.890
<v Speaker 1>So don't be thinking like,</v>

1739
01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:35.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not so simple that you can just dump money down the competence hierarchy to</v>

1740
01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1741
01:00:35.750 --> 01:00:38.330
<v Speaker 1>to the people who are in the underclass and expect that that's going to have a</v>

1742
01:00:38.331 --> 01:00:39.380
<v Speaker 1>salutary effect.</v>

1743
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:41.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's any evidence for that whatsoever.</v>

1744
01:00:42.130 --> 01:00:45.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like money is not an easy resource to use productively.</v>

1745
01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:50.420
<v Speaker 1>So is a class based speciation something to be concerned about?</v>

1746
01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:52.573
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1747
01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>elaborate on that a little bit.</v>

1748
01:00:54.650 --> 01:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean exactly?</v>

1749
01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Well by class based speciation,</v>

1750
01:00:57.471 --> 01:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>meaning there's already a tremendous amount of wealth that is accumulated within</v>

1751
01:01:02.061 --> 01:01:07.061
<v Speaker 1>such a small percentage of people and whether it be through a bifurcation of</v>

1752
01:01:07.161 --> 01:01:12.161
<v Speaker 1>split of a couple billion people off of the human species or it could be a</v>

1753
01:01:13.011 --> 01:01:13.791
<v Speaker 1>trifurcation.</v>

1754
01:01:13.791 --> 01:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how many splits there may be,</v>

1755
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.323
<v Speaker 1>whether that,</v>

1756
01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's something to worry about or something to hope for it.</v>

1757
01:01:20.690 --> 01:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean this timescales are so large that it's probably not relevant to</v>

1758
01:01:24.351 --> 01:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>individuals potentially something to hope for in the evolutionary trajectory of</v>

1759
01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>the human.</v>

1760
01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Well you kind of hope that people get smarter.</v>

1761
01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>My might get smarter across time.</v>

1762
01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:35.510
<v Speaker 1>I guess we would hope that might be a good thing.</v>

1763
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not self evident so,</v>

1764
01:01:36.851 --> 01:01:38.480
<v Speaker 1>so if it is a lottery,</v>

1765
01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>if it was a roll of the dice to be born where we are,</v>

1766
01:01:43.550 --> 01:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>don't we also feel that it could have been rolled the dice to be born in a place</v>

1767
01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>less fortunate therefore sure.</v>

1768
01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:51.981
<v Speaker 1>We do feel that.</v>

1769
01:01:51.981 --> 01:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>I think that's why the didn't even know.</v>

1770
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're successful,</v>

1771
01:01:54.141 --> 01:01:57.160
<v Speaker 1>people often feel guilty because of inequality and say,</v>

1772
01:01:57.170 --> 01:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>no wonder your ultimate calling in terms of the width of religion and with,</v>

1773
01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:02.541
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1774
01:02:02.541 --> 01:02:06.140
<v Speaker 1>with finding self actualization and meaning within us to what you say,</v>

1775
01:02:06.141 --> 01:02:10.190
<v Speaker 1>eradicate suffering is something that is give so much meaning to life.</v>

1776
01:02:10.191 --> 01:02:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1777
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:11.623
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1778
01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:15.590
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people in less fortunate circumstances experienced lots of suffering</v>

1779
01:02:15.591 --> 01:02:20.591
<v Speaker 1>with lack of food or water or shelter or basic physiological needs.</v>

1780
01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>And so then therefore,</v>

1781
01:02:23.251 --> 01:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it feel like within this potential class-based speciation with wealth</v>

1782
01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:31.720
<v Speaker 1>that there should be some sort of assistant course?</v>

1783
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

1784
01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:32.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1785
01:02:32.911 --> 01:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>And now the conversation is how can we do that?</v>

1786
01:02:34.770 --> 01:02:36.060
<v Speaker 1>So there's a couple of things there.</v>

1787
01:02:36.061 --> 01:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1788
01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:37.493
<v Speaker 1>to the degree,</v>

1789
01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.730
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

1790
01:02:38.731 --> 01:02:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I've been a vocal opponent of the radical left and I,</v>

1791
01:02:41.961 --> 01:02:42.350
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1792
01:02:42.350 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I can't detest them enough really.</v>

1793
01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Is this a fundamental,</v>

1794
01:02:45.721 --> 01:02:47.280
<v Speaker 1>is the fund my fundamental position?</v>

1795
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:49.583
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

1796
01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:54.870
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that I don't think that uh,</v>

1797
01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>functioning polity requires a left and a right wing.</v>

1798
01:02:58.050 --> 01:02:58.681
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

1799
01:02:58.681 --> 01:03:02.310
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it requires a left wing is because inequality is real and it has</v>

1800
01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:03.360
<v Speaker 1>to be addressed.</v>

1801
01:03:03.361 --> 01:03:05.970
<v Speaker 1>It has to be addressed for all the reasons that you described,</v>

1802
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.283
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

1803
01:03:07.590 --> 01:03:08.423
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1804
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

1805
01:03:10.831 --> 01:03:15.831
<v Speaker 1>there are ways to go about addressing it that are clearly counterproductive and</v>

1806
01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:20.460
<v Speaker 1>those were tried to great destructive power in the 20th century and I don't</v>

1807
01:03:20.461 --> 01:03:21.840
<v Speaker 1>really think we need to do that again.</v>

1808
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:26.460
<v Speaker 1>The corollary to that is we don't know what the productive means are now.</v>

1809
01:03:26.461 --> 01:03:27.750
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking a lot about that,</v>

1810
01:03:27.751 --> 01:03:28.011
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1811
01:03:28.011 --> 01:03:29.370
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking,</v>

1812
01:03:29.371 --> 01:03:29.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1813
01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.800
<v Speaker 1>how do you solve the problem of inequality?</v>

1814
01:03:32.130 --> 01:03:37.130
<v Speaker 1>And it has to be something like the moral burden on those who are successful has</v>

1815
01:03:38.461 --> 01:03:40.410
<v Speaker 1>to be increased.</v>

1816
01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:41.490
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

1817
01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.900
<v Speaker 1>And I think you see that,</v>

1818
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:43.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1819
01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:44.790
<v Speaker 1>I think I wrote this to you,</v>

1820
01:03:44.791 --> 01:03:49.791
<v Speaker 1>that what's the significance of purchasing a third yacht rather than maybe</v>

1821
01:03:50.101 --> 01:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>hiring 50 people to solve a problem in the world?</v>

1822
01:03:52.721 --> 01:03:53.101
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

1823
01:03:53.101 --> 01:03:54.360
<v Speaker 1>These things aren't so simple.</v>

1824
01:03:54.361 --> 01:03:54.631
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1825
01:03:54.631 --> 01:03:58.680
<v Speaker 1>like let's say that you decided to go out to a restaurant and your meal is $500</v>

1826
01:03:58.681 --> 01:03:59.251
<v Speaker 1>and you might think,</v>

1827
01:03:59.251 --> 01:04:00.870
<v Speaker 1>well that's reprehensible and well,</v>

1828
01:04:00.930 --> 01:04:02.460
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you don't think that's reprehensible.</v>

1829
01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:03.570
<v Speaker 1>But the thing is,</v>

1830
01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:05.610
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad way of dispersing extra money.</v>

1831
01:04:06.150 --> 01:04:09.900
<v Speaker 1>So it's not that obvious what rich people should do with their money that's</v>

1832
01:04:09.901 --> 01:04:10.734
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>

1833
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:11.401
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

1834
01:04:11.401 --> 01:04:11.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1835
01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:13.830
<v Speaker 1>should you buy a third yard because do you really need it?</v>

1836
01:04:13.831 --> 01:04:14.400
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

1837
01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.850
<v Speaker 1>that's particularly perhaps a particularly egregious example,</v>

1838
01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:20.190
<v Speaker 1>but it's not like you're not employing people when you do that.</v>

1839
01:04:20.310 --> 01:04:22.620
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't stuff the money in your mattress.</v>

1840
01:04:22.830 --> 01:04:23.730
<v Speaker 1>We could say that,</v>

1841
01:04:23.731 --> 01:04:23.951
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1842
01:04:23.951 --> 01:04:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Because that's just pure hoarding.</v>

1843
01:04:25.321 --> 01:04:28.980
<v Speaker 1>But most people who have money aren't like scrooge McDuck.</v>

1844
01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:31.830
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a money been that they swim in right there.</v>

1845
01:04:31.831 --> 01:04:32.520
<v Speaker 1>Money.</v>

1846
01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.061
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

1847
01:04:33.061 --> 01:04:33.894
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of,</v>

1848
01:04:33.910 --> 01:04:36.090
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of clueless picture of wealth.</v>

1849
01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:36.301
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1850
01:04:36.301 --> 01:04:37.920
<v Speaker 1>most people who have money,</v>

1851
01:04:37.921 --> 01:04:39.570
<v Speaker 1>their money is out there doing things.</v>

1852
01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:40.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they're,</v>

1853
01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:42.300
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's in their bedroom,</v>

1854
01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:42.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1855
01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1856
01:04:42.930 --> 01:04:44.580
<v Speaker 1>and in gold coin form.</v>

1857
01:04:44.850 --> 01:04:48.900
<v Speaker 1>So they're not hoarding it in exactly the same way that perhaps people used to</v>

1858
01:04:48.901 --> 01:04:52.730
<v Speaker 1>hoard wealth when it wasn't as abstracted and,</v>

1859
01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:52.951
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1860
01:04:52.951 --> 01:04:55.760
<v Speaker 1>and functional in its own terms out there in the aquarium.</v>

1861
01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Money is usually working for them,</v>

1862
01:04:58.501 --> 01:04:59.520
<v Speaker 1>making them more money.</v>

1863
01:04:59.610 --> 01:04:59.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1864
01:04:59.851 --> 01:05:01.800
<v Speaker 1>But it's also doing a bunch of other things.</v>

1865
01:05:01.801 --> 01:05:02.131
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1866
01:05:02.131 --> 01:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a bad money manager,</v>

1867
01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:04.531
<v Speaker 1>even if you're wealthy,</v>

1868
01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you're money tends to disappear very rapidly.</v>

1869
01:05:06.330 --> 01:05:10.110
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing that's really worth knowing is that like there is a 1% and</v>

1870
01:05:10.111 --> 01:05:15.000
<v Speaker 1>that 1% does have a disproportionate amount of the money and 1% of that 1% has</v>

1871
01:05:15.001 --> 01:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>an even more disproportionate amount of the money.</v>

1872
01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:21.970
<v Speaker 1>It's scales all the way up the up the measurement spectrum let's say,</v>

1873
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but there's actually quite a bit of mobility within that 1% so you have a 10%</v>

1874
01:05:27.221 --> 01:05:31.600
<v Speaker 1>chance in your lifetime in the United States of being in the top 1% for at least</v>

1875
01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>

1876
01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Now that's not like a hundred percent chance,</v>

1877
01:05:34.301 --> 01:05:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but it's one in 10 it's not dismal,</v>

1878
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:37.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1879
01:05:37.570 --> 01:05:38.430
<v Speaker 1>so well,</v>

1880
01:05:38.770 --> 01:05:41.890
<v Speaker 1>partly what you hope for is that there's some genuine upward mobility.</v>

1881
01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>But then I think the other thing that you hope for is that people who are</v>

1882
01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:50.791
<v Speaker 1>disproportionately successful take it upon themselves to do everything they</v>

1883
01:05:51.041 --> 01:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>possibly can to do whatever they can.</v>

1884
01:05:54.070 --> 01:05:56.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the best possible thing to do with their money.</v>

1885
01:05:57.130 --> 01:05:57.431
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1886
01:05:57.431 --> 01:06:00.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of an admirer of Bill Gates for a variety of reasons,</v>

1887
01:06:00.310 --> 01:06:04.240
<v Speaker 1>but he's doing a really good job of putting the boots to the five world,</v>

1888
01:06:04.270 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 1>the world's five worst transmissible diseases.</v>

1889
01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:06.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1890
01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:08.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's going quite nicely.</v>

1891
01:06:08.141 --> 01:06:08.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1892
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:11.350
<v Speaker 1>they're making some real polios just about defunct.</v>

1893
01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:14.620
<v Speaker 1>They're making some real progress with malaria.</v>

1894
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Like there's almost nothing that can be possibly be done for Africa that would</v>

1895
01:06:18.161 --> 01:06:19.960
<v Speaker 1>be more useful than to get rid of malaria.</v>

1896
01:06:20.050 --> 01:06:23.380
<v Speaker 1>Sleeping sickness would be another one that would be really useful to allow to</v>

1897
01:06:23.381 --> 01:06:23.951
<v Speaker 1>eradicate.</v>

1898
01:06:23.951 --> 01:06:27.280
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say that the longterm solution,</v>

1899
01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.230
<v Speaker 1>assuming that there is one,</v>

1900
01:06:29.231 --> 01:06:29.411
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

1901
01:06:29.411 --> 01:06:33.700
<v Speaker 1>the problem of inequality is that people who are disproportionately fortunate,</v>

1902
01:06:33.701 --> 01:06:34.480
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

1903
01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.020
<v Speaker 1>or successful or both take it upon,</v>

1904
01:06:38.170 --> 01:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>take the moral duty of doing the best possible good that they can with the money</v>

1905
01:06:43.301 --> 01:06:44.134
<v Speaker 1>that they generate.</v>

1906
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:47.290
<v Speaker 1>But the other thing I think that's sort of interesting about that is I actually</v>

1907
01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:50.050
<v Speaker 1>don't think there's anything more interesting to do with your money that direct.</v>

1908
01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:50.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1909
01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:53.740
<v Speaker 1>can you think of anything more interesting to do with your money than to find a</v>

1910
01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:57.040
<v Speaker 1>really difficult problem that causes a bunch of people suffering and then try to</v>

1911
01:06:57.041 --> 01:06:57.491
<v Speaker 1>fix it?</v>

1912
01:06:57.491 --> 01:06:58.570
<v Speaker 1>It's like amazing.</v>

1913
01:06:58.571 --> 01:07:01.810
<v Speaker 1>If you have a clue that's gotta be a little better than a third yacht.</v>

1914
01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:02.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1915
01:07:02.350 --> 01:07:03.001
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1916
01:07:03.001 --> 01:07:03.160
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1917
01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:03.881
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty low.</v>

1918
01:07:03.881 --> 01:07:04.151
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1919
01:07:04.151 --> 01:07:08.890
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a low bar like that conspicuous consumption thing at at some point</v>

1920
01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:14.160
<v Speaker 1>it's just if you have any sense at some point that's just not very impressive.</v>

1921
01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:15.071
<v Speaker 1>Could it could.</v>

1922
01:07:15.071 --> 01:07:20.071
<v Speaker 1>Another way to address the potential class based speciation be the education of</v>

1923
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:27.180
<v Speaker 1>the child and by the principles of let's say that over the last hundred billion</v>

1924
01:07:30.641 --> 01:07:35.290
<v Speaker 1>people that have lived in died to build this beautiful world we live in today</v>

1925
01:07:35.291 --> 01:07:38.800
<v Speaker 1>with all of the food and water ubiquity and the governments and the economies</v>

1926
01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.370
<v Speaker 1>that there,</v>

1927
01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:45.660
<v Speaker 1>every child that's being stamped out into this world might have a little tiny</v>

1928
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:52.710
<v Speaker 1>missing chip on their shoulder and that missing chip might be things like their</v>

1929
01:07:53.831 --> 01:07:58.831
<v Speaker 1>parents explaining to them what evolution is or what their anatomy,</v>

1930
01:08:02.471 --> 01:08:04.210
<v Speaker 1>what their heart and their brain is,</v>

1931
01:08:04.211 --> 01:08:05.320
<v Speaker 1>their body may be,</v>

1932
01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:06.730
<v Speaker 1>what morality is,</v>

1933
01:08:06.731 --> 01:08:07.660
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

1934
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:12.670
<v Speaker 1>If maybe every child is born with a little bit of something like that.</v>

1935
01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there's something like that Jordan?</v>

1936
01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:15.471
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1937
01:08:15.471 --> 01:08:16.304
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>

1938
01:08:17.210 --> 01:08:19.070
<v Speaker 3>you know like that's done right?</v>

1939
01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:24.320
<v Speaker 3>This thing is connecting everyone to everything and so the probability that</v>

1940
01:08:24.321 --> 01:08:28.580
<v Speaker 3>people are going to be get whatever education they want in the next 30 years is</v>

1941
01:08:28.610 --> 01:08:29.810
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmingly high.</v>

1942
01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:31.760
<v Speaker 3>So I think in some sense</v>

1943
01:08:33.470 --> 01:08:36.560
<v Speaker 3>that problem is being solved as rapidly as it can possibly be.</v>

1944
01:08:36.970 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 3>Be being solved.</v>

1945
01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:38.501
<v Speaker 3>That is,</v>

1946
01:08:38.501 --> 01:08:41.300
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't mean people should stop trying to find more and more effective ways</v>

1947
01:08:41.301 --> 01:08:42.134
<v Speaker 3>of educating.</v>

1948
01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:46.530
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be reading some general basic principles that you think of.</v>

1949
01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:50.030
<v Speaker 3>Parents should teach a child obviously within the rules of life,</v>

1950
01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:55.031
<v Speaker 3>but it may be something about evolution or something about their own anatomy and</v>

1951
01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:56.450
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1952
01:08:56.450 --> 01:08:57.283
<v Speaker 3>I think that,</v>

1953
01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:03.200
<v Speaker 3>I think that there are all sorts of things that parents who are good parents</v>

1954
01:09:03.350 --> 01:09:04.610
<v Speaker 3>teach their children.</v>

1955
01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:05.271
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1956
01:09:05.271 --> 01:09:08.700
<v Speaker 3>part of what 12 rules for life is about is about that.</v>

1957
01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:11.060
<v Speaker 3>It's like a universal ethic in some sense there.</v>

1958
01:09:11.750 --> 01:09:12.920
<v Speaker 3>I think that there is a,</v>

1959
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:19.030
<v Speaker 3>there's dawning realization among members of the biologically oriented</v>

1960
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:20.091
<v Speaker 3>community.</v>

1961
01:09:20.091 --> 01:09:24.770
<v Speaker 3>Let's say that there is something like an emergent ethic that's evident in</v>

1962
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:27.580
<v Speaker 3>biological systems and um,</v>

1963
01:09:28.670 --> 01:09:33.670
<v Speaker 3>one of the most outstanding examples of that I would say is apart from the work</v>

1964
01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:36.440
<v Speaker 3>that dwell has done with chimpanzees,</v>

1965
01:09:36.441 --> 01:09:38.900
<v Speaker 3>showing the beginnings of an ethic,</v>

1966
01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.020
<v Speaker 3>at least in in the behavioral sense,</v>

1967
01:09:42.021 --> 01:09:45.590
<v Speaker 3>the beginnings of an ethic among chimpanzees is work that's being done with</v>

1968
01:09:45.591 --> 01:09:46.131
<v Speaker 3>rats.</v>

1969
01:09:46.131 --> 01:09:47.960
<v Speaker 3>And so Jaak Panksepp for example,</v>

1970
01:09:47.961 --> 01:09:49.850
<v Speaker 3>who wrote a book called an affect of neuroscience,</v>

1971
01:09:49.851 --> 01:09:50.990
<v Speaker 3>which I would highly recommend.</v>

1972
01:09:50.991 --> 01:09:52.160
<v Speaker 3>It's a real work of genius.</v>

1973
01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.720
<v Speaker 3>You blew my mind with Piaget,</v>

1974
01:09:53.721 --> 01:09:54.554
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1975
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.850
<v Speaker 3>with the way that rats,</v>

1976
01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:56.571
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1977
01:09:56.571 --> 01:09:58.490
<v Speaker 3>that's Panksepp know.</v>

1978
01:09:58.550 --> 01:09:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Piaget found out,</v>

1979
01:09:59.571 --> 01:10:00.770
<v Speaker 3>found out that out in children.</v>

1980
01:10:00.771 --> 01:10:01.310
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1981
01:10:01.310 --> 01:10:01.521
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1982
01:10:01.521 --> 01:10:04.370
<v Speaker 3>Panksepp was a scientist who discovered that rats laugh.</v>

1983
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:05.600
<v Speaker 3>It's hurting and you think,</v>

1984
01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:06.650
<v Speaker 3>well that's not a big deal.</v>

1985
01:10:06.651 --> 01:10:09.950
<v Speaker 3>It's like actually it is a really big deal because it shows that it shows</v>

1986
01:10:09.951 --> 01:10:13.640
<v Speaker 3>commonality of the positive emotion systems across biological strata</v>

1987
01:10:13.641 --> 01:10:14.121
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

1988
01:10:14.121 --> 01:10:15.380
<v Speaker 3>So it's actually a really big deal.</v>

1989
01:10:15.381 --> 01:10:18.710
<v Speaker 3>And he found that if you tickle routes with an Eraser,</v>

1990
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:22.280
<v Speaker 3>they laugh ultrasonically and so you have to slow it down to hear them.</v>

1991
01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:25.220
<v Speaker 3>And the reason he figured figure that out was because he was trying to figure</v>

1992
01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:26.054
<v Speaker 3>out why.</v>

1993
01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:29.480
<v Speaker 3>If you take rat pups away from their mother and feed them and give them enough</v>

1994
01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:29.781
<v Speaker 3>water,</v>

1995
01:10:29.781 --> 01:10:30.620
<v Speaker 3>they still die.</v>

1996
01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:34.790
<v Speaker 3>They die unless you massage them with while he used a pencil eraser.</v>

1997
01:10:34.791 --> 01:10:38.210
<v Speaker 3>That's what cause it's Kinda soft and it seems to work without harming the</v>

1998
01:10:38.211 --> 01:10:38.621
<v Speaker 3>routes.</v>

1999
01:10:38.621 --> 01:10:39.500
<v Speaker 3>A little rap pops in.</v>

2000
01:10:39.770 --> 01:10:41.240
<v Speaker 3>If you rub them with pencil racer,</v>

2001
01:10:41.241 --> 01:10:42.110
<v Speaker 3>then they'll thrive.</v>

2002
01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:45.680
<v Speaker 3>And that was actually translated very rapidly into practical research because it</v>

2003
01:10:45.681 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 3>turns out that if you have a premature infant,</v>

2004
01:10:48.170 --> 01:10:49.310
<v Speaker 3>it's an incubator.</v>

2005
01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:50.750
<v Speaker 3>They often lose weight a,</v>

2006
01:10:50.790 --> 01:10:53.180
<v Speaker 3>which is a really bad thing because they're supposed to be gaining weight.</v>

2007
01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:56.270
<v Speaker 3>But if you massage them three times a day for 10 minutes,</v>

2008
01:10:56.271 --> 01:10:58.820
<v Speaker 3>then they'll gain weight about as fast as they do in utero.</v>

2009
01:10:59.030 --> 01:11:01.520
<v Speaker 3>And they leave the hospital on average five days earlier.</v>

2010
01:11:01.521 --> 01:11:05.810
<v Speaker 3>And the beneficial cognitive and physiological effects are still detectable six</v>

2011
01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:07.910
<v Speaker 3>months down the road to walloping.</v>

2012
01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:09.740
<v Speaker 3>It's a walloping effect.</v>

2013
01:11:09.980 --> 01:11:13.530
<v Speaker 3>And so it turns out that one of the things Panksepp sorted out was that human</v>

2014
01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:15.360
<v Speaker 3>that touches a human need.</v>

2015
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:16.710
<v Speaker 3>It's not a secondary need.</v>

2016
01:11:16.711 --> 01:11:17.521
<v Speaker 3>It's a primary need.</v>

2017
01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:20.160
<v Speaker 3>Like like food and water and childhood development.</v>

2018
01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:20.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2019
01:11:20.911 --> 01:11:21.151
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

2020
01:11:21.151 --> 01:11:21.361
<v Speaker 3>Well.</v>

2021
01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:25.020
<v Speaker 3>And then he was also a big proponent of rough and tumble play because he found</v>

2022
01:11:25.021 --> 01:11:26.880
<v Speaker 3>out that in routes that rough and tumble play,</v>

2023
01:11:26.881 --> 01:11:28.350
<v Speaker 3>especially among juvenile males,</v>

2024
01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:32.760
<v Speaker 3>catalyzes prefrontal development and that rat pups who are male that aren't</v>

2025
01:11:32.761 --> 01:11:34.680
<v Speaker 3>allowed to engage in rough and tumble play,</v>

2026
01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:39.890
<v Speaker 3>she'll prefrontal hypo development and you can then treat them with Ritalin,</v>

2027
01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.600
<v Speaker 3>which is the Adhd drug,</v>

2028
01:11:42.630 --> 01:11:44.040
<v Speaker 3>just in case you're wondering.</v>

2029
01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:47.220
<v Speaker 3>So that's a very dismal line of scientific research,</v>

2030
01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:48.750
<v Speaker 3>but also very promising.</v>

2031
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:51.180
<v Speaker 3>So what Panksepp also found,</v>

2032
01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.600
<v Speaker 3>and this is another piece of information that really blew me away when I first</v>

2033
01:11:55.140 --> 01:11:55.980
<v Speaker 3>first read about it,</v>

2034
01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:58.280
<v Speaker 3>was so he,</v>

2035
01:11:58.500 --> 01:11:58.791
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

2036
01:11:58.791 --> 01:12:00.420
<v Speaker 3>he Panksepp discovered the place,</v>

2037
01:12:00.421 --> 01:12:01.410
<v Speaker 3>circuitry and mammals.</v>

2038
01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 3>And that's also a big deal,</v>

2039
01:12:02.791 --> 01:12:03.001
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2040
01:12:03.001 --> 01:12:07.650
<v Speaker 3>That's like discovering a continent to discover a dedicated circuitry to a set</v>

2041
01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:09.270
<v Speaker 3>of complex biological functions.</v>

2042
01:12:09.271 --> 01:12:10.320
<v Speaker 3>That's a big deal,</v>

2043
01:12:10.321 --> 01:12:10.950
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2044
01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:11.783
<v Speaker 3>And so,</v>

2045
01:12:11.820 --> 01:12:12.710
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2046
01:12:13.290 --> 01:12:16.800
<v Speaker 3>when he was investigating play behavior among rats,</v>

2047
01:12:16.801 --> 01:12:20.760
<v Speaker 3>he noticed that juvenile males in particular would work to wrestle.</v>

2048
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:22.710
<v Speaker 3>And they wrestle really a lot.</v>

2049
01:12:22.711 --> 01:12:23.400
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2050
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2051
01:12:24.180 --> 01:12:28.650
<v Speaker 3>human children or like cumin children and dogs wrestle and rats pin each other.</v>

2052
01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:29.730
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2053
01:12:29.730 --> 01:12:30.563
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2054
01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:32.340
<v Speaker 3>what banks have found first was that,</v>

2055
01:12:32.341 --> 01:12:33.480
<v Speaker 3>and other scientists as well,</v>

2056
01:12:33.481 --> 01:12:34.840
<v Speaker 3>but I'll use him as a shorthand,</v>

2057
01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:39.120
<v Speaker 3>was that rats would work to enter a play arena where they knew they were going</v>

2058
01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:41.160
<v Speaker 3>to be allowed to wrestle with a appear.</v>

2059
01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.200
<v Speaker 3>And that's kind of how you figure out if a rat wants to do something right,</v>

2060
01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:47.790
<v Speaker 3>you make them button press forward or pull on something and then you can measure</v>

2061
01:12:47.791 --> 01:12:50.370
<v Speaker 3>how fast you'll press the button or how hard it pull and you can get some</v>

2062
01:12:50.371 --> 01:12:51.740
<v Speaker 3>estimate of how motivated he is.</v>

2063
01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:54.600
<v Speaker 3>Routes are pretty damn motivated to enter into a play arena.</v>

2064
01:12:54.601 --> 01:12:59.601
<v Speaker 3>And so if one route enters into a player arena and another rat does and the one</v>

2065
01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:01.890
<v Speaker 3>rat is 10% bigger than the other,</v>

2066
01:13:02.070 --> 01:13:04.530
<v Speaker 3>then in like nine out of 10 cases,</v>

2067
01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:09.531
<v Speaker 3>the big rat can pin the little rat and in the first bout then pinning,</v>

2068
01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:10.860
<v Speaker 3>establish his dominance.</v>

2069
01:13:11.010 --> 01:13:14.370
<v Speaker 3>This is kind of an interesting commentary on scientific methodology too,</v>

2070
01:13:14.371 --> 01:13:19.170
<v Speaker 3>because let's say that you are investigating rat behavior and you were trying to</v>

2071
01:13:19.171 --> 01:13:21.450
<v Speaker 3>draw conclusions and you only paired rats together.</v>

2072
01:13:21.451 --> 01:13:26.451
<v Speaker 3>Once you'd assume the big rat dominates its physical size that does the</v>

2073
01:13:26.611 --> 01:13:29.010
<v Speaker 3>domination and that's the purpose of play.</v>

2074
01:13:29.490 --> 01:13:33.810
<v Speaker 3>But that isn't right because it's like don't let it win play as something that</v>

2075
01:13:33.811 --> 01:13:34.261
<v Speaker 3>iterates,</v>

2076
01:13:34.261 --> 01:13:34.590
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2077
01:13:34.590 --> 01:13:37.200
<v Speaker 3>You don't play with a person only once you play with them.</v>

2078
01:13:37.770 --> 01:13:39.210
<v Speaker 3>Well who knows for how long,</v>

2079
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:39.510
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2080
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:41.670
<v Speaker 3>If it's a relationship that lasts decades,</v>

2081
01:13:41.671 --> 01:13:43.620
<v Speaker 3>then it's decades of reciprocal interaction.</v>

2082
01:13:44.010 --> 01:13:47.910
<v Speaker 3>So Panksepp and his colleagues and the other scientists who are working on this</v>

2083
01:13:48.550 --> 01:13:49.920
<v Speaker 3>paired the rats repeatedly.</v>

2084
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.940
<v Speaker 3>So these are iterated games and the rules of an iterated game aren't the same as</v>

2085
01:13:53.941 --> 01:13:55.170
<v Speaker 3>the rules of a one off game.</v>

2086
01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:58.860
<v Speaker 3>And that might actually be the basis for a universal ethic is that there are</v>

2087
01:13:58.861 --> 01:14:00.000
<v Speaker 3>rules for iterated games.</v>

2088
01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.800
<v Speaker 3>And what paths have found was that,</v>

2089
01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:02.431
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

2090
01:14:02.431 --> 01:14:06.390
<v Speaker 3>so the big rat is now super ordinate to the little rat.</v>

2091
01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:08.040
<v Speaker 3>Now when you repair them,</v>

2092
01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.590
<v Speaker 3>the little rat has to ask the big let route to play.</v>

2093
01:14:10.591 --> 01:14:11.321
<v Speaker 3>That's the rule.</v>

2094
01:14:11.321 --> 01:14:12.100
<v Speaker 3>So the big rat gets</v>

2095
01:14:12.100 --> 01:14:15.440
<v Speaker 1>to sit there like he's cool and the little rat cast to hop up like,</v>

2096
01:14:15.610 --> 01:14:18.130
<v Speaker 1>like a dog that's asking you to play and sort of bounce around.</v>

2097
01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:19.480
<v Speaker 1>You all know what that looks like.</v>

2098
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Dog kind of puts its rear end up in the air,</v>

2099
01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:22.990
<v Speaker 1>kind of hops a little bit.</v>

2100
01:14:23.050 --> 01:14:23.883
<v Speaker 1>And that means like,</v>

2101
01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:25.930
<v Speaker 1>well come on human cuff me,</v>

2102
01:14:25.931 --> 01:14:28.150
<v Speaker 1>you know and if you have any sense,</v>

2103
01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:32.380
<v Speaker 1>you know how to do that and you can even understand when a dog does it and the</v>

2104
01:14:32.381 --> 01:14:32.800
<v Speaker 1>dog,</v>

2105
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>if he socialized can understand when you're doing it right cause well socialized</v>

2106
01:14:36.311 --> 01:14:37.570
<v Speaker 1>dog is you Kinda,</v>

2107
01:14:37.930 --> 01:14:41.110
<v Speaker 1>you kinda go like this and then he does the same thing and you whack them on the</v>

2108
01:14:41.111 --> 01:14:44.080
<v Speaker 1>side of the head little bit and he growls and puts his,</v>

2109
01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.510
<v Speaker 1>you know your hand in his mouth but he doesn't bite it.</v>

2110
01:14:46.511 --> 01:14:47.860
<v Speaker 1>But he sounds like he's going to,</v>

2111
01:14:47.861 --> 01:14:50.110
<v Speaker 1>the dog knows what the hell is going on unless it's completely,</v>

2112
01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.810
<v Speaker 1>unless it's raised by a behavioral psychologist,</v>

2113
01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:53.673
<v Speaker 1>which isn't</v>

2114
01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.590
<v Speaker 1>the worst behaved dog I ever saw was the dog that was raised by a behavioral</v>

2115
01:14:59.591 --> 01:15:00.424
<v Speaker 1>psychologist.</v>

2116
01:15:00.910 --> 01:15:01.743
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2117
01:15:01.870 --> 01:15:02.621
<v Speaker 1>sorry about that.</v>

2118
01:15:02.621 --> 01:15:03.700
<v Speaker 1>But so anyway,</v>

2119
01:15:03.701 --> 01:15:07.810
<v Speaker 1>so the pair of these rats together and what you find is that,</v>

2120
01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:10.480
<v Speaker 1>so the little rat has to ask the big rat to play in the big rattle,</v>

2121
01:15:10.481 --> 01:15:11.490
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>

2122
01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:13.060
<v Speaker 1>break is cool and then wrestle.</v>

2123
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.980
<v Speaker 1>And then if you pair them repeatedly,</v>

2124
01:15:14.981 --> 01:15:18.970
<v Speaker 1>unless the big rat lets the little rat win 30% of the time for little rat will</v>

2125
01:15:18.971 --> 01:15:20.260
<v Speaker 1>no longer ask him to play.</v>

2126
01:15:20.650 --> 01:15:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Like I read that it was like a little electrical storm went off in my bag is</v>

2127
01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.180
<v Speaker 1>what happened to me too.</v>

2128
01:15:25.300 --> 01:15:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2129
01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.051
<v Speaker 1>it's so good.</v>

2130
01:15:26.051 --> 01:15:26.651
<v Speaker 1>So on.</v>

2131
01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:29.050
<v Speaker 1>So absolutely unbelievable is that,</v>

2132
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.540
<v Speaker 1>well there you have this emergent ethic of reciprocity.</v>

2133
01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:35.800
<v Speaker 1>All you need to do is pair animals together in reciprocal play boats and you</v>

2134
01:15:35.801 --> 01:15:38.200
<v Speaker 1>have an emergent reciprocity and then you think,</v>

2135
01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:38.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2136
01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:38.951
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2137
01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:42.550
<v Speaker 1>so that's the basis for social interaction is that reciprocity.</v>

2138
01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:44.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a bit of an advantage to the,</v>

2139
01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.311
<v Speaker 1>to the big rat,</v>

2140
01:15:45.311 --> 01:15:46.960
<v Speaker 1>but not a huge advantage.</v>

2141
01:15:47.470 --> 01:15:47.711
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

2142
01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:49.930
<v Speaker 1>well that's the beginning of an ethic.</v>

2143
01:15:49.931 --> 01:15:50.351
<v Speaker 1>And you say,</v>

2144
01:15:50.351 --> 01:15:50.561
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2145
01:15:50.561 --> 01:15:55.390
<v Speaker 1>human beings that efficacy merged at the biological level and then human beings</v>

2146
01:15:55.391 --> 01:15:58.390
<v Speaker 1>watched it develop and told stories about it.</v>

2147
01:15:58.570 --> 01:15:59.800
<v Speaker 1>That's where the stories came from.</v>

2148
01:15:59.950 --> 01:16:03.880
<v Speaker 1>And then out of the stories we coded and explicit ethic and that's where the</v>

2149
01:16:03.881 --> 01:16:05.320
<v Speaker 1>philosophy of ethics came from.</v>

2150
01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.300
<v Speaker 1>But it emerged from the bottom up.</v>

2151
01:16:07.390 --> 01:16:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Something Nietzsche predicted like 150 years ago.</v>

2152
01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:10.331
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

2153
01:16:10.331 --> 01:16:10.660
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2154
01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:10.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2155
01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:14.740
<v Speaker 1>we'll find that there was an emergent ethic that emerged biologically and then</v>

2156
01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:15.670
<v Speaker 1>was later mapped.</v>

2157
01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And so that was just,</v>

2158
01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:18.550
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2159
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:22.600
<v Speaker 1>that's just absolutely beyond belief and then very likely true and points the</v>

2160
01:16:22.601 --> 01:16:23.800
<v Speaker 1>way to something like</v>

2161
01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:26.880
<v Speaker 1>while in archetipal ethics,</v>

2162
01:16:26.881 --> 01:16:28.300
<v Speaker 1>certainly one of reciprocity,</v>

2163
01:16:28.301 --> 01:16:28.511
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

2164
01:16:28.511 --> 01:16:28.690
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2165
01:16:28.690 --> 01:16:31.840
<v Speaker 1>which I think the fundamental art archetypical ethic,</v>

2166
01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:32.703
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2167
01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:33.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2168
01:16:33.551 --> 01:16:34.510
<v Speaker 1>here's another example,</v>

2169
01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:35.021
<v Speaker 1>Jordan.</v>

2170
01:16:35.021 --> 01:16:36.360
<v Speaker 1>Maybe just because we,</v>

2171
01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.200
<v Speaker 1>when we will not touch on a bunch of other,</v>

2172
01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:38.760
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2173
01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.593
<v Speaker 1>points as well.</v>

2174
01:16:39.740 --> 01:16:40.011
<v Speaker 1>We've,</v>

2175
01:16:40.011 --> 01:16:40.570
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2176
01:16:40.570 --> 01:16:43.320
<v Speaker 1>we're amazingly in depth in this.</v>

2177
01:16:43.321 --> 01:16:44.680
<v Speaker 1>This is so cool.</v>

2178
01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.170
<v Speaker 1>While universal ethic is important as it turns out.</v>

2179
01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:48.873
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2180
01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell just a brief story.</v>

2181
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2182
01:16:52.940 --> 01:16:53.480
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

2183
01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:54.313
<v Speaker 1>Because this is also,</v>

2184
01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:57.760
<v Speaker 1>this is also extremely important because it shows where the classical</v>

2185
01:16:57.761 --> 01:16:58.310
<v Speaker 1>economists,</v>

2186
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:59.980
<v Speaker 1>brief story,</v>

2187
01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:00.540
<v Speaker 1>brief,</v>

2188
01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.050
<v Speaker 1>brief Jordan Peterson.</v>

2189
01:17:02.230 --> 01:17:02.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2190
01:17:02.471 --> 01:17:02.890
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

2191
01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:03.191
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2192
01:17:03.191 --> 01:17:04.024
<v Speaker 1>It's not likely.</v>

2193
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:06.130
<v Speaker 1>So let's play a trading game.</v>

2194
01:17:06.131 --> 01:17:06.371
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2195
01:17:06.371 --> 01:17:08.020
<v Speaker 1>so you two can play this trading game.</v>

2196
01:17:08.021 --> 01:17:08.771
<v Speaker 1>So here's the deal.</v>

2197
01:17:08.771 --> 01:17:09.770
<v Speaker 1>It's very simple.</v>

2198
01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to give you $100.</v>

2199
01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm not actually,</v>

2200
01:17:12.381 --> 01:17:16.820
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to give you $100 and you can offer some of it to your partner in</v>

2201
01:17:16.821 --> 01:17:17.654
<v Speaker 1>the game.</v>

2202
01:17:17.690 --> 01:17:19.280
<v Speaker 1>But the rule is if she says no,</v>

2203
01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:23.630
<v Speaker 1>you don't get anything and neither does she and you only get to make one offer.</v>

2204
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.651
<v Speaker 1>So okay,</v>

2205
01:17:24.651 --> 01:17:25.520
<v Speaker 1>here's your hundred dollars.</v>

2206
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:26.480
<v Speaker 1>How much you can offer her?</v>

2207
01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:29.931
<v Speaker 1>40 okay.</v>

2208
01:17:29.931 --> 01:17:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Would you take 40 okay then now that's interesting.</v>

2209
01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:33.500
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2210
01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:33.951
<v Speaker 1>very good.</v>

2211
01:17:33.951 --> 01:17:34.784
<v Speaker 1>That's perfect.</v>

2212
01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:35.181
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2213
01:17:35.181 --> 01:17:36.680
<v Speaker 1>so first of all,</v>

2214
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:40.970
<v Speaker 1>the classic economic economist would say you should offer her a dollar.</v>

2215
01:17:41.810 --> 01:17:42.643
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2216
01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:43.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2217
01:17:43.251 --> 01:17:46.310
<v Speaker 1>because she might as well take a dollar cause she gets a dollar and you want to</v>

2218
01:17:46.311 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>maximize your own return.</v>

2219
01:17:47.541 --> 01:17:49.340
<v Speaker 1>So you get $99 it's like</v>

2220
01:17:51.140 --> 01:17:52.340
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you do that?</v>

2221
01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.500
<v Speaker 1>What happens is that is never what people do.</v>

2222
01:17:54.501 --> 01:17:59.150
<v Speaker 1>They usually offer approximately 50% and if they don't,</v>

2223
01:17:59.151 --> 01:18:00.470
<v Speaker 1>then the other person refuses.</v>

2224
01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:00.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2225
01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Now then you might think,</v>

2226
01:18:01.971 --> 01:18:02.091
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2227
01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 1>let's say matched a rich person,</v>

2228
01:18:03.891 --> 01:18:04.641
<v Speaker 1>a poor person,</v>

2229
01:18:04.641 --> 01:18:05.061
<v Speaker 1>and you said,</v>

2230
01:18:05.061 --> 01:18:05.360
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2231
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.630
<v Speaker 1>give the rich person a hundred and they offer the poor person a dollar.</v>

2232
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.320
<v Speaker 1>What is the poor person say?</v>

2233
01:18:10.321 --> 01:18:10.611
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

2234
01:18:10.611 --> 01:18:11.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2235
01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:11.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2236
01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:11.751
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2237
01:18:11.751 --> 01:18:12.411
<v Speaker 1>I need the dollar.</v>

2238
01:18:12.411 --> 01:18:13.071
<v Speaker 1>It's they say,</v>

2239
01:18:13.071 --> 01:18:13.311
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2240
01:18:13.311 --> 01:18:14.120
<v Speaker 1>go to hell.</v>

2241
01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:15.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it because,</v>

2242
01:18:15.380 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and they're more likely the poor person is more likely to refuse the lower offer</v>

2243
01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:23.360
<v Speaker 1>than a rich person is completely running completely contrary to the predictions</v>

2244
01:18:23.361 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 1>of classical economists.</v>

2245
01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:26.090
<v Speaker 1>You played that game across the world.</v>

2246
01:18:26.091 --> 01:18:28.200
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much 50 50 and I,</v>

2247
01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:31.610
<v Speaker 1>that's so interesting because it's another example of that emergent ethic.</v>

2248
01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:32.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2249
01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:32.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2250
01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:37.960
<v Speaker 1>part of the reason you'd say no and why no was correct is because you don't play</v>

2251
01:18:38.631 --> 01:18:39.464
<v Speaker 1>one trading game.</v>

2252
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:45.230
<v Speaker 1>You play a lifetime of trading games and the right answer to the question of how</v>

2253
01:18:45.231 --> 01:18:50.231
<v Speaker 1>to play a lifetime of trading games is to not settle for less than 50% money.</v>

2254
01:18:50.390 --> 01:18:54.860
<v Speaker 1>You could also make a case that if you're the giver rather than receiver,</v>

2255
01:18:55.220 --> 01:18:56.690
<v Speaker 1>if you're playing an iterated game,</v>

2256
01:18:56.870 --> 01:19:01.870
<v Speaker 1>you might want to offer $60 $60 because especially if your reputation is being</v>

2257
01:19:02.331 --> 01:19:03.164
<v Speaker 1>broadcast,</v>

2258
01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:08.500
<v Speaker 1>because let's say your goal isn't to get $40 which is what you'd be left if you</v>

2259
01:19:10.641 --> 01:19:14.570
<v Speaker 1>offered 60 your goal is to let everybody know that if they play with you,</v>

2260
01:19:15.020 --> 01:19:18.890
<v Speaker 1>you give them 60 and you get 40 and then what happens is like,</v>

2261
01:19:19.100 --> 01:19:22.100
<v Speaker 1>well let's take a vote on who wants to play with who.</v>

2262
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:25.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like you want to play with the person who offers the a 10 or do you want to</v>

2263
01:19:25.911 --> 01:19:30.110
<v Speaker 1>play with the person who offers you 60 and then the person who's a little more</v>

2264
01:19:30.111 --> 01:19:31.730
<v Speaker 1>generous than reciprocal.</v>

2265
01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:32.031
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2266
01:19:32.031 --> 01:19:33.440
<v Speaker 1>50 50 would be reciprocal.</v>

2267
01:19:33.441 --> 01:19:35.480
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should err on the side of generosity.</v>

2268
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Why easily easy people will line up to play with you.</v>

2269
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.330
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is,</v>

2270
01:19:41.331 --> 01:19:45.560
<v Speaker 1>do you want to win the game or do you want to win the set of games?</v>

2271
01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2272
01:19:46.790 --> 01:19:47.623
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

2273
01:19:47.690 --> 01:19:52.010
<v Speaker 1>I think there's rules that govern the set of all possible games and it's the</v>

2274
01:19:52.011 --> 01:19:55.400
<v Speaker 1>rules that govern the set of all possible games that constitutes something like</v>

2275
01:19:55.401 --> 01:19:56.234
<v Speaker 1>an emergent ethic.</v>

2276
01:19:56.810 --> 01:19:57.920
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

2277
01:19:57.921 --> 01:20:00.080
<v Speaker 1>so that's a very useful thing to know.</v>

2278
01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a very useful thing to know.</v>

2279
01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:02.690
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

2280
01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:06.890
<v Speaker 1>Can you give a couple quick ones of those potentially universal ethics that</v>

2281
01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.280
<v Speaker 1>govern the set of games?</v>

2282
01:20:08.550 --> 01:20:08.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2283
01:20:08.731 --> 01:20:09.031
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2284
01:20:09.031 --> 01:20:10.050
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the big one.</v>

2285
01:20:10.051 --> 01:20:10.380
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

2286
01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I think the big one is you approximate reciprocity,</v>

2287
01:20:13.381 --> 01:20:14.340
<v Speaker 1>but it would be better.</v>

2288
01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It'd be better if you can figure out how to,</v>

2289
01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:18.391
<v Speaker 1>I think you,</v>

2290
01:20:18.391 --> 01:20:22.050
<v Speaker 1>it's recept reciprocity with erring on the side of generosity because there's</v>

2291
01:20:22.051 --> 01:20:23.190
<v Speaker 1>just no downside to that.</v>

2292
01:20:23.191 --> 01:20:24.210
<v Speaker 1>In an iterated game.</v>

2293
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2294
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to borrow what I do when I grade papers with students for example,</v>

2295
01:20:28.381 --> 01:20:31.170
<v Speaker 1>is I grade them and then I had 5% it's like,</v>

2296
01:20:31.171 --> 01:20:31.381
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2297
01:20:31.381 --> 01:20:32.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe I made a mistake.</v>

2298
01:20:32.311 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 1>So I'll err on the side of generosity.</v>

2299
01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:35.450
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2300
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>And why not do that in your reciprocal interactions.</v>

2301
01:20:38.490 --> 01:20:40.770
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean you're letting people take advantage of you,</v>

2302
01:20:40.771 --> 01:20:40.981
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2303
01:20:40.981 --> 01:20:44.190
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of weakness in your negotiating strategy because there's no</v>

2304
01:20:44.191 --> 01:20:45.024
<v Speaker 1>excuse for that.</v>

2305
01:20:45.360 --> 01:20:45.840
<v Speaker 1>That's just,</v>

2306
01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.100
<v Speaker 1>that's a losing game that,</v>

2307
01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:52.540
<v Speaker 1>but if you could take 50% or 70% and you decide to be generous,</v>

2308
01:20:52.951 --> 01:20:53.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2309
01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:54.233
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2310
01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:58.830
<v Speaker 1>you still have to be awake so that you're not being messed about with by people</v>

2311
01:20:58.831 --> 01:21:01.260
<v Speaker 1>who are a little bit on the psychopathic and you know,</v>

2312
01:21:01.261 --> 01:21:03.540
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be foolish about it,</v>

2313
01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:06.690
<v Speaker 1>but reciprocal plus generous.</v>

2314
01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:08.550
<v Speaker 1>That's a hell of a good start.</v>

2315
01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:14.240
<v Speaker 1>So can we do quick dive into science and God because I want,</v>

2316
01:21:14.820 --> 01:21:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I want to know and quick</v>

2317
01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:21.931
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

2318
01:21:21.931 --> 01:21:22.770
<v Speaker 1>let's try.</v>

2319
01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:24.660
<v Speaker 1>So let's try</v>

2320
01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.230
<v Speaker 1>10 science sufficiently,</v>

2321
01:21:28.231 --> 01:21:31.260
<v Speaker 1>consistently self actualize humans.</v>

2322
01:21:33.120 --> 01:21:33.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2323
01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:33.990
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

2324
01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Let cause with,</v>

2325
01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:35.640
<v Speaker 1>with your,</v>

2326
01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.200
<v Speaker 1>with God,</v>

2327
01:21:37.410 --> 01:21:42.270
<v Speaker 1>with religion people find some sort of self actualization.</v>

2328
01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:48.920
<v Speaker 1>10 science be a source of self actualization or morality.</v>

2329
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 1>The way that we normally construe science.</v>

2330
01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at,</v>

2331
01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:54.470
<v Speaker 1>let,</v>

2332
01:21:54.470 --> 01:21:55.950
<v Speaker 1>let's make that concrete for,</v>

2333
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 1>for a minute.</v>

2334
01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:57.593
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2335
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.830
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

2336
01:21:58.830 --> 01:22:03.030
<v Speaker 1>when I teach my students my personality class and we concentrated a fair bit on</v>

2337
01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:04.650
<v Speaker 1>clinical theories because I'm a clinician,</v>

2338
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:10.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I make clear to them is that neither medicine nor clinical</v>

2339
01:22:10.531 --> 01:22:11.364
<v Speaker 1>psychology,</v>

2340
01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.660
<v Speaker 1>our sciences,</v>

2341
01:22:13.890 --> 01:22:14.723
<v Speaker 1>they're there,</v>

2342
01:22:15.060 --> 01:22:17.010
<v Speaker 1>they're variants of engineering.</v>

2343
01:22:17.850 --> 01:22:19.350
<v Speaker 1>They're attempting to build something.</v>

2344
01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:20.220
<v Speaker 1>There's an end in mind.</v>

2345
01:22:20.221 --> 01:22:21.420
<v Speaker 1>There's an ethical end in mind,</v>

2346
01:22:21.421 --> 01:22:21.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2347
01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:21.811
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2348
01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 1>what you do when you're a clinical psychologist is try to help people make their</v>

2349
01:22:24.781 --> 01:22:25.614
<v Speaker 1>lives better.</v>

2350
01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:26.551
<v Speaker 1>Or you might say,</v>

2351
01:22:26.551 --> 01:22:26.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2352
01:22:26.671 --> 01:22:28.410
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make them more mentally healthy,</v>

2353
01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:32.730
<v Speaker 1>but actually that's a weaker description then that you're trying to make their</v>

2354
01:22:32.731 --> 01:22:33.564
<v Speaker 1>lives better.</v>

2355
01:22:33.630 --> 01:22:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Because sometimes as a clinical psychologist,</v>

2356
01:22:35.491 --> 01:22:36.420
<v Speaker 1>you see people who are,</v>

2357
01:22:36.830 --> 01:22:37.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2358
01:22:37.110 --> 01:22:38.790
<v Speaker 1>they're normal in their health,</v>

2359
01:22:38.791 --> 01:22:40.350
<v Speaker 1>but they would like their lives to be better.</v>

2360
01:22:40.410 --> 01:22:42.100
<v Speaker 1>There's an op obviously there,</v>

2361
01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:42.580
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2362
01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:46.800
<v Speaker 1>and that introduces the ethical realm and you might be able to use scientific</v>

2363
01:22:46.860 --> 01:22:51.810
<v Speaker 1>techniques in order to determine which of the strategies you use to try to make</v>

2364
01:22:51.811 --> 01:22:53.250
<v Speaker 1>your life better are working.</v>

2365
01:22:53.730 --> 01:22:56.880
<v Speaker 1>But it's not obvious that you can use scientific principles to decide what</v>

2366
01:22:56.881 --> 01:22:58.440
<v Speaker 1>constitutes better to begin with.</v>

2367
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:59.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a big problem.</v>

2368
01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:01.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any evidence that you can,</v>

2369
01:23:01.891 --> 01:23:02.101
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2370
01:23:02.101 --> 01:23:03.540
<v Speaker 1>how about just science,</v>

2371
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.633
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

2372
01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:07.420
<v Speaker 1>morality from its purview at the methodological level?</v>

2373
01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2374
01:23:08.230 --> 01:23:08.471
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

2375
01:23:08.471 --> 01:23:13.471
<v Speaker 1>let's take an example of cancer and science solving suffering by providing</v>

2376
01:23:16.271 --> 01:23:17.320
<v Speaker 1>solutions to cancer.</v>

2377
01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:17.711
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2378
01:23:17.711 --> 01:23:17.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2379
01:23:17.951 --> 01:23:19.870
<v Speaker 1>should you devote money to cancer education?</v>

2380
01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:22.211
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2381
01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:22.391
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>

2382
01:23:22.391 --> 01:23:25.270
<v Speaker 1>that's where the problems start to come is that you can't,</v>

2383
01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:27.180
<v Speaker 1>you can't make an a priori decisions.</v>

2384
01:23:27.181 --> 01:23:30.250
<v Speaker 1>You can't make an informed decision about where the ethical,</v>

2385
01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:34.450
<v Speaker 1>where the scientific attention should focus itself.</v>

2386
01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy thing to do.</v>

2387
01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:36.701
<v Speaker 1>At some point,</v>

2388
01:23:36.701 --> 01:23:38.320
<v Speaker 1>the decisions have to be there,</v>

2389
01:23:38.321 --> 01:23:39.101
<v Speaker 1>either arbitrary,</v>

2390
01:23:39.101 --> 01:23:39.934
<v Speaker 1>they're made by,</v>

2391
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:43.510
<v Speaker 1>they're made by techniques that seem to be outside of the scientific purview.</v>

2392
01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

2393
01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:50.220
<v Speaker 1>So I read this book by an ex KGB agent who had detailed out some of the extent</v>

2394
01:23:51.431 --> 01:23:52.810
<v Speaker 1>of the Soviet,</v>

2395
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:53.783
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2396
01:23:54.010 --> 01:23:57.430
<v Speaker 1>biological warfare program back in the 1980s.</v>

2397
01:23:57.850 --> 01:24:01.330
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things the Soviet scientists were trying to do according to this</v>

2398
01:24:01.331 --> 01:24:03.100
<v Speaker 1>guy was to weaponize,</v>

2399
01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.333
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2400
01:24:04.660 --> 01:24:09.660
<v Speaker 1>biological infectious biological agents actually turns out to be harder than we</v>

2401
01:24:09.731 --> 01:24:10.564
<v Speaker 1>suspected,</v>

2402
01:24:11.170 --> 01:24:12.003
<v Speaker 1>thank God.</v>

2403
01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:12.910
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2404
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:13.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2405
01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:18.440
<v Speaker 1>what they were trying to do was cross smallpox with Ebola and it's because Ebola</v>

2406
01:24:18.441 --> 01:24:23.380
<v Speaker 1>is like seriously fatal and smallpox is seriously contagious.</v>

2407
01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:24.011
<v Speaker 1>And so they thought,</v>

2408
01:24:24.011 --> 01:24:24.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2409
01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:26.500
<v Speaker 1>seriously fatal plus seriously contagious.</v>

2410
01:24:26.501 --> 01:24:28.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like what could be better than that?</v>

2411
01:24:29.550 --> 01:24:29.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2412
01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:30.251
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2413
01:24:30.251 --> 01:24:31.084
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2414
01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:31.961
<v Speaker 1>and he might say,</v>

2415
01:24:31.961 --> 01:24:36.961
<v Speaker 1>well is crossing Ebola with smallpox if is seeing whether you can cross Ebola</v>

2416
01:24:38.321 --> 01:24:39.154
<v Speaker 1>with smallpox,</v>

2417
01:24:39.520 --> 01:24:43.420
<v Speaker 1>reasonable scientific question and appropriate scientific question and purely</v>

2418
01:24:43.421 --> 01:24:45.370
<v Speaker 1>from the perspective of science,</v>

2419
01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:46.413
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2420
01:24:46.990 --> 01:24:49.900
<v Speaker 1>science is a generic problem solving mechanism.</v>

2421
01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:51.131
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

2422
01:24:51.131 --> 01:24:52.660
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

2423
01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:56.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's not something any reasonable human being should ever engage in.</v>

2424
01:24:56.201 --> 01:25:00.820
<v Speaker 1>But that's not the same thing as asking whether or not it's a question within</v>

2425
01:25:00.821 --> 01:25:02.620
<v Speaker 1>the reasonable purview of science.</v>

2426
01:25:02.950 --> 01:25:07.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean the thing about science is that science was designed to be as value free</v>

2427
01:25:09.221 --> 01:25:10.840
<v Speaker 1>a methodology as possible.</v>

2428
01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.730
<v Speaker 1>It's designed for that.</v>

2429
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And so then people say,</v>

2430
01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:16.150
<v Speaker 1>well why is there a gap between science and values?</v>

2431
01:25:16.151 --> 01:25:16.481
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2432
01:25:16.481 --> 01:25:16.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2433
01:25:16.631 --> 01:25:18.220
<v Speaker 1>because it's built into the methodology.</v>

2434
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So it looks to me like you need something that's outside of science to direct</v>

2435
01:25:22.901 --> 01:25:23.350
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2436
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:24.183
<v Speaker 1>the ethic.</v>

2437
01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:26.710
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that something like stories,</v>

2438
01:25:27.050 --> 01:25:28.540
<v Speaker 1>what can come from within science,</v>

2439
01:25:28.541 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't see how,</v>

2440
01:25:30.220 --> 01:25:31.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean partly because it's,</v>

2441
01:25:31.301 --> 01:25:32.260
<v Speaker 1>it just glued the value.</v>

2442
01:25:32.261 --> 01:25:37.261
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the story of the cosmos already enough to get someone excited enough to</v>

2443
01:25:38.231 --> 01:25:43.231
<v Speaker 1>find some sort of value system from the being born from the stars and that being</v>

2444
01:25:44.291 --> 01:25:45.090
<v Speaker 1>inspirational?</v>

2445
01:25:45.090 --> 01:25:45.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2446
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:46.121
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>

2447
01:25:46.121 --> 01:25:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Because you can just as easily say,</v>

2448
01:25:47.771 --> 01:25:48.041
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2449
01:25:48.041 --> 01:25:48.311
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2450
01:25:48.311 --> 01:25:50.350
<v Speaker 1>here we are in this little dirt ball in the middle,</v>

2451
01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:50.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2452
01:25:50.651 --> 01:25:53.410
<v Speaker 1>and the outer edge of this galaxy that's rotating,</v>

2453
01:25:53.411 --> 01:25:57.010
<v Speaker 1>going to rotate pointlessly for the next 250 million years,</v>

2454
01:25:57.310 --> 01:25:58.143
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2455
01:25:58.330 --> 01:26:01.660
<v Speaker 1>a couple of dozen billion years before the heat death of the universe.</v>

2456
01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:06.320
<v Speaker 1>It's like that's pretty dismal accounting of the utility of life.</v>

2457
01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2458
01:26:07.010 --> 01:26:07.670
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2459
01:26:07.670 --> 01:26:11.180
<v Speaker 1>You can take you sure to hear what you have that entire,</v>

2460
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:14.810
<v Speaker 1>you have that entire range of interpretive possibilities from like,</v>

2461
01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:17.960
<v Speaker 1>isn't life remarkable and wonderful and too,</v>

2462
01:26:17.961 --> 01:26:19.910
<v Speaker 1>isn't it bloody pointless if you,</v>

2463
01:26:19.911 --> 01:26:21.430
<v Speaker 1>if you look at it from the wrong temporary,</v>

2464
01:26:21.530 --> 01:26:23.330
<v Speaker 1>I can find that from science.</v>

2465
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.171
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

2466
01:26:24.171 --> 01:26:24.441
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2467
01:26:24.441 --> 01:26:26.090
<v Speaker 1>but you can also find the reverse.</v>

2468
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:27.350
<v Speaker 1>So that's the problem.</v>

2469
01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm not anti scientific,</v>

2470
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:30.560
<v Speaker 1>but I don't,</v>

2471
01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't see a simple way of solving the problem of,</v>

2472
01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:35.613
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2473
01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:38.690
<v Speaker 1>of the ethical direction of the scientific inquiry.</v>

2474
01:26:38.691 --> 01:26:40.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean you don't do it.</v>

2475
01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:45.680
<v Speaker 1>What comes to mind maybe as a way to to get to that area?</v>

2476
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:47.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2477
01:26:47.090 --> 01:26:50.060
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I talked about in detail with Sam Harris,</v>

2478
01:26:50.061 --> 01:26:53.750
<v Speaker 1>and we're going to talk about this some more because it's by no means solved is</v>

2479
01:26:53.751 --> 01:26:57.170
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between facts and values and the old idea,</v>

2480
01:26:57.171 --> 01:26:57.890
<v Speaker 1>Hume's ideas,</v>

2481
01:26:57.890 --> 01:27:00.020
<v Speaker 1>you can't derive values from a set of fact.</v>

2482
01:27:00.620 --> 01:27:02.750
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's sort of right.</v>

2483
01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:03.380
<v Speaker 1>But I do,</v>

2484
01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I kind of think it's more complicated than Hume thought it was,</v>

2485
01:27:07.161 --> 01:27:10.760
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not exactly sure why because like I made a case earlier about this</v>

2486
01:27:10.761 --> 01:27:15.380
<v Speaker 1>emergent ethic arising out of out of out of eight are rated games.</v>

2487
01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:19.100
<v Speaker 1>That kind of looks like a scientific observation about the origin of morality</v>

2488
01:27:19.430 --> 01:27:20.300
<v Speaker 1>and something like that.</v>

2489
01:27:20.301 --> 01:27:22.970
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like science can't inform your moral decisions,</v>

2490
01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:27.530
<v Speaker 1>but exactly how that might come about is by no means a straight forward issue.</v>

2491
01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.393
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

2492
01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:29.870
<v Speaker 1>well it's also not the case.</v>

2493
01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.960
<v Speaker 1>It is also not self evident that science has served a beneficial function for</v>

2494
01:27:36.981 --> 01:27:37.814
<v Speaker 1>human beings.</v>

2495
01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Like it might be the case,</v>

2496
01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:40.311
<v Speaker 1>it could be the case.</v>

2497
01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:40.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2498
01:27:40.491 --> 01:27:40.731
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2499
01:27:40.731 --> 01:27:43.670
<v Speaker 1>we're pretty comfortable here and thank God and that's definitely a consequence</v>

2500
01:27:43.671 --> 01:27:44.900
<v Speaker 1>of the scientific revolution.</v>

2501
01:27:44.901 --> 01:27:45.320
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2502
01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:45.740
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2503
01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:47.870
<v Speaker 1>highlighted your phone as a major,</v>

2504
01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:52.430
<v Speaker 1>but one good hydrogen bomb blown up over North America would set us back about</v>

2505
01:27:53.330 --> 01:27:54.560
<v Speaker 1>50,000 years.</v>

2506
01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:58.070
<v Speaker 1>And that could easily happen if I was a paranoid dictator.</v>

2507
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.290
<v Speaker 1>That's certainly what I would do.</v>

2508
01:28:01.270 --> 01:28:01.761
<v Speaker 1>And I know you,</v>

2509
01:28:01.761 --> 01:28:02.594
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2510
01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:06.740
<v Speaker 1>most of you guys probably know what would happen if you blow up a hydrogen bomb.</v>

2511
01:28:07.010 --> 01:28:08.720
<v Speaker 1>I think it's about 150 miles up,</v>

2512
01:28:08.721 --> 01:28:09.530
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2513
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:10.363
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

2514
01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.200
<v Speaker 1>you get an electromagnetic pulse,</v>

2515
01:28:12.201 --> 01:28:13.610
<v Speaker 1>it takes all the electronics out,</v>

2516
01:28:14.210 --> 01:28:15.043
<v Speaker 1>like all of them,</v>

2517
01:28:15.980 --> 01:28:16.813
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2518
01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:18.260
<v Speaker 1>One bomb.</v>

2519
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:20.180
<v Speaker 1>And so like maybe we'll manage that,</v>

2520
01:28:20.181 --> 01:28:21.014
<v Speaker 1>but it wouldn't.</v>

2521
01:28:21.110 --> 01:28:21.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2522
01:28:21.680 --> 01:28:25.310
<v Speaker 1>maybe we'll manage that transition to whatever we're going to do next,</v>

2523
01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.600
<v Speaker 1>but I wouldn't count on it.</v>

2524
01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:32.080
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't even necessarily the case that scientific endeavor is a pro</v>

2525
01:28:33.650 --> 01:28:37.610
<v Speaker 1>human life process and he's in what we do with it.</v>

2526
01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:42.230
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that's why you said earlier that it's important now more than ever to</v>

2527
01:28:42.231 --> 01:28:47.231
<v Speaker 1>have these conversations about the future of humanity and where are we going?</v>

2528
01:28:48.141 --> 01:28:49.550
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to do this together?</v>

2529
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:51.320
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>

2530
01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:51.681
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

2531
01:28:51.681 --> 01:28:54.770
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about just ending it off with mutual exploration.</v>

2532
01:28:54.771 --> 01:28:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I really thought this was interesting and the intellectual dark web is a really</v>

2533
01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:00.020
<v Speaker 1>good example of this,</v>

2534
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:02.160
<v Speaker 1>which you are a main pillar</v>

2535
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.000
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>

2536
01:29:03.001 --> 01:29:03.834
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion.</v>

2537
01:29:04.140 --> 01:29:09.140
<v Speaker 3>So let's say that two people are having a conversation and they're reducing</v>

2538
01:29:10.141 --> 01:29:10.920
<v Speaker 3>their points.</v>

2539
01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.620
<v Speaker 3>There may be keeping it to a straight binary.</v>

2540
01:29:13.621 --> 01:29:17.520
<v Speaker 3>We see a lot of political polarization that's occurring today and United States</v>

2541
01:29:17.521 --> 01:29:22.521
<v Speaker 3>politics finding a lot of the beauty and the nuance of conversation when you</v>

2542
01:29:24.331 --> 01:29:29.331
<v Speaker 3>take complex position and you may be stay economists rather than become</v>

2543
01:29:30.061 --> 01:29:30.894
<v Speaker 3>agitated.</v>

2544
01:29:31.350 --> 01:29:31.860
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

2545
01:29:31.860 --> 01:29:35.580
<v Speaker 3>all of these things tend to drive better conversations.</v>

2546
01:29:35.581 --> 01:29:38.970
<v Speaker 3>And it seems as though you're leading that forefront.</v>

2547
01:29:39.250 --> 01:29:40.170
<v Speaker 3>What what,</v>

2548
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:45.500
<v Speaker 3>what do you see in that sort of path that we're walking of figuring out how to</v>

2549
01:29:45.571 --> 01:29:46.740
<v Speaker 3>have better conversations?</v>

2550
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:50.333
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

2551
01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:53.400
<v Speaker 3>I write about this a fair bit and 12 rules for life.</v>

2552
01:29:53.401 --> 01:29:54.121
<v Speaker 3>There's a chapter,</v>

2553
01:29:54.121 --> 01:29:55.500
<v Speaker 3>I think it's chapter nine.</v>

2554
01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:56.543
<v Speaker 3>I think that's right.</v>

2555
01:29:56.800 --> 01:29:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Assuming that the person that you're listening to know something you don't,</v>

2556
01:30:00.570 --> 01:30:05.220
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of a derivation of some of some things that I learned from Carl Rogers</v>

2557
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:07.020
<v Speaker 3>who was a great clinician,</v>

2558
01:30:07.021 --> 01:30:08.430
<v Speaker 3>great 20th century clinician,</v>

2559
01:30:08.810 --> 01:30:12.180
<v Speaker 3>his star sort of rose during the 1960s he was a humanist,</v>

2560
01:30:12.660 --> 01:30:14.700
<v Speaker 3>he was a Christian missionary when he was a kid,</v>

2561
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:19.500
<v Speaker 3>but he dropped that and he became a leading light humanistic psychology and he</v>

2562
01:30:19.501 --> 01:30:24.501
<v Speaker 3>was really interested in the preconditions for therapeutic conversation and he</v>

2563
01:30:24.721 --> 01:30:25.554
<v Speaker 3>thought that,</v>

2564
01:30:26.070 --> 01:30:26.903
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2565
01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:32.570
<v Speaker 3>if you are going to engage in the process of therapy with a client that the</v>

2566
01:30:32.941 --> 01:30:37.941
<v Speaker 3>client had to bring to the session before he or she arrived,</v>

2567
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:41.550
<v Speaker 3>the willingness to make things better,</v>

2568
01:30:41.670 --> 01:30:42.630
<v Speaker 3>that would be the first thing.</v>

2569
01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2570
01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:43.621
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2571
01:30:43.621 --> 01:30:44.454
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

2572
01:30:44.490 --> 01:30:47.760
<v Speaker 3>and I've done therapy that was court mandated.</v>

2573
01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:48.330
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2574
01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't recommend that.</v>

2575
01:30:49.530 --> 01:30:50.940
<v Speaker 3>That just doesn't work very well,</v>

2576
01:30:51.240 --> 01:30:51.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2577
01:30:51.451 --> 01:30:53.220
<v Speaker 3>cause you can't force someone to be better.</v>

2578
01:30:53.790 --> 01:30:57.510
<v Speaker 3>They have to kind of come already thinking that there's a bunch of things they</v>

2579
01:30:57.511 --> 01:31:00.750
<v Speaker 3>don't know and that their life could be better than it already is.</v>

2580
01:31:00.920 --> 01:31:05.250
<v Speaker 3>And that's a good position to take when you're engaging in a conversation with</v>

2581
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:05.551
<v Speaker 3>someone.</v>

2582
01:31:05.551 --> 01:31:06.384
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2583
01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:06.751
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2584
01:31:06.751 --> 01:31:07.860
<v Speaker 3>if you already know enough,</v>

2585
01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:09.571
<v Speaker 3>more power to you,</v>

2586
01:31:09.571 --> 01:31:10.404
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2587
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:11.393
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2588
01:31:11.820 --> 01:31:14.190
<v Speaker 3>but if you're suffering more than you think is necessary,</v>

2589
01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:16.470
<v Speaker 3>which is like a highly probable or,</v>

2590
01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.570
<v Speaker 3>or more than you think is desirable,</v>

2591
01:31:19.050 --> 01:31:22.050
<v Speaker 3>which basically means if you're suffering more than you think is desirable,</v>

2592
01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:25.230
<v Speaker 3>that means that you're way more ignorant than you need to be.</v>

2593
01:31:25.710 --> 01:31:26.041
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2594
01:31:26.041 --> 01:31:26.791
<v Speaker 3>That's what it means.</v>

2595
01:31:26.791 --> 01:31:28.200
<v Speaker 3>Because maybe you have an illness,</v>

2596
01:31:28.201 --> 01:31:29.160
<v Speaker 3>you don't know how to cure it.</v>

2597
01:31:29.610 --> 01:31:31.770
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're having a fight with someone you don't how to get out of it.</v>

2598
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:34.800
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you're failing at work and you don't know what to do about it.</v>

2599
01:31:34.801 --> 01:31:38.250
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're ignorant and no wonder because people are ignorant and so you</v>

2600
01:31:38.251 --> 01:31:38.731
<v Speaker 3>might think,</v>

2601
01:31:38.731 --> 01:31:38.911
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2602
01:31:38.911 --> 01:31:42.180
<v Speaker 3>unless everything is just the way you want it to be,</v>

2603
01:31:42.930 --> 01:31:45.150
<v Speaker 3>then you have something to learn and then you think,</v>

2604
01:31:45.151 --> 01:31:46.710
<v Speaker 3>well maybe the person you're talking to,</v>

2605
01:31:47.160 --> 01:31:48.180
<v Speaker 3>no matter how</v>

2606
01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:54.180
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable you are with their opinions and how bent out of shape you think</v>

2607
01:31:54.181 --> 01:31:54.481
<v Speaker 3>they are,</v>

2608
01:31:54.481 --> 01:31:57.570
<v Speaker 3>maybe even how bent out of shape they actually are.</v>

2609
01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:00.880
<v Speaker 3>There's always the possibility that if you are actually engaged in a</v>

2610
01:32:00.881 --> 01:32:01.714
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

2611
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:04.920
<v Speaker 3>you ask them questions and you tried to figure out what they thought that you'd</v>

2612
01:32:04.930 --> 01:32:08.830
<v Speaker 3>come away with one crumb of knowledge more than you had when you went into the</v>

2613
01:32:08.831 --> 01:32:09.601
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>

2614
01:32:09.601 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 3>And like conversations like that are a lot more interesting.</v>

2615
01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:13.653
<v Speaker 3>Guy Founded my,</v>

2616
01:32:13.860 --> 01:32:13.990
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2617
01:32:13.990 --> 01:32:16.270
<v Speaker 3>I've probably done 20,000 hours of clinical work,</v>

2618
01:32:16.271 --> 01:32:16.991
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2619
01:32:16.991 --> 01:32:19.420
<v Speaker 3>And so that's 20,000 hours of really,</v>

2620
01:32:19.570 --> 01:32:20.111
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2621
01:32:20.111 --> 01:32:20.920
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>

2622
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.900
<v Speaker 3>really serious conversations.</v>

2623
01:32:23.290 --> 01:32:26.050
<v Speaker 3>And they're almost always interesting beyond belief.</v>

2624
01:32:26.290 --> 01:32:26.561
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2625
01:32:26.561 --> 01:32:30.190
<v Speaker 3>I've had clients that I told you already that sort of span the entire spectrum</v>

2626
01:32:30.191 --> 01:32:35.191
<v Speaker 3>from people who were so impaired cognitively and behaviorally that while they</v>

2627
01:32:35.441 --> 01:32:38.140
<v Speaker 3>were utterly unemployable by any,</v>

2628
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:43.060
<v Speaker 3>any reasonable standards to people who were unbelievably high functioning,</v>

2629
01:32:43.061 --> 01:32:44.980
<v Speaker 3>and I found working with all of them,</v>

2630
01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:45.851
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

2631
01:32:45.851 --> 01:32:47.680
<v Speaker 3>if I'm in the zone properly,</v>

2632
01:32:47.681 --> 01:32:52.681
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculously fascinating because people are ridiculously interesting and so</v>

2633
01:32:53.110 --> 01:32:53.610
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2634
01:32:53.610 --> 01:32:58.610
<v Speaker 3>and everyone has their own characteristic experience that's actually unique.</v>

2635
01:32:59.170 --> 01:33:02.380
<v Speaker 3>And so if you have a real conversation with someone and they tell you what's</v>

2636
01:33:02.381 --> 01:33:03.760
<v Speaker 3>unique about their experience,</v>

2637
01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:08.030
<v Speaker 3>the probability that you can learn something from that is it's lots,</v>

2638
01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:09.610
<v Speaker 3>it's certain that you can mind.</v>

2639
01:33:09.850 --> 01:33:11.170
<v Speaker 3>My Low Iq clients,</v>

2640
01:33:11.171 --> 01:33:11.471
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>

2641
01:33:11.471 --> 01:33:12.400
<v Speaker 3>they taught me so much.</v>

2642
01:33:12.401 --> 01:33:16.180
<v Speaker 3>It's just they taught me how difficult things were first,</v>

2643
01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:17.111
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2644
01:33:17.111 --> 01:33:22.111
<v Speaker 3>because to see someone struggle with the task that the typical person can do</v>

2645
01:33:22.691 --> 01:33:27.691
<v Speaker 3>without even thinking sheds light on exactly how amazing it is that that normal</v>

2646
01:33:28.661 --> 01:33:32.950
<v Speaker 3>people can do that and how hard it is when when you were impaired to the point</v>

2647
01:33:32.951 --> 01:33:36.910
<v Speaker 3>where those sorts of normal behaviors become become impossible.</v>

2648
01:33:37.090 --> 01:33:38.080
<v Speaker 3>It's so enlightening.</v>

2649
01:33:38.081 --> 01:33:39.700
<v Speaker 3>It teaches you a lot about the world.</v>

2650
01:33:39.701 --> 01:33:44.701
<v Speaker 3>And so I think part of the reason that youtube is killing television is partly</v>

2651
01:33:45.641 --> 01:33:47.980
<v Speaker 3>because it's technologically advantageous.</v>

2652
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.940
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2653
01:33:48.940 --> 01:33:49.990
<v Speaker 3>make no mistake about it.</v>

2654
01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:52.570
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that TV can do that youtube can't do.</v>

2655
01:33:52.960 --> 01:33:56.380
<v Speaker 3>And there's a whole bunch of things that youtube can do.</v>

2656
01:33:56.381 --> 01:33:57.430
<v Speaker 3>The TV cat.</v>

2657
01:33:57.490 --> 01:33:59.440
<v Speaker 3>So it's obvious which one is going to win.</v>

2658
01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:04.800
<v Speaker 3>But what's also interesting about it is that there seems to be a massive and</v>

2659
01:34:05.620 --> 01:34:09.580
<v Speaker 3>relatively untapped market for actual conversation.</v>

2660
01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:15.240
<v Speaker 3>And it's because conversation is between people of goodwill who are trying to</v>

2661
01:34:16.571 --> 01:34:17.404
<v Speaker 3>tell the truth.</v>

2662
01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:21.190
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to aim at making things better is unbelievably valuable.</v>

2663
01:34:21.550 --> 01:34:22.030
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2664
01:34:22.030 --> 01:34:22.950
<v Speaker 3>at least in principle,</v>

2665
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:24.070
<v Speaker 3>that's what we're all doing here,</v>

2666
01:34:24.071 --> 01:34:24.281
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2667
01:34:24.281 --> 01:34:24.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2668
01:34:24.910 --> 01:34:26.150
<v Speaker 3>even though you know,</v>

2669
01:34:26.770 --> 01:34:27.910
<v Speaker 3>you guys aren't talking,</v>

2670
01:34:28.290 --> 01:34:29.020
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2671
01:34:29.020 --> 01:34:30.850
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't mean this isn't a conversation.</v>

2672
01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:31.721
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2673
01:34:31.721 --> 01:34:32.830
<v Speaker 3>it's first of all,</v>

2674
01:34:32.831 --> 01:34:37.510
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to pay attention to you at least enough to see if everyone is</v>

2675
01:34:37.511 --> 01:34:39.190
<v Speaker 3>engaged in the conversation.</v>

2676
01:34:39.370 --> 01:34:40.870
<v Speaker 3>If you're not engaged in it,</v>

2677
01:34:40.871 --> 01:34:42.400
<v Speaker 3>then it would be completely pointless.</v>

2678
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.731
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2679
01:34:42.731 --> 01:34:44.650
<v Speaker 3>And you want to take them into your experiment.</v>

2680
01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:45.430
<v Speaker 3>That was amazing.</v>

2681
01:34:45.430 --> 01:34:45.761
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2682
01:34:45.761 --> 01:34:48.850
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I learned in my clinical practice is that if the conversation</v>

2683
01:34:48.851 --> 01:34:49.601
<v Speaker 3>was an interesting,</v>

2684
01:34:49.601 --> 01:34:50.680
<v Speaker 3>then I was doing it wrong.</v>

2685
01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:51.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2686
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.761
<v Speaker 3>it's great.</v>

2687
01:34:51.761 --> 01:34:53.110
<v Speaker 3>It's just that,</v>

2688
01:34:53.111 --> 01:34:54.340
<v Speaker 3>and that's a really cool thing too.</v>

2689
01:34:54.341 --> 01:34:57.070
<v Speaker 3>I think that also speaks to this idea of a universal ethic.</v>

2690
01:34:57.320 --> 01:34:58.130
<v Speaker 3>I've really become</v>

2691
01:34:58.130 --> 01:34:58.671
<v Speaker 1>interested,</v>

2692
01:34:58.671 --> 01:35:00.980
<v Speaker 1>I talked about this with Ian McGilchrist recently.</v>

2693
01:35:00.981 --> 01:35:02.570
<v Speaker 1>I just released that video today.</v>

2694
01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:03.553
<v Speaker 1>But what was up,</v>

2695
01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.820
<v Speaker 1>we could go on a different site.</v>

2696
01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.700
<v Speaker 1>I Bierly become interested in the idea that the sense of engagement of</v>

2697
01:35:10.701 --> 01:35:14.600
<v Speaker 1>meaningful engagement is the deepest of cognitive instincts.</v>

2698
01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:18.350
<v Speaker 1>I actually think you could make a very strong neuro biological case for that and</v>

2699
01:35:18.890 --> 01:35:21.890
<v Speaker 1>that if you're engaged in something,</v>

2700
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:25.610
<v Speaker 1>what it means is that you're safe and secure on the one hand,</v>

2701
01:35:25.611 --> 01:35:28.490
<v Speaker 1>sufficiently safe and secure your in your domain of competence,</v>

2702
01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.140
<v Speaker 1>which is a good place to be.</v>

2703
01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:30.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2704
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 1>it's like explored territory.</v>

2705
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:34.760
<v Speaker 1>So you're with within the walls where you're safe,</v>

2706
01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 1>but you're also peering over the fence and at the same time,</v>

2707
01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:37.611
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2708
01:35:37.611 --> 01:35:38.960
<v Speaker 1>So if you're engaged,</v>

2709
01:35:38.961 --> 01:35:41.180
<v Speaker 1>what it means is that you're in your domain of competence,</v>

2710
01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:44.480
<v Speaker 1>but you're operating within that domain of competence so that you're expanding</v>

2711
01:35:44.481 --> 01:35:45.980
<v Speaker 1>your competence at the same time.</v>

2712
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:48.440
<v Speaker 1>And so you feel that as meaningfully engage,</v>

2713
01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:49.880
<v Speaker 1>meaningfully engaging.</v>

2714
01:35:50.120 --> 01:35:50.953
<v Speaker 1>And it is.</v>

2715
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.380
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

2716
01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:55.910
<v Speaker 1>and I do also think that that sense of meaningful engagement is the right</v>

2717
01:35:55.911 --> 01:35:57.440
<v Speaker 1>antidote to the suffering.</v>

2718
01:35:57.441 --> 01:35:57.890
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2719
01:35:57.890 --> 01:35:58.310
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

2720
01:35:58.310 --> 01:36:01.070
<v Speaker 1>that's part and parcel of our limited existence.</v>

2721
01:36:01.071 --> 01:36:04.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like you need an antidote to the fact that life is suffering and the,</v>

2722
01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:08.720
<v Speaker 1>the experience of meaningful engagement I think is that antidote.</v>

2723
01:36:08.721 --> 01:36:13.610
<v Speaker 1>And I also think that the experience of meaningful engagement is a marker that</v>

2724
01:36:13.611 --> 01:36:14.180
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

2725
01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.180
<v Speaker 1>where you should be doing what you should be at the right time.</v>

2726
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the deepest of cognitive instincts.</v>

2727
01:36:19.700 --> 01:36:21.110
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really cool man.</v>

2728
01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:22.070
<v Speaker 1>If that was true,</v>

2729
01:36:22.190 --> 01:36:23.420
<v Speaker 1>I think it's actually true.</v>

2730
01:36:23.930 --> 01:36:25.400
<v Speaker 1>So if you bring something,</v>

2731
01:36:25.401 --> 01:36:26.270
<v Speaker 1>if that was true,</v>

2732
01:36:26.271 --> 01:36:27.104
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2733
01:36:27.170 --> 01:36:27.620
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2734
01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:28.453
<v Speaker 1>but I think it is.</v>

2735
01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:32.300
<v Speaker 1>So when we're trying to see if it works and that state of flow,</v>

2736
01:36:32.301 --> 01:36:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you lose a sense of time.</v>

2737
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:34.101
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2738
01:36:34.101 --> 01:36:36.470
<v Speaker 1>When you lose your self consciousness too as well.</v>

2739
01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:38.930
<v Speaker 1>So that's something that's worth thinking.</v>

2740
01:36:38.931 --> 01:36:41.960
<v Speaker 1>But I would also consider that a primary religious experience.</v>

2741
01:36:42.410 --> 01:36:43.280
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

2742
01:36:43.281 --> 01:36:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2743
01:36:43.730 --> 01:36:44.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2744
01:36:44.001 --> 01:36:47.330
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about science and religion earlier and like there's a bunch of</v>

2745
01:36:47.331 --> 01:36:50.330
<v Speaker 1>questions that we need to address pretty seriously about that too.</v>

2746
01:36:50.331 --> 01:36:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Because the scientific kind of atheist types,</v>

2747
01:36:53.660 --> 01:36:53.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2748
01:36:53.871 --> 01:36:55.670
<v Speaker 1>they're very down on the idea of religion.</v>

2749
01:36:55.671 --> 01:36:58.640
<v Speaker 1>But that's a very bad idea because religion is a human universal,</v>

2750
01:36:59.510 --> 01:36:59.990
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2751
01:36:59.990 --> 01:37:01.550
<v Speaker 1>And religious experience.</v>

2752
01:37:01.551 --> 01:37:03.050
<v Speaker 1>People have religious experiences.</v>

2753
01:37:03.051 --> 01:37:05.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like at the minimum we need an explanation for that.</v>

2754
01:37:05.421 --> 01:37:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Plus you can induce them,</v>

2755
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:08.203
<v Speaker 1>which is also,</v>

2756
01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:08.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2757
01:37:08.841 --> 01:37:09.231
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

2758
01:37:09.231 --> 01:37:10.910
<v Speaker 1>you can't just write that off.</v>

2759
01:37:10.911 --> 01:37:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Like you can induce religious experiences.</v>

2760
01:37:12.861 --> 01:37:15.410
<v Speaker 1>I can be intertwined with that spiritual as well.</v>

2761
01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2762
01:37:15.890 --> 01:37:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2763
01:37:16.580 --> 01:37:17.001
<v Speaker 1>Religious,</v>

2764
01:37:17.001 --> 01:37:17.780
<v Speaker 1>spiritual.</v>

2765
01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:18.613
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2766
01:37:18.710 --> 01:37:19.011
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

2767
01:37:19.011 --> 01:37:19.610
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2768
01:37:19.610 --> 01:37:20.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not just conceptual.</v>

2769
01:37:21.050 --> 01:37:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2770
01:37:21.290 --> 01:37:21.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2771
01:37:21.501 --> 01:37:21.951
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

2772
01:37:21.951 --> 01:37:22.131
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2773
01:37:22.131 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 1>there's this spiritual realm.</v>

2774
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:24.740
<v Speaker 1>It's deeply experiential.</v>

2775
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:27.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to be Jordan,</v>

2776
01:37:27.980 --> 01:37:29.510
<v Speaker 1>are we in a computer simulation?</v>

2777
01:37:30.100 --> 01:37:30.933
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

2778
01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:34.873
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2779
01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:35.631
<v Speaker 1>if we are,</v>

2780
01:37:35.631 --> 01:37:38.210
<v Speaker 1>it's within a computer that we don't understand.</v>

2781
01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2782
01:37:39.450 --> 01:37:42.590
<v Speaker 1>I look at questions like that or are strange because,</v>

2783
01:37:42.910 --> 01:37:43.743
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2784
01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:45.680
<v Speaker 1>welcome to simulation.</v>

2785
01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:46.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2786
01:37:46.700 --> 01:37:47.620
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's,</v>

2787
01:37:47.780 --> 01:37:52.780
<v Speaker 1>it's like asking whether you can reduce consciousness to material to material</v>

2788
01:37:53.091 --> 01:37:53.924
<v Speaker 1>substrate.</v>

2789
01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:54.980
<v Speaker 3>And the answer to that is,</v>

2790
01:37:56.030 --> 01:38:00.770
<v Speaker 3>but by the time we reduced consciousness to its material substrate,</v>

2791
01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.800
<v Speaker 3>our understanding of what that material substrate is,</v>

2792
01:38:03.801 --> 01:38:07.130
<v Speaker 3>we'll have transformed so dramatically that it won't look very much like the</v>

2793
01:38:07.131 --> 01:38:09.140
<v Speaker 3>material substrate that we presume now.</v>

2794
01:38:09.141 --> 01:38:11.060
<v Speaker 3>And so if we're in a simulation,</v>

2795
01:38:11.061 --> 01:38:16.061
<v Speaker 3>then it's within the confines of a mechanism that we can't easily assimilate to</v>

2796
01:38:16.481 --> 01:38:18.220
<v Speaker 3>our own computational devices.</v>

2797
01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:23.680
<v Speaker 3>And then of course the other question like that as well,</v>

2798
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:26.730
<v Speaker 3>we've already defined this as reality.</v>

2799
01:38:26.731 --> 01:38:28.050
<v Speaker 3>And so his reality,</v>

2800
01:38:28.051 --> 01:38:28.890
<v Speaker 3>a simulation,</v>

2801
01:38:28.891 --> 01:38:29.071
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

2802
01:38:29.071 --> 01:38:29.311
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2803
01:38:29.311 --> 01:38:30.080
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2804
01:38:30.080 --> 01:38:31.400
<v Speaker 3>by definition it's not.</v>

2805
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:33.350
<v Speaker 3>It's you might say,</v>

2806
01:38:33.351 --> 01:38:33.501
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2807
01:38:33.501 --> 01:38:36.620
<v Speaker 3>the simulation can get so real that you can't distinguish it from reality.</v>

2808
01:38:37.060 --> 01:38:37.893
<v Speaker 3>You start to</v>

2809
01:38:39.680 --> 01:38:44.680
<v Speaker 3>almost all questions of the form is a B devolve down to it depends on how you</v>

2810
01:38:48.221 --> 01:38:49.360
<v Speaker 3>define a and B.</v>

2811
01:38:49.620 --> 01:38:53.160
<v Speaker 3>Because the problem with questions like that is it decontextualizes the terms,</v>

2812
01:38:53.161 --> 01:38:53.401
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2813
01:38:53.401 --> 01:38:53.970
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2814
01:38:53.970 --> 01:38:54.121
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2815
01:38:54.121 --> 01:38:55.200
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean by reality?</v>

2816
01:38:55.620 --> 01:38:56.850
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by simulation?</v>

2817
01:38:57.210 --> 01:38:57.301
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2818
01:38:57.301 --> 01:38:59.280
<v Speaker 3>if you mean the same thing by both of them,</v>

2819
01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:00.480
<v Speaker 3>then they're the same thing.</v>

2820
01:39:00.660 --> 01:39:02.550
<v Speaker 3>If you mean different things by both of them,</v>

2821
01:39:02.670 --> 01:39:03.900
<v Speaker 3>then there are different things.</v>

2822
01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:04.973
<v Speaker 3>And so</v>

2823
01:39:06.210 --> 01:39:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I'm serious about that.</v>

2824
01:39:07.290 --> 01:39:12.290
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

2825
01:39:12.560 --> 01:39:17.480
<v Speaker 3>well most of the time you can't pull single terms out of a conversational stream</v>

2826
01:39:17.690 --> 01:39:22.570
<v Speaker 3>and assumed that the term has a bounded definition that's self evident using</v>

2827
01:39:22.571 --> 01:39:23.500
<v Speaker 3>only that term.</v>

2828
01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:25.360
<v Speaker 3>Because when we converse it's like,</v>

2829
01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:28.190
<v Speaker 3>well you utter a stream of words.</v>

2830
01:39:28.191 --> 01:39:28.551
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2831
01:39:28.551 --> 01:39:29.600
<v Speaker 3>well what are the words mean?</v>

2832
01:39:30.340 --> 01:39:32.110
<v Speaker 3>It depends on where they are in the phrase.</v>

2833
01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:34.140
<v Speaker 3>It depends on where they are in the sentence.</v>

2834
01:39:34.141 --> 01:39:36.540
<v Speaker 3>It depends on where the sentence is located in the paragraph.</v>

2835
01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:39.670
<v Speaker 3>It depends on the context within which the paragraph is uttered.</v>

2836
01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:43.500
<v Speaker 3>And you triangulate all of that simultaneously.</v>

2837
01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Extract out the meaning of the word.</v>

2838
01:39:45.740 --> 01:39:47.030
<v Speaker 3>And then if you take a word out,</v>

2839
01:39:47.031 --> 01:39:48.710
<v Speaker 3>like it's a thing and another word out,</v>

2840
01:39:48.711 --> 01:39:49.371
<v Speaker 3>like it's a thing.</v>

2841
01:39:49.371 --> 01:39:49.791
<v Speaker 3>And you say,</v>

2842
01:39:49.791 --> 01:39:51.260
<v Speaker 3>are these two things the same?</v>

2843
01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:55.340
<v Speaker 3>You're acting as if those words can be decontextualized and they have absolute</v>

2844
01:39:55.341 --> 01:39:58.190
<v Speaker 3>meaning in their decontextualize state and they don't.</v>

2845
01:39:58.620 --> 01:39:59.453
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2846
01:40:00.180 --> 01:40:01.013
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2847
01:40:01.150 --> 01:40:05.970
<v Speaker 3>so usually those questions I would say in some sense or philosophically are</v>

2848
01:40:05.971 --> 01:40:07.410
<v Speaker 3>philosophically untenable.</v>

2849
01:40:07.810 --> 01:40:08.643
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2850
01:40:08.970 --> 01:40:09.211
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

2851
01:40:09.211 --> 01:40:10.270
<v Speaker 3>well that's the answer to that.</v>

2852
01:40:12.250 --> 01:40:17.250
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

2853
01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:26.890
<v Speaker 3>for those of you that haven't done self authoring or understand myself,</v>

2854
01:40:29.810 --> 01:40:31.310
<v Speaker 3>they are incredible programs.</v>

2855
01:40:31.311 --> 01:40:35.590
<v Speaker 3>There's a 20% off code San Fran.</v>

2856
01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:36.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2857
01:40:36.370 --> 01:40:38.140
<v Speaker 3>So give that a go.</v>
