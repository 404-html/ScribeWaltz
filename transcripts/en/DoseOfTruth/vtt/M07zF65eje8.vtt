1
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:08.830
<v Speaker 1>Young was so radical thinker.</v>

2
00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:09.970
<v Speaker 1>It's just beyond belief.</v>

3
00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Like I've read a lot of critics of young and I've always,</v>

4
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.090
<v Speaker 1>I've always got a kick out of them because the things they accused young of are</v>

5
00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>so trivial compared to the things that young actually did that it's like</v>

6
00:00:19.931 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 1>accusing a murderer of jaywalking.</v>

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.990
<v Speaker 1>Like because young was unbelievably radical.</v>

8
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Like here's one of his ideas,</v>

9
00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:27.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:30.100
<v Speaker 1>he thought that it was necessary.</v>

11
00:00:30.101 --> 00:00:34.390
<v Speaker 1>He believed that psychotherapy could be replaced by a supreme moral effort.</v>

12
00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.050
<v Speaker 1>And so the moral effort would be something like aiming at the good and then</v>

13
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.570
<v Speaker 1>trying to integrate yourself around that and that</v>

14
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Speaker 1>the good at which you aimed would be something approximating what you would be</v>

15
00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:52.360
<v Speaker 1>like if you manifested your full potential and that you'd have a glimmering of</v>

16
00:00:52.361 --> 00:00:54.340
<v Speaker 1>what that for full potential was.</v>

17
00:00:54.341 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the potential future you and he thought of that.</v>

18
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>He thought of people as four dimensional entities,</v>

19
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:04.510
<v Speaker 1>especially essentially that we're stretched across time and that you as a</v>

20
00:01:04.511 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>totality across time,</v>

21
00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>including your potential manifested yourself also in the here and now.</v>

22
00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And that part of what your potential manifested itself was something like the</v>

23
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:17.530
<v Speaker 1>voice of conscious conscience or intuition.</v>

24
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing idea.</v>

25
00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:20.140
<v Speaker 1>It's an amazing idea,</v>

26
00:01:20.141 --> 00:01:20.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:01:20.381 --> 00:01:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Because it's like what you could be in the future beckons to you in the present</v>

28
00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 1>and helps you determine the difference between good and evil.</v>

29
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a mind boggling idea.</v>

30
00:01:28.841 --> 00:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

31
00:01:29.711 --> 00:01:33.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's an idea you have to contend with.</v>

32
00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.650
<v Speaker 1>And then he went further than that.</v>

33
00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 1>And this is,</v>

34
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.370
<v Speaker 1>this is also remarkable idea.</v>

35
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

36
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.410
<v Speaker 1>he was interested in this symbolic representation of Christ and I mean</v>

37
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>psychologically speaking,</v>

38
00:01:45.611 --> 00:01:50.611
<v Speaker 1>and he thought of Christ as the representation of the ideal potential human.</v>

39
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.050
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

40
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 1>So it was a symbolic at,</v>

41
00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:55.571
<v Speaker 1>at minimum,</v>

42
00:01:55.571 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>that's what Christ was,</v>

43
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.950
<v Speaker 1>is a symbolic representation of the ideal potential of a human being.</v>

44
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 1>And so for young,</v>

45
00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 1>there was no difference between,</v>

46
00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.510
<v Speaker 1>there was no psychological difference between who you could be in the future</v>

47
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>beckoning to you and the prey in the present and orienting yourself in</v>

48
00:02:11.891 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>relationship to Christ.</v>

49
00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.141
<v Speaker 1>Psychologically.</v>

50
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker 1>Those were the same thing.</v>

51
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.600
<v Speaker 1>And then so that's a pretty mind boggling idea.</v>

52
00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Like seriously,</v>

53
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>that's a mind boggling idea.</v>

54
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

55
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>especially when you add the psychological idea that one of the things that</v>

56
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 1>characterizes your ideal future self is the ability to make sacrifices,</v>

57
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.890
<v Speaker 1>And the deeper the sacrifice,</v>

59
00:02:32.891 --> 00:02:33.670
<v Speaker 1>the better.</v>

60
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.160
<v Speaker 1>And then also to recover from the sacrifice,</v>

61
00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:36.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:36.341 --> 00:02:37.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's the death and rebirth.</v>

63
00:02:37.691 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>So the part of you that's most essential to your full flowering as a,</v>

64
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>as a being is your ability to let things go and then spring back from that.</v>

65
00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:52.360
<v Speaker 1>So to die in some sense and to be reborn in the service of a higher good.</v>

66
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

67
00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>well then the next part of that is that the direction of the world depends on</v>

68
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.913
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

69
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>So not only your own life,</v>

70
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>but your family's life.</v>

71
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:02.840
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

72
00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>and because we're networked so intently together,</v>

73
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.660
<v Speaker 1>the whole panoply of humankind,</v>

75
00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the structure of the,</v>

76
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>of the cosmos.</v>

77
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:11.970
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

78
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.821
<v Speaker 1>you might think,</v>

80
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:13.061
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

81
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:13.421
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

82
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

83
00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not so simple.</v>

84
00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not so simple.</v>
