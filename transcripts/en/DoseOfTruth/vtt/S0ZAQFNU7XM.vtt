00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson.</v>

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.221
<v Speaker 2>So I want to say,</v>

3
00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:10.054
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

5
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 2>what a great lecture series and uh,</v>

6
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 2>this is the last this year.</v>

7
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:17.870
<v Speaker 2>So Merry Christmas to you and your family.</v>

8
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.381
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

9
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.214
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

10
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 2>I just want to say this,</v>

11
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.270
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

12
00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.260
<v Speaker 2>don't get too enthusiastic about that.</v>

13
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.660
<v Speaker 2>I wrote you an essay of a question and then I use the,</v>

14
00:00:29.661 --> 00:00:30.300
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

15
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.700
<v Speaker 2>the lecture of the essay writing guide on site two 30 to narrow it down to just</v>

16
00:00:34.701 --> 00:00:35.534
<v Speaker 2>a few pages,</v>

17
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.100
<v Speaker 2>a few lines.</v>

18
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:38.180
<v Speaker 2>And then during this,</v>

19
00:00:38.181 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

20
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.250
<v Speaker 2>this particular lecture,</v>

21
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 2>like the Zigzag slide manifest again and I thought,</v>

22
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>

23
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.353
<v Speaker 2>basically just</v>

24
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.480
<v Speaker 2>had all my questions answered.</v>

25
00:00:47.481 --> 00:00:48.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

26
00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.903
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

27
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 2>basically I just,</v>

28
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.320
<v Speaker 2>I want to ask,</v>

29
00:00:51.321 --> 00:00:52.154
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

30
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.171
<v Speaker 2>the idea of,</v>

31
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:55.004
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

32
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

33
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 2>you've made a lecture that was on youtube many years ago and uh,</v>

34
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.940
<v Speaker 2>you keep referring to Cain and Abel and the,</v>

35
00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

36
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Speaker 2>the death of Abel by Cain and the Christina.</v>

37
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>And I think that was the,</v>

38
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.920
<v Speaker 2>that was the single brother,</v>

39
00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 2>two brothers conflicting.</v>

40
00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.901
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

41
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:15.620
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

42
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 2>but here we have in the sons of Jacob the 12,</v>

43
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.610
<v Speaker 2>there was one who was one who's good,</v>

44
00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:27.110
<v Speaker 2>one who was enable archetype and there were 1211 that came after him.</v>

45
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>

46
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.051
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

47
00:01:30.051 --> 00:01:32.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's something about the division.</v>

48
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.691
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

49
00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 1>that's a good observation.</v>

50
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:37.000
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't thought about that.</v>

51
00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Well I mean there's a bit of variability because Ruben and Ruben isn't quite as</v>

53
00:01:42.341 --> 00:01:43.091
<v Speaker 1>bad as the rest,</v>

54
00:01:43.091 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

55
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.090
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's probably easier for the cane side,</v>

56
00:01:46.091 --> 00:01:46.924
<v Speaker 1>the multiply.</v>

57
00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Luckily it's not as powerful because it doesn't do anything.</v>

58
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

59
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.091
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

60
00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:56.924
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

61
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.890
<v Speaker 2>there's young was often included</v>

62
00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.290
<v Speaker 1>accused of Manichean these,</v>

63
00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry I'm not pronouncing that properly,</v>

64
00:02:04.721 --> 00:02:05.554
<v Speaker 1>but there was a,</v>

65
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>there was a variant of Christian dogma that held that good and evil.</v>

66
00:02:08.801 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>We're separate metaphysical realities and that they were battling for the,</v>

67
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.560
<v Speaker 1>for governance of the Cosmo,</v>

68
00:02:15.561 --> 00:02:16.361
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

69
00:02:16.361 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>But they both had an independent existence and the classical Christian idea,</v>

70
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:22.600
<v Speaker 1>which won out over that was that no,</v>

71
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 1>that good was real,</v>

72
00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:25.660
<v Speaker 1>but evil was the absence of good.</v>

73
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Now that produced all sorts of the absence of good produces all sorts of</v>

74
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:30.004
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

75
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.390
<v Speaker 1>And it is interesting to read young because he does get kind of Manichaean in</v>

76
00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:35.650
<v Speaker 1>his discussions.</v>

77
00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>And I think it was partly because he was so concerned about what happened in</v>

78
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Germany and then with a Cold War afterwards.</v>

79
00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:42.101
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

80
00:02:42.101 --> 00:02:44.170
<v Speaker 1>cause evil seem to be a palpable force.</v>

81
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think that it's as powerful as good.</v>

82
00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>But I do think it's easier for it to multiply because it's what's easier path.</v>

83
00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.140
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to be resentful and hostile and bitter and,</v>

84
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>and do nothing that's easy.</v>

85
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible and it's hard on people,</v>

86
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't require a tremendous amount of faith or effort.</v>

87
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that is why it's multiplied in the final story in genesis.</v>

88
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

89
00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:11.131
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

90
00:03:11.131 --> 00:03:13.440
<v Speaker 2>I've been reading ahead and for my own,</v>

91
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.500
<v Speaker 2>based on the interest of the present presented stories and I keyed in on a few</v>

92
00:03:19.921 --> 00:03:20.540
<v Speaker 2>other books,</v>

93
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.210
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

94
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:22.190
<v Speaker 2>chapters in the Bible,</v>

95
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.790
<v Speaker 2>First Corinthians 13,</v>

96
00:03:23.791 --> 00:03:24.870
<v Speaker 2>which is the love chapter.</v>

97
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

98
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.150
<v Speaker 2>and that cycles through the idea of I can have all things in life,</v>

99
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

100
00:03:30.571 --> 00:03:31.051
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>

101
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:31.800
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

102
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's all passing.</v>

103
00:03:32.701 --> 00:03:33.890
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

104
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.380
<v Speaker 2>the law now and forever.</v>

105
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.681
<v Speaker 2>Faith,</v>

106
00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:38.460
<v Speaker 2>hope and love.</v>

107
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 2>And then of course love triumphs overall.</v>

108
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.281
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.240
<v Speaker 1>Well the love the issue.</v>

110
00:03:43.241 --> 00:03:43.700
<v Speaker 1>See I've,</v>

111
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 1>I've been,</v>

112
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I thought a lot about the relationship between love and truth because I've</v>

113
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.900
<v Speaker 1>thought and talked a lot more about truth.</v>

114
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 1>And I think partly that's because love is a word that you can hardly even say</v>

115
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>because it's been so,</v>

116
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's being dragged behind a car through mud puddles.</v>

117
00:03:59.161 --> 00:04:00.120
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

118
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:01.460
<v Speaker 1>But it's so,</v>

119
00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.711
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

120
00:04:01.711 --> 00:04:03.870
<v Speaker 1>let me just finish it liberating this idea.</v>

121
00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:05.360
<v Speaker 1>But I think that the,</v>

122
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.800
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

123
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.450
<v Speaker 1>the love idea is associated with w for me,</v>

124
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>at least with what I discussed at the beginning of this lecture with regards to</v>

125
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.740
<v Speaker 1>faith,</v>

126
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:18.540
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to make a decision about what your attitude towards being is</v>

127
00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 1>going to be.</v>

128
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.390
<v Speaker 1>And the proper attitude in my estimation is that you're working for its</v>

129
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:25.224
<v Speaker 1>betterment,</v>

130
00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.161
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

131
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:27.030
<v Speaker 1>And so maybe,</v>

132
00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>maybe you have the same attitude towards being as you do towards someone that</v>

133
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:31.951
<v Speaker 1>you love,</v>

134
00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Speaker 1>like a son or a daughter or wife,</v>

135
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.120
<v Speaker 1>that you want things to be better.</v>

136
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And then so that's your aim.</v>

137
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:43.131
<v Speaker 1>So they aim is basically the aim is motivated by love.</v>

138
00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>You want things to be better,</v>

139
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.420
<v Speaker 1>because I think that's a good definition of love.</v>

140
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.380
<v Speaker 1>Like if you really care for someone,</v>

141
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.590
<v Speaker 1>you can tell because you want things to be better for them.</v>

142
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>And then I think truth is nested inside that because I think that truth is the</v>

143
00:04:56.881 --> 00:04:58.200
<v Speaker 1>best servant of love.</v>

144
00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

145
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.180
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
