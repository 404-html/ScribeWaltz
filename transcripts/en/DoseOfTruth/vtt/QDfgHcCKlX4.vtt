00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>You and was a great believer in the dream and I noted that dreams will tell you</v>

2
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:07.380
<v Speaker 1>things that you don't know.</v>

3
00:00:07.381 --> 00:00:07.981
<v Speaker 1>And then I thought,</v>

4
00:00:07.981 --> 00:00:08.071
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:09.240
<v Speaker 1>how the hell can that be?</v>

6
00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:14.040
<v Speaker 1>How would that in the world can something you think up tell you something you</v>

7
00:00:14.041 --> 00:00:14.851
<v Speaker 1>don't know?</v>

8
00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>How does that make any sense?</v>

9
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

10
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>why don't you understand it?</v>

11
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>Why does it have to come forth in the form of the dream?</v>

12
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not,</v>

13
00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>there's something going on inside you that you don't control rights.</v>

14
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 1>The dream happens to you just like life happens to you.</v>

15
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean there is the odd lucid dreamer who can,</v>

16
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.190
<v Speaker 1>apply a certain amount of conscious control,</v>

18
00:00:35.191 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time it's,</v>

19
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you're laying there asleep and this crazy complicated world manifests itself</v>

20
00:00:42.571 --> 00:00:44.970
<v Speaker 1>inside you and you don't know how you could,</v>

21
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>you can't do it when you're awake and you don't know what it means.</v>

22
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the hell is going on?</v>

23
00:00:50.021 --> 00:00:53.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things that's so damn frightening about the psychoanalysts</v>

24
00:00:53.221 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>because you get this both from Freud and young,</v>

25
00:00:56.431 --> 00:01:00.600
<v Speaker 1>you really start to understand that there are things inside you that are</v>

26
00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:04.050
<v Speaker 1>happening that control you instead of the other way around.</v>

27
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.311
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

28
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

29
00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a bit of reciprocal control,</v>

30
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:11.121
<v Speaker 1>but there's manifestations of spirits so to speak inside you that determine the</v>

31
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>manner in which you walk through life and you don't control it.</v>

32
00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>And what does,</v>

33
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.631
<v Speaker 1>is it random?</v>

34
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:18.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

35
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>there are people who have claimed the dreams are mirror merely the consequence</v>

36
00:01:22.951 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>of random neuronal firing,</v>

37
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.200
<v Speaker 1>which is a theory I think is absolutely absurd because there's nothing random</v>

38
00:01:28.201 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>about dreams.</v>

39
00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

40
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.451
<v Speaker 1>there are very,</v>

41
00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>very structured and very,</v>

42
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:36.600
<v Speaker 1>very complex and they're not like snow on a television screen or,</v>

43
00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>or static on a radio.</v>

44
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Like those things are complicated.</v>

45
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>And then also I've seen so often that people have very coherent dreams that have</v>

46
00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:45.930
<v Speaker 1>a perfect narrative structure.</v>

47
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Now they're fully developed,</v>

48
00:01:47.491 --> 00:01:48.301
<v Speaker 1>did some sense.</v>

49
00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And so that just as an ide,</v>

50
00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>that theory just doesn't go anywhere with me.</v>

51
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I just can't see that as useful at all.</v>

52
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

53
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.920
<v Speaker 1>so I'm more likely to take the phenomena seriously.</v>

54
00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.251
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

55
00:01:59.251 --> 00:01:59.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:01.470
<v Speaker 1>there's something to dreams,</v>

57
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>what you dream of the future.</v>

58
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>And then you try to make it into a reality that seems to be an important thing,</v>

59
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.991
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

60
00:02:06.991 --> 00:02:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you dream up at nightmare and try to make that into a reality because</v>

61
00:02:10.231 --> 00:02:11.041
<v Speaker 1>people do that too.</v>

62
00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.510
<v Speaker 1>If they're hell bent on revenge,</v>

63
00:02:12.511 --> 00:02:13.141
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

64
00:02:13.141 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>and full of hatred and resentment mean that manifest itself in terrible</v>

65
00:02:17.491 --> 00:02:18.241
<v Speaker 1>fantasies,</v>

66
00:02:18.241 --> 00:02:18.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>those are dreams,</v>

68
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>then people go act them out.</v>

69
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.590
<v Speaker 1>These things are powerful,</v>

70
00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

71
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.620
<v Speaker 1>And whole nations can get caught up in collective dreams.</v>

72
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to the Nazis.</v>

73
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:31.080
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened to Nazi Germany in the 1930s and it was absolutely</v>

74
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>remarkable,</v>

75
00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.761
<v Speaker 1>amazing,</v>

76
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:33.481
<v Speaker 1>horrific,</v>

77
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 1>destructive spectacle.</v>

78
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:36.750
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing happened in the Soviet Union.</v>

79
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:38.160
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happened in China.</v>

80
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 1>It's like we have to take these things seriously,</v>

81
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:41.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

82
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>and try to understand what's going on.</v>
