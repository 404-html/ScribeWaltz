00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.990
Cities.

2
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.880
We had to be very careful when we have these discussions,

3
00:00:10.881 --> 00:00:15.881
not to devalue the human dignity of people who aren't in the upper end of the

4
00:00:17.421 --> 00:00:18.260
distribution.

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.690
If there's one criticism that I think is fair is sometimes in these

6
00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:24.650
conversations,

7
00:00:24.651 --> 00:00:29.651
it sounds like we're devaluing people at the lower end of the distribution.

8
00:00:30.921 --> 00:00:33.230
We have to be very careful that we don't do that.

9
00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.680
A human life has dignity and Iq was not the most important thing that defines

10
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:40.850
human gifts.

11
00:00:40.851 --> 00:00:42.240
We beams EAGAN.

12
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.440
It's

13
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.030
<v 2>not associated with wisdom.</v>

14
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:48.410
It's not necessarily associated with truth or with courage or with many virtues

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080
that are how.

16
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:51.590
Right.

17
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.920
Get it.

18
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.940
You in it at all with being likable or on

19
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.230
the psychometric,

20
00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.880
which the psychometric relationship between intelligence and conscientiousness

21
00:01:01.881 --> 00:01:02.714
is zero.

22
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.653
Right.

23
00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.270
We have to make that point.

24
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.050
Yes,

25
00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.880
I agree.

26
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:07.713
I agree.

27
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.570
I'm trying to make the point about how difficult it is for people who are on the

28
00:01:11.571 --> 00:01:14.160
low end of the cognitive spectrum to survive in a,

29
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.130
in an increasingly complex,

30
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.320
cognitively sophisticated environment.
