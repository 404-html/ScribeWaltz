00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Be comedians are happy,</v>

2
00:00:08.551 --> 00:00:08.791
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:08.791 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>But everyone doesn't aspire to be a comedian.</v>

4
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:12.510
<v Speaker 1>Then you don't watch comedy all the time,</v>

5
00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>even though you could laugh nonstop more or less if the comedians funny you want</v>

6
00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>to get your teeth into something.</v>

7
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.500
<v Speaker 1>And also seems to me that this is one of the reasons I liked existential</v>

8
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>philosophy was that,</v>

9
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>the existentialists believed it's sort of an original sin idea.</v>

11
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:32.000
<v Speaker 1>They believe that we came into the world with an ethical burden already laid in</v>

12
00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:32.581
<v Speaker 1>upon us.</v>

13
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>Something like something like that.</v>

14
00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:38.130
<v Speaker 1>And that we had a felt sense that it was necessary for us to justify our being.</v>

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.480
<v Speaker 1>And if we didn't do that,</v>

16
00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>then we weren't authentic to ourselves.</v>

17
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:43.470
<v Speaker 1>We weren't moving towards individuality,</v>

18
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>we weren't sustaining the community,</v>

19
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>we weren't living properly and that and that,</v>

20
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:52.701
<v Speaker 1>that idea was deeply embedded in people as part of their ordinary experience.</v>

21
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>And that also seems to me to be accurate.</v>

22
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.791
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

23
00:00:56.791 --> 00:00:59.430
<v Speaker 1>I've dealt with lots of people say in my clinical practice and</v>

24
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>they don't really cut.</v>

25
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.821
<v Speaker 1>They have,</v>

26
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:03.750
<v Speaker 1>they will come and say,</v>

27
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>I wish I wasn't so unhappy.</v>

28
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.650
<v Speaker 1>But they don't usually come and say,</v>

29
00:01:07.651 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I wish I was happier.</v>

30
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>And those things aren't the same.</v>

31
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>And then when,</v>

32
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

33
00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>when you talk to people who are having trouble,</v>

34
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:15.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>they want to straighten things out and figure out how to do them right.</v>

36
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

37
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

38
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.481
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

39
00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>that's the primary,</v>

40
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.790
<v Speaker 1>that's their primary goal.</v>

41
00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
