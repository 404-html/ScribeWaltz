<v Speaker 1>What do you think about Adhd?</v>

2
00:00:02.431 --> 00:00:03.001
<v Speaker 1>I have it.</v>

3
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm frustrated by my failures in life because of it.</v>

4
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I am trying to become a a chemist and I am failing at school.</v>

5
00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 1>I think ADHD is a catch all diagnosis.</v>

7
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that people who are extroverted and unconscientious for example,</v>

8
00:00:17.881 --> 00:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>often manifest the traits of,</v>

9
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.790
<v Speaker 1>of uh,</v>

10
00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>attention deficit disorder.</v>

11
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.200
<v Speaker 1>I know that there isn't any real evidence of longterm utility and cycle and</v>

13
00:00:28.201 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>cycle.</v>

14
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 1>What a psycho pharmacological treatment for Adhd.</v>

15
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>I would say though,</v>

17
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:36.690
<v Speaker 1>if you are having a hard time concentrating on your goals,</v>

18
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.110
<v Speaker 1>that what you should probably do is set yourself up with a therapist,</v>

19
00:00:40.111 --> 00:00:41.370
<v Speaker 1>find someone you can talk to,</v>

20
00:00:41.371 --> 00:00:41.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:43.110
<v Speaker 1>so see two or three therapists.</v>

22
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>I know it's expensive but so is not having a life.</v>

23
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>Find someone you can talk to and then make it and someone practical,</v>

24
00:00:49.741 --> 00:00:51.810
<v Speaker 1>probably a behavioral therapist would be best.</v>

25
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>And then have them set goals with you and help you strategize to stay on track</v>

26
00:00:57.031 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>week to week.</v>

27
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>That's the best thing.</v>

28
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Or to set that up with a friend if he can't do it with the therapist.</v>

29
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

30
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.340
<v Speaker 1>that's the best advice I have for that.</v>

31
00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:06.151
<v Speaker 1>And keep at it,</v>

32
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

33
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.300
<v Speaker 1>but break your,</v>

35
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>you gotta learn to schedule.</v>

36
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>You got to learn to break your days down into disciplined subsections and you've</v>

37
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.340
<v Speaker 1>got to practice out at and practice at it.</v>

38
00:01:17.341 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

39
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

40
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>there isn't an easier answer that I know of,</v>

41
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 1>but having someone that will help keep your responsible,</v>

42
00:01:23.161 --> 00:01:24.150
<v Speaker 1>I think can be useful.</v>

43
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that be useful for people who have attention deficits,</v>

44
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.991
<v Speaker 1>disorder,</v>

45
00:01:27.991 --> 00:01:28.470
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>
