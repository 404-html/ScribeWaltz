1
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>So back to the story of Jacob and his ladder so that I can come again to my</v>

2
00:00:15.111 --> 00:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>father's house in peace.</v>

3
00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Then shall the Lord be my God and this stone,</v>

4
00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:20.690
<v Speaker 1>which I've said for a pillar shall be God's house.</v>

5
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>And of all that that thou shalt give me,</v>

6
00:00:22.581 --> 00:00:24.530
<v Speaker 1>I will surely give the 10th unto the,</v>

7
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 1>so that's,</v>

8
00:00:26.301 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>that's also an echo,</v>

9
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:28.071
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

10
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:33.071
<v Speaker 1>of the obligation of those who climb the power hierarchy hierarchy to attend to</v>

11
00:00:33.951 --> 00:00:35.450
<v Speaker 1>those who are at the bottom.</v>

12
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.171
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

13
00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think about the tie thing as a form of wealth distribution,</v>

14
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially what it is,</v>

15
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>the part of the ethic that defines the proper moral endeavor that's related to</v>

16
00:00:47.901 --> 00:00:52.901
<v Speaker 1>that center is not to advance yourself at the expense of the entire community.</v>

17
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:55.573
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

18
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 1>if you're fortunate enough so that you can rise in,</v>

19
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.800
<v Speaker 1>in authority and Power and competence within the confines of a community,</v>

20
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.450
<v Speaker 1>you still have a obligation to maintain the structure,</v>

21
00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>maintain and further the structure of the community within which you rose.</v>

22
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:13.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's obvious,</v>

23
00:01:13.251 --> 00:01:13.491
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Because if people didn't do that,</v>

25
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>after a couple of generations,</v>

26
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:17.690
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing would fall apart.</v>

27
00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

28
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

29
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

30
00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.230
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

31
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.660
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

32
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 1>it's not reasonable to destroy the game that you're winning.</v>

33
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>It's reasonable to strengthen the game that you're winning.</v>

34
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.390
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another thing because that also describes the ethic that should</v>

35
00:01:32.391 --> 00:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>allow you to be an active member of the community around which that,</v>

36
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>that gathers around that center.</v>

37
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.430
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

38
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:41.263
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

39
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>so one of the things I've learned about the hero mythology that I really,</v>

40
00:01:44.811 --> 00:01:45.644
<v Speaker 1>really like his,</v>

41
00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.830
<v Speaker 1>so you see this pretty clearly in the figure of Christ,</v>

42
00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:52.030
<v Speaker 1>but because two things are conjoined in,</v>

43
00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>in that story,</v>

44
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 1>but Christ is also the here,</v>

45
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>there's two kinds of heroes.</v>

46
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:57.101
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

47
00:01:57.101 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>there's the hero that goes out into chaos and confronts the dragon of chaos and</v>

48
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.540
<v Speaker 1>gathers the,</v>

49
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>the treasure as a consequence and then shares it with the community.</v>

50
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.670
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

51
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:07.000
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

52
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.640
<v Speaker 1>that's one.</v>

53
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>The other form of hero is the hero who stands up against the corrupt state and</v>

54
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.750
<v Speaker 1>rattles the foundation of the state,</v>

55
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 1>has it collapse and then reconstruct it.</v>

56
00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:17.631
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

57
00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:20.510
<v Speaker 1>So because the two great dangers to human beings are</v>

58
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>protected exposure to the catastrophes of the natural world and subjugation to</v>

59
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:27.374
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>

60
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

61
00:02:27.681 --> 00:02:29.420
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two major dangerous.</v>

62
00:02:29.421 --> 00:02:34.421
<v Speaker 1>And so a hero is their ultimate hero is the person who reconstructs the</v>

63
00:02:35.451 --> 00:02:39.650
<v Speaker 1>structure of the state by using the information that he gathered by going out</v>

64
00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 1>into the unknown that unites them both.</v>

65
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means,</v>

66
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 1>here's the,</v>

67
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>here's the rub as far as I can tell.</v>

68
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>So a structure,</v>

69
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>a center has to risks associated with it.</v>

70
00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 1>One is that it will degenerate into chaos.</v>

71
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>And the other is that we'll rigidified into and it'll degenerate into chaos even</v>

72
00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:06.610
<v Speaker 1>if it just stays doing what it's doing.</v>

73
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.910
<v Speaker 1>So if it just does exactly what it's doing and it doesn't change,</v>

74
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>it will degenerate because things change.</v>

75
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And if it doesn't change to keep up,</v>

76
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 1>then it gets farther and farther away from the environment and it'll</v>

77
00:03:18.791 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>precipitously collapse.</v>

78
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.281
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

79
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:26.281
<v Speaker 1>and then if it just changes willy nilly so that nobody can establish a stable</v>

80
00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:31.630
<v Speaker 1>centralize a game than a degenerates into chaos immediately and no one can get</v>

81
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.464
<v Speaker 1>along.</v>

82
00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.740
<v Speaker 1>So there's a rule for being longing to the community and the rule has to be two</v>

83
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>that you have to act in a manner that sustains and that sustains the community</v>

84
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and increases its competence.</v>

85
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the fundamental moral obligation for belonging.</v>

86
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>And while an obviously so,</v>

87
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:51.641
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

88
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:53.580
<v Speaker 1>because why would you belong to a,</v>

89
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>why would you walk into a club House that was on fire?</v>

90
00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.450
<v Speaker 1>Like that's just not smart,</v>

91
00:03:58.451 --> 00:03:58.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

92
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be part of the game,</v>

93
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.150
<v Speaker 1>if you've decided that being part of the game is worthwhile,</v>

94
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you've also taken on the moral.</v>

95
00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:09.220
<v Speaker 1>You've also decided,</v>

96
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.570
<v Speaker 1>even if you didn't notice it,</v>

97
00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>that you have to work to support that game because by deciding to play that</v>

98
00:04:14.801 --> 00:04:15.071
<v Speaker 1>game,</v>

99
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>you've said that it's valuable.</v>

100
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And if it's valuable,</v>

101
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>then obviously you should work to sustain and expand it because that's the</v>

102
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 1>definition of having a relationship with something that's valuable.</v>

103
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the criteria for membership in the community.</v>

104
00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's partly why,</v>

105
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>if you regard the cross,</v>

106
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 1>say as the symbol of voluntary suffering,</v>

107
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.791
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>

108
00:04:39.791 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>excepted voluntarily,</v>

109
00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

110
00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.430
<v Speaker 1>which is means that there's another element of that too.</v>

111
00:04:45.431 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>That's worth thinking about.</v>

112
00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

113
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.300
<v Speaker 1>the reason that came gets so out of hand is because he's suffering and he won't</v>

114
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.134
<v Speaker 1>accept it.</v>

115
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.970
<v Speaker 1>He certainly won't accept responsibility for it.</v>

116
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.030
<v Speaker 1>He's angry and bitter about it and no wonder,</v>

117
00:04:58.031 --> 00:04:58.301
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:04:58.301 --> 00:04:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

119
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.850
<v Speaker 1>we have to be realistic about these sorts of things.</v>

120
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.961
<v Speaker 1>They're your guys,</v>

121
00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>all of you people are going to suffer at some point in your life to the point</v>

122
00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:07.870
<v Speaker 1>where you're angry and bitter about it.</v>

123
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:08.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

124
00:05:08.141 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 1>there's just absolutely no doubt about that.</v>

125
00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.500
<v Speaker 1>And you're even going to think,</v>

126
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:11.651
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:05:11.651 --> 00:05:14.710
<v Speaker 1>it's no bloody wonder that I'm angry and bitter about it.</v>

128
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would be,</v>

129
00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.710
<v Speaker 1>and things are so god awful that there's no excuse for them to even exist.</v>

130
00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>And like that's a powerful argument.</v>

131
00:05:23.861 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Although I think it's ultimately self-defeating.</v>

132
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.520
<v Speaker 1>Well that's kind of what the story of Cain and Abel,</v>

133
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.980
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of what the story of Cain and Abel,</v>

134
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:34.360
<v Speaker 1>what would you say?</v>

135
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the moral of the story of Cain enable essentially.</v>

136
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.810
<v Speaker 1>So what that means instead is that even under those conditions of relatively</v>

137
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:44.710
<v Speaker 1>intense suffering,</v>

138
00:05:44.711 --> 00:05:48.970
<v Speaker 1>you have to accept it voluntarily because otherwise it turns you against being</v>

139
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>and then you start to act in this terrible manner that makes everything worse.</v>

140
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.770
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that there's a contradiction in that if,</v>

141
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>if the reason you're complaining is that things are bad,</v>

142
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>then it isn't reasonable for you to act in a manner that makes them worse.</v>

143
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

144
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

145
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>even if it's no wonder that people do that,</v>

146
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:09.860
<v Speaker 1>but it's a degenerating game.</v>

147
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.293
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

148
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>so the idea,</v>

149
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>part of the idea of the cross and the suffering that it represents is that if</v>

150
00:06:19.371 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>you could accept that voluntarily,</v>

151
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>regardless of its intensity,</v>

152
00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:29.110
<v Speaker 1>then you won't become embittered and resentful and vengeful to the point where</v>

153
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>you pose a danger to the stability of the community.</v>

154
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.730
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

155
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.680
<v Speaker 1>or to your own stability for that matter,</v>

156
00:06:36.681 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>cause it's,</v>

157
00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:06:37.581 --> 00:06:38.930
<v Speaker 1>it might be your own stability,</v>

159
00:06:38.931 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>the stability of your family,</v>

160
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:42.620
<v Speaker 1>the stability of the community and the stability of the world.</v>

161
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>It might be all of that.</v>

162
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And increasingly I think it is all of that.</v>

163
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.750
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
