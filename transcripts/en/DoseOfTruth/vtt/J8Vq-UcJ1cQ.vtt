1
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Take down competence.</v>

2
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:14.190
<v Speaker 1>That's fundamentally the underground motivation is to blur the line between</v>

3
00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:16.180
<v Speaker 1>competence and power.</v>

4
00:00:16.181 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>And then to make anyone who manifests any competence feel as if they're doing</v>

5
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.600
<v Speaker 1>nothing but manifesting tyranny.</v>

6
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>And it's a terrible doctrine.</v>

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen it really destroyed people.</v>

8
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I literally,</v>

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.570
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it destroy people.</v>

10
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.490
<v Speaker 1>And in what context?</v>

11
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:35.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're punished every time you do anything forthright and courageous and</v>

13
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.561
<v Speaker 1>noble,</v>

14
00:00:35.561 --> 00:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>buy,</v>

15
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.390
<v Speaker 1>buy as a consequence of accusations of tyranny and oppression,</v>

16
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>then everything you do that's good is punished.</v>

17
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.770
<v Speaker 1>And there's Nicha pointed out,</v>

18
00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 1>if you really want to punish someone,</v>

19
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.950
<v Speaker 1>you punish them for their virtues,</v>

20
00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>not for their faults.</v>

21
00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>If you really want to hurt someone,</v>

22
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>if I punish you because you've done something wrong and you know you've done</v>

23
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:54.004
<v Speaker 1>something wrong,</v>

24
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>you might not be happy punishment.</v>

25
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.910
<v Speaker 1>but at least it sets the scales right and that Starsky Dostoyevsky's steam in</v>

27
00:01:00.911 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 1>his great novel crime and punishment.</v>

28
00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.341
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

29
00:01:03.341 --> 00:01:03.640
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

30
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>where the murderer actually cries out to the heavens to be punished because it's</v>

31
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:10.270
<v Speaker 1>the only way that he can reestablish his humanity.</v>

32
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.120
<v Speaker 1>But if you really want to hurt people,</v>

33
00:01:13.121 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>then you punish them for their virtues.</v>

34
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>And we're definitely in this situation and I think the universities have played</v>

35
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:23.371
<v Speaker 1>a major role in this were forthright action on the part of ambitious and</v>

36
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>productive individuals is confused with tyrannical oppression.</v>

37
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.860
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that's a consequence of the disturbed relationships between,</v>

38
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.370
<v Speaker 1>well many of the people who take that tack in the social activist domains in</v>

39
00:01:38.591 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 1>universities and have never had a healthy relationship with someone who</v>

40
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.233
<v Speaker 1>masculine.</v>

41
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.870
<v Speaker 1>And so they feel that masculinity and itself is toxic,</v>

42
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.853
<v Speaker 1>which is that's,</v>

43
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was going to ask you next because the first video that really</v>

44
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:52.594
<v Speaker 1>hooked me,</v>

45
00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:53.830
<v Speaker 1>it spoke to me personally,</v>

46
00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.420
<v Speaker 1>both as a new father at the time and perhaps also as a,</v>

47
00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:00.040
<v Speaker 1>as a song of a deceased father.</v>

48
00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

49
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.810
<v Speaker 1>it was where you were talking about the relationship one has with his father.</v>

50
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.750
<v Speaker 1>can you please elaborate a little bit on that?</v>

52
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:02:08.351 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 1>the proper role of a father and a mother as well,</v>

54
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:12.760
<v Speaker 1>although the roles aren't identical.</v>

55
00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I would say the,</v>

56
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.200
<v Speaker 1>the proper fundamental maternal role is one of protection.</v>

57
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is quite obvious is that newborn infants need above all</v>

58
00:02:23.621 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>to be protected.</v>

59
00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.850
<v Speaker 1>The proper response to an infant's distress is,</v>

60
00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you're right and I'll take care of you right now,</v>

61
00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.130
<v Speaker 1>especially for the first nine months of life.</v>

62
00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.770
<v Speaker 1>There's no disputing that whenever the infant is upset,</v>

63
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.240
<v Speaker 1>he or she needs to be dealt with as if that upset is justified.</v>

64
00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 1>But then as the infant matures,</v>

65
00:02:42.041 --> 00:02:43.540
<v Speaker 1>and even by the age of nine months,</v>

66
00:02:43.541 --> 00:02:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I would say then that that has to be,</v>

67
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.330
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

68
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>that that interaction has to be made more sophisticated because the child has to</v>

69
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 1>be encouraged to take his or her place in the world.</v>

70
00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.700
<v Speaker 1>And I would say that encouragement is more on the masculine side of the,</v>

71
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.013
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

72
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.700
<v Speaker 1>of the duty distribution.</v>

73
00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.270
<v Speaker 1>And their father's fundamental role is to produce a bounded environment in which</v>

74
00:03:10.481 --> 00:03:15.481
<v Speaker 1>exploration can take place with an eye towards the encouragement of the child to</v>

75
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 1>develop more and more competence to push that development.</v>

76
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

77
00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's true for mothers and fathers that the end goal is to produce a person</v>

78
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 1>who's capable of operating autonomously in the world.</v>

79
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.720
<v Speaker 1>Now father's role is to foster that sense of confident autonomy by by</v>

80
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Speaker 1>encouraging the child to push his or her limits and like that role can be played</v>

81
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>by mother or father if it's a masculine role.</v>

82
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to be played by a man,</v>

83
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

84
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 1>it's still tilts in that direction.</v>

85
00:03:50.081 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>And so for example,</v>

86
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>fathers are much more likely to engage in rough and tumble play with their kids,</v>

87
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:55.961
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>

88
00:03:55.961 --> 00:03:57.220
<v Speaker 1>very good for them by the way,</v>

89
00:03:57.221 --> 00:04:01.180
<v Speaker 1>and absolutely necessary and something to be completely encouraged.</v>

90
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.780
<v Speaker 1>Rough and tumble play at is just fooling around wrestling,</v>

91
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.920
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>

92
00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>physical play because the kids learn while they learn all sorts of things.</v>

93
00:04:09.371 --> 00:04:10.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like they learned to dance.</v>

94
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the best way of thinking about it because a confident child understands</v>

95
00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:21.090
<v Speaker 1>the physics of play and you can see this even in said simple things is going</v>

96
00:04:21.341 --> 00:04:26.341
<v Speaker 1>into a park where there's a lot of dogs and the dogs that are well socialized</v>

97
00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>are very good at acting out playfulness and you can tell the difference between</v>

98
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.960
<v Speaker 1>a growling dog and a mean dog and afraid and dog and a playful dog.</v>

99
00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>People are very good at making that distinction and a playful dog knows how to</v>

100
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 1>move in a playful manner and so does a playful child.</v>

101
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:47.130
<v Speaker 1>And that attentive readiness to play is something that's fostered by those play</v>

102
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>fight interactions with fathers for example.</v>

103
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.350
<v Speaker 1>And that makes the kid ready in a deep sense to engage with other children.</v>

104
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 1>And it also sets the stage for a,</v>

105
00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>for a confident physicality and out in,</v>

106
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>in adolescents and in sexual relationships.</v>

107
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

108
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

109
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

110
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.381
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

111
00:05:05.381 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of our wisdom is embodied when you,</v>

112
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>when you wrestle with kids,</v>

113
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.480
<v Speaker 1>then they learn what hurts them and what doesn't.</v>

114
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>They learn how far they can be extended and stretched the limits.</v>

115
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>He tests the limits they learned to trust because you throw kids up in the air</v>

116
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>and you catch them and you push them to the point where they're really excited.</v>

117
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:25.750
<v Speaker 1>So they're right on the edge of fear.</v>

118
00:05:25.751 --> 00:05:26.201
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

119
00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:30.640
<v Speaker 1>The excitement pushes right to the edge of fear and but they learn and then they</v>

120
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 1>also learn how they can interact with someone else physically and what's</v>

121
00:05:34.601 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>acceptable and where the limits of pain are.</v>

122
00:05:36.941 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And what's frightening and what can be sustained and how to take turns and all</v>

123
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

124
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

125
00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.240
<v Speaker 1>it's not abstract,</v>

126
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:43.931
<v Speaker 1>it's concrete.</v>

127
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>It's right in the body.</v>

128
00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.293
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

129
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.130
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of the father's role.</v>

130
00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:51.130
<v Speaker 1>But the fundamental paternal role is that of encouragement.</v>

131
00:05:51.131 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>And the encouragement is you can handle it kid life is hard.</v>

132
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>It's going to come at you and all sorts of ways.</v>

133
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>You can accept that as a challenge.</v>

134
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>You can thrive,</v>

135
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>you can master it and I'm behind you.</v>

136
00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm behind the best in you manifesting itself in the world.</v>

137
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And that gives a kid a spine,</v>

138
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>metaphysically and physic.</v>

140
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.810
<v Speaker 1>And so it's an unbelievably important thing to do.</v>

141
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.060
<v Speaker 1>And fatherlessness is a catastrophe.</v>

142
00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the epidemiological literature,</v>

143
00:06:20.721 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>the psychological literature,</v>

144
00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>fatherlessness predicts all sorts of terrible outcomes.</v>

145
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

146
00:06:26.511 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>And we've fallen into this idea in our society that fathers aren't necessary.</v>

147
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

148
00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>and it's just a family that's run by single mother is just as good in in the</v>

149
00:06:36.321 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 1>broad sense as a family with two parents.</v>

150
00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And it's simply not true.</v>

151
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>All the evidence suggests.</v>

152
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

153
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean that there aren't single parents who were notably raising</v>

154
00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:48.230
<v Speaker 1>their children because there are,</v>

155
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.490
<v Speaker 1>but in the aggregate,</v>

156
00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 1>the two parent family is a much better arrangement for children.</v>

157
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.390
<v Speaker 1>She said that,</v>

158
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

159
00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:56.300
<v Speaker 1>without the encoder Smith off the father,</v>

160
00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 1>is this as if it's spirit will be left outside the walls of civilization?</v>

161
00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

162
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly,</v>

163
00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly it is that,</v>

164
00:07:05.331 --> 00:07:05.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>the father's role is to,</v>

166
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.443
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

167
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.510
<v Speaker 1>to note that the individual is capable of thriving in a difficult world and to</v>

168
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>put that message forward and to,</v>

169
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.110
<v Speaker 1>and to note that that's been the message of people who've been successful</v>

170
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>throughout history and that each individual is capable of doing that,</v>

171
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.180
<v Speaker 1>at least to some degree and has no better bet.</v>

172
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:29.631
<v Speaker 1>That's the,</v>

173
00:07:29.631 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 1>as no better alternative.</v>
