1
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.993
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

2
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>postmoderns and we talked about it a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>

3
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>we'll return to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're going to talk a little bit</v>

4
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>about Marxism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a quote here from mark's.</v>

5
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 1>The proletarians have nothing to lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're chains.</v>

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.501
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>that was pretty good for like 1880 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>1890 or whenever it was.</v>

8
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:27.670
<v Speaker 1>He wrote it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere around that period of time it</v>

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 1>turned out the proletarians had a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>more to lose than their chains.</v>

10
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.840
<v Speaker 1>They had their lives and their families</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lose.</v>

11
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>That was demonstrated and play as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of the,</v>

12
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sociological movements that were put</v>

13
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:45.780
<v Speaker 1>into place when the Marxist</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions began to govern</v>

14
00:00:45.781 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>societies like the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:52.020
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's take the same postmodernist</v>

16
00:00:52.021 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's some basic tenants of Marxism.</v>

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.500
<v Speaker 1>It's Berge Lousy against proletariat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bourgeoisie year.</v>

18
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>They're capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the property owners,</v>

19
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.610
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of people.</v>

20
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>The proletariat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the working class,</v>

21
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.210
<v Speaker 1>for all intents and purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The basic idea is that history itself is</v>

22
00:01:09.211 --> 00:01:12.150
<v Speaker 1>nothing but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

23
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:16.200
<v Speaker 1>The documentation of the struggle of one</v>
<v Speaker 1>class against the other.</v>

24
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

25
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.370
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's wrong,</v>

26
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's okay because it's too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

27
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 1>It's obviously too simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of motivations that</v>

28
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are economic,</v>

29
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>some of them are associated with power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

30
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:35.820
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will leave that.</v>

31
00:01:35.821 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's give the devil his due and say,</v>

32
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:37.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

33
00:01:37.981 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is still a fair bit of tension</v>

34
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 1>between the haves and the haves and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>have nots.</v>

35
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 1>And maybe that was even more intense and</v>
<v Speaker 1>previous societies than it is now.</v>

36
00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:48.060
<v Speaker 1>And it's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no doubt that economics plays a</v>

37
00:01:48.061 --> 00:01:50.370
<v Speaker 1>role in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in virtually everything that human</v>

38
00:01:50.371 --> 00:01:52.230
<v Speaker 1>beings do in a fairly significant role.</v>

39
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:53.063
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

40
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.310
<v Speaker 1>let's accept that as a potential theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

41
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.740
<v Speaker 1>it's simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe it's practically useful.</v>

42
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.990
<v Speaker 1>And then there's kind of an offshoot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that theory,</v>

43
00:02:00.991 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 1>which is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:02:02.041 --> 00:02:04.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means you have sympathy for the</v>

45
00:02:04.381 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>working class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

46
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what you're saying all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>

47
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:07.711
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:07.711 --> 00:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>the poor working class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all oppressed.</v>

49
00:02:09.601 --> 00:02:11.730
<v Speaker 1>The poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor proletariat,</v>

50
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.830
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you're also saying,</v>

51
00:02:13.831 --> 00:02:15.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're the good guys because we're</v>

52
00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:19.440
<v Speaker 1>standing on the side of the oppressed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so then you might also ask what</v>

53
00:02:19.441 --> 00:02:22.980
<v Speaker 1>you're marginalizing when you claim that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the good guys because one of the</v>

54
00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 1>things that you would be marginalizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is all of the ways in which you're not</v>

55
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>the good guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can leave that aside for a moment</v>

56
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:31.970
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's the claims is that,</v>

57
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the working class against the</v>

58
00:02:34.731 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 1>ruling class.</v>

59
00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Another claim is the ruling class is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruined class because they exploit the</v>

60
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.120
<v Speaker 1>working class basically stealing their</v>
<v Speaker 1>excess labor from them.</v>

61
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.740
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another very,</v>

62
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

63
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.520
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

64
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.720
<v Speaker 1>surfacely attractive claim that lacks</v>
<v Speaker 1>any reasonable justification,</v>

65
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's predicated the idea of the</v>

66
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>world as a zero sum game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And clearly the world is not a zero sum</v>

67
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when someone creates wealth,</v>

68
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 1>when someone is wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be at least at times because they</v>

69
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>created it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not because they swiped it from someone</v>

70
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

71
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can think of someone like Bill Gates</v>

72
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 1>or Steve Jobs is a good example of that.</v>

73
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.773
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

74
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

75
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.600
<v Speaker 1>they're what they produced pad and value</v>
<v Speaker 1>that far exceeded what they garnered as</v>

76
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>a consequence of their production even</v>
<v Speaker 1>though what they garnered was fairly</v>

77
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.920
<v Speaker 1>substantial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

78
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 1>but we'll get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

79
00:03:31.031 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give the devil his due.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>It's the bourgeoisie against the</v>
<v Speaker 1>proletariat will accept that.</v>

81
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 1>It's class warfare is the primary</v>
<v Speaker 1>historical mover.</v>

82
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

83
00:03:41.231 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 1>but here's what I'm not willing to give</v>
<v Speaker 1>away so easily.</v>

84
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have sympathy for the working class</v>

85
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.440
<v Speaker 1>primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're good because of that.</v>

86
00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna just give that away.</v>

87
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>So simply.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's investigate that a little bit.</v>

88
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's see if we can actually figure it</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

89
00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>If that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll say a use a pragmatic approach</v>

90
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.390
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a pragmatist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the William James Sense.</v>

91
00:04:05.391 --> 00:04:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.660
<v Speaker 1>or maybe you can think about it even</v>
<v Speaker 1>more deeply in anciently.</v>

93
00:04:11.661 --> 00:04:13.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a statement in the New</v>

94
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.110
<v Speaker 1>Testament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's by their fruits,</v>

95
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:16.880
<v Speaker 1>you shall know the fine.</v>
