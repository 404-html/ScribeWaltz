1
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.220
<v Speaker 1>It really started when I was about 13.</v>

2
00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I was a junior high school student and,</v>

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:14.393
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>I met this librarian who's kind of an eccentric person,</v>

5
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.820
<v Speaker 1>very well educated person,</v>

6
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.683
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

7
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.920
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

8
00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>I used to hang around with my delinquent friends in the library,</v>

9
00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.970
<v Speaker 1>which tells you how eccentric the librarian was because that's not normally the</v>

10
00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>place where the delinquent kids hang out,</v>

11
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

12
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.070
<v Speaker 1>But she talked to us like we were adults and that was a,</v>

13
00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:44.171
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it,</v>

14
00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:45.040
<v Speaker 1>a refreshing.</v>

15
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 1>That was a refreshing experience.</v>

16
00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.563
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

17
00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.600
<v Speaker 1>she knew that I liked to read and she started giving me real books.</v>

18
00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.370
<v Speaker 1>She gave me one day in the life of Ivan Denisovich,</v>

19
00:01:00.371 --> 00:01:05.371
<v Speaker 1>which was the first book published by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn in the Soviet</v>

20
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

21
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.770
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

22
00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a story about the day of a political prisoner in a,</v>

23
00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.580
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>

24
00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.580
<v Speaker 1>in a work camp and brave new world and 1984 and animal farm and Ayn Rand's</v>

25
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:17.381
<v Speaker 1>books,</v>

26
00:01:17.381 --> 00:01:22.360
<v Speaker 1>which was quite interesting because she was the wife of our member of parliament</v>

27
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>who was the only member of the opposition in our province.</v>

28
00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And he was a socialist and NDP new Democratic Party leader as a matter of fact.</v>

29
00:01:31.871 --> 00:01:32.704
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

30
00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>but despite that,</v>

31
00:01:33.761 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>she gave me Ayn Rand's books because she thought that I should be exposed to the</v>

32
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.030
<v Speaker 1>other side of the argument.</v>

33
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 1>So I read atlas shrugged and,</v>

34
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.393
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

35
00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.650
<v Speaker 1>the fountain head and well,</v>

36
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.390
<v Speaker 1>she was the first person who helped me discover literature,</v>

37
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.313
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

38
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.730
<v Speaker 1>And while at the same time I got interested in what had happened in Nazi</v>

39
00:02:00.971 --> 00:02:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

40
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>Then I wrote an essay about that when I was about 13 or 14 about Auschwitz and</v>

41
00:02:06.611 --> 00:02:07.450
<v Speaker 1>what had happened there.</v>

42
00:02:07.451 --> 00:02:09.280
<v Speaker 1>And I never read that,</v>

43
00:02:09.281 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>really never left my mind.</v>

44
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.913
<v Speaker 1>I would say,</v>

45
00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.880
<v Speaker 1>I think I read Viktor Frankl's man's search for meaning at that point,</v>

46
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.470
<v Speaker 1>which is a book I would highly recommend.</v>

47
00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.020
<v Speaker 1>I have a reading list on my website by the way,</v>

48
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.520
<v Speaker 1>at Jordan B.</v>

49
00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.151
<v Speaker 1>Peterson Dotcom.</v>

50
00:02:22.151 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And so there's a variety of books there that have really influenced me and I put</v>

51
00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:27.810
<v Speaker 1>them up for other people's,</v>

52
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

53
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.403
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

54
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Anyways.</v>

55
00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>

56
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 1>what I learned about Auschwitz and about Nazi Germany never really left my mind.</v>

57
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:41.920
<v Speaker 1>And because I couldn't understand how people could act that way,</v>

58
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.210
<v Speaker 1>how they could not only be possessed by an ideology to the degree that the</v>

59
00:02:46.211 --> 00:02:48.850
<v Speaker 1>Germans were in a very civilized country,</v>

60
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:49.301
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

61
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:49.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:50.320
<v Speaker 1>so it was,</v>

63
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>I suppose even a more spectacular shock that something so catastrophic happened</v>

64
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

65
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.910
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't just the ideological possession,</v>

66
00:02:57.911 --> 00:03:02.440
<v Speaker 1>it was the cruelty and the gratuitous cruelty in the service of that ideological</v>

67
00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>possession that I couldn't understand.</v>

68
00:03:04.031 --> 00:03:04.864
<v Speaker 1>It didn't,</v>

69
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.730
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't establish a relationship between my own being and,</v>

70
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.660
<v Speaker 1>and those patterns of action.</v>

71
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>And as I got older,</v>

72
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>that concern transformed itself into an obsession.</v>

73
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 1>I would say not so much with what had happened to Nazi Germany,</v>

74
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.643
<v Speaker 1>but with,</v>

75
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I think what happened,</v>

76
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>what was happening as a consequence of the collectivist philosophy per se,</v>

77
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.030
<v Speaker 1>which you might think of something that manifested itself both on the right in</v>

78
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:41.071
<v Speaker 1>Nazi Germany and then on the left in all the multitudeness and catastrophic</v>

79
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>communist regimes that characterized the bulk of the 20th century.</v>

80
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>And they're insane.</v>

81
00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Murderousness and that probably culminated for me in the 1970s when I Read</v>

82
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn the Gulag archipelago,</v>

83
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.850
<v Speaker 1>which is another book that everyone should read because in some sense it might</v>

84
00:04:03.101 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>be the defining document of the 20th century.</v>

85
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that everyone in the West isn't familiar with that book is actually</v>

86
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:14.080
<v Speaker 1>a signal of our catastrophic moral failing,</v>

87
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.943
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

88
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.443
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

89
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I started writing this book called maps of meaning in about 1985 although I had</v>

90
00:04:23.081 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>been working on variants of it before that.</v>

91
00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.840
<v Speaker 1>And what I was trying to understand was maybe the psychological</v>

92
00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 1>motivations for the Cold War,</v>

93
00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

94
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Many of you are old enough to remember what it was like in the 1980s we just</v>

95
00:04:42.641 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 1>went and visited the house in,</v>

96
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>in Reykjavik where Gorbachev and Reagan met,</v>

97
00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>which was quite something to see.</v>

98
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>And when they decided they were going to bring at least some of the insanity to</v>

99
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:55.480
<v Speaker 1>irrelative halt,</v>

100
00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:56.523
<v Speaker 1>thank God.</v>

101
00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And the 80s were a very contentious time.</v>

102
00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

103
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:04.411
<v Speaker 1>the Cold War sort of peaked in two at two times a peaked in 1962 during the</v>

104
00:05:04.961 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 1>Cuban missile crisis.</v>

105
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>

106
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>but I w I visited a uh,</v>

107
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 1>nuclear missile site in Arizona</v>

108
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.330
<v Speaker 1>both 10 years ago.</v>

109
00:05:16.331 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>It was a decommissioned missile site,</v>

110
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.750
<v Speaker 1>intercontinental ballistic missile,</v>

111
00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>intercontinental ballistic missile is a very large rocket and can go halfway</v>

112
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>around the world and its ballistic,</v>

113
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>which means it has the same function as a bullet.</v>

114
00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.820
<v Speaker 1>And the bullet is ballistic because once you fire it,</v>

115
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>

116
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.400
<v Speaker 1>You don't control it after it.</v>

117
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.241
<v Speaker 1>It leaves.</v>

118
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:36.010
<v Speaker 1>So once you launch a ballistic missile,</v>

119
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>it's launched,</v>

120
00:05:37.661 --> 00:05:38.890
<v Speaker 1>there's no calling back.</v>

121
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>And they told us they did a simulation launch,</v>

122
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:43.210
<v Speaker 1>which was very eerie thing.</v>

123
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.720
<v Speaker 1>And so to launch a nuclear missile is a big console.</v>

124
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:51.721
<v Speaker 1>It sort of looks like the star Trek control a control module,</v>

125
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:54.874
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

126
00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>And One person stands here.</v>

127
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.600
<v Speaker 1>One person stands about 20 feet away,</v>

128
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.080
<v Speaker 1>each have a key around their neck and they put the key in the lock</v>

129
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously and then turn it for 10 seconds and at the end of 10 seconds the</v>

130
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 1>missile is gone.</v>

131
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's that.</v>

132
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>And they both had their keys in the lock in 1962 so,</v>

133
00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 1>and we came close again in 1984 when,</v>

134
00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this,</v>

135
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:23.861
<v Speaker 1>but there's Soviet missile detection system signal.</v>

136
00:06:24.251 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>The launch of four or five missiles from North America and a single Russian</v>

137
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.520
<v Speaker 1>soldier decided that it was a false alarm and refuse to push the button that</v>

138
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>would have resulted in major retaliation.</v>

139
00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 1>He just died about a year ago.</v>

140
00:06:41.301 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>You can read about him on Wikipedia.</v>

141
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:44.241
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

142
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:47.530
<v Speaker 1>I read soldier Nixon in 1970s and,</v>

143
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>and I made me,</v>

144
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 1>me even I would say more obsessed with what was happening in,</v>

145
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 1>in on the world stage.</v>

146
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.140
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to understand why it was that</v>

147
00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.820
<v Speaker 1>the systems of belief that we inhabited,</v>

148
00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:06.710
<v Speaker 1>let's say one typifying the Soviet Union and in similar states,</v>

149
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Maoist China,</v>

150
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>North Korea,</v>

151
00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 1>wonderful places like that versus the West.</v>

152
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 1>We each had our own way of construing the world,</v>

153
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>the ways of construing the world were set at odds with one another.</v>

154
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that they were set at odds with one another appeared to be so</v>

155
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>significant that we'd armed ourselves with</v>

156
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:32.050
<v Speaker 1>50,000</v>

157
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.000
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

158
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.910
<v Speaker 1>hydro hydrogen bombs on each side,</v>

159
00:07:36.911 --> 00:07:37.744
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

160
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:39.880
<v Speaker 1>And I don't know how much you know about hydrogen bomb.</v>

161
00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

162
00:07:40.361 --> 00:07:41.710
<v Speaker 1>you know about atomic bombs,</v>

163
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.850
<v Speaker 1>you know that a hydrogen bomb has an atomic bomb for the trigger,</v>

164
00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:48.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.010
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

166
00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 1>so like the atom bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima,</v>

167
00:07:51.531 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>that was something that was a fission bomb,</v>

168
00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.850
<v Speaker 1>not standard atomic bomb,</v>

169
00:07:55.851 --> 00:07:56.690
<v Speaker 1>the first generation,</v>

170
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.960
<v Speaker 1>but hydrogen bomb is incontestably more powerful than that.</v>

171
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>And we were producing them in the tens of thousands.</v>

172
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:08.720
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we don't have any now,</v>

173
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:13.721
<v Speaker 1>but it was really some insanity in the 1980s and people seem to have a very</v>

174
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 1>itchy trigger finger.</v>

175
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.670
<v Speaker 1>So I was very confused about this in two ways.</v>

176
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.580
<v Speaker 1>One from a psychological perspective,</v>

177
00:08:22.581 --> 00:08:23.900
<v Speaker 1>because by that time I had just studied,</v>

178
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.480
<v Speaker 1>decided to study psychology instead of political science,</v>

179
00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>which was my original major.</v>

180
00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I get,</v>

181
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>I got disenchanted with political science because I didn't believe that people</v>

182
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 1>were fundamentally motivated by economic issues.</v>

183
00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I still don't believe that that's true.</v>

184
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.120
<v Speaker 1>They're motivated by whatever they're motivated by.</v>

185
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:42.650
<v Speaker 1>It can't be captured by economics,</v>

186
00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:43.410
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

187
00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>not precisely.</v>

188
00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It's very curious about what it was that was so important about a belief system</v>

189
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:55.990
<v Speaker 1>that people would risk putting the entire planet to the torch to ensure that</v>

190
00:08:56.371 --> 00:09:00.690
<v Speaker 1>their particular mode of construing the world prevailed was an interesting</v>

191
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:01.650
<v Speaker 1>psychological problem.</v>

192
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:06.651
<v Speaker 1>What was so important about belief system that would justify destroying</v>

193
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:07.171
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

194
00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:07.461
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

195
00:09:07.461 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>or risking destroying everything,</v>

196
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>because that was certainly the situation we put ourselves in.</v>
