1
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.760
<v Speaker 1>You once mentioned you were planning on</v>
<v Speaker 1>making an Iq test available alongside</v>

2
00:00:10.761 --> 00:00:12.380
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspects scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

3
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>is that in the works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

4
00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>we have an Iq test that we use for</v>
<v Speaker 1>business testing.</v>

5
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we haven't made it available</v>

6
00:00:20.931 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 1>publicly yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is in the works but not for a while</v>

7
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing instead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because it has to be while</v>

8
00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:33.430
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of work we still have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do on it to generate the report so that</v>

9
00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:35.420
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be truly usable to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

10
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 1>Now that I would say is about three or</v>
<v Speaker 1>four months.</v>

11
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Work is necessary to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>what we are doing right now with the big</v>
<v Speaker 1>five aspect scale though.</v>

13
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:48.641
<v Speaker 1>So that's how understand myself.com is</v>
<v Speaker 1>producing a dyad version.</v>

14
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>And so we're working on the boyfriend</v>
<v Speaker 1>girlfriend version right now.</v>

15
00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>So what that'll mean is that when you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and you do your personality test</v>

16
00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:59.180
<v Speaker 1>and your girlfriend say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does her personality test that you'll</v>

17
00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:04.181
<v Speaker 1>both be able to generate a dual report</v>
<v Speaker 1>that describes the similarities and</v>

18
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>differences between you and your partner</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where you're likely to see eye to</v>

19
00:01:08.961 --> 00:01:12.290
<v Speaker 1>eye on things where you're likely to</v>
<v Speaker 1>defer and what that's going to mean and</v>

20
00:01:12.291 --> 00:01:13.730
<v Speaker 1>what you might want to do about it.</v>

21
00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.980
<v Speaker 1>If you know what you might be able to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

22
00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And this we're hoping this will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>really useful because temperamental</v>

23
00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:23.630
<v Speaker 1>differences are a lot of the reason that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a hard time getting along</v>

24
00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:28.631
<v Speaker 1>that and complete inability whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 1>to state what they actually want and to</v>

25
00:01:28.911 --> 00:01:30.830
<v Speaker 1>negotiate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is a completely different issue.</v>

26
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.640
<v Speaker 1>I want to build a program to help people</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate to at some point in the</v>

27
00:01:34.641 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's part of our future plan,</v>

28
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 1>but the next development plan is to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>there's two of them is to get the high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school version of the cell phone program</v>

30
00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:48.431
<v Speaker 1>up and running and that my program or</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps promising it in two weeks and I.</v>

31
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.720
<v Speaker 1>These things always take longer than</v>
<v Speaker 1>expected,</v>

32
00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:55.430
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sure we'll get it out in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>first quarter of 2018 and then also the</v>

33
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 1>dyad version of the big five aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale that should be out in the first</v>

34
00:02:00.051 --> 00:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>quarter of 2018 as well.</v>

35
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.630
<v Speaker 1>And then I'm not sure if the Iq test</v>
<v Speaker 1>will be next on the development track.</v>

36
00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.630
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things we'd like to do with</v>

37
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:13.631
<v Speaker 1>understand myself is to expand it out</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a career I'm planning process</v>

38
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:21.140
<v Speaker 1>because look at it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know if you have an Iq of 100,</v>

39
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>which is the average Iq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that would place you sort of in the</v>

40
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 1>middle of the average high school class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being a lawyer is probably not a great</v>

41
00:02:28.641 --> 00:02:32.420
<v Speaker 1>career choice for you unless you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably conscientious because</v>

42
00:02:32.421 --> 00:02:36.500
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be competing with people</v>
<v Speaker 1>who have a verbal facility say and a</v>

43
00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 1>problem solving capacity that far</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceeds yours.</v>

44
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.530
<v Speaker 1>And you're going to have to work like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mad to just be reasonably competent.</v>

45
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.620
<v Speaker 1>And so what seems to be more logical is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take a good look at your intellectual</v>

46
00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:57.221
<v Speaker 1>prowess as given because it's very</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerfully biologically influenced and</v>

47
00:02:57.771 --> 00:03:02.771
<v Speaker 1>to pick a domain of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of career that you could excel in</v>

48
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 1>because why not pick a domain that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can excel and there's lots of different</v>

49
00:03:06.911 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>things that you can be.</v>

50
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>And so you want to consult your</v>
<v Speaker 1>temperament.</v>

51
00:03:10.991 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>So if you're agreeable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you probably want to work with</v>

52
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're disagreeable,</v>

53
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 1>you probably want to work with things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're extroverted,</v>

54
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a job that involves</v>
<v Speaker 1>sales and social activity.</v>

55
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:21.700
<v Speaker 1>And if you're introverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to work alone.</v>

56
00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 1>And if you're open,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to do something creative and</v>

57
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to consult your temperament</v>

58
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 1>to see where you would be properly</v>
<v Speaker 1>slotted.</v>

59
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to consider your</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence so that you can find a</v>

60
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>niche where you're most likely to excel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those niches exists.</v>

61
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 1>So we'd like to combine the Iq test with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspects scale.</v>

62
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 1>So that we can give people reasonable</v>
<v Speaker 1>career advice.</v>

63
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>It's been a longterm goal and so those</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all on the table and I have good</v>

64
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>program team working on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're very complicated things and</v>

65
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.870
<v Speaker 1>they take a lot of time and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to make a mistake and all of that.</v>

66
00:03:55.871 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But maybe the couples version and the</v>

67
00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:02.190
<v Speaker 1>high school version of the couple's</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of the personality test and the</v>

68
00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>high school version of the self</v>
<v Speaker 1>authoring in this quarter and maybe</v>

69
00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe the career counseling version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspects scale in the next</v>

70
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be lovely.</v>

71
00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.300
<v Speaker 1>That's probably overly optimistic for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second part,</v>

72
00:04:16.301 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
