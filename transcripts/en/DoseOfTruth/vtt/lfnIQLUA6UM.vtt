1
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.491
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

2
00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>so you have the chaos that surrounds you and it's some,</v>

3
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:11.294
<v Speaker 1>some sense,</v>

4
00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>infinite in scope,</v>

5
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.770
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the order that you produce,</v>

6
00:00:15.771 --> 00:00:18.350
<v Speaker 1>which is your mastery of it.</v>

7
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

8
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 1>let's take order apart for a minute.</v>

9
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.340
<v Speaker 1>We want to think about the structure of order and bill.</v>

10
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.410
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying that chaos is bad in order is good.</v>

11
00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that at all.</v>

12
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.990
<v Speaker 1>That's not the right way to look at it.</v>

13
00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:31.123
<v Speaker 1>It's the balance.</v>

14
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.920
<v Speaker 1>It's the balance between the mets of crucial importance.</v>

15
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.720
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

16
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 1>they exist as superordinate categories.</v>

17
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 1>Whether you liked them or not is really not that relevant there.</v>

18
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>There,</v>

19
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

20
00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.780
<v Speaker 1>there the fundamental constituent elements of reality.</v>

21
00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

23
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.791
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:00:46.791 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>what's your evidence for that?</v>

25
00:00:48.111 --> 00:00:49.850
<v Speaker 1>And I can tell you one piece of evidence,</v>

26
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>which I won't go into for for very much time.</v>

27
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>You have two hemispheres in each,</v>

28
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:57.014
<v Speaker 1>in your brain.</v>

29
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.880
<v Speaker 1>The brain is composed of two hemispheres,</v>

30
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>which implies something about the nature of the world.</v>

31
00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.960
<v Speaker 1>Given that your brain is hypothetically adapted to the structure of the world.</v>

32
00:01:05.961 --> 00:01:09.860
<v Speaker 1>It's not just your brain cause animal brains have the same fundamental</v>

33
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.851
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>

34
00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>this bifurcated structure and the bifurcation indicates that there's two</v>

35
00:01:15.351 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>fundamental realities because otherwise why would you need a bifurcated</v>

36
00:01:19.251 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 1>structure or maybe you need to try you in brain or one that's divided into four</v>

37
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.340
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what you have.</v>

38
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.410
<v Speaker 1>You have one that's divided into two and if your working definition of reality</v>

39
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.610
<v Speaker 1>is scientific,</v>

40
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>biological,</v>

41
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.440
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

42
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.240
<v Speaker 1>then your definition of reality is reality is that which shapes life.</v>

43
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.400
<v Speaker 1>You can't actually do better than that from a Darwinian perspective and if the</v>

44
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:48.230
<v Speaker 1>reality that shape life produced a bifurcated representational structure,</v>

45
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.390
<v Speaker 1>then that implies that the proper way to represent reality and perhaps that</v>

46
00:01:53.391 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 1>reality itself is in fact bifurcated and I believe it's bifurcated in the manner</v>

47
00:01:57.621 --> 00:02:02.060
<v Speaker 1>I just described and the neurological evidence for that is actually quite</v>

48
00:02:02.061 --> 00:02:02.894
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>

49
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.520
<v Speaker 1>It's come from multiple sources,</v>

50
00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 1>some of them Russian,</v>

51
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:06.950
<v Speaker 1>some of them American.</v>

52
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.690
<v Speaker 1>That's where most of the work has been done.</v>

53
00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Your left hemisphere is specialized for operation in those situations that you</v>

54
00:02:13.551 --> 00:02:18.230
<v Speaker 1>know and understand and your right hemisphere is specialized for operation in</v>

55
00:02:18.231 --> 00:02:21.710
<v Speaker 1>those situations that you neither know nor understand.</v>

56
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.960
<v Speaker 1>And the proper way to Orient Yourself in life is to get the balance between</v>

57
00:02:26.961 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 1>those two sets of operations.</v>

58
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.683
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>

59
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 1>And the way that manifests itself in your subjective experiences as meaningful</v>

60
00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:35.864
<v Speaker 1>engagement.</v>

61
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>And so that's not a bad first pass.</v>

62
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.530
<v Speaker 1>What would you say?</v>

63
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Justification for the view that these two domains are the most real domains.</v>

64
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.961
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

65
00:02:50.961 --> 00:02:51.830
<v Speaker 1>so order.</v>

66
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.963
<v Speaker 1>What is order?</v>

67
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 1>if you just sit there and do nothing,</v>

69
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.090
<v Speaker 1>that will be chaos.</v>

70
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:00.423
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

71
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 1>because you'll,</v>

73
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>you'll suffer and die.</v>

74
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>That's what will happen.</v>

75
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>So without action on your part,</v>

76
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>deterioration and death is a certainty.</v>

77
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.591
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

78
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>So you need to act well then we built on an action platform.</v>

79
00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're the consequence of</v>

80
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 1>3 billion years of evolution for action,</v>

81
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.251
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>

82
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:32.251
<v Speaker 1>movement forward in the face of necessity is the prime dictum of life.</v>

83
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

84
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Were embodied action.</v>

85
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>What do you have to do when you act?</v>

86
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>at minimum you have to do whatever keeps you able to act.</v>

88
00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>These are truisms,</v>

89
00:03:44.411 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

90
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

91
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.510
<v Speaker 1>you have to have something to eat.</v>

92
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.310
<v Speaker 1>You have to have some fresh water.</v>

93
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.570
<v Speaker 1>You need some shelter,</v>

94
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

95
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>You need some companionship.</v>

96
00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You need a sexual partner,</v>

97
00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>you need children,</v>

98
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>you need play.</v>

99
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>You need to be touched.</v>

100
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.683
<v Speaker 1>There's there's,</v>

101
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.470
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>

102
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I actually mean need by the way.</v>

103
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>People deprived to play go insane.</v>

104
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.920
<v Speaker 1>People who aren't touched,</v>

105
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.933
<v Speaker 1>die.</v>

106
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.500
<v Speaker 1>These things are necessary.</v>

107
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.020
<v Speaker 1>assuming that survival itself is necessary,</v>

109
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>but we'll start with that.</v>

110
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.960
<v Speaker 1>We'll start with the assumption that just sitting there and suffering and dying</v>

111
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>is not the right solution.</v>

112
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:23.261
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

113
00:04:23.261 --> 00:04:24.760
<v Speaker 1>So you have to act in the world.</v>

114
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.890
<v Speaker 1>You have to act in the world that in a manner that stops you from deteriorating</v>

115
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 1>and dying at minimum.</v>

116
00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>And that means that you have to address the problems that are intrinsic to that</v>

117
00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.503
<v Speaker 1>destiny.</v>

118
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.090
<v Speaker 1>Now you have all sorts of systems that evolved,</v>

119
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 1>have evolved to help you do that.</v>

120
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:42.730
<v Speaker 1>Motivational systems,</v>

121
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:43.601
<v Speaker 1>we have to eat.</v>

122
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:44.500
<v Speaker 1>So you get hungry.</v>

123
00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>You have to find water and consume it so you get thirsty.</v>

124
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>You get lonely,</v>

125
00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.830
<v Speaker 1>you get curious.</v>

126
00:04:50.831 --> 00:04:51.280
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

127
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.730
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

128
00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>there's specialized biological systems that are very,</v>

129
00:04:54.671 --> 00:04:55.504
<v Speaker 1>very old.</v>

130
00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 1>You get aggressive,</v>

131
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>you get afraid,</v>

132
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.850
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

133
00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 1>you suffer pain,</v>

134
00:04:59.070 --> 00:04:59.520
<v Speaker 1>all those,</v>

135
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 1>there's specialized systems for all of those unit directional systems of</v>

136
00:05:04.031 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 1>orientation in the world.</v>

137
00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:06.820
<v Speaker 1>And they help you figure out what to do.</v>

138
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>So when you're hungry,</v>

139
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:08.471
<v Speaker 1>it's time to eat.</v>

140
00:05:08.471 --> 00:05:09.500
<v Speaker 1>And when you're thirsty it's,</v>

141
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.420
<v Speaker 1>it's time to drink.</v>

142
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.280
<v Speaker 1>And when your lonesome,</v>

143
00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.510
<v Speaker 1>it's time to seek out some companionship.</v>

144
00:05:13.511 --> 00:05:16.960
<v Speaker 1>And you have specialized systems that help you do that.</v>

145
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.670
<v Speaker 1>But they're not enough because,</v>

146
00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:19.931
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

147
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>they're not very bright.</v>

148
00:05:20.861 --> 00:05:22.090
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

149
00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of uni dimensional and you also have the problem of organizing all</v>

150
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:25.841
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

151
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:26.171
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

152
00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:26.291
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

153
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to eat now and you have to drink now and you need a companion.</v>

154
00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>It's probably time to play and you have to do something about shelter.</v>

155
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>And there isn't just you right now.</v>

156
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:38.470
<v Speaker 1>There's you now and tomorrow and next week and a year from now and five years</v>

157
00:05:38.471 --> 00:05:38.831
<v Speaker 1>from now.</v>

158
00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:43.330
<v Speaker 1>So you have to plan across all those stretches of time and there isn't just you</v>

159
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>now in the future,</v>

160
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:44.591
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

161
00:05:44.591 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>there's you plus your family and your community and so all of that has to be</v>

162
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 1>taken into account while you're plotting your movement forward is very,</v>

163
00:05:53.261 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>

164
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>You have all these problems to solve simile,</v>

165
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>tiniest [inaudible] and your motivational systems,</v>

166
00:05:58.671 --> 00:05:59.151
<v Speaker 1>anger,</v>

167
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>hunger and so forth can help you solve one of those problems now,</v>

168
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 1>but not all of them permanently.</v>

169
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>That requires higher cognitive function and that's part of what drove the</v>

170
00:06:10.191 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>evolution of our complex cognitive systems.</v>

171
00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>That's how do you propagate the game across time in a complex environment.</v>

172
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>The left hemisphere operates when,</v>

173
00:06:21.351 --> 00:06:21.770
<v Speaker 1>where,</v>

174
00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.770
<v Speaker 1>when what you're doing works and so a lot of what you do during your life is to</v>

175
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:29.000
<v Speaker 1>keep your right hemisphere off.</v>

176
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.390
<v Speaker 1>People don't like it going on accidentally.</v>

177
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:34.100
<v Speaker 1>It's the home of negative emotion.</v>

178
00:06:34.101 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the home of pain and anxiety.</v>

179
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.280
<v Speaker 1>It's the thing that turns on and freezes you in your tracks when something that</v>

180
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:45.281
<v Speaker 1>you deeply did not expect happens and it prepares you to deal with the onslaught</v>

181
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 1>of what you didn't expect.</v>

182
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Now it's not all bad news because to use the right hemisphere in a judicious</v>

183
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 1>manner is also something that adds intrigue and interest in artistic expression</v>

184
00:06:57.921 --> 00:07:00.320
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of positive things to your life.</v>

185
00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:04.010
<v Speaker 1>So because potential is not only negative,</v>

186
00:07:04.011 --> 00:07:05.060
<v Speaker 1>it's also positive,</v>

187
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>it can be,</v>

188
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>it can be dealt with in ways that are deeply enriching and meaningful</v>

189
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.063
<v Speaker 1>order.</v>

190
00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:13.461
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

191
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:14.840
<v Speaker 1>so you have to do something.</v>

192
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise the consequences are dire.</v>

193
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.500
<v Speaker 1>To do something you have to value something.</v>

194
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It's it's,</v>

195
00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:27.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a definitional issue because to do something is to act out the proposition</v>

196
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.270
<v Speaker 1>that the thing you're doing,</v>

197
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>the thing you're aiming at,</v>

198
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's preferable to the thing you have and preferable means you'll do</v>

199
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

200
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 1>So those things are tied together so tightly.</v>

201
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.720
<v Speaker 1>You can't disentangle them.</v>

202
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.093
<v Speaker 1>If you say,</v>

203
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm aiming at x,</v>

204
00:07:41.961 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>but I don't value it,</v>

205
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>then there's something wrong with the way that you're conceptualizing the</v>

206
00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:47.324
<v Speaker 1>statement.</v>

207
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 1>Because to aim at something and to work to bring it into existence is the same</v>

208
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:53.324
<v Speaker 1>as valuing it.</v>

209
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.261
<v Speaker 1>And if you say,</v>

210
00:07:54.261 --> 00:07:54.471
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

211
00:07:54.471 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't value it,</v>

212
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 1>then something's out of kilter.</v>

213
00:07:57.110 --> 00:08:00.920
<v Speaker 1>Either you're acting out a false hood or you don't know what you're talking</v>

214
00:08:00.921 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

215
00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those two things and you meet people like that are deeply confused</v>

216
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

217
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Their action patterns and their verbal self representation don't Mesh,</v>

218
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that they're critics of value.</v>

219
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:16.910
<v Speaker 1>It just means that they're deeply confused.</v>

220
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>So you have to act or you suffer.</v>

221
00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 1>In order to act,</v>

222
00:08:21.111 --> 00:08:25.040
<v Speaker 1>you have to have a value structure because to act you have to value one thing</v>

223
00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:25.940
<v Speaker 1>more than another,</v>

224
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>which means that you have to inhabit a structure of value.</v>

225
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:31.123
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

226
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.863
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

227
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.080
<v Speaker 1>so you need a structure value because it's the antidote to catastrophe.</v>

228
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.393
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

229
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.640
<v Speaker 1>if you act out a structure of values socially,</v>

230
00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.560
<v Speaker 1>which you will cause you're social,</v>

231
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to pursue your aims in isolation because you're not,</v>

232
00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:52.910
<v Speaker 1>you're not a solitary animal.</v>

233
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>You're a social animal,</v>

234
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>you're a tribal animal.</v>

235
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>Deeply tribal.</v>

236
00:08:58.530 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>We live in groups,</v>

237
00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:00.840
<v Speaker 1>we live in families,</v>

238
00:09:00.841 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>we live in communities.</v>

239
00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:07.100
<v Speaker 1>We live in large societies were social at every level of analysis and we've been</v>

240
00:09:07.591 --> 00:09:11.520
<v Speaker 1>social for as long as we've been primates.</v>

241
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>So maybe that's,</v>

242
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:17.940
<v Speaker 1>that's at least 6 million years and it might be more like 60 million years.</v>

243
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>It's really a long time.</v>

244
00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's not an arbitrary social construction.</v>

245
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:24.751
<v Speaker 1>It's far,</v>

246
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>far deeper than that.</v>

247
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Now what happens when you act out a structure of value in a social environment,</v>

248
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>you produce a hierarchy inevitably.</v>

249
00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:36.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

250
00:09:36.491 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 1>let's think it through.</v>

251
00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.453
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

252
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:39.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

253
00:09:39.301 --> 00:09:43.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you say that one thing is more worth doing then another,</v>

254
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:44.820
<v Speaker 1>whatever happens to be,</v>

255
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.360
<v Speaker 1>and then you tell a bunch of people about what you're doing and they decide that</v>

256
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come along and help you do this thing that's valuable because</v>

257
00:09:51.181 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 1>they also think it's valuable and maybe you get 20 people together to do this</v>

258
00:09:55.651 --> 00:09:56.160
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

259
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.420
<v Speaker 1>whatever it happens to me.</v>

260
00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.900
<v Speaker 1>And the first thing you discover is that some of the people are way better at</v>

261
00:10:00.901 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>doing whatever it is that they're doing than other people.</v>

262
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

263
00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.550
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

264
00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>and who knows why that is?</v>

265
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>Because it depends on what you chose to do,</v>

266
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.911
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

267
00:10:08.911 --> 00:10:09.691
<v Speaker 1>If you chose a,</v>

268
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>then it would be a different group of people who were good at it.</v>

269
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Then if you chose B,</v>

270
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>because people differ in their abilities.</v>

271
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:20.730
<v Speaker 1>But one thing you will not escape from if you make an organization to do</v>

272
00:10:20.731 --> 00:10:25.731
<v Speaker 1>something valuable is the brute fact that it will be a minority of the people</v>

273
00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.510
<v Speaker 1>who are good at doing it.</v>

274
00:10:28.290 --> 00:10:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And there's actually a law,</v>

275
00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:31.170
<v Speaker 1>it's called price's law,</v>

276
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.180
<v Speaker 1>and it's a real law,</v>

277
00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:38.450
<v Speaker 1>even governs the size of cities and the massive stars in the heights of plants</v>

278
00:10:38.791 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>in the jungle.</v>

279
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't govern human interactions.</v>

280
00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.380
<v Speaker 1>And price's law says that the square root of the number of people engaged in an</v>

281
00:10:46.381 --> 00:10:46.921
<v Speaker 1>enterprise,</v>

282
00:10:46.921 --> 00:10:48.030
<v Speaker 1>we'll do half the work.</v>

283
00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you have 10 people doing something,</v>

284
00:10:51.001 --> 00:10:51.451
<v Speaker 1>three of them,</v>

285
00:10:51.451 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 1>we'll do half the work.</v>

286
00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.330
<v Speaker 1>But if you have a hundred people doing something,</v>

287
00:10:54.331 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>then 10 of them will do half the work.</v>

288
00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.180
<v Speaker 1>And if you have 10,000 people doing something than a hundred of them,</v>

289
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 1>we'll do half the work.</v>

290
00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:02.730
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

291
00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:07.590
<v Speaker 1>you know how wealth distributes itself such that a minority of people have most</v>

292
00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:08.424
<v Speaker 1>of the money,</v>

293
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:12.300
<v Speaker 1>1285 richest people in the world have as much money as the bottom,</v>

294
00:11:12.301 --> 00:11:13.320
<v Speaker 1>two and a half billion.</v>

295
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

296
00:11:14.730 --> 00:11:15.570
<v Speaker 1>And everybody goes,</v>

297
00:11:15.571 --> 00:11:16.404
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

298
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 1>the 1% it's like,</v>

299
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:18.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

300
00:11:18.631 --> 00:11:19.141
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

301
00:11:19.141 --> 00:11:22.710
<v Speaker 1>you're all the 1% so get over yourself because you're,</v>

302
00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:23.693
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

303
00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 1>western European,</v>

304
00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:29.640
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking and by world current world standards,</v>

305
00:11:29.641 --> 00:11:31.530
<v Speaker 1>and certainly by historical standards,</v>

306
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.850
<v Speaker 1>you're all well ensconced in the 1% so if that's a problem,</v>

307
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.760
<v Speaker 1>well it's a problem for all of you.</v>

308
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.080
<v Speaker 1>And some of you might be,</v>

309
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

310
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.790
<v Speaker 1>richer than that,</v>

311
00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean all of you aren't in the same boat.</v>

312
00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:45.653
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>

313
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 1>the fact that wealth aggregates in the hands of a small number of people is part</v>

314
00:11:51.061 --> 00:11:53.040
<v Speaker 1>of the general expression of price's.</v>

315
00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.170
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing special about the distribution of money.</v>

316
00:11:56.410 --> 00:11:58.840
<v Speaker 1>You see the same thing in every creative domain.</v>

317
00:11:59.500 --> 00:11:59.681
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

318
00:11:59.681 --> 00:12:02.170
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have have recorded a</v>

319
00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 1>gold record?</v>

320
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 1>How many looks like zero up?</v>

321
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 1>There's one,</v>

322
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:11.620
<v Speaker 1>one person,</v>

323
00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:12.131
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

324
00:12:12.131 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 1>there's 850 people in here.</v>

325
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So there's one in a thousand so that's one 10th of 1% something like that.</v>

326
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.470
<v Speaker 1>How many of you have written a piano concerto?</v>

327
00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>How about painted a painting that's hanging in a national museum?</v>

328
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.231
<v Speaker 1>Oh look,</v>

329
00:12:29.231 --> 00:12:30.310
<v Speaker 1>it's none of you again.</v>

330
00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

331
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:31.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

332
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 1>and how many of you have been a member of a professional sports team?</v>

333
00:12:36.610 --> 00:12:36.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

334
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 1>look up one one.</v>

335
00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:39.640
<v Speaker 1>So that's one in a thousand.</v>

336
00:12:39.790 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Well you get the point here.</v>

337
00:12:41.370 --> 00:12:42.161
<v Speaker 1>Well if there was a couple,</v>

338
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:42.490
<v Speaker 1>there was.</v>

339
00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:42.791
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

340
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:46.570
<v Speaker 1>so it looks like it's easier to be a member of a professional sports team</v>

341
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.950
<v Speaker 1>or my or my audiences is biased.</v>

342
00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:52.780
<v Speaker 1>The samples biased but,</v>

343
00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:54.101
<v Speaker 1>but it is the case.</v>

344
00:12:54.101 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 1>If you look at high levels of creative achievement of the sort of just described</v>

345
00:12:58.060 --> 00:12:58.570
<v Speaker 1>they can,</v>

346
00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.540
<v Speaker 1>they characterize it staggering minority of people.</v>

347
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And so the rule is is that you produce a value system which you better produce</v>

348
00:13:08.081 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you suffer and die.</v>

349
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.291
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't the only,</v>

350
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.520
<v Speaker 1>the only that it's like,</v>

351
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:13.120
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

352
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.530
<v Speaker 1>here's something else you all know.</v>

353
00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:15.910
<v Speaker 1>As far as I can tell,</v>

354
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.040
<v Speaker 1>we start with the idea that there's an intrinsic,</v>

355
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:26.110
<v Speaker 1>chaotic element to life and that includes the inevitability of suffering and</v>

356
00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.380
<v Speaker 1>malevolence betrayal at the hands of yourself and other people.</v>

357
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's the baseline.</v>

358
00:13:31.451 --> 00:13:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's intolerable in many ways because life is in many ways intolerable.</v>

359
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.701
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

360
00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:36.821
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

361
00:13:36.821 --> 00:13:39.070
<v Speaker 1>what do you do in the face of something that's intolerable?</v>

362
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.990
<v Speaker 1>And answer is,</v>

363
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:42.070
<v Speaker 1>will you try to find something that justifies it right?</v>

364
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:46.600
<v Speaker 1>You want to have something that gets you the hell out of bed in the morning and</v>

365
00:13:46.601 --> 00:13:48.220
<v Speaker 1>not just any old morning,</v>

366
00:13:48.221 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 1>but a morning when your father has Alzheimer's disease and your daughter has an</v>

367
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:56.380
<v Speaker 1>incurable illness because you need something to get out of bed for in those</v>

368
00:13:56.381 --> 00:13:57.280
<v Speaker 1>mornings too.</v>

369
00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.640
<v Speaker 1>And that better be the purpose that you found in life.</v>

370
00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:04.450
<v Speaker 1>And if the purpose is going to be such that it gets you out of bed in those</v>

371
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 1>mornings,</v>

372
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.620
<v Speaker 1>it better be a pretty damn noble purpose because otherwise,</v>

373
00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:09.880
<v Speaker 1>why would you bother?</v>

374
00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.430
<v Speaker 1>And so not only do you need a value structure,</v>

375
00:14:12.431 --> 00:14:16.300
<v Speaker 1>you need one that's of sufficient tension,</v>

376
00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:17.134
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

377
00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:22.200
<v Speaker 1>or sufficient value or sufficient nobility so that it's worth suffering for</v>

378
00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:26.350
<v Speaker 1>because you're going to suffer and you better have something that makes the</v>

379
00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:27.820
<v Speaker 1>suffering justifiable.</v>
