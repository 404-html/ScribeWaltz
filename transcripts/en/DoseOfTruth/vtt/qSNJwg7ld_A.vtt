00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm managing the homelessness.</v>

2
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Homeless people have schizophrenia.</v>

3
00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Schizophrenia is a genetic disorder.</v>

4
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Nobody knows what the Jews are or how they work,</v>

5
00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.470
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty clear there's a genetic component.</v>

6
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>If you can find the g,</v>

7
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>figure out what they do and come up with real good treatments.</v>

8
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:37.031
<v Speaker 1>If black shores for schizophrenia and possibly preventions for schizophrenia,</v>

9
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>that indirectly is going to help alleviate the homeless problem.</v>

10
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

11
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what to do about the homeless,</v>

12
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 1>but if you can figure out what to do about schizophrenia,</v>

13
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.210
<v Speaker 1>that's going to have some impact on that.</v>

14
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.811
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

15
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:51.591
<v Speaker 1>It's basically,</v>

16
00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:51.831
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

17
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:56.540
<v Speaker 1>we'll use your claim to some degree is that these more complex social problems</v>

18
00:00:56.541 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>should be decomposed into isolatable micro problems and its specific solutions</v>

19
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:02.240
<v Speaker 1>should be sought for them.</v>

20
00:01:02.241 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>And now that's certainly strikes me as an appropriate approach because everybody</v>

21
00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:06.921
<v Speaker 1>is different.</v>

22
00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone is the same reason.</v>

23
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

24
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.891
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

25
00:01:09.891 --> 00:01:10.730
<v Speaker 1>Well that's for sure.</v>

26
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure won't be on everyone's port for the same route for the same</v>

27
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:15.710
<v Speaker 1>reason that any stretch of the imagination.</v>

28
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.971
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

29
00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:17.691
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is,</v>

30
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have one,</v>

31
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 1>because you know what,</v>

32
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.143
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

33
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>and it's not nearly caused by lack of money either,</v>

34
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 1>because that would be a much easier problem to solve,</v>

35
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:27.921
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

36
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:28.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not so simple.</v>

37
00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>So the one thing that we're probably getting toward the end,</v>

38
00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:36.080
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I would like to leave your listeners with is really optimism.</v>

39
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.260
<v Speaker 1>These are not dismal problems in perpetuity because the genetic approach,</v>

40
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.363
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

41
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.921
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>

42
00:01:43.921 --> 00:01:45.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm kinda out,</v>

43
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

44
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of out there on this.</v>

45
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>This is not a mainstream view,</v>

46
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think the more something is generic,</v>

47
00:01:50.751 --> 00:01:53.270
<v Speaker 1>the more likely it is we can change it for the good.</v>

48
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's why we just should study the genetics of intelligence.</v>

49
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>That's why I hope genes have more to do with it.</v>

50
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.450
<v Speaker 1>That environment.</v>
