1
00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.550
<v Speaker 2>So don't be thinking that the things that appeared in front of you are merely</v>

3
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.990
<v Speaker 2>objects because they're not,</v>

4
00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I started thinking about this for example,</v>

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 2>when I was thinking about people going down to Graceland to look at Elvis</v>

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 2>Guitar,</v>

8
00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:23.683
<v Speaker 2>you think,</v>

9
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.750
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is it that makes a guitar Elvis and his guitar?</v>

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.711
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

11
00:00:30.711 --> 00:00:35.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly the guitar because it's just sitting there like any old guitar,</v>

12
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:35.811
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

13
00:00:35.811 --> 00:00:37.160
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you could even think about it.</v>

14
00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:40.160
<v Speaker 2>You could take that and guitar out and he could put another guitar in that look</v>

15
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 2>just like it and it would still be all of us as guitar cause no one would know.</v>

16
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.541
<v Speaker 2>And you might think,</v>

17
00:00:44.541 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 2>well then that's not really,</v>

18
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.210
<v Speaker 2>Elvis has guitar.</v>

19
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 2>But that's a funny thing because you would only think that if you thought that</v>

20
00:00:52.251 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 2>Elvis is guitar was the thing that was made out of material that was sitting</v>

21
00:00:55.611 --> 00:00:56.480
<v Speaker 2>right in front of you.</v>

22
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.670
<v Speaker 2>And that isn't what it is.</v>

23
00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 2>That's only one tiny little bit of it.</v>

24
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.300
<v Speaker 2>That bloody thing is,</v>

25
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.140
<v Speaker 2>is a part of an incredibly layered reality.</v>

26
00:01:06.141 --> 00:01:06.740
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

27
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.573
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

28
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 2>the people who want to go look at that,</v>

29
00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.660
<v Speaker 2>they're looking at it in some sense because of the magic that's emanating from</v>

30
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:14.781
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

31
00:01:14.781 --> 00:01:16.460
<v Speaker 2>But the magic is actually real.</v>

32
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:17.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

33
00:01:17.061 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 2>the magic is the effect of that guitar,</v>

34
00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:20.271
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

35
00:01:20.271 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 2>on the entire culture.</v>

36
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.500
<v Speaker 2>And those effects are the damn guitar too.</v>

37
00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.410
<v Speaker 2>And it's weird because when you go look at Elvis Guitar,</v>

38
00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.120
<v Speaker 2>you don't have looking at the guitar,</v>

39
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.590
<v Speaker 2>you're looking at the magic.</v>

40
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 2>And weirdly enough,</v>

41
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 2>the magic is actually real.</v>

42
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

43
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:37.580
<v Speaker 2>you can't think that way if you're a materialist because you think that the</v>

44
00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:38.720
<v Speaker 2>thing is the material.</v>

45
00:01:38.721 --> 00:01:39.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

46
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.561
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

47
00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

48
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.660
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you another story.</v>

49
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 2>So when the,</v>

50
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.640
<v Speaker 2>when the Europeans came to the South Pacific islands,</v>

51
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.440
<v Speaker 2>the South Pacific islanders,</v>

52
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.610
<v Speaker 2>because there weren't that many of them,</v>

53
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have a very high,</v>

54
00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 2>highly technical society,</v>

55
00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:53.241
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

56
00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:58.241
<v Speaker 2>And so like if you were like Joe Dominant guy in a Pacific island culture,</v>

57
00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

58
00:01:59.901 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 2>you might be able to have a stone ax,</v>

59
00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:05.510
<v Speaker 2>like a well made stone ax because going make a stone ax and see how long that</v>

60
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:05.900
<v Speaker 2>takes you.</v>

61
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

62
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.680
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

63
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 2>that's a bit of work.</v>

64
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're a high status guy,</v>

65
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:12.980
<v Speaker 2>if you've really worked your whole life to be at the top of your Damn pyramid,</v>

66
00:02:12.981 --> 00:02:13.520
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>

67
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 2>maybe you get head to access.</v>

68
00:02:15.111 --> 00:02:15.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

69
00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:16.640
<v Speaker 2>it's like a red letter day.</v>

70
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.250
<v Speaker 2>You've got two axes,</v>

71
00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

72
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.070
<v Speaker 2>which is more than any other animal has by a lot.</v>

73
00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.480
<v Speaker 2>So it's not trivial.</v>

74
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 2>And then the damn missionaries come in and they,</v>

75
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.430
<v Speaker 2>and they set up shop and what do they bring?</v>

76
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Steel axes.</v>

77
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.680
<v Speaker 2>It's like that's kind of a downer.</v>

78
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.340
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

79
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.820
<v Speaker 2>you've worked your whole damn life to get these stone axes and that makes you</v>

80
00:02:37.821 --> 00:02:41.690
<v Speaker 2>like head tribesmen and then you want your kid wanders down to the local</v>

81
00:02:41.691 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 2>missionaries and they say,</v>

82
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.281
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

83
00:02:43.281 --> 00:02:44.780
<v Speaker 2>we got an extra steel ax here.</v>

84
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you take that back home?</v>

85
00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.971
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

86
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:51.050
<v Speaker 2>it's so shocking because not only did the missionaries have this thing that is</v>

87
00:02:51.051 --> 00:02:52.730
<v Speaker 2>so much better than a steel ax,</v>

88
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:55.130
<v Speaker 2>it's like a jet plane compared to a,</v>

89
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

90
00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.930
<v Speaker 2>to a wheeled cart.</v>

91
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Like they're really,</v>

92
00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>really different.</v>

93
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.510
<v Speaker 2>But the missionaries,</v>

94
00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 2>they don't even notice.</v>

95
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 2>That's the horrible thing about it.</v>

96
00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:05.734
<v Speaker 2>It's like the giveaway,</v>

97
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 2>this thing that hasn't been virtually infinite value,</v>

98
00:03:08.231 --> 00:03:08.681
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>

99
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:08.901
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

100
00:03:08.901 --> 00:03:09.371
<v Speaker 2>it's okay.</v>

101
00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:09.701
<v Speaker 2>We got,</v>

102
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:09.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

103
00:03:09.891 --> 00:03:12.410
<v Speaker 2>a couple dozen of those sitting in the store room and you know,</v>

104
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.900
<v Speaker 2>we're just willing to hand them out.</v>

105
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 2>It was a little demoralizing.</v>

106
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>It was a little demoralizing for the Pacific Islanders,</v>

107
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.601
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

108
00:03:19.601 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 2>why was it an ax that the missionaries gave away?</v>

110
00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.473
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't.</v>

111
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 2>You'd think that if you are a Westerner and you had a bunch of access,</v>

112
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:29.411
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

113
00:03:29.411 --> 00:03:29.591
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

114
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.311
<v Speaker 2>that's an ax.</v>

115
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:30.611
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

116
00:03:30.611 --> 00:03:30.881
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

117
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:31.714
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

118
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot more than an ax,</v>

119
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.233
<v Speaker 2>a lot more.</v>

120
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a weapon to bring down a whole culture accidentally.</v>
