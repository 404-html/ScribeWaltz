1
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>So the last time,</v>

2
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.690
<v Speaker 1>last lecture I ended with the Abrahamic stories with the death of Sarah and that</v>

3
00:00:15.361 --> 00:00:16.470
<v Speaker 1>was Abraham's wife.</v>

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.710
<v Speaker 1>And so we're going to continue from from there.</v>

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Remember Abraham had a son,</v>

6
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.141
<v Speaker 1>Isaac,</v>

7
00:00:22.141 --> 00:00:25.200
<v Speaker 1>and he was asked by God to sacrifice his son,</v>

8
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:30.201
<v Speaker 1>which we talked about in some depth and I was attempting to make the case that,</v>

9
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

10
00:00:33.061 --> 00:00:35.850
<v Speaker 1>the idea of sacrifice was one of human kinds,</v>

11
00:00:35.851 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>great discoveries because it meant the discovery of the future,</v>

12
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:40.830
<v Speaker 1>it essentially,</v>

13
00:00:40.831 --> 00:00:44.160
<v Speaker 1>but it also meant the discovery that the future was something that you could</v>

14
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:47.190
<v Speaker 1>make a bargain with and that you could give up something now,</v>

15
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>something impulsive,</v>

16
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.340
<v Speaker 1>some pleasure,</v>

17
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.330
<v Speaker 1>even a deep pleasure in the moment.</v>

18
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.640
<v Speaker 1>And you could strive and hypothetically you could make a covenant,</v>

19
00:00:55.641 --> 00:00:57.090
<v Speaker 1>a bargain with the future.</v>

20
00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And if your sacrifices were acceptable and that seemed to mean ethically</v>

21
00:01:01.651 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>acceptable,</v>

22
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 1>you had to sacrifice the right thing,</v>

23
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>that that vastly increased the probability that not only you would be</v>

24
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

25
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.990
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

26
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>but that your descendants would be too.</v>

27
00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that that's an irrational proposition.</v>

28
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to leave in it a bit with the realization that sometimes you</v>

29
00:01:20.251 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

30
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 1>you get sliced off at the knees no matter what,</v>

31
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.311
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

32
00:01:23.311 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Because life has an arbitrary element and and that can't be tossed out.</v>

33
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:31.020
<v Speaker 1>But building in the arbitrary element,</v>

34
00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>we'll say you still want to think,</v>

35
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>well what's your best bat given a certain amount of randomness.</v>

36
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:41.091
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to me that conscious self aware sacrifice and proper ethical</v>

37
00:01:42.151 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>striving is your best bet.</v>

38
00:01:43.741 --> 00:01:44.750
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

39
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>there's another idea that I've always explained it when I've explained it to</v>

40
00:01:50.341 --> 00:01:50.701
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

41
00:01:50.701 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 1>I've always used the movie Pinocchio as an example.</v>

42
00:01:53.281 --> 00:01:58.281
<v Speaker 1>You know that when Japan was trying to make his puppet into a self aware and</v>

43
00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.410
<v Speaker 1>autonomous moral agent,</v>

44
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>which is what he wants above all else,</v>

45
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

46
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:08.070
<v Speaker 1>he aims at the highest good that he can conceive,</v>

47
00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 1>which is the star that he prays to essentially and hopes for the transformation.</v>

48
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.370
<v Speaker 1>And there's also something in that that's unutterably profound and maybe that is</v>

49
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>somewhat independent of the idea that you have to believe in God.</v>

50
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I would also say that what it means to believe in God in the Old Testament is by</v>

51
00:02:25.741 --> 00:02:26.790
<v Speaker 1>no means clear.</v>

52
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And that's something I also really want to talk about tonight.</v>

53
00:02:29.491 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious what it means and well,</v>

54
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:35.580
<v Speaker 1>Japan know what he does,</v>

55
00:02:35.581 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 1>at least is aim at the highest good of which he can conceive.</v>

56
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.411
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>and that that's actually been a philosophical definition of God upon occasion,</v>

58
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:46.950
<v Speaker 1>that God is the highest good of which you conceive.</v>

59
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.383
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

60
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:50.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>that's different than the idea of a transcendent being.</v>

62
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.661
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

63
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>But it's in line with,</v>

64
00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.280
<v Speaker 1>it's inline with certain interesting psychoanalytic speculations.</v>

65
00:02:59.281 --> 00:03:01.410
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the things I really liked about Carl Young.</v>

66
00:03:01.411 --> 00:03:01.740
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
