00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>When I just mentioned things like,</v>

2
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the greatest advancements in medicine,</v>

4
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:22.261
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

5
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:23.094
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.420
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>basically human civilization has complimented particularly white men.</v>

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually called a bigot and a Nazi and all sorts of things.</v>

10
00:00:32.581 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>So I wonder if these words now outright this,</v>

11
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:40.431
<v Speaker 1>that have no power and they're just used against anyone who doesn't tow the</v>

12
00:00:40.591 --> 00:00:41.191
<v Speaker 1>party line.</v>

13
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:41.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 2>well they're definitely,</v>

15
00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 2>while in the thing about a thing about the,</v>

16
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.910
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

17
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:45.743
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

18
00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.020
<v Speaker 2>let's say the disproportionate contribution of European,</v>

19
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 2>a small number of European men over the last 600 years,</v>

20
00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.054
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

21
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.390
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you could go all the way back to the Greeks if you're willing to call them</v>

22
00:00:58.391 --> 00:00:58.991
<v Speaker 2>European,</v>

23
00:00:58.991 --> 00:00:59.510
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

24
00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

25
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 2>perhaps you could get away with.</v>

26
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

27
00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.890
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

28
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 2>it's a drop in the ocean by historical standards.</v>

29
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 2>And of course now that the entire world is linked together by,</v>

30
00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.340
<v Speaker 2>by electronic communication and education is available to far more people,</v>

31
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.174
<v Speaker 2>you see that,</v>

32
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.303
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

33
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.580
<v Speaker 2>contributions to the world's knowledge are being made at an incredible rate by</v>

34
00:01:21.581 --> 00:01:22.750
<v Speaker 2>people all over the world.</v>

35
00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 2>And so now again,</v>

36
00:01:23.691 --> 00:01:25.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a historical accident in some ways,</v>

37
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 2>not precisely an accident,</v>

38
00:01:28.061 --> 00:01:30.670
<v Speaker 2>but as historical accident.</v>

39
00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 2>Let's use that term that some of these technologies for learning and discovery</v>

40
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 2>happened to be established in Europe and,</v>

41
00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.420
<v Speaker 2>and that gave Europeans of technological advantage and also the opportunity to</v>

42
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 2>contribute in a major way to new disciplines.</v>

43
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:48.040
<v Speaker 2>But that's being distributed.</v>

44
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.041
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you think origins,</v>

46
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>like we have to give credit where credit's due,</v>

47
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:53.870
<v Speaker 1>like the Aba Aviation,</v>

48
00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:54.740
<v Speaker 1>automobile,</v>

49
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

50
00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>many of the diseases cures like the origin really did come from Mensa matter how</v>

51
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 1>much feminist rant and rave.</v>

52
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>There is just no denying this,</v>

53
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:09.041
<v Speaker 1>that human societies have advanced tremendously because of these achievements.</v>

54
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

55
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:11.580
<v Speaker 2>there is no doubt about that.</v>

56
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:11.940
<v Speaker 2>And then it's,</v>

57
00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

58
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 2>And that it's a relatively small number of people who've contributed immensely.</v>

59
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:16.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

60
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 2>you see the same thing now you see the same thing now that there's a handful of</v>

61
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:23.400
<v Speaker 2>remarkable inventors that,</v>

62
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.850
<v Speaker 2>that are literally changing the world in front of our eyes.</v>

63
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 2>And it is the case that it's often a very small number of people who change the</v>

64
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 2>world in that manner.</v>

65
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.030
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

66
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.140
<v Speaker 1>look at Mark Zuckerberg.</v>

67
00:02:36.141 --> 00:02:36.411
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>I was reading like Facebook is used by a billion people,</v>

69
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.790
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

70
00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.611
<v Speaker 1>like a day,</v>

71
00:02:40.611 --> 00:02:41.880
<v Speaker 1>or I don't know if it was a day or,</v>

72
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy number of people.</v>

73
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.100
<v Speaker 1>Astonishing.</v>

74
00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
