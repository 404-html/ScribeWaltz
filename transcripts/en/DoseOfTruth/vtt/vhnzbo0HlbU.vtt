00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>It can be articulated speech on ways that people stretch themselves out and</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>dreams can shed light on things that sometimes it might take you a decade to</v>

3
00:00:10.141 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>figure out because dreams are the birthplace of thought.</v>

4
00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not like fully articulated thoughts.</v>

5
00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Just hear in your head and no development in history.</v>

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.391
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

7
00:00:20.391 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>we don't really know how thoughts appear in your head at all.</v>

8
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.420
<v Speaker 1>It's a mystery,</v>

9
00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's certainly the case that they just arise out of the dream is part of the</v>

10
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 1>process by which the thoughts emerge.</v>

11
00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.610
<v Speaker 1>So you could say that the dream stands in the same relationship to your thought</v>

12
00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>that art stands in relationship to a culture.</v>

13
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.603
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

14
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Or you can say that dream stand in the same relationship to your thought.</v>

15
00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:48.560
<v Speaker 1>As religious imagery stands in relationship to the culture.</v>

16
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>The religious imagery of your culture is like this dream to interview,</v>

17
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.890
<v Speaker 1>and so I've had lots of clients like I didn't do dream work with all my clients</v>

18
00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 1>because not all my clients remember the dreams,</v>

19
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.450
<v Speaker 1>but some of them remember that three or four nights and we would assess them,</v>

20
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:07.490
<v Speaker 1>discuss them,</v>

21
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>talk them through trying to make sense of the cost.</v>

22
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Often I believe so it's down here.</v>

23
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.280
<v Speaker 1>There's another thing that's really interesting.</v>

24
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Dreams is you know,</v>

25
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>because you don't really have conscious control over them.</v>

26
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>They don't live in I.</v>

27
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Whatever a dream tells you this is the truth.</v>

28
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.560
<v Speaker 1>You might not be able to understanding just the dream is trying to be mystical</v>

29
00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:34.490
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>

30
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.480
<v Speaker 1>It's that the dream is trying to express something that you don't fully</v>

31
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>understand it in the best possible way.</v>

32
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 1>That you can understand that as a NAC and that might not be very good,</v>

33
00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 1>but it's accurate,</v>

34
00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.570
<v Speaker 1>is a dream is something that comes directly from nature.</v>

35
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not you.</v>

36
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>It's more like it's something that happens to you.</v>

37
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It's worth paying attention.</v>

38
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>You can learn a lot from frames.</v>

39
00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.053
<v Speaker 1>It's not simple,</v>

40
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes it is,</v>

41
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:01.880
<v Speaker 1>sometimes what they need is clear,</v>

42
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case.</v>

43
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.470
<v Speaker 1>The more you work on them,</v>

44
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.323
<v Speaker 1>the deeper they get.</v>

45
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.360
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

46
00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.630
<v Speaker 1>and you could see around corners,</v>

47
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that surprising,</v>

48
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.023
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

49
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.300
<v Speaker 1>the purpose of thoughts to be pathetic prepare you for</v>

50
00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm from the Soviet Union and a lot of your commentary about the tyranny and the</v>

51
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.370
<v Speaker 2>vomit that took place there helped healthy process a lot of,</v>

52
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

53
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.163
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

54
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 2>my best memories of something that I'm going to ask is how do I make peace with</v>

55
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 2>the fact that most,</v>

56
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the victims of the Soviet theory under the communist tyranny and in</v>

57
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:56.844
<v Speaker 2>other countries,</v>

58
00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.130
<v Speaker 2>we're also the ones that brought it on themselves as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.</v>

59
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:03.040
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

60
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

61
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion he came to in the Gulag archipelago.</v>

62
00:03:06.371 --> 00:03:06.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

63
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.331
<v Speaker 2>the one hand,</v>

64
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

65
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean angry at,</v>

66
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>at the communist regimes and the members of my own family were murdered by the</v>

67
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:16.790
<v Speaker 2>Stalin regime for speaking out of him.</v>

68
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.030
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

69
00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 2>but then a lot of the other ones,</v>

70
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.730
<v Speaker 2>it was the regime they brought to power</v>

71
00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.153
<v Speaker 1>the book</v>

72
00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.823
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

73
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.340
<v Speaker 1>I think generally</v>

74
00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.200
<v Speaker 1>it's good to include yourself in that group,</v>

75
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>know he used to say that he'd sort of thrown off the ideological</v>

76
00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.240
<v Speaker 1>that him and his compatriots were played comrades,</v>

77
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.480
<v Speaker 1>newly imprison diehard communists and quiz them about all the inadequacies and</v>

78
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:16.970
<v Speaker 1>corruptions of the state,</v>

79
00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.560
<v Speaker 1>and of course they would just lay out their ideological routine and it was like</v>

80
00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>a satirical gate.</v>

81
00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

82
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.650
<v Speaker 1>from Solzhenitsyn Solzhenitsyn's perspective where you sit,</v>

83
00:04:27.651 --> 00:04:28.484
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

84
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>it's like walking in a desert talking to someone like that.</v>

85
00:04:31.491 --> 00:04:35.930
<v Speaker 1>He said he made the rounds of the smithies and came home on shot the same thing,</v>

86
00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.123
<v Speaker 1>but social.</v>

87
00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.940
<v Speaker 1>This attitude essentially wasn't it.</v>

88
00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.960
<v Speaker 1>As soon as someone who was a partial perpetrator and then trapped by the system,</v>

89
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 1>realized their complicitness in the system that they can be brought back into</v>

90
00:04:52.641 --> 00:04:53.474
<v Speaker 1>the full.</v>

91
00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.930
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's an extension.</v>

92
00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:59.120
<v Speaker 1>It's really an extension of a Christian idea.</v>

93
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the idea of something like confession and redemption.</v>

94
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

95
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

96
00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.510
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

97
00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.010
<v Speaker 1>when do you make peace with someone?</v>

98
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.110
<v Speaker 1>When they admit to their error,</v>

99
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 1>that's when you can forgive.</v>

100
00:05:11.361 --> 00:05:12.690
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

101
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:13.221
<v Speaker 1>because you say,</v>

102
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:13.431
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

103
00:05:13.431 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>forgiveness is a virtue.</v>

104
00:05:15.061 --> 00:05:15.950
<v Speaker 1>It's it is,</v>

105
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.100
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't a preconditioned list for truth,</v>

106
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.930
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

107
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.450
<v Speaker 1>You want to pull people back into the full.</v>

108
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.660
<v Speaker 1>They have to abandon that which</v>

109
00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.430
<v Speaker 1>knocked them off the path before you do that same name if you're trying to make</v>

110
00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:32.480
<v Speaker 1>peace with yourself,</v>

111
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.120
<v Speaker 1>so that's how it how it looks to me like</v>

112
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.990
<v Speaker 1>everybody is oppressed and oppressor situation like that.</v>

113
00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:44.120
<v Speaker 1>When people are.</v>

114
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.120
<v Speaker 1>When people repent of the oppression,</v>

115
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.670
<v Speaker 1>you hold them back in full or something like that,</v>

116
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.930
<v Speaker 1>like conspiracy theories and many,</v>

117
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.213
<v Speaker 1>many other things.</v>

118
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.640
<v Speaker 1>They're not entirely doing that just to defame you.</v>

119
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>I think they really like what's going on in universities is so absurd.</v>

120
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.033
<v Speaker 1>It</v>

121
00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>there's an entire sub branch of feminism and feminist purely devoted to</v>

122
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.580
<v Speaker 1>dismantling science itself is corrupt in patriarchal.</v>

123
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>When this happened in Canada,</v>

124
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:31.343
<v Speaker 1>now first of all,</v>

125
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.980
<v Speaker 1>the press as a whole,</v>

126
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.640
<v Speaker 1>we're not laid out.</v>

127
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 1>What was happening to spill</v>

128
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>response was,</v>

129
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

130
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you're saying there's something wrong with our system.</v>

131
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Our system works fine.</v>

132
00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:50.250
<v Speaker 1>There must be something wrong with</v>

133
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:58.420
<v Speaker 1>99 percent of circumstances and maybe it's the right response to whistleblowers</v>

134
00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.890
<v Speaker 1>in general.</v>

135
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the system.</v>

136
00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:01.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

137
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 1>and so it's also even reasonable if you stand up and object to something that's</v>

138
00:07:06.411 --> 00:07:08.240
<v Speaker 1>happened legislatively for people to say,</v>

139
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

140
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 1>how do we know you're not crazy?</v>

141
00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.890
<v Speaker 1>You're crazy like this or like this or like this,</v>

142
00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.870
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

143
00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.830
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of accusations.</v>

144
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't necessarily say it's the best way of conducting the debate,</v>

145
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:21.140
<v Speaker 1>but it's not surprising.</v>

146
00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

147
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.001
<v Speaker 1>So first of all,</v>

148
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:26.620
<v Speaker 1>it's an exploratory tactic and separate courses.</v>

149
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:31.950
<v Speaker 1>It's in the best interests of people who was trying to this math and science to</v>

150
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:34.641
<v Speaker 1>pay.</v>

151
00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.470
<v Speaker 1>He has sufficiently reprehensible along some dimension so that I should be</v>

152
00:07:39.471 --> 00:07:44.471
<v Speaker 1>attended to because if I'm not a terrible creature and unreasonable,</v>

153
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:52.970
<v Speaker 1>then there's something wrong with what they're doing so I can be reasonable.</v>

154
00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>And so unfortunately I am reasonably.</v>

155
00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 1>They really knew things were happening that they would have listened to you,</v>

156
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:05.193
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

157
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.470
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not believable.</v>

158
00:08:09.471 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a great thing happening in Canada right now as far as I'm</v>

159
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:13.620
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

160
00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:16.780
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know how many of you were aware of what happened.</v>

161
00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.230
<v Speaker 1>Wilfrid laurier university,</v>

162
00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:21.563
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

163
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:23.833
<v Speaker 1>The most.</v>

164
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.750
<v Speaker 1>The biggest scam ever hit a Canadian university and I think,</v>

165
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 1>I think they have no idea how many people know about because wherever I go</v>

166
00:08:32.481 --> 00:08:33.141
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

167
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:36.650
<v Speaker 1>the United Kingdom Hall and people know about this case,</v>

168
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>she's suing the university</v>

169
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:47.930
<v Speaker 1>because I'm really in touch with the lawyer.</v>

170
00:08:47.931 --> 00:08:49.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go after them as well,</v>

171
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to read the statement of claim on my youtube channel problem</v>

172
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.903
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow.</v>

173
00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.273
<v Speaker 1>A</v>

174
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.340
<v Speaker 1>lawyer of planning actually reads like a,</v>

175
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>like a normal.</v>

176
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.410
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

177
00:09:08.411 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

178
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.620
<v Speaker 1>they went after her carer and she taped it,</v>

179
00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.073
<v Speaker 1>but then,</v>

180
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.690
<v Speaker 1>well then there's a bunch of things that happen.</v>

181
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.970
<v Speaker 1>So they claimed that is due to the motor class was a lie.</v>

182
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.780
<v Speaker 1>No student complaint.</v>

183
00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.230
<v Speaker 1>What happened was somebody in the diversity office overheard some students talk</v>

184
00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 1>about the class and complaint.</v>

185
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.230
<v Speaker 1>That's not the same because students,</v>

186
00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 1>especially when you say that a student.</v>

187
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:36.310
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

188
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

189
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:39.800
<v Speaker 1>So the university apologized and professor apologized.</v>

190
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:41.270
<v Speaker 1>He sort of apologized,</v>

191
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.310
<v Speaker 1>but we'll see next year and it's all documented.</v>

192
00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Like they didn't learn it as thing and you read this statement of playing.</v>

193
00:09:51.691 --> 00:09:52.524
<v Speaker 1>They started.</v>

194
00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It's not like there's who is informed mistakes the university made.</v>

195
00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:57.190
<v Speaker 1>It's like physically,</v>

196
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>you just can't believe that.</v>

197
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 1>It's very engrossing.</v>

198
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking.</v>

199
00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:02.620
<v Speaker 1>I'm really actually looking forward</v>

200
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.140
<v Speaker 1>to see engrossing and.</v>

201
00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 1>But you can't believe that which is of course why the recording she made caused</v>

202
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:10.561
<v Speaker 1>such a stir.</v>

203
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:11.394
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

204
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.593
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

205
00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.291
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

206
00:10:13.291 --> 00:10:14.101
<v Speaker 1>This is happening.</v>

207
00:10:14.101 --> 00:10:14.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

208
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:15.001
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

209
00:10:15.001 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand that it's happening.</v>

210
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>It's standard practice.</v>

211
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not an normally.</v>

212
00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

213
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 1>it's everywhere.</v>

214
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:25.140
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely.</v>

215
00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely unbelievable,</v>

216
00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:32.010
<v Speaker 1>but what's even more unbelievable is when you call people out for it,</v>

217
00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.873
<v Speaker 1>which is what happened,</v>

218
00:10:33.270 --> 00:10:34.350
<v Speaker 1>and Wilfrid Laurier,</v>

219
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 1>it makes no difference.</v>

220
00:10:36.990 --> 00:10:38.140
<v Speaker 1>They don't learn a thing.</v>

221
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:43.160
<v Speaker 1>They didn't learn the things they're going to be scattered is the scattering is</v>

222
00:10:44.671 --> 00:10:46.050
<v Speaker 1>not going to go away.</v>

223
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:46.530
<v Speaker 1>It's to.</v>

224
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:48.030
<v Speaker 1>It's about to get way worse.</v>

225
00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.060
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that by the time it's older,</v>

226
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 1>both professors will be fired in the president of the university will reside.</v>

227
00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.200
<v Speaker 1>That's my gifts.</v>

228
00:10:55.830 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Were hoping that would be the case and maybe that will actually.</v>

229
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:01.470
<v Speaker 1>This is why I wasn't going to take legal action,</v>

230
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:06.330
<v Speaker 1>but what's Lindsey decided to the lawyer who was a good lawyer and putting the</v>

231
00:11:06.331 --> 00:11:07.200
<v Speaker 1>fish's character,</v>

232
00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:10.860
<v Speaker 1>which is part of what makes a good lawyer.</v>

233
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.470
<v Speaker 1>He sent me the statement in any aspect you want to join,</v>

234
00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:16.610
<v Speaker 1>do you want to join the claim?</v>

235
00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:17.161
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

236
00:11:17.161 --> 00:11:17.281
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

237
00:11:17.281 --> 00:11:18.120
<v Speaker 1>why don't you write about.</v>

238
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.073
<v Speaker 1>I'll read it,</v>

239
00:11:19.230 --> 00:11:21.720
<v Speaker 1>and so you wrote it up when I read it,</v>

240
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.370
<v Speaker 1>the outlines,</v>

241
00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.690
<v Speaker 1>all of the things that you accused me of and it's just.</v>

242
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely.</v>

243
00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.710
<v Speaker 1>If you just generated the laundry list of things,</v>

244
00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:33.990
<v Speaker 1>you could hypothetically accused someone.</v>

245
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:36.270
<v Speaker 1>All of them are there,</v>

246
00:11:36.271 --> 00:11:37.660
<v Speaker 1>so it starts with hepburn</v>

247
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:44.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of does the trick for the cakes because you're going to defame someone.</v>

248
00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.530
<v Speaker 1>A good old Hitler comparison.</v>

249
00:11:46.531 --> 00:11:47.364
<v Speaker 1>There's a lovely</v>

250
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:54.030
<v Speaker 1>day and then they compared compared to be in the mind of</v>

251
00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.373
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

252
00:11:58.450 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 1>professor said</v>

253
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:05.050
<v Speaker 1>is like playing a video bio Hitler or Milo.</v>

254
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 1>You slipped in a sentence like that and you think everything that's wrong with</v>

255
00:12:12.971 --> 00:12:14.090
<v Speaker 1>you is encapsulated</v>

256
00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:18.263
<v Speaker 1>insults.</v>

257
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.950
<v Speaker 1>You can't have both of those in the same sense,</v>

258
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

259
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:28.500
<v Speaker 1>You're like the worst mass murder in history or a provocative gate.</v>

260
00:12:28.501 --> 00:12:29.370
<v Speaker 1>British Jews.</v>

261
00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.850
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that we'll see,</v>

262
00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 1>I have a bit of trepidation because the court system in Canada are also being</v>

263
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:47.220
<v Speaker 1>more white,</v>

264
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.120
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think you're.</v>

265
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 1>And there's the case law school as well,</v>

266
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.950
<v Speaker 1>which is really terrible thing and that's happened to us.</v>

267
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:57.680
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

268
00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.513
<v Speaker 1>very proud.</v>

269
00:12:59.100 --> 00:12:59.933
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

270
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.023
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

271
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:03.580
<v Speaker 1>it's not surprising.</v>

272
00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:05.043
<v Speaker 1>It's not surprising.</v>

273
00:13:06.270 --> 00:13:07.103
<v Speaker 1>When I started,</v>

274
00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:08.003
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

275
00:13:08.290 --> 00:13:09.150
<v Speaker 1>criticized this building.</v>

276
00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 1>The other thing about the mail that was so strange was like if you read the bill</v>

277
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:13.710
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

278
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:15.820
<v Speaker 1>this has really contributed to the public confusion.</v>

279
00:13:15.821 --> 00:13:20.821
<v Speaker 1>It's only about two paragraphs long and what's in the bill doesn't look unless</v>

280
00:13:22.331 --> 00:13:25.990
<v Speaker 1>you really think about it doesn't look dangerous,</v>

281
00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:29.950
<v Speaker 1>but there's a set of policies within which the bill was going to be interpreted.</v>

282
00:13:30.430 --> 00:13:34.330
<v Speaker 1>The federal government in Maryland and I read the policies and the policies are</v>

283
00:13:34.331 --> 00:13:35.164
<v Speaker 1>just.</v>

284
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.123
<v Speaker 1>They're just,</v>

285
00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.360
<v Speaker 1>you just can't believe that exists.</v>

286
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:42.160
<v Speaker 1>We've written a social constructionist view of gender into Canadian law.</v>

287
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:42.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

288
00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:43.533
<v Speaker 1>what the hell?</v>

289
00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:46.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like lysenkoism in Sophia.</v>

290
00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

291
00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.120
<v Speaker 1>that's the other thing that I said that the Senate,</v>

292
00:13:52.121 --> 00:13:52.954
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

293
00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:54.003
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

294
00:13:54.670 --> 00:13:55.840
<v Speaker 1>this is your argument.</v>

295
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Gender is socially constructed,</v>

296
00:13:58.361 --> 00:14:01.900
<v Speaker 1>but a manager manageably born in a woman's body.</v>

297
00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:03.003
<v Speaker 1>That's your argument.</v>

298
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 1>I understand that.</v>

299
00:14:04.001 --> 00:14:06.100
<v Speaker 1>That argument makes no sense.</v>

300
00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.480
<v Speaker 1>You can't have the biological determinism of the wrong body with the claim of</v>

301
00:14:12.581 --> 00:14:15.940
<v Speaker 1>social constructionism of gender irrelevant.</v>

302
00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 1>You're making the assumption that logical coherence magnets in the debate like</v>

303
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 1>this and it doesn't.</v>

304
00:14:20.970 --> 00:14:23.090
<v Speaker 1>That's just part of the patriarchal structure.</v>

305
00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:32.560
<v Speaker 1>How do you handle it when the opposition doesn't pair,</v>

306
00:14:32.561 --> 00:14:34.570
<v Speaker 1>if anything actually make sense or not,</v>

307
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:36.900
<v Speaker 1>or rather what they say is true with.</v>

308
00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

309
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.600
<v Speaker 1>I think I think that.</v>

310
00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

311
00:14:40.410 --> 00:14:43.080
<v Speaker 1>I think partly what you do is try to expose that.</v>

312
00:14:44.540 --> 00:14:45.760
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've learned,</v>

313
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:50.410
<v Speaker 1>I've learned a couple of things over the last couple of years of dealing with</v>

314
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:51.303
<v Speaker 1>this situation.</v>

315
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>The first thing I learned that this would be a lovely.</v>

316
00:14:55.510 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 1>You can all learn this,</v>

317
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm telling you help a lot.</v>

318
00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 1>It really does work,</v>

319
00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.150
<v Speaker 1>so there's an English common law principle that I outlined in rule five,</v>

320
00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.750
<v Speaker 1>which is don't make your children do anything that makes you dislike them.</v>

321
00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:14.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the doctor of never minimal necessary force and you have the right under</v>

322
00:15:15.591 --> 00:15:18.590
<v Speaker 1>English common law to defend yourself with minimum necessary for us.</v>

323
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>But what I've learned is that's actually the right amount of force to defend</v>

324
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:24.890
<v Speaker 1>yourself optimally.</v>

325
00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:29.160
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're attacked by people who are from Aaron's,</v>

326
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.033
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

327
00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.870
<v Speaker 1>and with a strong antipathy towards you,</v>

328
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the best thing to do is to back off and just let them lay out your cap.</v>

329
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're going to be publicly.</v>

330
00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Because all it does expose the structure of their arguments.</v>

331
00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:45.740
<v Speaker 1>And when that's happened to me,</v>

332
00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 1>as long as I've kept my temporary,</v>

333
00:15:47.181 --> 00:15:50.150
<v Speaker 1>which I've done 95 percent of the time.</v>

334
00:15:52.130 --> 00:15:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Then all the consequences of that is that the person who brings forth the</v>

335
00:15:56.961 --> 00:16:01.961
<v Speaker 1>accusatory argument loses every time and not just a little bit either like it's</v>

336
00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:04.070
<v Speaker 1>been.</v>

337
00:16:04.070 --> 00:16:04.880
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

338
00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:05.020
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

339
00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.960
<v Speaker 1>and I've watched because I pay attention to the comments that people make and I</v>

340
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:13.220
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to the means that people generate to keep an eye on the</v>

341
00:16:13.221 --> 00:16:14.320
<v Speaker 1>temperature stays.</v>

342
00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:18.630
<v Speaker 1>The memes are actually really helpful because as long as they're humorous,</v>

343
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:20.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

344
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.420
<v Speaker 1>like you're poking fun at and it's Siriko but it's not,</v>

345
00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:24.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm time,</v>

346
00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:27.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just sitting for and,</v>

347
00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:32.710
<v Speaker 1>and you know that that comic edge is a really good thing because as long as,</v>

348
00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.870
<v Speaker 1>as long as you can take a joke,</v>

349
00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:40.590
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not a tyrant and as long as you can take a jokes,</v>

350
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.220
<v Speaker 1>joke,</v>

351
00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:46.090
<v Speaker 1>the jokes don't get too cruel and so it's a very good thing to watch.</v>

352
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:50.360
<v Speaker 1>And so I've tried to keep my tamper but the doctrine of minimum necessary</v>

353
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:50.721
<v Speaker 1>forest,</v>

354
00:16:50.721 --> 00:16:51.980
<v Speaker 1>that's unbelievably useful.</v>

355
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't push back with any more forced than is minimally necessary.</v>

356
00:16:57.380 --> 00:16:58.340
<v Speaker 1>It really works.</v>

357
00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:00.180
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

358
00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a kin to the turn the other cheek.</v>

359
00:17:03.230 --> 00:17:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>

360
00:17:03.950 --> 00:17:05.210
<v Speaker 1>very closely aligned to that.</v>

361
00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:06.763
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

362
00:17:07.850 --> 00:17:08.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:17:08.161 --> 00:17:08.994
<v Speaker 1>on the other thing,</v>

364
00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:13.070
<v Speaker 1>I do believe that public discourse works.</v>

365
00:17:13.210 --> 00:17:13.521
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

366
00:17:13.521 --> 00:17:13.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

367
00:17:13.731 --> 00:17:15.140
<v Speaker 1>when the university went after me,</v>

368
00:17:15.350 --> 00:17:17.660
<v Speaker 1>he wrote me two letters telling me to stalk,</v>

369
00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:22.580
<v Speaker 1>which was actually really good because I said that when I made the videos I said</v>

370
00:17:22.581 --> 00:17:26.010
<v Speaker 1>they're probably already illegal to make these criticized critical videos and</v>

371
00:17:26.011 --> 00:17:27.890
<v Speaker 1>everybody jumped out of the woodwork and said,</v>

372
00:17:27.891 --> 00:17:28.880
<v Speaker 1>you're being paranoid.</v>

373
00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:30.830
<v Speaker 1>And then the university,</v>

374
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:35.860
<v Speaker 1>thankfully he had there been lawyers review what I did compensate conclusion and</v>

375
00:17:35.861 --> 00:17:38.060
<v Speaker 1>sent me these two letters I just read.</v>

376
00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:40.790
<v Speaker 1>I just read them without comments here.</v>

377
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:46.430
<v Speaker 1>And so my sense has been my experience has been that if people,</v>

378
00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:47.691
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

379
00:17:47.691 --> 00:17:49.130
<v Speaker 1>people are basically reasonable,</v>

380
00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.260
<v Speaker 1>like the founders of your constitution are correct.</v>

381
00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 1>People are reasonable fundament,</v>

382
00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.620
<v Speaker 1>some people aren't reasonable at all and they're noisy and sometimes they</v>

383
00:18:01.621 --> 00:18:02.454
<v Speaker 1>dominate,</v>

384
00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:05.010
<v Speaker 1>but the bulk of people you can rely on it.</v>

385
00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:08.040
<v Speaker 1>And so if you inform everyone about what's going on,</v>

386
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.750
<v Speaker 1>then the majority comes to the appropriate conclusion.</v>

387
00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:12.780
<v Speaker 1>That's how it looks to me.</v>

388
00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.420
<v Speaker 1>I think you can have faith in that.</v>

389
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:16.103
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

390
00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.830
<v Speaker 1>and I've had way more support.</v>

391
00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:22.831
<v Speaker 1>The criticism is not even 100 to 1:50,</v>

392
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.890
<v Speaker 1>101,</v>

393
00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.773
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

394
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.210
<v Speaker 1>So I guess it just makes me a little nervous,</v>

395
00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.360
<v Speaker 1>but like we've said multiple times that they like praying on a religious</v>

396
00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:37.550
<v Speaker 1>substructure sort of fulfilled and if that's enough to convince people to one of</v>

397
00:18:38.911 --> 00:18:39.301
<v Speaker 1>your talks,</v>

398
00:18:39.301 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 1>they were like banging on the windows.</v>

399
00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:41.721
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

400
00:18:41.721 --> 00:18:42.720
<v Speaker 1>that was a Roman.</v>

401
00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.190
<v Speaker 1>If that's enough to do that.</v>

402
00:18:44.191 --> 00:18:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Like what's to stop 1776 from being necessary a second.</v>

403
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

404
00:18:48.670 --> 00:18:53.240
<v Speaker 1>Well I have very tiny minority and I think that.</v>

405
00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:56.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that good sense prevailed.</v>

406
00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:58.173
<v Speaker 1>I do believe though</v>

407
00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:02.960
<v Speaker 1>that the states you'd be polarizing before</v>

408
00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.580
<v Speaker 1>the stakes were higher,</v>

409
00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.430
<v Speaker 1>but you were polarized around,</v>

410
00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.650
<v Speaker 1>around when Nixon was president,</v>

411
00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:13.990
<v Speaker 1>there were stretched pretty far apart.</v>

412
00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:15.243
<v Speaker 1>You got through that.</v>

413
00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:17.040
<v Speaker 1>You've been through worse than this.</v>

414
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.020
<v Speaker 1>I think Tom Hanson will prevail.</v>

415
00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I also think the universities are way</v>

416
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.350
<v Speaker 1>things are going to flip upside down with the university so fast that it'll be a</v>

417
00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:29.263
<v Speaker 1>shot.</v>

418
00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:31.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

419
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.520
<v Speaker 1>they're much my question doing what corporations do.</v>

420
00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:39.870
<v Speaker 1>Like let's say that you're busy and you've built up a great brand,</v>

421
00:19:40.290 --> 00:19:41.120
<v Speaker 1>people trust,</v>

422
00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:41.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

423
00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:44.910
<v Speaker 1>Because you produce high quality content for years,</v>

424
00:19:44.911 --> 00:19:49.320
<v Speaker 1>so you have the Disney brand and then some people come in and take over the</v>

425
00:19:49.321 --> 00:19:50.960
<v Speaker 1>company and they just start dumping on</v>

426
00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:56.983
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

427
00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:02.210
<v Speaker 1>well that would work for about three years and then you've sucked all the value</v>

428
00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:04.120
<v Speaker 1>out of the brand and that's it.</v>

429
00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:05.130
<v Speaker 1>Little trusted anymore.</v>

430
00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I think it is brand break.</v>

431
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:08.920
<v Speaker 1>You know you've got,</v>

432
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:12.810
<v Speaker 1>you've got an incredible reputation and then you could explain the hell out of</v>

433
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:13.873
<v Speaker 1>pocket.</v>

434
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's the universities is that they haven't brand and the brand is</v>

435
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:24.360
<v Speaker 1>the universities are the liberal arts,</v>

436
00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:26.280
<v Speaker 1>the sciences,</v>

437
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.370
<v Speaker 1>technology that can survive on its own,</v>

438
00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:30.390
<v Speaker 1>the liberal,</v>

439
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 1>the liberal arts or the university.</v>

440
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.280
<v Speaker 1>The liberal arts are valuable because they teach people wisdom.</v>

441
00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:37.330
<v Speaker 1>If you stopped being DP,</v>

442
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:39.000
<v Speaker 1>teaching people wisdom,</v>

443
00:20:39.001 --> 00:20:40.320
<v Speaker 1>the wisdom isn't gonna go away.</v>

444
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Someone else is gonna.</v>

445
00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Pick up the value that start to disseminate and that'll happen electronically.</v>

446
00:20:46.231 --> 00:20:51.231
<v Speaker 1>So fast can make people's heads are and I think that's what's going to happen</v>

447
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:52.700
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's possible.</v>

448
00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.240
<v Speaker 1>It's partly why I'm working on diversity.</v>

449
00:20:55.630 --> 00:21:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I think it's possible to deliver educational resources at 10 times the rate at</v>

450
00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:06.190
<v Speaker 1>100 footfalls,</v>

451
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:10.000
<v Speaker 1>no administrative overhead and with accurate assessment,</v>

452
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:12.420
<v Speaker 1>I really think that's where</v>

453
00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:15.840
<v Speaker 1>we'll start with the</v>

454
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.830
<v Speaker 1>church or exactly what the lectures that I put online.</v>

455
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:23.673
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

456
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.390
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't I put lectures online?</v>

457
00:21:26.330 --> 00:21:26.980
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

458
00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 1>I thought about going back to teaching,</v>

459
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:34.560
<v Speaker 1>which is unlikely because why would I go back to teaching 50 people who are sort</v>

460
00:21:34.771 --> 00:21:36.490
<v Speaker 1>of okay about being there</v>

461
00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.800
<v Speaker 1>overload when I can do a lecture on anything I want</v>

462
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:47.710
<v Speaker 1>and the only people that will listen or people who want to listen and there's at</v>

463
00:21:47.770 --> 00:21:50.400
<v Speaker 1>least $350,000.</v>

464
00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no comparison.</v>

465
00:21:54.130 --> 00:21:55.390
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely no comparison.</v>

466
00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:56.643
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

467
00:21:58.970 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 1>this is the beginning of three really smart people working on it and they're fun</v>

468
00:22:04.991 --> 00:22:09.430
<v Speaker 1>to work with because they go find ways of doing things 100 times faster and if</v>

469
00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:11.470
<v Speaker 1>you're quite computer literate and theory,</v>

470
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.670
<v Speaker 1>computer literate and you're interested in handling information,</v>

471
00:22:15.970 --> 00:22:19.390
<v Speaker 1>you can handle the information so fast is just beyond belief.</v>

472
00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:23.450
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things we thought about doing it was one of the things that</v>

473
00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.970
<v Speaker 1>universities do is this,</v>

474
00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:25.780
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

475
00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:26.080
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

476
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.171
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

477
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:27.260
<v Speaker 1>how much do you know what</v>

478
00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:29.621
<v Speaker 1>to tell you,</v>

479
00:22:29.621 --> 00:22:30.341
<v Speaker 1>what you know,</v>

480
00:22:30.341 --> 00:22:31.061
<v Speaker 1>which is useful,</v>

481
00:22:31.061 --> 00:22:32.940
<v Speaker 1>but also to tell other people what you know,</v>

482
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.350
<v Speaker 1>that's your brain.</v>

483
00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.520
<v Speaker 1>Say that the greatest systems like Max necessarily.</v>

484
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.280
<v Speaker 1>So we thought,</v>

485
00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:45.280
<v Speaker 1>well why don't we put together a universal set of questions covering every topic</v>

486
00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:49.600
<v Speaker 1>we can possibly think of so that you can and then group them so that you can go</v>

487
00:22:49.601 --> 00:22:51.330
<v Speaker 1>in and just assess herself,</v>

488
00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:54.160
<v Speaker 1>will rank the questions by difficulty.</v>

489
00:22:54.330 --> 00:22:57.180
<v Speaker 1>You want to know how much you knew about a cell biology.</v>

490
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.551
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

491
00:22:57.551 --> 00:22:58.300
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

492
00:22:58.300 --> 00:22:58.780
<v Speaker 1>here's a.</v>

493
00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:03.670
<v Speaker 1>here's 200 questions on cell biology ranked from everyone can get it to no one</v>

494
00:23:03.671 --> 00:23:04.504
<v Speaker 1>can get it,</v>

495
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.561
<v Speaker 1>will test you.</v>

496
00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:06.580
<v Speaker 1>We'll give you your percentile.</v>

497
00:23:06.581 --> 00:23:10.960
<v Speaker 1>You'll know exactly what you know and don't know and we'll collect all the</v>

498
00:23:10.961 --> 00:23:15.190
<v Speaker 1>questions you don't know and you'll have a source for each of them so you can</v>

499
00:23:15.191 --> 00:23:16.024
<v Speaker 1>find the answers.</v>

500
00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:22.020
<v Speaker 1>In Vermont we collected 15,000 questions and sorted all of them because we found</v>

501
00:23:24.730 --> 00:23:28.090
<v Speaker 1>a question database that someone in order to put together with a methodology for</v>

502
00:23:28.091 --> 00:23:32.680
<v Speaker 1>generating more questions so we can generally figure we can generate $150,000 a</v>

503
00:23:32.681 --> 00:23:34.470
<v Speaker 1>month and choice questions for Ken Council.</v>

504
00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:36.580
<v Speaker 1>It's unbelievable.</v>

505
00:23:36.670 --> 00:23:41.380
<v Speaker 1>And then we found another program that classify as content by wikipedia</v>

506
00:23:41.381 --> 00:23:42.430
<v Speaker 1>knowledge structure.</v>

507
00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:46.910
<v Speaker 1>So wikipedia is already laid out the universal structure essentially.</v>

508
00:23:47.570 --> 00:23:51.530
<v Speaker 1>And so this thing will classify all the questions immediately so we can just be</v>

509
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:54.860
<v Speaker 1>questions and as fast as possible and it sorts them all by,</v>

510
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.120
<v Speaker 1>by topic and not just main time,</v>

511
00:23:58.220 --> 00:23:59.660
<v Speaker 1>main topic and subsidiary.</v>

512
00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:04.640
<v Speaker 1>So we figured in three months you can have 150,000 questions ready so that</v>

513
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:09.700
<v Speaker 1>everybody can assess what they know on everything there is to be known at work.</v>

514
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:12.673
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

515
00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I asked him to do things,</v>

516
00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.303
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

517
00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:19.840
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

518
00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:21.840
<v Speaker 1>we're going to figure out how to do it 100 times faster.</v>

519
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And with computers you can do everything fast.</v>

520
00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:31.220
<v Speaker 1>And so there's lots of people who want to fund this.</v>

521
00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And then we started to think about,</v>

522
00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:34.370
<v Speaker 1>we want to teach people to read,</v>

523
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:36.620
<v Speaker 1>we want to teach them to write,</v>

524
00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to outsource the problem of grading is learning to write and reading</v>

525
00:24:41.271 --> 00:24:44.050
<v Speaker 1>the problem with feedback in ways in solving that.</v>

526
00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.850
<v Speaker 1>But I think that I think the universities are way more gave me.</v>

527
00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.800
<v Speaker 1>I really believe that especially because the only thing that they really offer</v>

528
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.480
<v Speaker 1>all the economic value of a university degrees in the accreditation,</v>

529
00:24:56.481 --> 00:24:57.490
<v Speaker 1>not in the education.</v>

530
00:24:58.120 --> 00:24:58.953
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

531
00:24:59.100 --> 00:24:59.720
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

532
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.230
<v Speaker 1>so that that's a different thing that,</v>

533
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:07.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean the economic value for the employer because they want to know,</v>

534
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.260
<v Speaker 1>like if you're a Harvard graduate,</v>

535
00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:12.680
<v Speaker 1>the reason that you're valuable isn't because you're graduating from arc.</v>

536
00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.580
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's impossible to get into Harvard.</v>

537
00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:17.090
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

538
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And then the documentation on this is clear.</v>

539
00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:21.980
<v Speaker 1>If you look at most educational institutions,</v>

540
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:26.600
<v Speaker 1>the reason that the graduates are valuable isn't because of what they learned in</v>

541
00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:27.434
<v Speaker 1>the institution.</v>

542
00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:28.040
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

543
00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:33.040
<v Speaker 1>it depends on how good the accreditation system was in screening people before</v>

544
00:25:33.411 --> 00:25:35.090
<v Speaker 1>they went to the institution.</v>

545
00:25:35.091 --> 00:25:36.170
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

546
00:25:36.171 --> 00:25:40.370
<v Speaker 1>if you go to an executive MBA program at a high level university,</v>

547
00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:43.140
<v Speaker 1>you have to write the uh,</v>

548
00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:48.320
<v Speaker 1>it's the standardized tests that they use for business school</v>

549
00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:51.770
<v Speaker 1>over the team out.</v>

550
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 1>And so if it's a high end school,</v>

551
00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.460
<v Speaker 1>you have to score like 99th percentile.</v>

552
00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Well that's actually why you're valuable as a graduate.</v>

553
00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.250
<v Speaker 1>It's because you scored 90,</v>

554
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.950
<v Speaker 1>90 percent.</v>

555
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.783
<v Speaker 1>The Gi map,</v>

556
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:03.230
<v Speaker 1>what they teach you in business school,</v>

557
00:26:03.231 --> 00:26:06.860
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's not that use and the blood of business schools know this.</v>

558
00:26:06.861 --> 00:26:07.930
<v Speaker 1>I've talked to lots of,</v>

559
00:26:09.370 --> 00:26:14.370
<v Speaker 1>they're absolutely aware of it and so I think it will be possible to steal</v>

560
00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.490
<v Speaker 1>accreditation from the universities and,</v>

561
00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:23.010
<v Speaker 1>and also do steel it in a way that cannot be gerrymandered it sexual race</v>

562
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:23.960
<v Speaker 1>ethnicity,</v>

563
00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:28.550
<v Speaker 1>not like you'll get your damn great and it will say how much you knows and that</v>

564
00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:29.390
<v Speaker 1>repeat that.</v>

565
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And so there will be tremendous value in that because what people need is solid</v>

566
00:26:34.521 --> 00:26:35.354
<v Speaker 1>accreditation.</v>

567
00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.580
<v Speaker 1>So that's the problem we're solving first.</v>

568
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.110
<v Speaker 1>So when you knock them out with assistance,</v>

569
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:40.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

570
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.050
<v Speaker 1>like the higher education system,</v>

571
00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.700
<v Speaker 1>you leave the value behind.</v>

572
00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you need to know you have a classical education behind,</v>

573
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.760
<v Speaker 1>someone's going to pick up that value when an offer it because the values are</v>

574
00:26:50.770 --> 00:26:51.603
<v Speaker 1>underneath there,</v>

575
00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:55.410
<v Speaker 1>so I think the universities I calculated the other day,</v>

576
00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.840
<v Speaker 1>they were making seven fatal errors and I've seen big businesses go out of</v>

577
00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:05.250
<v Speaker 1>business and they can run a business really,</v>

578
00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:05.731
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

579
00:27:05.731 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 1>really fat.</v>

580
00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.630
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite staggering of things could journal,</v>

581
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:10.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

582
00:27:10.501 --> 00:27:15.460
<v Speaker 1>in the universities they're way too top heavy administrative way.</v>

583
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:19.350
<v Speaker 1>It's gone way out of kilter over the last three decades and it's not faculty</v>

584
00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:20.184
<v Speaker 1>costs.</v>

585
00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.360
<v Speaker 1>That's mistake number one.</v>

586
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.630
<v Speaker 1>Mistake number two is their gerrymandering.</v>

587
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:25.770
<v Speaker 1>The accreditation process.</v>

588
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:27.540
<v Speaker 1>That's a big mistake.</v>

589
00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:28.374
<v Speaker 1>Number three,</v>

590
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:31.590
<v Speaker 1>they're not teaching people to write into safe mistake.</v>

591
00:27:31.591 --> 00:27:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Number four there,</v>

592
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.890
<v Speaker 1>especially in the US,</v>

593
00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.191
<v Speaker 1>they figured out,</v>

594
00:27:36.191 --> 00:27:40.380
<v Speaker 1>ever pick the pockets of students future earnings and condemn them to indentured</v>

595
00:27:40.381 --> 00:27:41.214
<v Speaker 1>servitude,</v>

596
00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:41.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

597
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:46.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what the non bankruptcy student loan program has done and that's feeding</v>

598
00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:48.120
<v Speaker 1>the administrative top heaviness.</v>

599
00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Next fatal error.</v>

600
00:27:50.370 --> 00:27:55.110
<v Speaker 1>Fifth layer ethics committees are killing research by just slowing it down so</v>

601
00:27:55.111 --> 00:27:55.321
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

602
00:27:55.321 --> 00:27:58.830
<v Speaker 1>It's too damn painful to do human research and they're also producing</v>

603
00:27:58.831 --> 00:28:03.810
<v Speaker 1>generations of scientists and lie because in order to circumvent the idiot</v>

604
00:28:03.811 --> 00:28:04.770
<v Speaker 1>ethics committees,</v>

605
00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:08.640
<v Speaker 1>you have to do all sorts of sideways things so that you can move your research</v>

606
00:28:08.641 --> 00:28:10.380
<v Speaker 1>forward with any degree of deficiency.</v>

607
00:28:10.930 --> 00:28:13.350
<v Speaker 1>So that was six.</v>

608
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.540
<v Speaker 1>Well the last thing they're doing is they're using the wrong criteria</v>

609
00:28:21.541 --> 00:28:24.220
<v Speaker 1>increasingly to select your own selector.</v>

610
00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:25.323
<v Speaker 1>They're faculty,</v>

611
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:29.670
<v Speaker 1>but the last thing is they're replacing full time faculty with adjuncts,</v>

612
00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.050
<v Speaker 1>so instead of instead of full time faculty who are tenured,</v>

613
00:28:34.051 --> 00:28:35.970
<v Speaker 1>who might dispute utility of tenure,</v>

614
00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:37.050
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't seemed ability,</v>

615
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.910
<v Speaker 1>they're hiring part time people.</v>

616
00:28:39.470 --> 00:28:40.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't pay them anything.</v>

617
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.610
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

618
00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:45.150
<v Speaker 1>They exploited because they don't pay the mirroring what they're working on.</v>

619
00:28:45.630 --> 00:28:50.450
<v Speaker 1>They have zero power zero and they can't make any administrative decisions,</v>

620
00:28:50.451 --> 00:28:55.451
<v Speaker 1>so it's perfect for the administrator like no too many states have no.</v>

621
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:59.520
<v Speaker 1>There's no way you're going to stumble and then you get a situation like the</v>

622
00:28:59.521 --> 00:29:00.660
<v Speaker 1>situation at Harvard.</v>

623
00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:01.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

624
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

625
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.160
<v Speaker 1>they're taking half as many Asian students as they should take.</v>

626
00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:05.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

627
00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:06.573
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>

628
00:29:07.290 --> 00:29:08.123
<v Speaker 1>It isn't.</v>

629
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like who cares if it's unfair?</v>

630
00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

631
00:29:10.830 --> 00:29:11.281
<v Speaker 1>I care,</v>

632
00:29:11.281 --> 00:29:14.070
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the problem.</v>

633
00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:20.180
<v Speaker 1>The problem is if you have students who score at the 99th percentile on their</v>

634
00:29:22.291 --> 00:29:27.291
<v Speaker 1>sats and they've done everything else you would need to do to go our Hartford,</v>

635
00:29:27.471 --> 00:29:27.901
<v Speaker 1>which would be.</v>

636
00:29:27.901 --> 00:29:28.770
<v Speaker 1>You'd have to be good at it,</v>

637
00:29:28.771 --> 00:29:32.470
<v Speaker 1>at least two other things that kids need.</v>

638
00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.050
<v Speaker 1>The grades you need to use in.</v>

639
00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:35.450
<v Speaker 1>You have to be good to do other things.</v>

640
00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like there aren't many people like that.</v>

641
00:29:38.610 --> 00:29:42.190
<v Speaker 1>You want to take those people and you want to put them in place where they get</v>

642
00:29:42.191 --> 00:29:46.120
<v Speaker 1>the best possible education and the reason you want to do that isn't because</v>

643
00:29:46.121 --> 00:29:46.811
<v Speaker 1>it's fair to them.</v>

644
00:29:46.811 --> 00:29:49.780
<v Speaker 1>It's because you want to exploit the hell out of them for the rest of their life</v>

645
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 1>because they're going to do your society a tremendous amount of good.</v>

646
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:57.100
<v Speaker 1>If you're too damn stupid to give them the proper opportunity,</v>

647
00:29:57.340 --> 00:30:00.730
<v Speaker 1>then all you're going to do is not hell out of your whole society.</v>

648
00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.030
<v Speaker 1>It's like it isn't unfair to the Asian students.</v>

649
00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:04.751
<v Speaker 1>Even though it is.</v>

650
00:30:04.751 --> 00:30:05.740
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point.</v>

651
00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.430
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

652
00:30:06.430 --> 00:30:08.680
<v Speaker 1>You're going to let a resource like that go to waste.</v>

653
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Are you out of your mind?</v>

654
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:13.210
<v Speaker 1>These people are like one in a thousand,</v>

655
00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:14.380
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

656
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:15.760
<v Speaker 1>Don't waste them.</v>

657
00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

658
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.213
<v Speaker 1>And so.</v>

659
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 1>And they are lasting.</v>

660
00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.010
<v Speaker 1>So that's not,</v>

661
00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:22.870
<v Speaker 1>that's not smart.</v>

662
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.150
<v Speaker 1>We think with our accreditation system,</v>

663
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.050
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this,</v>

664
00:30:26.530 --> 00:30:31.530
<v Speaker 1>so we'll have thousand mathematics questions.</v>

665
00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:36.760
<v Speaker 1>So then we can have people take the questions from stratified by age.</v>

666
00:30:37.150 --> 00:30:37.301
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>

667
00:30:37.301 --> 00:30:37.571
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

668
00:30:37.571 --> 00:30:38.404
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

669
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.880
<v Speaker 1>you can take the data and say here's the top scores in the 15 to 17 year old</v>

670
00:30:45.161 --> 00:30:45.994
<v Speaker 1>category.</v>

671
00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's a thousand kids who took it.</v>

672
00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's five.</v>

673
00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.840
<v Speaker 1>So we can take the top 100.</v>

674
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.700
<v Speaker 1>You can say here's the email addresses of the other top 100.</v>

675
00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:02.620
<v Speaker 1>So now all of a sudden you guys who were like mathematically mathematical</v>

676
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:03.990
<v Speaker 1>geniuses on the order,</v>

677
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:06.820
<v Speaker 1>the first percentile say now you have a peer group.</v>

678
00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:08.530
<v Speaker 1>Same with physics,</v>

679
00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.630
<v Speaker 1>engineering and biology to be able to network with people that are like hyper</v>

680
00:31:13.631 --> 00:31:17.500
<v Speaker 1>smart and then they can go off and do whatever networks of hyper smart people</v>

681
00:31:17.501 --> 00:31:17.980
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

682
00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.800
<v Speaker 1>which is generally push each other and compete like app.</v>

683
00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:22.940
<v Speaker 1>And so anyways,</v>

684
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:25.780
<v Speaker 1>so that's part of it I guess I think,</v>

685
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's lots of people who want to fund this.</v>

686
00:31:29.621 --> 00:31:30.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to figure out,</v>

687
00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:34.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to just raise a bunch of money because money is a problem as well</v>

688
00:31:34.391 --> 00:31:36.340
<v Speaker 1>as a solution because once you have a bunch of money,</v>

689
00:31:36.341 --> 00:31:38.630
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out how to handle it intelligent.</v>

690
00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:40.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a little more difficult than your company.</v>

691
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.860
<v Speaker 1>And the business partner told me it's really easy to grow your business on the</v>

692
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:45.700
<v Speaker 1>cost side.</v>

693
00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:47.230
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

694
00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:48.063
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

695
00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I think what we're probably going to do is because there's so many people</v>

696
00:31:57.911 --> 00:31:58.271
<v Speaker 1>telling me,</v>

697
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:02.340
<v Speaker 1>probably a half dozen people tonight to have an opportunity to participate in.</v>

698
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:04.000
<v Speaker 1>Some of that might be financial,</v>

699
00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:05.920
<v Speaker 1>some of them might be in terms of content,</v>

700
00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:09.280
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to try to crack that over the next three or four months.</v>

701
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.380
<v Speaker 1>So I think</v>

702
00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:13.730
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

703
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:15.810
<v Speaker 1>when technology's changing this rap,</v>

704
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:22.410
<v Speaker 1>you abandoned your responsibility to do something important at your peril</v>

705
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.680
<v Speaker 1>because there's plenty of ways that you can be replaced that.</v>

706
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.880
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

707
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:32.580
<v Speaker 1>the other thing too is that universities now are only a tiny proportion of</v>

708
00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:33.880
<v Speaker 1>people can be educated.</v>

709
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:39.850
<v Speaker 1>They might be able to increase that by a factor and teach people all over the</v>

710
00:32:40.311 --> 00:32:41.144
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

711
00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Obviously youtube videos and podcasts and all that.</v>

712
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:49.100
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not so worried.</v>

713
00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:59.280
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

714
00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:05.420
<v Speaker 1>not to any great degree.</v>

715
00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.140
<v Speaker 1>So worried what I do see,</v>

716
00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:12.420
<v Speaker 1>like the European Union date,</v>

717
00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:13.723
<v Speaker 1>curse them,</v>

718
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.670
<v Speaker 1>decided that they haven't actually passed this law yet,</v>

719
00:33:18.671 --> 00:33:20.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's part of a proposition.</v>

720
00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:23.540
<v Speaker 1>It's a set of propositions that they're attempting to move into law,</v>

721
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.220
<v Speaker 1>that if you're going to have a website,</v>

722
00:33:25.221 --> 00:33:26.180
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to use,</v>

723
00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:29.780
<v Speaker 1>you would have to implement ai to screen your content for hate speech.</v>

724
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:33.770
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

725
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:35.740
<v Speaker 1>you have to implement the air.</v>

726
00:33:36.530 --> 00:33:39.580
<v Speaker 1>That's one butt cheek second.</v>

727
00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.830
<v Speaker 1>The Ai has to be able to identify it.</v>

728
00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:45.260
<v Speaker 1>That's not even.</v>

729
00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:45.900
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

730
00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.300
<v Speaker 1>hate speech is the category that we have an AI system can learn.</v>

731
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 1>We can't even agree on it.</v>

732
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:52.650
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>

733
00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 1>AI system can't learn to categorize something that we can't categorize.</v>

734
00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.730
<v Speaker 1>So it's the EU,</v>

735
00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.380
<v Speaker 1>the European Union.</v>

736
00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:01.131
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

737
00:34:01.131 --> 00:34:01.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

738
00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:01.880
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

739
00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.713
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

740
00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.411
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

741
00:34:03.411 --> 00:34:03.711
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

742
00:34:03.711 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 1>the censorship thing is worrisome,</v>

743
00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:11.141
<v Speaker 1>but it's not so easy to censor Internet geniuses and they tend to stay one step</v>

744
00:34:12.321 --> 00:34:13.450
<v Speaker 1>ahead of the bureaucrats,</v>

745
00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:13.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

746
00:34:13.730 --> 00:34:17.480
<v Speaker 1>and there's lots of people in Silicon Valley who are already watching the</v>

747
00:34:17.481 --> 00:34:19.190
<v Speaker 1>censorship problem and thinking,</v>

748
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:22.190
<v Speaker 1>well here's a bunch of reasons we can deal with very quickly.</v>

749
00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:23.443
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

750
00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.553
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

751
00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.680
<v Speaker 1>John Taylor Gatto</v>

752
00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:34.260
<v Speaker 1>deliberate dumbing down of the US a lot of votes on the Prussian education</v>

753
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:38.650
<v Speaker 1>system and design to have a gun.</v>

754
00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:39.630
<v Speaker 1>The marketing class,</v>

755
00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.150
<v Speaker 1>it's really good at serving in the military and that's what Americans really</v>

756
00:34:44.151 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 1>good at.</v>

757
00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's conspiratorial,</v>

758
00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:51.070
<v Speaker 1>but I think behind that would interfere with some random.</v>

759
00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.420
<v Speaker 1>There's no,</v>

760
00:34:53.421 --> 00:34:53.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

761
00:34:53.890 --> 00:34:58.890
<v Speaker 1>I think that there's no date and never assume a level of stupidity,</v>

762
00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:07.370
<v Speaker 1>but because stupidities it's a much better explanation for most things.</v>

763
00:35:07.581 --> 00:35:10.880
<v Speaker 1>See what happened with Prussian education system.</v>

764
00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:14.090
<v Speaker 1>There was actually a reason,</v>

765
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.920
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

766
00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:15.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

767
00:35:15.390 --> 00:35:16.223
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

768
00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.310
<v Speaker 1>in that time,</v>

769
00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:18.283
<v Speaker 1>in that place,</v>

770
00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:24.110
<v Speaker 1>one of the real man's was how to have a viable military and what to do with</v>

771
00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:28.610
<v Speaker 1>underemployed young men and that she was making them into soldiers and the</v>

772
00:35:28.611 --> 00:35:32.390
<v Speaker 1>pressures get that very effective in other European states that wanted them to</v>

773
00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.400
<v Speaker 1>protect the military and then use that as an system.</v>

774
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:38.383
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

775
00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:40.790
<v Speaker 1>looking back you think,</v>

776
00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:44.870
<v Speaker 1>well that's kind of reprehensible in imagery and it is by today's standards,</v>

777
00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:46.730
<v Speaker 1>it is part of course.</v>

778
00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Back then in the US,</v>

779
00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.770
<v Speaker 1>the idea was more rural.</v>

780
00:35:52.771 --> 00:35:55.710
<v Speaker 1>People were moving to the cities on mice and things were starting to</v>

781
00:35:55.711 --> 00:35:58.480
<v Speaker 1>industrialize and that can be two problems.</v>

782
00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:03.560
<v Speaker 1>One was how do you ensure a steady pool of labor for the industrialized future,</v>

783
00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.750
<v Speaker 1>reasonable problem and what to do with the children of the people who were</v>

784
00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:11.590
<v Speaker 1>working in factories announced was</v>

785
00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:18.420
<v Speaker 1>put them in factory training school and that was the public education system and</v>

786
00:36:18.421 --> 00:36:22.050
<v Speaker 1>that was reasonable because the probability that those kids were going to be</v>

787
00:36:22.051 --> 00:36:24.030
<v Speaker 1>working in factories was high.</v>

788
00:36:24.510 --> 00:36:25.360
<v Speaker 1>What's unreasonable?</v>

789
00:36:25.390 --> 00:36:27.010
<v Speaker 1>This is what is that?</v>

790
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:30.510
<v Speaker 1>That hasn't changed 100 years later.</v>

791
00:36:31.190 --> 00:36:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Right now I don't.</v>

792
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:36.743
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

793
00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I've never met anyone who's powerful,</v>

794
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.580
<v Speaker 1>who is motivated to keep people stupid.</v>

795
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people I know that are powerful and cognitive are very annoyed</v>

796
00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.860
<v Speaker 1>as educated and competent as they could be because they're starving for educated</v>

797
00:36:58.231 --> 00:37:01.050
<v Speaker 1>and competent and so I don't.</v>

798
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:05.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that people might interfere with a real education system out of</v>

799
00:37:05.851 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 1>ignorance and maybe out of India,</v>

800
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:08.663
<v Speaker 1>Lord,</v>

801
00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:10.490
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think any,</v>

802
00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:15.840
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it'll matter because I don't think of your grass can control</v>

803
00:37:16.530 --> 00:37:17.410
<v Speaker 1>computer technology.</v>

804
00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:25.120
<v Speaker 1>It's so fast and so many people in that field are so smart and if you're a</v>

805
00:37:27.001 --> 00:37:28.460
<v Speaker 1>computation wisdom,</v>

806
00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like bureaucrats there.</v>

807
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.370
<v Speaker 1>You're in 2050 and there in 1942.</v>

808
00:37:37.050 --> 00:37:39.650
<v Speaker 1>They're not in the same way over time.</v>

809
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:45.643
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

810
00:37:46.510 --> 00:37:47.390
<v Speaker 1>we've been as</v>

811
00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:49.910
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

812
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:52.760
<v Speaker 1>We're brothers on the road one.</v>

813
00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:57.670
<v Speaker 1>It was a pleasure talking to all of you and thank you for very nice.</v>
