00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:12.183
<v Speaker 1>Personality,</v>

2
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.160
<v Speaker 1>all your lectures are available on,</v>

3
00:00:15.161 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>on Youtube and,</v>

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.930
<v Speaker 1>and you can either watch them as a whole or you can see bits and pieces.</v>

5
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>And this is in part what has made you world famous and Cain to tremendous</v>

6
00:00:24.401 --> 00:00:25.234
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

7
00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>And those videos,</v>

8
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be full of all sorts of coaching advices from raising children to</v>

9
00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:32.931
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

10
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:36.580
<v Speaker 1>really relationship advice is being a good person and facing all sorts of</v>

11
00:00:36.581 --> 00:00:37.414
<v Speaker 1>challenges.</v>

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Can you talk a little bit about these two courses?</v>

13
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 2>A little bit about the maps of meaning course is based on a book I wrote,</v>

14
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 2>which was my first book called maps of meaning,</v>

15
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.780
<v Speaker 2>which is coming out in audio form on June 12th.</v>

16
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a very difficult book,</v>

17
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.541
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

18
00:00:55.541 --> 00:00:58.330
<v Speaker 2>I wrote it not so much to communicate,</v>

19
00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:59.920
<v Speaker 2>let's say with the general public,</v>

20
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 2>but to solve a,</v>

21
00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 2>to address and attempt to solve a very complex problem.</v>

22
00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:10.741
<v Speaker 2>And I was curious about why the world had found itself in a stalemate after</v>

23
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.160
<v Speaker 2>World War II with the Soviet bloc and the western block say arming themselves</v>

24
00:01:23.411 --> 00:01:24.850
<v Speaker 2>ever more insanely,</v>

25
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.613
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

26
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 2>in this ideological deadlock.</v>

27
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 2>And I was curious about why the belief systems that we were each,</v>

28
00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.690
<v Speaker 2>that each side was putting forward,</v>

29
00:01:37.691 --> 00:01:42.691
<v Speaker 2>we're so seemed so important that it was worth risking the world itself to</v>

30
00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.803
<v Speaker 2>support them.</v>

31
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.700
<v Speaker 2>And so maps of meaning is an inquiry into the purpose of belief systems and more</v>

32
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.100
<v Speaker 2>than that it goes down to the individual.</v>

33
00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.761
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

34
00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the thing.</v>

35
00:01:55.751 --> 00:01:56.584
<v Speaker 2>Is that</v>

36
00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

37
00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.320
<v Speaker 2>what I,</v>

38
00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 2>what I came to understand,</v>

39
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I think was that the,</v>

40
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 2>the proper way forward,</v>

41
00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Speaker 2>the proper way of conceptualizing the world is one that's individual centered</v>

42
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.481
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

43
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:14.920
<v Speaker 2>And I was curious about that because of course the Soviet view was a</v>

44
00:02:14.921 --> 00:02:19.921
<v Speaker 2>collectivist view and you can make a strong case for a collectivist view and it</v>

45
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 2>might be that either view,</v>

46
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:26.230
<v Speaker 2>the individualist view or the collective view is arbitrary in some sense.</v>

47
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:29.740
<v Speaker 2>But I don't believe that the view that privileges the individual over the state</v>

48
00:02:29.741 --> 00:02:30.580
<v Speaker 2>is arbitrary.</v>

49
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.430
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's correct and correct.</v>

50
00:02:33.431 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Meaning that if you act it out in the world at the individual level or the</v>

51
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 2>family level or the or the societal level,</v>

52
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.900
<v Speaker 2>that it produces societies that are functional and healthy and productive and</v>

53
00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 2>safe and secure and free in the medium to longterm.</v>

54
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:52.623
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's,</v>

55
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 2>and then I tried to lay out the psychological reasons for the development of the</v>

56
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 2>idea of sovereign individual and to show that that was grounded in more than</v>

57
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 2>arbitrary ideology.</v>

58
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 2>And so maps of meaning the course,</v>

59
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 2>which that's been a very popular course.</v>

60
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 2>I taught that at Harvard for six years and then at the University of Toronto</v>

61
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:14.561
<v Speaker 2>ever since.</v>

62
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's generally regarded as a course that changes people's lives.</v>

63
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 2>So many of your students say that.</v>

64
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.341
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

65
00:03:21.341 --> 00:03:21.930
<v Speaker 2>it's very,</v>

66
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.330
<v Speaker 2>it's very common response.</v>

67
00:03:23.331 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 2>And so why,</v>

68
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>why do you think that is?</v>

69
00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.230
<v Speaker 2>How has it changed the students?</v>

70
00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.783
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

71
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.523
<v Speaker 2>we have a,</v>

72
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 2>we have a lot of explicit thoughts that we can articulate,</v>

73
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.330
<v Speaker 2>but they're grounded in,</v>

74
00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 2>in other forms of thinking.</v>

75
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.170
<v Speaker 2>They're grounded in images and artistic expression and narratives.</v>

76
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.350
<v Speaker 2>So we're fundamentally grounded in the world inside stories and maps of meaning</v>

77
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.400
<v Speaker 2>is an attempt to lay out the structure of those stories and to say,</v>

78
00:03:57.401 --> 00:03:57.850
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

79
00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 2>here's how the world is composed.</v>

80
00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 2>It's composed of chaos and order,</v>

81
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 2>which is a strange way of looking at it.</v>

82
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:05.380
<v Speaker 2>And on top of that,</v>

83
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:06.214
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

84
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.520
<v Speaker 2>an ethical struggle which has been formulated most typically as a battle between</v>

85
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:13.901
<v Speaker 2>good and evil.</v>

86
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's the right way of looking at the world is that human</v>

87
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 2>beings are engaged in this struggle between good and evil on a background of</v>

88
00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 2>chaos and order.</v>

89
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And maps of meaning is an attempt to explain what those categories mean in terms</v>

90
00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 2>that you can grip and then and that you can use.</v>

91
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:32.891
<v Speaker 2>Conceptually,</v>

92
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I'm practically in the world.</v>

93
00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's not merely a high level abstract discussion,</v>

94
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:39.520
<v Speaker 2>although it is that in part,</v>

95
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.480
<v Speaker 2>it's an attempt to take that high level abstract discussion and say,</v>

96
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.710
<v Speaker 2>here's why.</v>

97
00:04:44.711 --> 00:04:48.700
<v Speaker 2>If you know that you will be able to operate more effectively in the world.</v>

98
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 2>And I think that once you know these categories,</v>

99
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 2>you can operate more effectively in the world.</v>

100
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 2>It strengthens your resilience in the face of catastrophe,</v>

101
00:04:57.071 --> 00:04:57.904
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

102
00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.750
<v Speaker 2>It's encouraging it.</v>

103
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 2>It helps reestablish the dignity of the individual and to describe why that's a</v>

104
00:05:06.131 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>real thing and the most real thing even.</v>

105
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.490
<v Speaker 2>And so it's very salutary for people because everyone doubts the utility.</v>

106
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 2>People doubt their own value.</v>

107
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the most precise way of putting it.</v>

108
00:05:20.621 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>And there are reasons that you shouldn't doubt your value.</v>

109
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 2>They're deep reasons.</v>

110
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>And so maps of meaning lays that out.</v>

111
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 2>It was those one thing that</v>

112
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:31.190
<v Speaker 2>grabbed me.</v>

113
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 2>He will talk.</v>

114
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.481
<v Speaker 2>Talking about what,</v>

115
00:05:32.481 --> 00:05:34.110
<v Speaker 2>what sort of push when you want to be,</v>

116
00:05:34.111 --> 00:05:34.340
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

117
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

118
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.230
<v Speaker 2>when you went in the face of,</v>

119
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.870
<v Speaker 2>of maybe a death in the family.</v>

120
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

121
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 2>can you elaborate on one of the things?</v>

122
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.200
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

123
00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

124
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:42.453
<v Speaker 2>many</v>

125
00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

126
00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy for people to determine what their goals should be in our culture</v>

127
00:05:49.031 --> 00:05:50.200
<v Speaker 2>because our culture is,</v>

128
00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.260
<v Speaker 2>I would say materialistic and,</v>

129
00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 2>and there's some positive things about that,</v>

130
00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.730
<v Speaker 2>but so much in its ethical orientation.</v>

131
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 2>And so we think,</v>

132
00:05:59.571 --> 00:05:59.751
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

133
00:05:59.751 --> 00:06:02.180
<v Speaker 2>people should strive to be happy.</v>

134
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's a weak aim.</v>

135
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Not that there's anything wrong with being happy if,</v>

136
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 2>if it happens,</v>

137
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.861
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

138
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:11.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's a side effect of something else.</v>

139
00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.800
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

140
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not a goal in and of itself.</v>

141
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:20.040
<v Speaker 2>The a better goal is to be courageous and resilient and strong and one of the,</v>

142
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but that's a taboo today so much it's because people don't understand it well.</v>

143
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 2>Like I've told my students that they should try to beat the strongest person at</v>

144
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:30.350
<v Speaker 2>their father's funeral.</v>

145
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

146
00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.400
<v Speaker 2>because you are going to face tremendous adversity in your life and you need to</v>

147
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 2>think through what sort of person you want to be under conditions of adversity</v>

148
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 2>and a funeral is a very good example of that because it's a catastrophe for</v>

149
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:51.041
<v Speaker 2>everyone involved and someone has to bear the responsibility to navigate the,</v>

150
00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.000
<v Speaker 2>the ship of the family through the storms of the death.</v>

151
00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And if you think about a person that can do that,</v>

152
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 2>obviously such a person is admirable and there's every reason to set your goal</v>

153
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:07.760
<v Speaker 2>as the development of an admirable character.</v>

154
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Something else we don't talk about anymore.</v>

155
00:07:09.561 --> 00:07:13.400
<v Speaker 2>It's as if the whole idea of admirable character has been dispensed with,</v>

156
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.890
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's associated with the idea,</v>

157
00:07:15.891 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 2>at least in part of the [inaudible] patriarchy,</v>

158
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.641
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

159
00:07:19.641 --> 00:07:22.670
<v Speaker 2>if our culture is nothing but a tyrannical patriarchy,</v>

160
00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.950
<v Speaker 2>which it is most decidedly not,</v>

161
00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 2>then anyone who takes forthright action in that structure is nothing but a</v>

162
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 2>patriarchal tyrant.</v>

163
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like none of that is reasonable.</v>

164
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 2>So this is a really negative,</v>

165
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:36.830
<v Speaker 2>not active,</v>

166
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 2>this whole patriarchy idea.</v>

167
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible narrative.</v>

168
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.400
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>

169
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.650
<v Speaker 2>and I think the purpose of the narrative is,</v>

170
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 2>is fundamentally to blur the distinction between competence and power.</v>
