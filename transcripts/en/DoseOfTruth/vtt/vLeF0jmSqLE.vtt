00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.270
<v Speaker 1>The Prieto distribution,</v>

2
00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.210
<v Speaker 1>it looks like this.</v>

3
00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.000
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like a normal distribution.</v>

4
00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:11.810
<v Speaker 1>A lot of you guys had been told about not normal distributions and how many</v>

5
00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:15.050
<v Speaker 1>things follow a normal distribution.</v>

6
00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>Most things,</v>

7
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>but that's really a limited case.</v>

8
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.130
<v Speaker 1>You can understand a Prieto distribution.</v>

9
00:00:22.131 --> 00:00:22.964
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

10
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>you've all played monopoly,</v>

11
00:00:24.351 --> 00:00:29.351
<v Speaker 1>I presume at the beginning everyone has the same amount of money.</v>

12
00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.090
<v Speaker 1>We'll include property,</v>

13
00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.320
<v Speaker 1>the same amount of wealth.</v>

14
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Then what happens as the game progresses and really as a function of chance,</v>

15
00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean I know yet we have to use your head a little bit and monopoly,</v>

16
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>but the basic rule is just buy everything you can get your hands on</v>

17
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>and then trade meanly,</v>

18
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:47.540
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

19
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.990
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning everybody has the same amount and then as you begin to play,</v>

20
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.220
<v Speaker 1>if you had enough players you would develop an a normal distribution because</v>

21
00:00:58.221 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>some people would win relatively consistently and some people would lose</v>

22
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:03.710
<v Speaker 1>relatively consistently.</v>

23
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>And so the money starts to be distributed in a normal distribution.</v>

24
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about money and the thing about lots of things is that</v>

25
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.840
<v Speaker 1>zero is involved in zero is a weird place because if you're playing a trading</v>

26
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>game and you hit zero,</v>

27
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.913
<v Speaker 1>then you're done.</v>

28
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.721
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

29
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>and it's very hard to recover from zero and you know it's really hard to</v>

30
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:30.951
<v Speaker 1>recover.</v>

31
00:01:30.951 --> 00:01:32.690
<v Speaker 1>You know when you're doomed in monopoly,</v>

32
00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>you can tell you've got some resources,</v>

34
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.870
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be some crisis when you land on some hotel and you're going</v>

35
00:01:41.181 --> 00:01:41.901
<v Speaker 1>to get wiped out,</v>

36
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:42.381
<v Speaker 1>you know it.</v>

37
00:01:42.381 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 1>So there's a point at which you're headed for zero.</v>

38
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Even if you have something you know and you might be rescued by</v>

39
00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.323
<v Speaker 1>luck,</v>

40
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.020
<v Speaker 1>but you know when you're doomed.</v>

41
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.040
<v Speaker 1>So what happens is that as you continue to play monopoly more and more people</v>

42
00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:09.041
<v Speaker 1>stack up at zero and fewer and fewer people have more and more money.</v>

43
00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>And when the game is over,</v>

44
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>everyone has nothing except one person and they have all of it.</v>

45
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.990
<v Speaker 1>Now the funny thing about that is that in some sense that's how trading games</v>

46
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:21.800
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

47
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

48
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.850
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>

49
00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 1>you might wonder why is that?</v>

50
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.970
<v Speaker 1>Why there is inequality in a society and it's easy to consider that it's because</v>

51
00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>the society is corrupt and perhaps,</v>

52
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

53
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>society's ours somewhat or horribly corrupt.</v>

54
00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:36.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the variation.</v>

55
00:02:36.891 --> 00:02:41.891
<v Speaker 1>There's no society that's without its criminal criminal element and fixed</v>

56
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:44.360
<v Speaker 1>element anyways.</v>

57
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.600
<v Speaker 1>Trading Games tend to produce a Prieto distribution so that very many people</v>

58
00:02:50.601 --> 00:02:55.250
<v Speaker 1>have very little and a tiny minority have a tremendous amount.</v>

59
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>That's the 1% that you hear about.</v>

60
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.633
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

61
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>And you know the thing about that 1% is that that's happened in every society</v>

62
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.030
<v Speaker 1>that's ever been studied.</v>

63
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter what the governmental system is and it certainly</v>

64
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.610
<v Speaker 1>handled it certainly happened under the Soviets,</v>

65
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

66
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>And there was a lot of people who had enough zero so they just died.</v>

67
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

68
00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.343
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

69
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.720
<v Speaker 1>the Utopian dream was completely unimplementable for a variety of very complex</v>

70
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:26.800
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

71
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 1>One is that it's very hard to fight against that distribution pattern when</v>

72
00:03:31.781 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>people are trading.</v>

73
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>Because mere statistics,</v>

74
00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:35.741
<v Speaker 1>we'll do that.</v>

75
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:36.780
<v Speaker 1>And then there's other things that,</v>

76
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>and I should tell you as well,</v>

77
00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>that the Prieto distribution that governs a lot of things.</v>

78
00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.213
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

79
00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.560
<v Speaker 1>if you look at books,</v>

80
00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>if I remember properly last year there was something like a million English</v>

81
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>language books published</v>

82
00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 1>and I think 500 of them sold more than a hundred thousand copies,</v>

83
00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.681
<v Speaker 1>which is none,</v>

84
00:03:56.681 --> 00:03:56.921
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

85
00:03:56.921 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>That's none.</v>

86
00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.590
<v Speaker 1>And of that 500 you can be sure that one of them was by Stephen King and he took</v>

87
00:04:02.591 --> 00:04:07.591
<v Speaker 1>half the money because there's like five authors in the English language who are</v>

88
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 1>on every airport paperback stand,</v>

89
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.280
<v Speaker 1>occupying the top rung.</v>

90
00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's massive real estate,</v>

91
00:04:16.721 --> 00:04:16.901
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

92
00:04:16.901 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's replicated everywhere.</v>

93
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.640
<v Speaker 1>And because there are so prominent and because there are no names when people</v>

94
00:04:24.461 --> 00:04:26.290
<v Speaker 1>are in a hurry and they just want something to read,</v>

95
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>they just grabbed that and then more money goes to those people.</v>

96
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:29.381
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

97
00:04:29.381 --> 00:04:30.214
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:33.850
<v Speaker 1>success breeds success and failure breeds failure.</v>

99
00:04:33.851 --> 00:04:35.500
<v Speaker 1>And it's not necessarily linear.</v>

100
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.470
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really difficult thing to deal with.</v>
