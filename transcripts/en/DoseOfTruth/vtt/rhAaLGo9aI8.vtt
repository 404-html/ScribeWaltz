00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Here today in Manhattan,</v>

2
00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>talking to Doctor Jonathan Heit who's a professor at Nyu.</v>

3
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

4
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:14.603
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm here for a bunch of reasons.</v>

6
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan isn't extremely interesting researcher.</v>

7
00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.490
<v Speaker 1>I've been following his work on disgust and political belief for literally,</v>

8
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.510
<v Speaker 1>literally for decades.</v>

9
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:27.260
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the first people who started to do serious research on disgust,</v>

10
00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:30.740
<v Speaker 1>which is its own emotional system and therefore very much worth attending to.</v>

11
00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.580
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

12
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>but we also have some other interests in common.</v>

13
00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

14
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Jonathan also started this institute called the Heterodox Academy,</v>

15
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.620
<v Speaker 1>which is attempting to bring back a reasonable diversity of views,</v>

16
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>what he regards as a reasonable diversity of views to university,</v>

17
00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:47.204
<v Speaker 1>faculty and,</v>

18
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>and campuses and discussion.</v>

19
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:49.584
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

20
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

21
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 1>I first met Jonathan,</v>

22
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be just about 30 years ago,</v>

23
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.570
<v Speaker 1>25 years ago,</v>

24
00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>eight 2014,</v>

25
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:58.161
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

26
00:00:58.161 --> 00:00:58.420
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

27
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

28
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.200
<v Speaker 1>the 1994.</v>

29
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.381
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

30
00:01:00.381 --> 00:01:01.430
<v Speaker 1>it was in 1994.</v>

31
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

32
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

33
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

34
00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

35
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:03.321
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

36
00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.230
<v Speaker 1>you came to do a job talk at Harvard too,</v>

37
00:01:05.231 --> 00:01:07.220
<v Speaker 1>at for an assistant professorship position,</v>

38
00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:10.080
<v Speaker 1>and I'd been aware of your work on discuss then and,</v>

39
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>and agitated hard for them to hire you because I thought it was of great</v>

40
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:14.661
<v Speaker 1>significance,</v>

41
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>which turned out to be exactly the case.</v>

42
00:01:16.521 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>So what do you remember about that?</v>

43
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I remember I was so excited to have an interview at Harvard.</v>

44
00:01:21.201 --> 00:01:23.660
<v Speaker 1>It was my only interview if I didn't get that job.</v>

45
00:01:23.661 --> 00:01:25.910
<v Speaker 1>I had no job for the following year.</v>

46
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>And it was a very strange day in which I didn't feel particularly welcome or</v>

47
00:01:31.281 --> 00:01:31.731
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>

48
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:36.731
<v Speaker 1>And then I had my session with you in which he was this guy who was had,</v>

49
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>he actually got a job at Harvard and he was studying young,</v>

50
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>which is like almost taboo.</v>

51
00:01:43.221 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about dreams and creativity.</v>

52
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.820
<v Speaker 1>And so I just,</v>

53
00:01:46.821 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>that was the really bright,</v>

54
00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>that was the bright memory of the day was our hour long conversation.</v>
