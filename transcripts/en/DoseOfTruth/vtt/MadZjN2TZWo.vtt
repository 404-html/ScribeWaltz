1
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>The one in the last,</v>

2
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.430
<v Speaker 1>which is on the right.</v>

3
00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>It's quite a horrifying image.</v>

4
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:10.891
<v Speaker 1>She know.</v>

5
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>And that's a kind of a devouring father figure.</v>

6
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

7
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:14.890
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

8
00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>here's a,</v>

9
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.830
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about that I,</v>

10
00:00:16.831 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>which I think is extremely useful.</v>

11
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:18.571
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

12
00:00:18.571 --> 00:00:18.751
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

13
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>you guys are in university,</v>

14
00:00:20.011 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

15
00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.413
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

16
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.313
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

17
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
<v Speaker 1>university is one of those patriarchal institution that's gives with one hand</v>

18
00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>and takes away with another,</v>

19
00:00:28.951 --> 00:00:29.221
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:30.360
<v Speaker 1>So when you come here,</v>

21
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>there's thousands of you,</v>

22
00:00:31.321 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>there's tens of thousands of view.</v>

23
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense as an individual you're rather faceless and you're also in some</v>

24
00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>sense at the bottom of the power hierarchy in the university,</v>

25
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 1>I think more than you should be.</v>

26
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>But whatever you,</v>

27
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>you are at the bottom of it.</v>

28
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.243
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

29
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>there's a crushing institutional weight that comes along with being part of such</v>

30
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>a big university in particular.</v>

31
00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

32
00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.620
<v Speaker 1>that's really hard on students in their first year.</v>

33
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.251
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:00:53.251 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>it's always seemed to me that it's better for first year students to go to a</v>

35
00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>smaller place where the institutional weight is not so heavy.</v>

36
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.141
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

37
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>I've tested u of t students in their first year with things like the Beck</v>

38
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:09.801
<v Speaker 1>depression inventory and about 30% of u of t students meet criteria for</v>

39
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>hospitalized depression.</v>

40
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.570
<v Speaker 1>They do,</v>

41
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

42
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

43
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.470
<v Speaker 1>but that's also because the back is way more sensitive to that than it should</v>

44
00:01:16.471 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

45
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.543
<v Speaker 1>At least that,</v>

46
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

47
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.510
<v Speaker 1>because I don't think its criteria for when you should be hospitalized are</v>

48
00:01:21.511 --> 00:01:22.021
<v Speaker 1>reasonable.</v>

49
00:01:22.021 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>But the point is is that the depression and the anxiety is quite high.</v>

50
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:26.221
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

51
00:01:26.221 --> 00:01:27.031
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>

52
00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:29.250
<v Speaker 1>of course you're benefiting from going to university.</v>

53
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:32.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the kind of bipolar nature of the symbol.</v>

54
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>It's the tire town,</v>

55
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 1>it's benevolent tradition.</v>

56
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:35.910
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

57
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

58
00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.800
<v Speaker 1>it's molding you.</v>

59
00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.430
<v Speaker 1>You could even say it's crushing you because an educational system does that.</v>

60
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>But at the same time it's like,</v>

61
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:43.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>unless you allow yourself to get crushed by it,</v>

63
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:47.700
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to get the benefit.</v>

64
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>And that's the paradoxical relationship that individuals have with culture</v>

65
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.171
<v Speaker 1>everywhere.</v>

66
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>And at all time.</v>

67
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

68
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.620
<v Speaker 1>without culture you're nothing.</v>

69
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>But with culture,</v>

70
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.890
<v Speaker 1>you have to be a cog in some sense.</v>

71
00:01:58.891 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And so the tension between those two things is continual and constant.</v>

72
00:02:02.941 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>You could think about it as an existential constant.</v>

73
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Ever since there's been complex human societies,</v>

74
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even when there were only tribal human societies,</v>

75
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>that's been a problem for the individual.</v>

76
00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>So culture,</v>

77
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.871
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>

78
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:19.500
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy is a solution and a problem and nature,</v>

79
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:20.191
<v Speaker 1>the unknown,</v>

80
00:02:20.191 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>unexplored territory is a solution and a problem.</v>

81
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>And then the third category,</v>

82
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.011
<v Speaker 1>while you see,</v>

83
00:02:26.011 --> 00:02:28.020
<v Speaker 1>I'll just tell you a couple of things about these images.</v>

84
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>So the one in the right,</v>

85
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.750
<v Speaker 1>that's the devouring father,</v>

86
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.220
<v Speaker 1>that's also giving birth.</v>

87
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>So in some sense,</v>

88
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.210
<v Speaker 1>your personalities are being devoured by the university,</v>

89
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.410
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time,</v>

90
00:02:37.411 --> 00:02:40.920
<v Speaker 1>a new personalities coming emerging as a consequence of that.</v>

91
00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:43.440
<v Speaker 1>And hopefully it's a better personality than the previous one.</v>

92
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.830
<v Speaker 1>If you can tolerate the tension of being transformed,</v>

93
00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>the heat and the pressure,</v>

94
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>then hopefully you come out,</v>

95
00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.390
<v Speaker 1>you come out though,</v>

97
00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:52.111
<v Speaker 1>it's worth it.</v>

98
00:02:52.111 --> 00:02:53.370
<v Speaker 1>The process is worth it.</v>
