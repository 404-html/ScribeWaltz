1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.810
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you know what you see on the left</v>

2
00:00:08.811 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>there at the top on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

3
00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.460
<v Speaker 1>on the right at the top you see a</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture of an old man kissing Joseph</v>

4
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Stalin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a weird thing to do.</v>

5
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Given that Joseph Stalin was probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the deaths of some</v>

6
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:23.600
<v Speaker 1>number of people in excess of 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>million,</v>

7
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>perhaps an excessive 30 million people</v>
<v Speaker 1>argue about this all the time.</v>

8
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.250
<v Speaker 1>He certainly starved 6 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukrainians to death in the 19 thirties,</v>

9
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 1>which is something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some reason you don't hear much</v>

10
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>about your education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

11
00:00:35.571 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>6 million Ukrainians probably worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>noticing a little bit,</v>

12
00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.260
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because this old</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

13
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:45.050
<v Speaker 1>this was taken after the fall of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berlin Wall.</v>

14
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.580
<v Speaker 1>He's nostalgic for the times when</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was certain you know,</v>

15
00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Gold Statue of style and his</v>

16
00:00:52.131 --> 00:00:55.250
<v Speaker 1>representation in some sense of a day of</v>
<v Speaker 1>five leader.</v>

17
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 1>And the old man is there is in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>position of worship and then captain</v>

18
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:01.400
<v Speaker 1>hook there at the bottom on the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand side.</v>

19
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>He is quite an interesting character</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's basically a tyrant.</v>

20
00:01:04.581 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>And the Peter Pan Story is very</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting because Peter Pan Pan Sorta</v>

21
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 1>means everything and Peter Pan is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of person who wants to retain the</v>

22
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:19.760
<v Speaker 1>dynamic potential of childhood because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're a child you're not anything</v>

23
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.810
<v Speaker 1>but you could be anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're pretty much only potential.</v>

24
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>And then you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why should you sacrifice that</v>

25
00:01:26.721 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>potential to become something actual?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because in some sense it's actually a</v>

26
00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>limiting process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

27
00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.710
<v Speaker 1>and I mean this in the most concrete</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible way,</v>

28
00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>you have more neural connections when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're born than you do at any other</v>

29
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>time in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most of those die by the time you're</v>

30
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go through this tremendous</v>

31
00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:50.750
<v Speaker 1>pruning process from when you're born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from when,</v>

32
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.320
<v Speaker 1>til two.</v>

33
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you're dying into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>childhood personality.</v>

34
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.170
<v Speaker 1>And then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happens at the end of</v>

35
00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>adolescence between say 16 and 21,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is also the peak time for risk for</v>

36
00:02:02.631 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people think that's the pruning</v>

37
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:07.490
<v Speaker 1>process gone wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

38
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:12.491
<v Speaker 1>as an adolescent you also shed childhood</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential to become the limited.</v>

39
00:02:14.031 --> 00:02:17.630
<v Speaker 1>But specialized and potentially useful</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that you will become.</v>

40
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:18.950
<v Speaker 1>And so you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

41
00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:21.590
<v Speaker 1>is it worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it worth shedding that potential?</v>

42
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.440
<v Speaker 1>And Peter Pan's answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>

43
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.060
<v Speaker 1>he wants to remain in Neverland as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>magical boy forever and he's King of the</v>

44
00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>lost boys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I would say is not a very.</v>

45
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>That's not much of a dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

46
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're,</v>

47
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:37.370
<v Speaker 1>you're the king king of the King of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>losers,</v>

48
00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:40.880
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People who can't get their act together</v>

49
00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>and mature now.</v>

50
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.930
<v Speaker 1>And you notice in Peter Pan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peter pan doesn't grow up.</v>

51
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't establish a relationship with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wendy who's actually real.</v>

52
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.230
<v Speaker 1>He has to settle for Tinkerbell who is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ferry and they don't exist.</v>

53
00:02:54.231 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 1>And so she's really in some sense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure of his imagination because he</v>

54
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:00.690
<v Speaker 1>won't mature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He have an actual relationship with,</v>

55
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.660
<v Speaker 1>with a genuine person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has to satisfy himself with while</v>

56
00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:07.120
<v Speaker 1>it's something like a pornographic</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy actually.</v>

57
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>So seriously it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is like that.</v>

58
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

59
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's toned down a lot in the movie</v>

60
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 1>version obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still,</v>

61
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.660
<v Speaker 1>that's what's underlying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

62
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>well why doesn't Peter Pan want to grow</v>
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>

63
00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is the only figure of</v>
<v Speaker 1>authority that's around for him.</v>

64
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>His P,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his captain hook,</v>

65
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.410
<v Speaker 1>and he doesn't like Captain Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's because captain hook is a</v>

66
00:03:26.411 --> 00:03:28.270
<v Speaker 1>tyrant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's brutal,</v>

67
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's also a coward because he's,</v>

68
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>he's lost a hand already to a crocodile</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a clock in its stomach.</v>

69
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.990
<v Speaker 1>That's chaos and time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>that's the dragon that lives underneath</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

71
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>It's like the basset lists can Harry</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potter and that Damn Crocodile's already</v>

72
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piece of him,</v>

73
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.140
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That crocodile has got a piece of me,</v>

74
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm older than 50 and so time is already</v>

75
00:03:51.071 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>got its grip on me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

76
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.790
<v Speaker 1>part of the problem of being adult is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you also have to take the fact that</v>

77
00:03:57.791 --> 00:04:01.810
<v Speaker 1>your finite and limited into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're terrified by that,</v>

78
00:04:01.811 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>which people tend to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then it can easily turn you into a</v>

79
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:07.720
<v Speaker 1>tyrant because you're afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything or disgusted by everything</v>

80
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:10.000
<v Speaker 1>and you have to ramp up the amount you</v>
<v Speaker 1>control it.</v>

81
00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:13.720
<v Speaker 1>And so Peter Pan looks at Captain Hook</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he thinks there's no damn way.</v>

82
00:04:13.721 --> 00:04:16.810
<v Speaker 1>That's what I want to end up as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's got a bad role model,</v>

83
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.440
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Captain Hook and Stalin and this sort</v>

84
00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>of devouring monster are good</v>
<v Speaker 1>representations of the negative or</v>

85
00:04:24.281 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical element of the great father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's the tyrannical element of the</v>

86
00:04:28.091 --> 00:04:29.020
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy.</v>
