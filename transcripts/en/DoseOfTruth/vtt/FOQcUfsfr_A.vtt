1
00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.410
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I've learned from studying that the mythological worldview,</v>

2
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:11.861
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

3
00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:16.420
<v Speaker 1>I think the mythological worldview conceptualizes the world as a place to act</v>

4
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>rather than as a place of state.</v>

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.720
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like Steven g Jay Gould's idea of two magistarium don't overlap.</v>

6
00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a moral magistarium materialists magistarium say,</v>

7
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but it's been striking to me looking at the archetypical foundations of</v>

8
00:00:31.991 --> 00:00:35.740
<v Speaker 1>mythological thinking that in that in the scientific world view,</v>

9
00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:38.830
<v Speaker 1>there seem to be two fundamental causal elements.</v>

10
00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>You could say nature and nurture,</v>

11
00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>something like that or biology and society.</v>

12
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.420
<v Speaker 1>And then technically sophisticated western academics argue about the relative</v>

13
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:51.610
<v Speaker 1>contribution of each to any given,</v>

14
00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>existential phenomena.</v>

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 1>But in the mythological worldview,</v>

17
00:00:55.361 --> 00:00:56.890
<v Speaker 1>there's always three actors.</v>

18
00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Here's nature,</v>

19
00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

20
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>usually personified as female or experienced as female.</v>

21
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Cause personified isn't quite the right word.</v>

22
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.883
<v Speaker 1>There's culture,</v>

23
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.060
<v Speaker 1>but there's also the individual and the individual seems to be the same thing as</v>

24
00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>the conscious actor.</v>

25
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the hero of the dragon slaying hero say.</v>

26
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>And there's that,</v>

27
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.370
<v Speaker 1>there is a kind of primacy given to that.</v>

28
00:01:18.371 --> 00:01:20.170
<v Speaker 1>And so in the oldest creation myths,</v>

29
00:01:20.171 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>you always see this interplay between the the mother,</v>

30
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>often mother earth and the father that the sky and then the hero who separates</v>

31
00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:32.320
<v Speaker 1>the two and somehow brains and perversely in some sense,</v>

32
00:01:32.321 --> 00:01:37.321
<v Speaker 1>although being their product clearly as the offspring is also the thing that</v>

33
00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 1>gives rise to them at the same at the same time.</v>

34
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>And it seems to be something that's in keeping in some sense with our lived</v>

35
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:50.191
<v Speaker 1>experience is that we confront the social world obviously and our beneficiaries</v>

36
00:01:51.341 --> 00:01:52.390
<v Speaker 1>and victims of it.</v>

37
00:01:52.391 --> 00:01:55.720
<v Speaker 1>And we confront the natural world in the same manner.</v>

38
00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.900
<v Speaker 1>But we also seem to be a gigantic actors and without us as a genetic actors,</v>

39
00:02:01.991 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>the idea that there is a reality seems to,</v>

40
00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.070
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be full of paradoxical holes like reality without a conscious actor.</v>

41
00:02:09.071 --> 00:02:12.790
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's the sort of thing that generates the thinking that you've</v>

42
00:02:12.791 --> 00:02:16.520
<v Speaker 1>referred to as characteristic of of Deepak Chopra and the people who,</v>

43
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 1>who make those sorts of claims.</v>

44
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.653
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

45
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.350
<v Speaker 1>what's your,</v>

47
00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 1>what's your take on,</v>

48
00:02:24.521 --> 00:02:27.280
<v Speaker 1>on consciousness and its role in being</v>

49
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 2>well and the one,</v>

50
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 2>and it's everything because,</v>

51
00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

52
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

53
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 2>it's what I tell what I tell deep,</v>

54
00:02:34.651 --> 00:02:36.400
<v Speaker 2>like what I write about in that chapter is that,</v>

55
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

56
00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.991
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

57
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 2>you're familiar with the anthropic principle.</v>

58
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:40.960
<v Speaker 2>So I call this the,</v>

59
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.850
<v Speaker 2>that the week consciousness principle that,</v>

60
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

61
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 2>without consciousness,</v>

62
00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 2>without consciousness,</v>

63
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.350
<v Speaker 2>nothing exists.</v>

64
00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:47.531
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

65
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:49.000
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the points to buck makes,</v>

66
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

67
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 2>and for me and you personally,</v>

68
00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 2>if we're dead or we're not conscious,</v>

69
00:02:53.711 --> 00:02:55.450
<v Speaker 2>the world doesn't exist for our brains.</v>

70
00:02:55.451 --> 00:02:56.284
<v Speaker 2>It's gone.</v>

71
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.740
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

72
00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:57.573
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing.</v>

73
00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.820
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

74
00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

75
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>but he goes further than that.</v>

76
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:02.920
<v Speaker 2>He says this is what I call the strong consciousness principle.</v>

77
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 2>That that consciousness is required.</v>

78
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 2>Our consciousness is required for material things to exist.</v>

79
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 2>And so there I have a discussion of what,</v>

80
00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.983
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

81
00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

82
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>Donald Hoffman,</v>

83
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.920
<v Speaker 2>the cognitive scientists at UC Irvine Coliseum,</v>

84
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.373
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

85
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

86
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 2>interface perception theory.</v>

87
00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.881
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

88
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:23.050
<v Speaker 2>I dunno if you're familiar with this,</v>

89
00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 2>but his analogy is like,</v>

90
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

91
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 2>your laptop screen here.</v>

92
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Then you'd have these icons on the screen and like the little trashcan icon</v>

93
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.193
<v Speaker 2>looks like a trashcan.</v>

94
00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 2>But of course there's no trash get the Oakland,</v>

95
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.410
<v Speaker 2>the open your laptop,</v>

96
00:03:35.411 --> 00:03:36.400
<v Speaker 2>there's no pro trashcan in there.</v>

97
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

98
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 2>these are just kind of icons that represent something that we think of as a</v>

99
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:41.770
<v Speaker 2>trash can.</v>

100
00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.130
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

101
00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

102
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:43.920
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

103
00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:44.711
<v Speaker 2>gets to the problem of,</v>

104
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's like to be a bat,</v>

105
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 2>a famous thought experiment.</v>

106
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 2>I can't know if like bolted on some,</v>

107
00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 2>some huge ears.</v>

108
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:51.581
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

109
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:55.570
<v Speaker 2>and I had an echolocation system and the neural processes to process that</v>

110
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:57.260
<v Speaker 2>information until on,</v>

111
00:03:57.261 --> 00:03:59.300
<v Speaker 2>I would have some sense of what it's like to be at that,</v>

112
00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.260
<v Speaker 2>but they have everything on to actually be a bad thing.</v>

113
00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 2>And I would just be a bat and I wouldn't even be a,</v>

114
00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.370
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't even know I was a human wondering what it's like to be a federal case</v>

115
00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:09.221
<v Speaker 2>at some level.</v>

116
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 2>We can't actually know.</v>

117
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

118
00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.300
<v Speaker 2>you know what it's like to be something else.</v>

119
00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:14.134
<v Speaker 2>And so you,</v>

120
00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.711
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

121
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:17.320
<v Speaker 2>with Deepak and I and these kinds of traditions like that,</v>

122
00:04:17.321 --> 00:04:18.460
<v Speaker 2>we hit this system,</v>

123
00:04:18.461 --> 00:04:20.410
<v Speaker 2>logical wall of language.</v>

124
00:04:20.411 --> 00:04:22.810
<v Speaker 2>It's difficult to say what you mean by certain things.</v>

125
00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
