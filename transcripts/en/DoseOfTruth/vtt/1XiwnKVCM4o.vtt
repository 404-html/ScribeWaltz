1
00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.250
<v Speaker 1>You your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wrote your amcap cause you want to</v>

2
00:00:02.251 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>go to medical school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And so now the envelope comes and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>shaking away and the open and it's like</v>

4
00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 1>you got 25th percentile just like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of the people who take the test.</v>

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Well what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

6
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
<v Speaker 1>Well this is Sir all blown to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>And so God only knows how many of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are going to go to.</v>

8
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.220
<v Speaker 1>Maybe your study habits really need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

9
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to reconstitute yourself all</v>

10
00:00:26.461 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>the way down to the level of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>habits.</v>

11
00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.210
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can be devastating news.</v>

12
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the ways to protect yourself</v>

13
00:00:32.161 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>against something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like don't have one plan,</v>

14
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.010
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to stake yourself on</v>

15
00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should throw a couple of alternative</v>

16
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 1>scaffolds up beside you so that you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere to go.</v>

17
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>You want to be a doctor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

18
00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.120
<v Speaker 1>well you could be a nurse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's not a doctor,</v>

19
00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:52.500
<v Speaker 1>but it needs cutting your throat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're still doing 80% of what you</v>

20
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>wanted to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you want to and you want to think</v>

21
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>about this during your whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

22
00:00:56.581 --> 00:01:01.110
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to take a high risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to scaffold yourself and other</v>

23
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>areas so that if it fails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't bother them,</v>

24
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>doesn't drop out and you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's also very much worth thinking</v>

25
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.780
<v Speaker 1>about with regards to setting up your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life in general.</v>

26
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you concentrate solely on your</v>

27
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get along way in your career and</v>

28
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I would say that that's a strategy that</v>
<v Speaker 1>a minority of men preferentially do that</v>

29
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 1>that's all they do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They worked like 70 80 hours a week.</v>

30
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>They go flat out on their career.</v>

31
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>They're staking everything on the small</v>
<v Speaker 1>probability of exceptional status in a</v>

32
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 1>narrow domain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

33
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>it's hard on them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a life.</v>

34
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for them to have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

35
00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.330
<v Speaker 1>They don't know how to take any leisure</v>
<v Speaker 1>activity like they get very one</v>

36
00:01:42.331 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it may be that that unit</v>

37
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:48.570
<v Speaker 1>dimentionality is the price you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay to be exceptional at one thing,</v>

38
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're going to be something</v>

39
00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>like a genius level mathematician and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to do that for,</v>

40
00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.060
<v Speaker 1>or a scientist say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you're in your lab,</v>

41
00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>you're in your lab all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working 70 hours a week or 80</v>

42
00:02:00.211 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>hours a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smart,</v>

43
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.780
<v Speaker 1>you're dedicated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're unit dimensional.</v>

44
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.020
<v Speaker 1>And that's how you get to beat all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other people who are doing that.</v>

45
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.710
<v Speaker 1>It's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is you don't get a life.</v>

46
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you love being a scientist and you</v>

47
00:02:13.381 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>have that kind of focus of mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well first of all,</v>

48
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>you're a rare person and second you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to pay for it,</v>

49
00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.840
<v Speaker 1>but fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More power to you.</v>

50
00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

51
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a risky business to do that.</v>

52
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>You sacrifice a lot for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

53
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:35.121
<v Speaker 1>And I would say most often if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking about having a healthy life,</v>

54
00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.130
<v Speaker 1>that isn't what you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You spread yourself out more.</v>

55
00:02:38.131 --> 00:02:38.641
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

56
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:41.550
<v Speaker 1>you have a family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have some things that you do outside</v>

57
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>of work that are meaningful to you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>useful.</v>

58
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a network of friends.</v>

59
00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

60
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.460
<v Speaker 1>that those three things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a loner for things,</v>

61
00:02:50.461 --> 00:02:52.800
<v Speaker 1>a loner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plenty to keep you well oriented.</v>

62
00:02:52.801 --> 00:02:54.930
<v Speaker 1>And then if one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>collapses,</v>

63
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything doesn't go now.</v>

64
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the price you pay for that is,</v>

65
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>the more you strive to optimize that</v>
<v Speaker 1>balance,</v>

66
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 1>the less likely you are to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastically successful at any single</v>

67
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>one of them.</v>

68
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 1>But you might have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

69
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 1>if you can consider your life as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

70
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.520
<v Speaker 1>that might be a winning strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things,</v>

71
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Carl Young sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked this.</v>

72
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>He thought that men went after</v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection and when women went after</v>

73
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>wholeness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there are different,</v>

74
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>they're different value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their did their different.</v>

75
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.090
<v Speaker 1>There's something different at the top</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the value hierarchy.</v>

76
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.330
<v Speaker 1>So perfection would be steak it all on</v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing and look for radical success.</v>

77
00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Not all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that all men do that cause they</v>

78
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.570
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're,</v>

79
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about extremes and at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least with regards to the men that do</v>

80
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wholeness ideas more like,</v>

81
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:46.264
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

82
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.390
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like I want one thing in my life to</v>

83
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:54.240
<v Speaker 1>be 150%</v>
<v Speaker 1>or I want five things in my life to be</v>

84
00:03:54.241 --> 00:03:55.080
<v Speaker 1>80%</v>

85
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.980
<v Speaker 1>well there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot more richness in a life</v>

86
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>where you have five things operating at</v>
<v Speaker 1>80% but you're not operating in any of</v>

87
00:04:03.791 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>at any of them at 150% so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I really believe this because I've</v>

88
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 1>watched men and women go through their</v>
<v Speaker 1>careers now for a long period of time.</v>

89
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of things that produce</v>

90
00:04:15.761 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things that I've noticed</v>

91
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>is that mostly women in their thirties</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear bail out of unit dimensional</v>

92
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.520
<v Speaker 1>careers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't do them.</v>

93
00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>They won't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't put in the 80 hours a week</v>

94
00:04:27.881 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>that they would have to put in in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dominate that particular area.</v>

95
00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.690
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason that they won't do it is</v>

96
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>because they decide it's not worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And no wonder because why would that be</v>

97
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 1>worth it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask yourself though.</v>

98
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you want to be an outstanding</v>

99
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:45.280
<v Speaker 1>scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like okay,</v>

100
00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.610
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really that's what you want because that</v>

101
00:04:48.611 --> 00:04:50.050
<v Speaker 1>means that's what you do.</v>

102
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

103
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're competing with other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

104
00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:54.770
<v Speaker 1>You know they're smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're hardworking.</v>

105
00:04:54.771 --> 00:04:58.130
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to be at the top,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to be smarter and work harder</v>

106
00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:01.400
<v Speaker 1>than any of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And working hard means working long</v>

107
00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.680
<v Speaker 1>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it also means working diligently.</v>

108
00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:07.700
<v Speaker 1>But in the final analysis it's all also</v>
<v Speaker 1>an additive issue.</v>

109
00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.560
<v Speaker 1>If I'm smart and hardworking and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>crank out for 70 hours a week and you do</v>

110
00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 1>it for 30 it's like until years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so far ahead of you,</v>

111
00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:20.480
<v Speaker 1>you will never ever catch up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

112
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 1>and I think partly may be part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason too that women are oriented that</v>

113
00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.800
<v Speaker 1>way more than men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's two reasons.</v>

114
00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 1>One is socioeconomic status does not</v>
<v Speaker 1>make women more attractive on the mating</v>

115
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:31.850
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does make men more attractive.</v>

116
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.520
<v Speaker 1>And the second is women's timeframe is</v>
<v Speaker 1>compressed,</v>

117
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

118
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Cause guys can always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'll have kids later and they can</v>

119
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 1>say that until they're like 80 whereas</v>
<v Speaker 1>women,</v>

120
00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:41.660
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no way man,</v>

121
00:05:41.661 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Speaker 1>you gotta get you gotta get it together</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time were let's say 40 but really</v>

122
00:05:45.231 --> 00:05:49.880
<v Speaker 1>probably by 35 but definitely by 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause otherwise it ain't happening and</v>

123
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:53.720
<v Speaker 1>that's bloody dreadful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the most unhappy people you ever</v>

124
00:05:53.721 --> 00:05:54.970
<v Speaker 1>see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

125
00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

126
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>One of the common roots to extreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>unhappiness is to want children and not</v>

127
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 1>have the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't recommend that.</v>

128
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see couples who were in their</v>

129
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:09.650
<v Speaker 1>thirties one couple in three over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>age of 30 has fertility problems.</v>

130
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>That's defined as an inability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>conceive after one year of trying one in</v>

131
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's worth thinking about because people</v>

132
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:19.280
<v Speaker 1>are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very unhappy if they want to have kids</v>

133
00:06:19.281 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>and then they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

134
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>you're in the medical mill for 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's,</v>

135
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>if that's what happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

136
00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:25.941
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

137
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:26.774
<v Speaker 1>back to this.</v>

138
00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.510
<v Speaker 1>I think what I'll do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what time it is,</v>

140
00:06:33.511 --> 00:06:36.150
<v Speaker 1>it is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'd have to open up a whole new</v>

141
00:06:36.151 --> 00:06:39.090
<v Speaker 1>can of worms so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the next part.</v>

142
00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:42.960
<v Speaker 1>So I think actually what I'm going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>is just recap what we did and then stop.</v>

143
00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe we can have some questions or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we can call it an early day.</v>

144
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:47.940
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what,</v>

145
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.290
<v Speaker 1>what is the fundamental issue here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did we discuss today?</v>

146
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.610
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're in a frame and we've laid out</v>

147
00:06:56.611 --> 00:06:58.410
<v Speaker 1>its characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a goal in it,</v>

148
00:06:58.411 --> 00:07:01.860
<v Speaker 1>it has a current position and it has</v>
<v Speaker 1>rules for operating within it.</v>

149
00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:05.640
<v Speaker 1>It governs your perceptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really critical thing to</v>

150
00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:09.000
<v Speaker 1>understand and well governing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptions.</v>

151
00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:10.950
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tells you what's useful to you and</v>

152
00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:12.690
<v Speaker 1>what gets in your way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But most importantly,</v>

153
00:07:12.691 --> 00:07:14.490
<v Speaker 1>it tells you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to pay attention to it.</v>

154
00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.560
<v Speaker 1>So as long as your damn frame is</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional,</v>

155
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.220
<v Speaker 1>you can ignore most of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that means your stress level is way</v>

156
00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:22.380
<v Speaker 1>lower than it would normally be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

157
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.600
<v Speaker 1>So perception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motivation,</v>

158
00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:26.520
<v Speaker 1>all of that's integrated into those</v>
<v Speaker 1>frames.</v>

159
00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And then the emotional element comes out</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that with it.</v>

160
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.000
<v Speaker 1>When you're within a frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that move you forward and</v>

161
00:07:33.001 --> 00:07:36.450
<v Speaker 1>validate the framer positive and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that get in your way and invalidate the</v>

162
00:07:36.451 --> 00:07:39.120
<v Speaker 1>frame are negative and then the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue is,</v>

163
00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:42.300
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if your frame is invalidated,</v>

164
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.030
<v Speaker 1>exactly what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't answer that without</v>

165
00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.850
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the hierarchy of frames</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're lucky,</v>

166
00:07:47.851 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 1>it just means your frame needs a minor</v>
<v Speaker 1>alteration that would be equivalent to</v>

167
00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Piaget did in assimilation in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>

168
00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can stay in the frame.</v>

169
00:07:56.431 --> 00:08:01.350
<v Speaker 1>You just make a small adjustment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the Piaget idiom distinction</v>

170
00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 1>between assimilation and accommodation</v>
<v Speaker 1>is technically inaccurate because it's a</v>

171
00:08:06.331 --> 00:08:08.040
<v Speaker 1>continuum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

172
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I want to grab your pen,</v>

173
00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 1>I have a little frame that will enable</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to do that.</v>

174
00:08:14.701 --> 00:08:16.350
<v Speaker 1>You say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well I'm staying within the frame to</v>

175
00:08:16.351 --> 00:08:18.540
<v Speaker 1>move that out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually I'm not.</v>

176
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:23.790
<v Speaker 1>What I'm doing is doing a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing a small micro revolution in</v>

177
00:08:23.791 --> 00:08:25.650
<v Speaker 1>the frame,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving that to pick that up.</v>

178
00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.310
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think accommodation,</v>

179
00:08:29.370 --> 00:08:34.080
<v Speaker 1>there's no hard distinction between</v>
<v Speaker 1>assimilation and accommodation.</v>

180
00:08:34.081 --> 00:08:35.910
<v Speaker 1>It's a continuum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd say,</v>

181
00:08:35.911 --> 00:08:36.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

182
00:08:36.261 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 1>if the top end of your map gets blown</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

183
00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:42.000
<v Speaker 1>that requires accommodation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if it's just a little micro change</v>

184
00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:43.530
<v Speaker 1>at the bottom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's assimilation.</v>

185
00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.450
<v Speaker 1>But there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no real difference between this</v>

186
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:49.530
<v Speaker 1>except for scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's kind of a continual scale,</v>

187
00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:52.290
<v Speaker 1>not an absolute dichotomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

188
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.670
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

189
00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>back to the back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The emotion.</v>

190
00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happens and it isn't what you</v>

191
00:08:59.131 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

192
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could mean anything.</v>

193
00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 1>What you do is you start trying to micro</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjust the frame at the highest level of</v>

194
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:10.860
<v Speaker 1>resolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you might find that you can't</v>

195
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 1>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to jump up to the next one.</v>

196
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.570
<v Speaker 1>You have to jump up to the next one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to jump up to the next one.</v>

197
00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And each time you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the psychophysiological cost increases.</v>

198
00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.113
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

199
00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.083
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

200
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:32.390
<v Speaker 1>so we talked about the cost end of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum and then we also talked about</v>

201
00:09:32.391 --> 00:09:35.180
<v Speaker 1>the engagement end of the spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea would be,</v>

202
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

203
00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.950
<v Speaker 1>if you're very much engaged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say in</v>

204
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.673
<v Speaker 2>cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that again.</v>

205
00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.090
<v Speaker 1>If you find it very engaging to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your baby,</v>

206
00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.400
<v Speaker 1>then you might be doing it in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an indicating that you're taking</v>

207
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Speaker 1>good care of your family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're being a good parent and that</v>

208
00:09:56.431 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 1>you're being a good person all</v>
<v Speaker 1>simultaneously.</v>

209
00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:02.550
<v Speaker 1>And there's rich meaning in that and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the systems that orient you with</v>

210
00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:03.960
<v Speaker 1>regards to meaning are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

211
00:10:03.961 --> 00:10:08.400
<v Speaker 1>you're doing this microaction in a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that benefits the maintenance and maybe</v>

212
00:10:08.401 --> 00:10:11.070
<v Speaker 1>even the expansion of all the frames</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exist above it.</v>

213
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

214
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.360
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to be doing that all the time</v>

215
00:10:15.361 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 1>if you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that implies that you want to</v>

216
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:22.701
<v Speaker 1>delineate out a pretty well developed</v>
<v Speaker 1>value system so that you're not acting</v>

217
00:10:23.431 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 1>at odds with yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you also want to have that</v>

218
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:31.401
<v Speaker 1>integrated within the broader society so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that society isn't existing towards you</v>

219
00:10:31.831 --> 00:10:35.310
<v Speaker 1>as a continual obstacle and making your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life miserable.</v>
