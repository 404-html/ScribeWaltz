00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>You're working like mad to get your bachelor's degree.</v>

2
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:15.710
<v Speaker 1>when you're really excited about the day that I do curse.</v>

4
00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.191
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

5
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>what happens the week after?</v>

6
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>What happens the week after is that you're no longer in the pursuing a bachelor</v>

7
00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:23.090
<v Speaker 1>degree universe.</v>

8
00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.280
<v Speaker 1>You're now in the post bachelor degree looking for a job universe and that might</v>

9
00:00:28.281 --> 00:00:30.080
<v Speaker 1>not be nearly as pleasant to place.</v>

10
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 1>So the problem is,</v>

11
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.070
<v Speaker 1>is when you attain a goal,</v>

12
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.090
<v Speaker 1>the framework within which you are operating disappears and there's no</v>

13
00:00:38.211 --> 00:00:39.170
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>

14
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.230
<v Speaker 1>there's no necessity that it's replaced by a better friend.</v>

15
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.891
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

16
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>lots of times it's replaced by chaos at least for some period of time.</v>

17
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:49.430
<v Speaker 1>So it's really weird thing.</v>

18
00:00:49.431 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>And this is like the surface story.</v>

19
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:51.620
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

20
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.841
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>it says office might be happy when he's rolling the rock up the hill.</v>
