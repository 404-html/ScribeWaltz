00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.960
<v Speaker 1>When I was about your age,</v>

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.980
<v Speaker 1>now it was back in the early eighties or there abouts.</v>

3
00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.363
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.680
<v Speaker 1>and this is particularly true around 1984,</v>

5
00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>but it was true before that too.</v>

6
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>every generation has its worries,</v>

9
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.850
<v Speaker 1>real or imagined.</v>

10
00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:32.851
<v Speaker 1>And the primary worry for people of my generation was nuclear war and you know,</v>

11
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:38.280
<v Speaker 1>it was a genuine worry.</v>

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 1>at one point,</v>

14
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.200
<v Speaker 1>many years later,</v>

15
00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>I went down to Arizona to visit an ICBM,</v>

16
00:00:47.701 --> 00:00:52.460
<v Speaker 1>a decommissioned ICBM nuclear missile silo and I,</v>

17
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>the ICBM intercontinental ballistic missiles were very large rockets.</v>

18
00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.631
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

19
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>They flew it,</v>

20
00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.020
<v Speaker 1>I could fly halfway around the world and it was deep underground and behind</v>

21
00:01:04.021 --> 00:01:04.291
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

22
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>very thick steel doors.</v>

23
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.320
<v Speaker 1>It was light green,</v>

24
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:07.531
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:11.760
<v Speaker 1>that pastel green that everyone seemed to like the 1950s.</v>

26
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>I was like Pastel Green Star Trek console.</v>

27
00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>That's what it looked like.</v>

28
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.443
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

29
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>so we went down,</v>

30
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>out in the yard was in the desert out in the yard.</v>

31
00:01:22.651 --> 00:01:23.484
<v Speaker 1>There was a very,</v>

32
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I would say yes,</v>

33
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>magical object,</v>

34
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.650
<v Speaker 1>for lack of a better word.</v>

35
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And that was the nose cone for the IC.</v>

36
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 1>I ICBM and it was quite big,</v>

37
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.490
<v Speaker 1>that big boat out high pointed like the point of a bullet about three quarters</v>

38
00:01:45.491 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>of inch of an inch thick plastic.</v>

39
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.850
<v Speaker 1>You know what kind of a resin,</v>

40
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 1>and it was designed to melt on reentry.</v>

41
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.230
<v Speaker 1>So that was just sitting there.</v>

42
00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:54.790
<v Speaker 1>So that was fairly</v>

43
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:56.330
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

44
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.260
<v Speaker 1>thought provoking,</v>

45
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>let's put it that way.</v>

46
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>And then we went into the missile silo,</v>

47
00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 1>interestingly enough,</v>

48
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>appended to the front of it.</v>

49
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.580
<v Speaker 1>It had been decommissioned under Reagan by the way,</v>

50
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 1>in the front of it,</v>

51
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>there was a,</v>

52
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.400
<v Speaker 1>like a museum with artifacts from the 1980s featuring Reagan and Gorbachev</v>

53
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Meeting Multiple Times.</v>

54
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.860
<v Speaker 1>And it was staffed by these southern,</v>

55
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 1>these Americans from the south who were grandparents age and they were here just</v>

56
00:02:30.171 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 1>super friendly and you know,</v>

57
00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:33.350
<v Speaker 1>they were happy to be in the museum.</v>

58
00:02:33.351 --> 00:02:34.490
<v Speaker 1>It was like going to visit your,</v>

59
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>your grandma's nuclear missile silo.</v>

60
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.110
<v Speaker 1>And so it was jarring,</v>

61
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:39.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

62
00:02:39.381 --> 00:02:42.860
<v Speaker 1>because it's obviously a poor tentious</v>

63
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>place and yet it was conjoined with hospitality and welcoming.</v>

64
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.150
<v Speaker 1>It was surreal in that manner.</v>

65
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.531
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

66
00:02:54.531 --> 00:02:55.364
<v Speaker 1>we went in to the</v>

67
00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.040
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

68
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>into the silo and a,</v>

69
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>they ran us through a simulated launch.</v>

70
00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.670
<v Speaker 1>So imagine a panel like this made out of metal except twice as long with another</v>

71
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>one of these things out the other end,</v>

72
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>16 feet across or so</v>

73
00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>basically 1950s technology</v>

74
00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.403
<v Speaker 1>but updated.</v>

75
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.620
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine that what you had to do to launch it was the,</v>

76
00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy with a key and there was another guy with a key and if I</v>

77
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:27.761
<v Speaker 1>remember correctly,</v>

78
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>the keys were around their necks,</v>

79
00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>although I don't think they were stored around their necks permanently.</v>

80
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:32.620
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

81
00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.090
<v Speaker 1>and so to launch the missile,</v>

82
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>you had to put the key in the lock,</v>

83
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.863
<v Speaker 1>both of you.</v>

84
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>That was the safety precautions,</v>

85
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 1>had to be two of you.</v>

86
00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.930
<v Speaker 1>Put the key in the lock and hold it for 10 seconds and then a way the missile</v>

87
00:03:46.931 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>goes and it wasn't as big.</v>

88
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>The missile wasn't as big as the rockets that went to the moon,</v>

89
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.370
<v Speaker 1>but it was plenty big.</v>

90
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.851
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

91
00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:55.040
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

92
00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.040
<v Speaker 1>the silo itself would have easily been as wide as this room is and perhaps</v>

93
00:04:00.881 --> 00:04:01.840
<v Speaker 1>larger and many,</v>

94
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:02.920
<v Speaker 1>many stories tall,</v>

95
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

96
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:04.450
<v Speaker 1>cause it was nested underground.</v>

97
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>So they ran us through a simulated launch,</v>

98
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.313
<v Speaker 1>which was</v>

99
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.990
<v Speaker 1>surreal I would say.</v>

100
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.940
<v Speaker 1>And then they told us that someone asked and they said the keys were in once.</v>

101
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Now they wouldn't tell us when,</v>

102
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:22.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.770
<v Speaker 1>that would have been during the Cuban missile crisis because we were that close</v>

104
00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:32.070
<v Speaker 1>and we were close again at other times,</v>

105
00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:33.420
<v Speaker 1>although perhaps not that close.</v>

106
00:04:33.421 --> 00:04:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And there seemed to be another peak of</v>

107
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 1>conflict in 1984 when there was a movie showed at that time called the day</v>

108
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:45.810
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

109
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>which at that time garnered more views than any movie ever had on,</v>

110
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.270
<v Speaker 1>on TV.</v>

111
00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.270
<v Speaker 1>And it was a story about the aftermath of a nuclear war and the people who were</v>

112
00:04:57.151 --> 00:04:57.541
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>

113
00:04:57.541 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 1>And it was pretty realistic and pretty frightening.</v>

114
00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:03.180
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

115
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.020
<v Speaker 1>it turned out,</v>

116
00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.480
<v Speaker 1>as I found out later,</v>

117
00:05:06.481 --> 00:05:11.370
<v Speaker 1>that that movie actually was one of the things that influenced Ronald Reagan to</v>

118
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>put pressure on or negotiate with the Soviets,</v>

119
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.560
<v Speaker 1>depending on how you look at it.</v>

120
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.473
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

121
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.681
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:05:19.681 --> 00:05:19.921
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

123
00:05:19.921 --> 00:05:20.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:05:20.161 --> 00:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>five years later,</v>

125
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.060
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union collapsed.</v>

126
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.530
<v Speaker 1>No one saw that coming.</v>

127
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:27.413
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

128
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.020
<v Speaker 1>and it really didn't collapse in 1989 in some sense,</v>

129
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:31.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

130
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:34.890
<v Speaker 1>like a huge machine like that.</v>

131
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.330
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't fall apart all like once it falls apart over time.</v>

132
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:42.960
<v Speaker 1>And then at some point it just becomes unsustainable and topples and,</v>

133
00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:44.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.400
<v Speaker 1>it's like they lost faith in their doctrine and,</v>

135
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.413
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

136
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.670
<v Speaker 1>and for good reason.</v>
