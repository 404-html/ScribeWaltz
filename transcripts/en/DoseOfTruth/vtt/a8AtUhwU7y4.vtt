00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm a female student in stem and I feel bombarded by all the feminist groups</v>

2
00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>trying to infantilize me.</v>

3
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.450
<v Speaker 1>How do I prevent them from turning me into an adult child?</v>

4
00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.113
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.170
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that's really useful to do in university is to pick your peer</v>

6
00:00:26.171 --> 00:00:27.004
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.300
<v Speaker 1>When I went to university,</v>

8
00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>like I made new friends in university and that was really useful.</v>

9
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Speaker 1>So I had my personal friends and they were people who were trying to aim at</v>

10
00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>something better than what they had,</v>

11
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>something better than what they had left.</v>

12
00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>And that was a real relief to me.</v>

13
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about that in my new book too.</v>

14
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

15
00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.600
<v Speaker 1>called make friends with people who want the best for you.</v>

16
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:50.530
<v Speaker 1>That's rule three.</v>

17
00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.053
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

18
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.490
<v Speaker 1>but I also realized that when you went to university,</v>

19
00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 1>you picked your peers and in the stem fields what you should do is pick some</v>

20
00:00:58.811 --> 00:01:02.080
<v Speaker 1>great scientists and those could be people that you just read books about.</v>

21
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Pick some great scientists,</v>

22
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.130
<v Speaker 1>man or some great engineers.</v>

23
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:07.360
<v Speaker 1>There's some great mathematicians,</v>

24
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>cause I don't know where you are in the stem fields.</v>

25
00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>Pick some,</v>

26
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.610
<v Speaker 1>pick a hero or two or three and then make those of your peers right and don't</v>

27
00:01:15.611 --> 00:01:18.310
<v Speaker 1>pay any attention to all the noise and Ruckus that you hear around you.</v>

28
00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Speaker 1>It's all nonsense anyways.</v>

29
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Partly what should happen when you go to university is that you should be</v>

30
00:01:22.781 --> 00:01:27.040
<v Speaker 1>introduced to great people and those can be great people of the past.</v>

31
00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

32
00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.230
<v Speaker 1>their spirits still live on in their work,</v>

33
00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:29.861
<v Speaker 1>in their books,</v>

34
00:01:29.861 --> 00:01:34.180
<v Speaker 1>and you can pick them as peers and just ignore all that idiot political</v>

35
00:01:34.181 --> 00:01:34.901
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>

36
00:01:34.901 --> 00:01:35.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:35.111 --> 00:01:38.920
<v Speaker 1>you straighten yourself out and learn to be great at what you do.</v>

38
00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Develop a philosophy of greatness and that will keep the social justice warriors</v>

39
00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:44.950
<v Speaker 1>at bay.</v>
