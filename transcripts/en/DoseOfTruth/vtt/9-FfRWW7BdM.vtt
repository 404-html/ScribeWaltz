00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:09.090
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.210
<v Speaker 1>What are they paying for?</v>

3
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.630
<v Speaker 1>You're paying for that fun that's associated with the anticipation of the reward</v>

4
00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:16.191
<v Speaker 1>and the brain.</v>

5
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:16.461
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

6
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:16.711
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

7
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>your emotional brain isn't that great at calculating mathematically</v>

8
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.650
<v Speaker 1>probabilities.</v>

9
00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>And so it sort of says some chance you have some chance of winning $50 million.</v>

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.111
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:27.111 --> 00:00:29.030
<v Speaker 1>it might be one in 380 million,</v>

12
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:29.864
<v Speaker 1>but your,</v>

13
00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>your anticipation system isn't a mathematical system.</v>

15
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.333
<v Speaker 1>It just says,</v>

16
00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.611
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

17
00:00:34.611 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>you have some chance that's a lot more than none.</v>

18
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.510
<v Speaker 1>in some ways it's infinitely more than none because at zero you have no chance.</v>

20
00:00:43.611 --> 00:00:44.031
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

21
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:46.160
<v Speaker 1>with one tech you have some chance.</v>

22
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>So that gets the old excitement going.</v>
