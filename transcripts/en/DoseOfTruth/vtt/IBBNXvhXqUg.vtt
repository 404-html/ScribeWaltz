00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Let me read this to you and then we'll get to the Q.</v>

2
00:00:10.061 --> 00:00:10.151
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

3
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:10.640
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

4
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I think this,</v>

5
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.450
<v Speaker 1>this is the kind of thing that I'd like to shed light on in any possible lecture</v>

6
00:00:16.451 --> 00:00:17.590
<v Speaker 1>series on marks.</v>

7
00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 1>So this is called invocation of one in despair.</v>

8
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.260
<v Speaker 1>So God has snatched from me my all in the curse and rack of destiny.</v>

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>All his worlds are gone beyond recall.</v>

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Nothing but revenge is left to me on myself.</v>

11
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Revenge all proudly wreak on that being that enthroned Lord make my strength a</v>

12
00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.530
<v Speaker 1>patchwork of what's week.</v>

13
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>Leave my better self without reward,</v>

14
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I shall build my throne.</v>

15
00:00:52.061 --> 00:00:53.410
<v Speaker 1>High overhead,</v>

16
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:54.423
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>

17
00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.970
<v Speaker 1>tremendous shell at summit be for it's bulwark,</v>

18
00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.510
<v Speaker 1>superstitious dread for it's Marshall,</v>

19
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>blackest agony who looks on it with a healthy I shall turn back struck deathly</v>

20
00:01:08.561 --> 00:01:13.561
<v Speaker 1>Pale and dumb clutched by blind and chill mortality made his happiness prepare</v>

21
00:01:15.101 --> 00:01:15.934
<v Speaker 1>his too.</v>

22
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>And the Almighty's lightning shell rebound from that massive iron giant.</v>

23
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.980
<v Speaker 1>If he bring my walls and towers down,</v>

24
00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.591
<v Speaker 1>he turned it.</v>

25
00:01:24.591 --> 00:01:28.060
<v Speaker 1>He shall raise them up defiant.</v>

26
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:32.080
<v Speaker 1>so on that happy note,</v>

28
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.560
<v Speaker 1>that's perhaps perhaps some insight into the spirit that motivated our friend Mr</v>

29
00:01:39.251 --> 00:01:40.150
<v Speaker 1>Carl Marx.</v>

30
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.343
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

31
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>I've really been thinking a lot about the Marxist critique of Western culture,</v>

32
00:01:47.561 --> 00:01:49.330
<v Speaker 1>especially if fundamental,</v>

33
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.693
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

34
00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Marxist critique is something eight fundamental Mar Marxist critique is a</v>

35
00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.520
<v Speaker 1>criticism of the fact that in capitalist societies,</v>

36
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 1>a disproportionate amount of the spoils,</v>

38
00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:09.481
<v Speaker 1>let's say the wealth goes to a disproportionately small part of the community.</v>

39
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.970
<v Speaker 1>And this is of course a truism by the way,</v>

40
00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>it is the case that that occurs,</v>

41
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>which is why the richest dozen people in the world have as much money as the</v>

42
00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:18.910
<v Speaker 1>bottom 2 billion,</v>

43
00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:19.744
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

44
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.030
<v Speaker 1>it's also the case,</v>

46
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>it's part of a more generalized law,</v>

47
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.660
<v Speaker 1>sometimes called price's law and represented with the peritoneal distribution.</v>

48
00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:33.661
<v Speaker 1>Perico is p a r e t o showing that not only do the bulk of the spoils,</v>

49
00:02:35.381 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 1>let's say the wealth go to a disproportionately small number of people,</v>

50
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>but the bulk of the productive work is also done by a disproportionately small</v>

51
00:02:43.331 --> 00:02:44.110
<v Speaker 1>number of people,</v>

52
00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.420
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily the same people that have the wealth.</v>

53
00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.140
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

54
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>although in a functional society,</v>

55
00:02:48.881 --> 00:02:49.870
<v Speaker 1>there's some overlap.</v>

56
00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Now Mark's was correct and observing that that happened in capitalist societies,</v>

57
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:58.510
<v Speaker 1>but incorrect in assuming that there are any societies that have ever been</v>

58
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 1>formulated or that could ever be formulated that would escape from that destiny.</v>

59
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>Because you see that same tremendous Pareto distribution,</v>

60
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:09.370
<v Speaker 1>that proclivity of wealth to,</v>

61
00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>to accrue in the hands of small of a small number of people.</v>

62
00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.700
<v Speaker 1>You see that in every human society that's ever been studied.</v>

63
00:03:15.701 --> 00:03:16.570
<v Speaker 1>And if it's not wealth,</v>

64
00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>it's sexual access or reproductive,</v>

65
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.020
<v Speaker 1>well that's the same thing.</v>

66
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Reproductive Opportunity,</v>

67
00:03:21.521 --> 00:03:22.354
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

68
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

69
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.853
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

70
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.723
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>

71
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>or material possessions,</v>

72
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:27.730
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously a form of wealth,</v>

73
00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:28.564
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

74
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that characterizes the west is that all our,</v>

75
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 1>although our society's produced inequality,</v>

76
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>like every other society,</v>

77
00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.050
<v Speaker 1>including animal societies,</v>

78
00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

79
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.880
<v Speaker 1>and even among plants,</v>

80
00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>even among stars,</v>

81
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:44.590
<v Speaker 1>a disproportionate number of the heavenly bodies have most of the mass,</v>

82
00:03:44.591 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

83
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>which is not something that you can lay at the feet of western capitalism.</v>

84
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.793
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

85
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>the thing that the West has been able to do</v>

86
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>that other societies haven't been able to do is to produce wealth along with</v>

87
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.464
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>

88
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.390
<v Speaker 1>And that wealth is definitely</v>

89
00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.370
<v Speaker 1>a fair proportion of that wealth is actually going to benefit the people who are</v>

90
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>in the diarists straights.</v>

91
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.360
<v Speaker 1>And that process has been accelerating over the last 20 years.</v>

92
00:04:13.361 --> 00:04:17.650
<v Speaker 1>So from the year 2000 till the year 2012,</v>

93
00:04:17.651 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>the level of absolute poverty in the world has halved,</v>

94
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.680
<v Speaker 1>which is the fastest rate of economic development in the history of the world.</v>

95
00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>And I think that rate is accelerating,</v>

96
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:28.030
<v Speaker 1>at least in part because the Soviet Union,</v>

97
00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:28.631
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

98
00:04:28.631 --> 00:04:33.631
<v Speaker 1>isn't around anymore to agitate the economic masters in leaders of developing</v>

99
00:04:34.721 --> 00:04:37.990
<v Speaker 1>countries into the adoption of counterproductive collectivist economic</v>

100
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:38.824
<v Speaker 1>strategies.</v>

101
00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>And so what appears to be happening is that as we spread the fundamental western</v>

102
00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.310
<v Speaker 1>ethos of individuality and private property and free markets and freedom in</v>

103
00:04:48.311 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>general for men and for women around the world,</v>

104
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:52.420
<v Speaker 1>that the poorest people are becoming,</v>

105
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:54.010
<v Speaker 1>well at least they're not starving.</v>

106
00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.220
<v Speaker 1>They're becoming richer even though at the same time we do pay a price for that</v>

107
00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>in inequality.</v>

108
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.620
<v Speaker 1>So there's a rule and I don't know how to formulate it exactly are there seems</v>

109
00:05:02.621 --> 00:05:07.621
<v Speaker 1>to be a rule which is a given unit of wealth is produced at the cost of of</v>

110
00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>certain production of inequality,</v>

111
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>a certain number of units of inequality and that seems to be inalienable to some</v>

112
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:14.554
<v Speaker 1>degree.</v>

113
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

114
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 1>that's part of a Marxist critique the poem first,</v>

115
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:22.840
<v Speaker 1>which is like you want to listen to that poem a couple of times I would say,</v>

116
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>but then more fundamentally a critique of the Marxist critique of the West.</v>

117
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:28.211
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

118
00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:29.800
<v Speaker 1>the West produces inequality,</v>

119
00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.260
<v Speaker 1>but it's not something that you could lay at the feet of capitalism.</v>

120
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:32.831
<v Speaker 1>It's a much,</v>

121
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:34.030
<v Speaker 1>much deeper problem.</v>

122
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And what that means too is that those people who purport to be on the side of</v>

123
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 1>the poor and dispossessed are not being friends to them by any stretch of the</v>

124
00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>imagination at all by attempting to tear down the very hierarchies that seemed</v>

125
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:49.930
<v Speaker 1>to be leveraging the world's poorest people out of poverty as rapidly as</v>

126
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:50.764
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

127
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.980
<v Speaker 1>There's evidence as well that people start to become very concerned about the</v>

128
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:54.431
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

129
00:05:54.431 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 1>If you can get their family income,</v>

130
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.250
<v Speaker 1>I think are its GDP,</v>

131
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I think up about 40 f above about 4,500 us a year.</v>

132
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>They start to have a little bit of spare time to be concerned with the</v>

133
00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>environment around them.</v>

134
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 1>And so the right way to,</v>

135
00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>to ecological balance in the world seems to be,</v>

136
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

137
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>to make people rich as fast as we possibly can to make the poor rich as fast as</v>

138
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:16.604
<v Speaker 1>we possibly can.</v>

139
00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And wouldn't that be lovely if that was really the way out.</v>
