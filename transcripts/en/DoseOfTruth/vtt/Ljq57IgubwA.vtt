00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.780
<v Speaker 1>My lower Iq clients,</v>

2
00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.700
<v Speaker 1>they used to go to the government agencies that were designed to help people</v>

3
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>find employment.</v>

4
00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:14.351
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

5
00:00:14.351 --> 00:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>the typical response was,</v>

6
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:16.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.210
<v Speaker 1>just go home and type up your CV and distributes.</v>

8
00:00:19.211 --> 00:00:19.830
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

9
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

10
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:20.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

11
00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.860
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

12
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.000
<v Speaker 1>you just go like,</v>

13
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I can't use a computer.</v>

14
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:24.640
<v Speaker 1>I can't type,</v>

15
00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what a CV is.</v>

16
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.161
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's,</v>

17
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 1>it's a nonstarter and all three councils,</v>

18
00:00:29.261 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

19
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.010
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

20
00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>So in the United States are 51 million people with iqs under 85 and there were</v>

21
00:00:35.831 --> 00:00:39.040
<v Speaker 1>about 43 million people living in poverty.</v>

22
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.310
<v Speaker 1>Do you think those Venn diagrams intersect?</v>

23
00:00:42.311 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

24
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

25
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

26
00:00:43.211 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 1>we should also be clear about this because it is so politically suspect is that</v>

27
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not like it's,</v>

28
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

29
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:50.803
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

30
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.830
<v Speaker 1>it's self evident that people who have less cognitive capability are likely to</v>

31
00:01:00.741 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>end up poor because there are serious,</v>

32
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:08.411
<v Speaker 1>complex problems in life that the Septum that they have a difficult time dealing</v>

33
00:01:08.511 --> 00:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>with and they can't learn as quickly.</v>

34
00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And so the relationship between poverty and intelligence is self evident.</v>

35
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.440
<v Speaker 1>If you're willing to think it through for any length of time.</v>

36
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that everybody who's rich that is,</v>

37
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.370
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that everyone who is rich is smart and it doesn't mean that</v>

38
00:01:25.371 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>everyone who is horror is stupid.</v>
