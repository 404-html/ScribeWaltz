1
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>Postmodern view is like the hobbs of</v>
<v Speaker 1>view in some sense,</v>

2
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:13.280
<v Speaker 1>except you want to replace the</v>
<v Speaker 1>individual with,</v>

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.440
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with pyramids of,</v>

4
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.910
<v Speaker 1>of social organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hierarchies of social organization</v>

5
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.720
<v Speaker 1>that are based on group identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.070
<v Speaker 1>and the landscape in which those</v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramids exists is one of unbroken</v>

7
00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:32.330
<v Speaker 1>enmity and inability to communicate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very dark view as far as I'm</v>

8
00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:36.290
<v Speaker 1>concerned and I think it's fundamentally</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong and in many ways,</v>

9
00:00:36.291 --> 00:00:40.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's right in that there are</v>
<v Speaker 1>groups of people and there is some</v>

10
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>difficulty in communication between</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

11
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.650
<v Speaker 1>And that power is an element in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>formation of hierarchies,</v>

12
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.710
<v Speaker 1>but you can't reduce hierarchy or group</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship to those premises.</v>

13
00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>It's too simplified because people also</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperate.</v>

14
00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>We're also not groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men,</v>

15
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.780
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of us belong to many groups,</v>

16
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 1>so it's to the actual situation is far</v>
<v Speaker 1>too complex to reduce it to that degree,</v>

17
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>to reduce it to that degree.</v>

18
00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Even though you can come up with a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanatory story if you do so,</v>

19
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't capture the nuances and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not just nuances.</v>

20
00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:21.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't capture the essence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

21
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:25.400
<v Speaker 1>the thing is is that when you make the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presupposition that the reason that</v>

22
00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:30.100
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies exist is because of power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then essentially what you do is turn to</v>

23
00:01:30.101 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 1>every hierarchy into a tyranny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you,</v>

24
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>if there is a hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you assume it's a tyranny.</v>

25
00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:35.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really the patriarchy.</v>

26
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.690
<v Speaker 1>The Patriarchy is hierarchy assumed as</v>
<v Speaker 1>tyranny,</v>

27
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.160
<v Speaker 1>and that's also just not true except in</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological hierarchies.</v>

28
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know from the psychological</v>

29
00:01:46.761 --> 00:01:49.760
<v Speaker 1>literature that the best predictors of</v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm life success,</v>

30
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.200
<v Speaker 1>our intelligence and conscientiousness</v>
<v Speaker 1>in western countries at least.</v>

31
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you'd hope for it,</v>

32
00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.990
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>More or less,</v>

33
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.820
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to even just set up a</v>

34
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you weren't particularly smart</v>

35
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>or hard working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might want to set up a society where</v>

36
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are good predictors of success</v>

37
00:02:08.571 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>because then the people who were smart</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hardworking would produce a bunch of</v>

38
00:02:11.451 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>things that you could have if you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade for them.</v>

39
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.570
<v Speaker 1>And of course that is actually the</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that most of us are in.</v>

40
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the other thing about</v>

41
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>people who believed that hierarchies in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West are only composed of of power</v>

42
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>and tyranny is that their own actions</v>
<v Speaker 1>belie that because whenever they make a</v>

43
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:33.320
<v Speaker 1>decision to interact with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

44
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.000
<v Speaker 1>they attempt or to make a purchase or or</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a trade,</v>

45
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to obtain a service,</v>

46
00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.490
<v Speaker 1>a service of any importance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say a medical service,</v>

47
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.840
<v Speaker 1>they are going to definitely act as if</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are less and more competent people</v>

48
00:02:49.761 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>within that hierarchy and seek out the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones that are more competent obviously,</v>

49
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 1>which you don't do if the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the hierarchy is only composed of</v>

50
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.700
<v Speaker 1>tyranny and power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no point looking for.</v>

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the west and in functioning</v>

52
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies are basically predicated on</v>

53
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>competence and not power.</v>

54
00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.770
<v Speaker 1>And and you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's pretty naive.</v>

55
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:09.311
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

56
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:14.311
<v Speaker 1>actually it's not very naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying at all that inappropriate</v>

57
00:03:14.321 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>power plays don't play a role in</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupting hierarchies of competence.</v>

58
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>That happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but generally what happens is if the</v>

59
00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.950
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies of competence get corrupted</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough by power,</v>

60
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>then they crumble because they can no</v>
<v Speaker 1>longer function.</v>

61
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.620
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

62
00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence that are hierarchies of</v>

63
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:33.040
<v Speaker 1>competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Work is everywhere because everything</v>

64
00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 1>around us works all the time ion hers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The two interesting stories in her book,</v>

65
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>infidel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a great book by the way,</v>

66
00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she came from Africa and from a country</v>

67
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't very functional and when she</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to Holland she said there were two</v>

68
00:03:47.351 --> 00:03:49.610
<v Speaker 1>things that really amazed her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

69
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.370
<v Speaker 1>and this really struck me because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

70
00:03:51.371 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you get lucky and you can see</v>

71
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world you live in from an outsider's</v>

72
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.860
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.690
<v Speaker 1>You get to see through someone else's</v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes.</v>

74
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she said the first thing that knocked</v>

75
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:06.571
<v Speaker 1>her off her feet was waiting for a bus</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in Amsterdam and on the,</v>

76
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.490
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's standing at the bus stop and</v>

77
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>there's a pole there and there's digital</v>
<v Speaker 1>sign on the pole and the digital sign</v>

78
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>says when the next bus is going to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>and counts down.</v>

79
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:18.830
<v Speaker 1>And then when it hits zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bus appears and she,</v>

80
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 1>she just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she just,</v>

81
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.780
<v Speaker 1>she absolutely could not believe that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would happen,</v>

82
00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>that there could be a sign that told you</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the bus would come and that it</v>

83
00:04:27.071 --> 00:04:30.610
<v Speaker 1>would change and the bus would actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>appear and you think,</v>

84
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

85
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.040
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a miracle man.</v>

86
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>That's an absolute miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

87
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to think that through,</v>

88
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of timing and organization</v>

89
00:04:39.251 --> 00:04:39.721
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

90
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:41.650
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and reliability,</v>

91
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>mechanical reliability and sociological</v>
<v Speaker 1>or social organization and dedication on</v>

92
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>the part of the bus drivers and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire company and the Organization of</v>

93
00:04:50.141 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>the whole city and the state to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>that possible is absolutely beyond</v>

94
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:55.930
<v Speaker 1>belief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it's time to,</v>

95
00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.460
<v Speaker 1>well perhaps not the second but to 10</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds or something like that.</v>

96
00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.930
<v Speaker 1>That is absolutely beyond belief and her</v>
<v Speaker 1>inability to comprehend.</v>

97
00:05:04.931 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>That was the correct response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other things she was amazed</v>

98
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>by was that you could go talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>policemen and they would help you.</v>

99
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.390
<v Speaker 1>That was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was just a no go for her because</v>

100
00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>for her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her experience was policemen were there</v>

101
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>to shake you down and and hurt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you think,</v>

102
00:05:23.681 --> 00:05:24.514
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

103
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't.</v>

104
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 1>I won't dwell on that point any longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is,</v>

105
00:05:30.381 --> 00:05:35.381
<v Speaker 1>is that it's absolutely ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blind to make the assumption that the</v>

106
00:05:39.101 --> 00:05:44.101
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies in functioning Western</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracies are fundamentally predicated</v>

107
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>on power and tyranny.</v>
