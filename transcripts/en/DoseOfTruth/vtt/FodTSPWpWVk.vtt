James,

2
00:00:08.201 --> 00:00:08.831
Mark Garber,

3
00:00:08.831 --> 00:00:09.221
he says,

4
00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:13.090
how can you be confident and courageous if your father was emotionally absent

5
00:00:13.091 --> 00:00:14.050
and narcissistic?

6
00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:15.370
I'm 21 and very creative.

7
00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.420
My mother is a people pleaser who isn't confident in herself and uses me as

8
00:00:19.421 --> 00:00:20.560
emotional support.

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.953
Help.

10
00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:33.751
Well look,

11
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.840
you're confident about some things you said you were very creative

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.450
so you're confident enough to say that.

13
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.853
And you know,

14
00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.180
I don't see the problem with questions like this.

15
00:00:55.181 --> 00:00:56.860
I'm not criticizing your question by the way,

16
00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:01.861
is that you're linking your lack of confidence and courage to the absence of

17
00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:06.340
your father and his narcissism and also associating it with your mother being a

18
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:07.210
people pleaser.

19
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.961
So,

20
00:01:07.961 --> 00:01:08.771
and you know,

21
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:10.210
there may be something to that.

22
00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.513
Um,

23
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.320
it could be James that you could,

24
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.600
could stand to talk to somebody you know,

25
00:01:16.601 --> 00:01:21.430
for a while on a regular basis and see if they can help you sort this out.

26
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:25.960
You obviously seem to think that this is a problem with you moving forward in

27
00:01:25.961 --> 00:01:26.794
your life.

28
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.320
If you don't want to talk to someone about it,

29
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:31.690
then I would say the other thing,

30
00:01:31.691 --> 00:01:32.590
you need a plan.

31
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.910
I know I always refer to that,

32
00:01:33.911 --> 00:01:34.780
but it's the case.

33
00:01:34.781 --> 00:01:39.781
You need a plan and then you need to break the plan down into this,

34
00:01:39.821 --> 00:01:42.340
into small steps that are somewhat challenging,

35
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.310
that you have a high probability of nonetheless,

36
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.173
obtaining.

37
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.210
And then I would say by observing yourself,

38
00:01:49.211 --> 00:01:50.770
move forward properly,

39
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:52.630
that your confidence will increase.

40
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:53.620
You're only 21,

41
00:01:53.621 --> 00:01:53.891
you know,

42
00:01:53.891 --> 00:01:55.390
so you're not that old.

43
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.673
But,

44
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:57.753
um,

45
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.470
that's the best I can do without having more information about the specifics of

46
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:03.340
your situation.
