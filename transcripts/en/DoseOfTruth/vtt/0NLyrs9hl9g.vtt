1
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.440
<v Speaker 1>The old kingdom is threatened by scar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scar is the evil king of the evil</v>

2
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>brother of the King.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The king is the parrot.</v>

3
00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.890
<v Speaker 1>The entity that inhabits the pinnacle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pyramid the king always has an evil</v>

4
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:26.451
<v Speaker 1>brother and you know that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that there is</v>

5
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:31.450
<v Speaker 1>no hierarchy that's so pristine that it</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't threatened by corruption and scars</v>

6
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.180
<v Speaker 1>presented as a resentful intellect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very common trope as well.</v>

7
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>That's the evil scientist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the only only the evil</v>

8
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>scientist idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the mad scientist it's the evil</v>

9
00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:46.800
<v Speaker 1>genius God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many movies with a mythological</v>

10
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:51.801
<v Speaker 1>substrate have come out in the last 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>years that prominently feature an evil</v>

11
00:00:51.811 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's dozens of them.</v>

12
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>There's an inexhaustible hunger for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>representation.</v>

13
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean in the last avenger movie you had</v>
<v Speaker 1>fantasy right.</v>

14
00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>He's basically the spirit of death who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is an evil genius who thinks that mass</v>

15
00:01:05.761 --> 00:01:10.620
<v Speaker 1>extinction is the answer to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>population problem of let's say the</v>

16
00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:11.454
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

17
00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Something to think about very seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the reason for that is that this</v>

18
00:01:16.891 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>estate is always threatened by</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence always.</v>

19
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.250
<v Speaker 1>The hierarchy can always be come corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tyrannical and that those the forces</v>

20
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>of malevolence let's say they are</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiring behind the scenes tend to</v>

21
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:34.911
<v Speaker 1>tilt every hierarchy towards tyranny and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proper attitude to take towards that</v>

22
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.320
<v Speaker 1>universal truth is to stay in the light</v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep your damn eyes open and so well</v>

23
00:01:44.321 --> 00:01:49.090
<v Speaker 1>what happens in the Lion King is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil brother overthrows the rightful</v>

24
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>king and that again is an unbelievably</v>
<v Speaker 1>common idea.</v>

25
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>You see that idea echo throughout the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mythological landscape for centuries.</v>

26
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.650
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is it happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

27
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.910
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened in Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happened in most of the</v>

28
00:02:03.911 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical societies of the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>most societies in the world are</v>

29
00:02:08.381 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 1>tyrannical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always the possibility that the</v>

30
00:02:11.651 --> 00:02:15.610
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies that we live in will become</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and counter-productive and</v>

31
00:02:15.611 --> 00:02:19.690
<v Speaker 1>there's multiple reasons for that but</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're summed up in the malevolence of</v>

32
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the arrogant intellect.</v>

33
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

34
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>That's a very common idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the character of Milton Satan.</v>

35
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>By the way because he's the ultimate in</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrogant intellect Milton Satan is the</v>

36
00:02:31.991 --> 00:02:35.980
<v Speaker 1>figure who believes that his knowledge</v>
<v Speaker 1>is sufficient to do without the</v>

37
00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:40.660
<v Speaker 1>transcendent to do without the idea that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something beyond or that</v>

38
00:02:40.661 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 1>there's still something to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I know is all that I need to know</v>

39
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the belief of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamental tyrant</v>

40
00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.900
<v Speaker 1>the evil</v>
<v Speaker 1>brother of the King kills the King Simba</v>

41
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.240
<v Speaker 1>loses his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's another common idea because</v>

42
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.440
<v Speaker 1>everyone loses their father in some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense people grow up and become cynical</v>

43
00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:06.140
<v Speaker 1>as teenagers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reason they become cynical as</v>

44
00:03:06.141 --> 00:03:11.141
<v Speaker 1>teenagers is because they see that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption of the state is sufficient to</v>

45
00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:14.930
<v Speaker 1>undermine their confidence in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benevolence of the state and they get</v>

46
00:03:14.931 --> 00:03:18.380
<v Speaker 1>cynical prematurely because what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hell do you know when you're a teenager.</v>

47
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.250
<v Speaker 1>But you're encouraged in your cynicism</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequently in our culture which is a</v>

48
00:03:22.251 --> 00:03:25.820
<v Speaker 1>very bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No I mean even though it is the case</v>

49
00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:30.821
<v Speaker 1>that the structure is always threatened</v>
<v Speaker 1>by malevolence let's say and and human</v>

50
00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:36.071
<v Speaker 1>weakness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simba ends up fatherless and lost and</v>

51
00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:39.200
<v Speaker 1>alienated from his kingdom just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>King Arthur.</v>

52
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.470
<v Speaker 1>It's the same story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The king is often the rightful king is</v>

53
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:48.471
<v Speaker 1>often dissociated from his kingdom and</v>
<v Speaker 1>forced to occupy a domain that's outside</v>

54
00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:51.510
<v Speaker 1>the kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what happens to Simba.</v>

55
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.510
<v Speaker 1>He loses his father and what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's</v>

56
00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.160
<v Speaker 1>he adopts the lifestyle of an impulsive</v>
<v Speaker 1>adolescent.</v>

57
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.440
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens and so he's out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there in no man's land with his useless</v>

58
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000
<v Speaker 1>teenage friends doing nothing of any</v>
<v Speaker 1>good except living for the moment.</v>

59
00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's the nihilistic retreat from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corrupt state.</v>

60
00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.740
<v Speaker 1>And no wonder and you might say well if</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state is corrupt why should I</v>

61
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:24.660
<v Speaker 1>participate in its maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why should I do anything that's useful</v>

62
00:04:24.661 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>if all I'm doing is furthering the</v>
<v Speaker 1>development of a corrupt state.</v>

63
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.870
<v Speaker 1>And I would say the message in the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathological university disciplines the</v>

64
00:04:34.201 --> 00:04:35.190
<v Speaker 1>activist disciplines.</v>

65
00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.300
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly the message that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly putting out to young men</v>

66
00:04:39.301 --> 00:04:43.320
<v Speaker 2>which is you live in a corrupt</v>
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy and that means any attempts</v>

67
00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:48.000
<v Speaker 2>that you make to further yourself in</v>
<v Speaker 2>this life as an individual with regards</v>

68
00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.790
<v Speaker 2>to your family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another corrupt patriarchal institution</v>

69
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.470
<v Speaker 2>with regards to marriage or career that</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that is is furthering the corrupt</v>

70
00:04:55.471 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 2>patriarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything you do that you think is good</v>

71
00:04:58.561 --> 00:05:02.130
<v Speaker 2>in the productive sense is actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing nothing but contributing to this</v>

72
00:05:02.131 --> 00:05:07.131
<v Speaker 2>catastrophic tyrannical patriarchy very</v>
<v Speaker 2>demoralizing but also opens the door for</v>

73
00:05:08.101 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 2>you to be as useless as you possibly can</v>
<v Speaker 2>because and there's always a temptation</v>

74
00:05:12.421 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 2>in that direction because it's easier</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can justify it by saying well if</v>

75
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:21.180
<v Speaker 2>I did anything productive all I would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing is furthering the dominance of the</v>

76
00:05:21.181 --> 00:05:25.050
<v Speaker 2>corrupt system anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you haven't met people who think</v>

77
00:05:25.051 --> 00:05:29.640
<v Speaker 2>that way then you haven't met very many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people because that's an unbelievably</v>

78
00:05:29.641 --> 00:05:34.530
<v Speaker 2>common way of thinking and it's an</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse but it's also a logical reaction</v>

79
00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.930
<v Speaker 2>to the confusion of competence with</v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

80
00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 2>That's part and parcel of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>collectivist landscape.</v>

81
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 1>So Simba grows up so to speak gets older</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least playing this impulsive day to</v>

82
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:51.720
<v Speaker 1>day game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rule seven in my book is do what is</v>

83
00:05:51.721 --> 00:05:56.721
<v Speaker 1>meaningful not what is expedient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course symbols lifestyle outside</v>

84
00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:01.200
<v Speaker 1>the rightful kingdom is nothing but</v>
<v Speaker 1>expedients it's impulsive pleasure and</v>

85
00:06:01.201 --> 00:06:06.201
<v Speaker 1>that lasts until until what until his</v>
<v Speaker 1>old girlfriend shows up Nahla and she's</v>

86
00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.330
<v Speaker 1>been dealing with the catastrophe of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and maybe that's because</v>

87
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:20.720
<v Speaker 1>women</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demands of family fall heavier on</v>

88
00:06:20.891 --> 00:06:25.891
<v Speaker 1>women at least initially and so they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive to the catastrophe of the</v>

89
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:29.020
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nahla shows up and says December</v>

90
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.730
<v Speaker 1>What the hell do you think you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're useless.</v>

91
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:36.340
<v Speaker 1>I liked you when you were a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you are.</v>

92
00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.790
<v Speaker 1>You're completely useless and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything's falling apart and the state</v>

93
00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:42.220
<v Speaker 1>has become corrupt and there isn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to eat and there's things that</v>

94
00:06:42.221 --> 00:06:43.054
<v Speaker 1>need to be done.</v>

95
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:48.430
<v Speaker 2>And he falls in love with her of course</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably because she criticizes him and</v>

96
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:54.400
<v Speaker 2>and then he's deeply ashamed of himself</v>
<v Speaker 2>because she rejects him because he's</v>

97
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:57.460
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so she should reject him because</v>

98
00:06:57.461 --> 00:07:00.460
<v Speaker 2>he's useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if she didn't then he'd never figure</v>

99
00:07:00.461 --> 00:07:03.700
<v Speaker 2>out why he was useless and do something</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it and that's when he meets his</v>

100
00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:06.490
<v Speaker 2>father.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember there's an initiation scene</v>

101
00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:06.970
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

102
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 3>The wise old baboon who is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be a fool and in the early drafts of the</v>

103
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:16.000
<v Speaker 3>movie guides him down underground so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that he can reflect upon himself which</v>

104
00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:21.001
<v Speaker 3>is what he does in a pool down in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>underworld and what he sees reflected in</v>

105
00:07:21.461 --> 00:07:26.461
<v Speaker 3>his own face is the spirit of his dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>father mature face symbol looks like</v>

106
00:07:26.951 --> 00:07:28.360
<v Speaker 3>this right.</v>

107
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.010
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a deer caught in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>headlights.</v>

108
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.040
<v Speaker 1>The animators have done a really good</v>
<v Speaker 1>job of capturing that naive and sort of</v>

109
00:07:36.711 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 1>rotten old adolescent innocence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that's that's outlived its</v>

110
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:45.641
<v Speaker 1>utility and but his father has a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>set face which means he's integrated his</v>

111
00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 1>aggression and he sees his father in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and then he sees his father in the</v>

112
00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:55.571
<v Speaker 1>sky and his father says you've forgotten</v>
<v Speaker 1>who you are Wake the hell up.</v>

113
00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.240
<v Speaker 1>Grow the hell up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things to fix there.</v>

114
00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:06.520
<v Speaker 1>There are things to fix there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibilities to take on and so.</v>

115
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Symbols rather shocked by this encounter</v>
<v Speaker 1>and decides to leave his false</v>

116
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:19.441
<v Speaker 1>adolescent paradise and to go back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the catastrophically demolished state</v>

117
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.710
<v Speaker 1>and he takes his friends and he sees</v>
<v Speaker 1>this place that where there's nothing</v>

118
00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but starvation and cruelty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>malevolence and tyranny.</v>

00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:43.140
<v Speaker 1>that's fascist mysticism by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems to appeal to a very large</v>

122
00:08:45.411 --> 00:08:48.610
<v Speaker 1>number of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Given the popularity of that movie and</v>

123
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.590
<v Speaker 1>what is that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's it called a responsibility.</v>

124
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental called a</v>
