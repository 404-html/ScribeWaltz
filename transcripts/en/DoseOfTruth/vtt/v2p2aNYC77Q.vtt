00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So that's a lovely photograph.</v>

2
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Obviously that's the establishment of a new center.</v>

3
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>And then the center can be a cathedral to and often is of course in classic</v>

4
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.320
<v Speaker 1>towns,</v>

5
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.270
<v Speaker 1>European towns in particular,</v>

6
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.620
<v Speaker 1>although it's not only European towns that are like this there,</v>

7
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>there's a center that's made out of stone.</v>

8
00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:32.900
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the cathedral and it's got the highest tower on top of the</v>

9
00:00:32.901 --> 00:00:33.231
<v Speaker 1>tower.</v>

10
00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>There's often a cross and that's the symbolic center.</v>

11
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.430
<v Speaker 1>So people are,</v>

12
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.600
<v Speaker 1>are drawn together around whatever the cross represents.</v>

13
00:00:41.601 --> 00:00:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Now that the cross obviously represents a center cause it's an x,</v>

14
00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:45.741
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:45.741 --> 00:00:46.970
<v Speaker 1>X marks the spot.</v>

16
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So the center of the Cross is the center.</v>

17
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.340
<v Speaker 1>And then the cathedrals often in a cross shape,</v>

18
00:00:52.341 --> 00:00:53.870
<v Speaker 1>which also marks the center.</v>

19
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
<v Speaker 1>And then in the cathedral there's a dome often and that's the sky.</v>

20
00:00:58.671 --> 00:01:02.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's that ladder that reaches from Earth to heaven.</v>

21
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.030
<v Speaker 1>So it's a recapitulation of the same idea.</v>

22
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.433
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

23
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>and people are drawn to that center and the center is the symbol of what unites</v>

24
00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:12.771
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

25
00:01:12.771 --> 00:01:17.771
<v Speaker 1>And what unites them is the faith that the cathedral is the embodiment of.</v>

26
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

27
00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:20.121
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>what does the faith mean?</v>

29
00:01:21.391 --> 00:01:21.861
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

30
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>we're approaching this psychologically and what it means is that we,</v>

31
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.170
<v Speaker 1>everyone who's a member of that group accepts the transcendent ideal of the</v>

32
00:01:30.171 --> 00:01:31.004
<v Speaker 1>group.</v>

33
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.061
<v Speaker 1>Now the thing is,</v>

34
00:01:32.061 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're the member of a group,</v>

35
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 1>you accept the transcendent ideal of the group.</v>

36
00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what it means to be a member of a group.</v>

37
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.030
<v Speaker 1>So if you're in a work team and you're all working on a project,</v>

38
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>what you've essentially done is decided that you're going to make the goal</v>

39
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>unquestionable,</v>

40
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

41
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

42
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.070
<v Speaker 1>you might argue about the details,</v>

43
00:01:49.071 --> 00:01:50.690
<v Speaker 1>but if you're tasked with something,</v>

44
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:51.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>here's a job for you.</v>

46
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.380
<v Speaker 1>10 people organize yourself around the job,</v>

47
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>you can argue about how you're going to do the job,</v>

48
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:59.270
<v Speaker 1>but you can't argue about the job,</v>

49
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.010
<v Speaker 1>then the group falls apart.</v>

50
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.430
<v Speaker 1>And so there's an act of faith in some sense,</v>

51
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.840
<v Speaker 1>the reason that the act of faith is necessary is because it's very,</v>

52
00:02:08.841 --> 00:02:13.430
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to specify without error what that central aim should be,</v>

53
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 1>given that there's any number of aims,</v>

54
00:02:15.441 --> 00:02:15.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

55
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.581
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very,</v>

56
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:18.110
<v Speaker 1>very difficult thing to figure out.</v>

57
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:21.740
<v Speaker 1>And this is something we're going to do a little bit tonight is like what should</v>

58
00:02:21.741 --> 00:02:25.250
<v Speaker 1>the aim be around which a group would congregate?</v>

59
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

60
00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.740
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

61
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:27.261
<v Speaker 1>so Matt,</v>

62
00:02:27.261 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a large group and it's a large group that has to stay</v>

63
00:02:30.771 --> 00:02:35.771
<v Speaker 1>together across very large swaths of time and the group is an incredibly</v>

64
00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:36.680
<v Speaker 1>diverse,</v>

65
00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:36.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:36.921 --> 00:02:41.921
<v Speaker 1>what possible kind of ideal could unite a large group of diverse people across a</v>

67
00:02:42.351 --> 00:02:43.760
<v Speaker 1>very large stretch of time.</v>

68
00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:44.930
<v Speaker 1>That's a really,</v>

69
00:02:44.931 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 1>really hard question.</v>

70
00:02:46.011 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of the way that question has been answered is it's been</v>

71
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 1>answered symbolically and in images because it's so damn complicated that it's</v>

72
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>almost impossible to articulate so,</v>

73
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.810
<v Speaker 1>but obviously you need to a center around which everyone can unite because if</v>

74
00:03:01.811 --> 00:03:02.644
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>

75
00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>then everyone is at odds with one another.</v>

76
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Like if I don't know what you're up to and you don't know what he's up to,</v>

77
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>we have no were just strangers and we don't know that our ethics match at all.</v>

78
00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Then the probability that we're going to be able to exist harmoniously decreases</v>

79
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>rapidly to zero.</v>
