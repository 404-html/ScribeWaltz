1
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.480
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.130
<v Speaker 1>we got very interested in dreams and started to understand the relationship</v>

3
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>between dreams and myths because he would see in his client's dreams,</v>

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.630
<v Speaker 1>echoes of stories that he knew because he was deeply read in mythology and,</v>

5
00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>and then he started to believe that the dream was the birthplace of the myth and</v>

6
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:27.510
<v Speaker 1>that there was a continual interaction between the two processes,</v>

7
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>the dream and the story and storytelling and well,</v>

8
00:00:30.691 --> 00:00:30.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

9
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:33.850
<v Speaker 1>you tend to tell your dreams as stories when you remember them.</v>

10
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:36.360
<v Speaker 1>And some people remember dreams all the time,</v>

11
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.710
<v Speaker 1>like two or three at night.</v>

12
00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:41.580
<v Speaker 1>I've had clients like that and they often have archetipal dreams that have very</v>

13
00:00:41.581 --> 00:00:43.050
<v Speaker 1>clear mythological structures.</v>

14
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:45.360
<v Speaker 1>I think that's more the case with people who are creative,</v>

15
00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:45.721
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

16
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're a bit unstable at,</v>

17
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>at the time,</v>

18
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>because the dream tends to occupy the space of uncertainty and to concentrate on</v>

19
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:58.800
<v Speaker 1>fleshing out the unknown reality before you get a real grip on it.</v>

20
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>So it's like the dream is the birthplace of thinking.</v>

21
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a good way of thinking about it.</v>

22
00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:04.980
<v Speaker 1>And so because it's the birthplace of thinking,</v>

23
00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:06.600
<v Speaker 1>it's not that clear.</v>

24
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.690
<v Speaker 1>It's doing its best to formulate something that was Young's notion as opposed to</v>

25
00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Freud who believed that there were sensors,</v>

26
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:16.440
<v Speaker 1>internal sensors that were hiding the dreams.</v>

27
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>True message.</v>

28
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.390
<v Speaker 1>That's not what you and believed.</v>

29
00:01:18.391 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>He believed the dream was doing its best to excel,</v>

30
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>to express a reality that was still outside of fully articulated conscious</v>

31
00:01:27.151 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>comprehension.</v>

32
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.460
<v Speaker 1>It was cause you think,</v>

33
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:31.350
<v Speaker 1>look a thought appears in your head,</v>

34
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:31.621
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:31.621 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>That's obvious pit bang.</v>

36
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:33.321
<v Speaker 1>It's it.</v>

37
00:01:33.321 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing you ever ask about.</v>

38
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 1>But what the hell does that mean?</v>

39
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>A thought appears in your head.</v>

40
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>What kind of ridiculous explanation is that?</v>

41
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.233
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't help with anything.</v>

43
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Where does it come from?</v>

44
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.371
<v Speaker 1>Well nowhere.</v>

45
00:01:47.371 --> 00:01:49.500
<v Speaker 1>It just appears in my head.</v>

46
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.071
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

47
00:01:50.071 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>well that's not a very sophisticated explanation as it turns out.</v>

48
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

49
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.370
<v Speaker 1>And so you might think that those thoughts,</v>

50
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:57.330
<v Speaker 1>thoughts that you think,</v>

51
00:01:57.331 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 1>well where do they come from?</v>

52
00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Well they're often someone else's thoughts,</v>

53
00:02:00.361 --> 00:02:00.571
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

54
00:02:00.571 --> 00:02:01.710
<v Speaker 1>Someone Long Dad,</v>

55
00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:02.640
<v Speaker 1>that might be part of it.</v>

56
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Just like the words you use to think our utterances of people who've been long</v>

57
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:08.124
<v Speaker 1>dead.</v>

58
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 1>And so you're informed by the spirit of your ancestors.</v>

59
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>That's one way of looking at it.</v>

60
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:14.100
<v Speaker 1>And your motivation,</v>

61
00:02:14.101 --> 00:02:15.360
<v Speaker 1>speak to your motion,</v>

62
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:16.560
<v Speaker 1>speak to in your body,</v>

63
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>speaks to you,</v>

64
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>and it all does all that,</v>

65
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>at least in part through the dream.</v>

66
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>And the dream is the birthplace of the fully articulated idea.</v>
