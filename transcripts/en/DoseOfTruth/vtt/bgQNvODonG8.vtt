1
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous people are indoctrinated in your children.</v>

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.850
<v Speaker 1>That's according to a leading conservative who is warning parents in a new video</v>

3
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>about sending their kids to America's liberal colleges.</v>

4
00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.330
<v Speaker 2>You're supporting ideologues who claimed that all truth is subjective,</v>

5
00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 2>that all sex differences are socially constructed and that Western imperialism</v>

6
00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:29.740
<v Speaker 2>is the sole source of all third world problems.</v>

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.760
<v Speaker 1>The man in that video,</v>

8
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Jordan Peterson is with us right now.</v>

9
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>He's a University of Toronto,</v>

10
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 1>psychology professor and author of the world hit book.</v>

11
00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 1>It's called 12 rules for life,</v>

12
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:44.030
<v Speaker 1>an antidote to crisis,</v>

13
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:45.560
<v Speaker 1>which has spoken to so many people.</v>

14
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.880
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

15
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.551
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson,</v>

16
00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>we thank you very much for joining us live in that,</v>

17
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>in that introduction you say,</v>

18
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.850
<v Speaker 1>I go to you is saying there are dangerous people teaching your children.</v>

20
00:00:55.851 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Who are you talking about?</v>

21
00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.681
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:00:57.681 --> 00:01:00.680
<v Speaker 1>increasingly and this is normally the case in the universities,</v>

23
00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:05.681
<v Speaker 1>people are being taught by ideologues north by educators and idiot logs have a</v>

24
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 1>very simple way of looking at the world.</v>

25
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:11.330
<v Speaker 1>They reduce it to a few principals like inequality,</v>

26
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.190
<v Speaker 1>unfairness and power.</v>

27
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Those would be the fundamental principles at the moment that are operating on</v>

28
00:01:16.311 --> 00:01:19.550
<v Speaker 1>the radical left and they're on an ideological campaign.</v>

29
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:22.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's increasingly the case in in elementary,</v>

30
00:01:22.671 --> 00:01:24.440
<v Speaker 1>junior high and high schools as well.</v>

31
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Mostly because the faculties of education are full of people who were radical.</v>

32
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.251
<v Speaker 1>So on.</v>

33
00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.040
<v Speaker 1>This is well documented.</v>

34
00:01:31.041 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean even the chronicle of higher education came out a month ago with a,</v>

35
00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.210
<v Speaker 1>with a blistering piece on faculties of education describing them is</v>

36
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 1>academically suspect and ideologically possessed,</v>

37
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:42.770
<v Speaker 1>which I think is exactly right.</v>

38
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Well we've talked a lot about that on this program and,</v>

39
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.090
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

40
00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the question is four for appearance,</v>

41
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:53.810
<v Speaker 1>who are thinking about sending their kids to college someday or already have is,</v>

42
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>is this effort rather than these uh,</v>

43
00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>professors and whatnot being educators but being law,</v>

44
00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.420
<v Speaker 1>where'd that come from?</v>

45
00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Is it a concerted across the board thing or is it just happening by accident?</v>

46
00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

47
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.300
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it,</v>

48
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.510
<v Speaker 1>part of it's still a hangover from the 1960s I would say,</v>

49
00:02:11.511 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps even a bit of a hangover from the cold war.</v>

50
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.211
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>

51
00:02:14.211 --> 00:02:17.920
<v Speaker 1>You mean the people from the sixties and seventies are now and the ethos that</v>

52
00:02:17.921 --> 00:02:18.681
<v Speaker 1>that that was,</v>

53
00:02:18.681 --> 00:02:23.540
<v Speaker 1>that was broadcast so widely in the 1960s and there was a lot of stress in the</v>

54
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 1>60s especially because of the Vietnam war and the consequences of the ongoing</v>

55
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.584
<v Speaker 1>called Warren.</v>

56
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>We're still sort of suffering from the aftermath of that ideological battle,</v>

57
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.440
<v Speaker 1>but I also think the university's made a dreadful mistake expanding their</v>

58
00:02:36.441 --> 00:02:40.280
<v Speaker 1>humanities per view to include disciplines like women's studies and these ethnic</v>

59
00:02:40.281 --> 00:02:41.300
<v Speaker 1>studies disciplines,</v>

60
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>which aren't disciplines.</v>

61
00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.540
<v Speaker 1>They're pseudo disciplines I have passed and they have very,</v>

62
00:02:44.541 --> 00:02:48.920
<v Speaker 1>very low academic standards and they're corrupting the rest of the enterprise.</v>

63
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.671
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

64
00:02:49.671 --> 00:02:50.270
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

65
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

66
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.920
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good thing.</v>

67
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean corrupting the rest of the enterprise?</v>

68
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>you need to have standards in education.</v>

70
00:02:56.631 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that disciplines emerged that have no real methodology and no</v>

71
00:03:01.001 --> 00:03:01.900
<v Speaker 1>method of proof,</v>

72
00:03:01.901 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>no philosophical background,</v>

73
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:08.410
<v Speaker 1>no real history meant that and that they became degree granting enterprises and</v>

74
00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

75
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.550
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>

76
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>that they emerge to produce political activists,</v>

77
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.500
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what they advertise on their websites,</v>

78
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 1>means that you've got to,</v>

79
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

80
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 1>you've got a fifth column of video logs operating behind the scenes and all</v>

81
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.950
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

82
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

83
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

84
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>they spend almost all of their time engaged in political activism,</v>

85
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:03:26.261 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

87
00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.480
<v Speaker 1>and that's not good for the university as a whole or any stretch or biases or</v>

88
00:03:31.481 --> 00:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>for society as a whole.</v>

89
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

91
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.671
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

92
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>if somebody is thinking about sending their kids at college,</v>

93
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>I've put three through good schools,</v>

94
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.660
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

95
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>what should they know about where they send their kids?</v>

96
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:42.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

97
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.630
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you have a big choice because a lot of the people in positions of</v>

98
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:50.380
<v Speaker 1>power in education are to the political left.</v>

99
00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:50.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

100
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>that's just a fact.</v>

101
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>You can go and you could go look up the heterodox academy on online.</v>

102
00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>That's run by Jonathan Heit,</v>

103
00:03:57.431 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 1>Hu,</v>

104
00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Hu Hu,</v>

105
00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.430
<v Speaker 1>or he's a main player in it at that he's here in New York and he's tried to rank</v>

106
00:04:03.431 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>order universities by their adherence to truth rather than social justice and</v>

107
00:04:07.661 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>put University of Chicago at the top of the list,</v>

108
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:10.481
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

109
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>And I think increasingly that parents and students will wise up and start,</v>

110
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>start,</v>

111
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

112
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>not tending may universities that are basically playing an ideological game.</v>

113
00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>What is the matter with having people from the ideological left to being your</v>

114
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.920
<v Speaker 1>children's instructors though?</v>

115
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.251
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

116
00:04:27.251 --> 00:04:27.771
<v Speaker 1>Jose late.</v>

117
00:04:27.771 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how you want all sides of the equation.</v>

118
00:04:30.851 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 1>You want to know all the opinions.</v>

119
00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.521
<v Speaker 1>yes you do.</v>

121
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>But there's,</v>

122
00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>there's no evidence that the middle of the road or the conservative side of the</v>

123
00:04:37.541 --> 00:04:41.050
<v Speaker 1>PA or the opinion spectrum is being represented in the humanities and the social</v>

124
00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>studies.</v>

125
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.670
<v Speaker 1>That's your worry if that,</v>

126
00:04:42.671 --> 00:04:45.790
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that there's something to be said for the left,</v>

127
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.460
<v Speaker 1>but there's not very much to be said for the radical left.</v>

128
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>And that distinction isn't being made and the left can clearly go too far as it</v>

129
00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>did many times in the 20th century.</v>

130
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>And so when it gets too radical,</v>

131
00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>especially when there's no countering voices and there are very few,</v>

132
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.910
<v Speaker 1>then that's a bad,</v>

133
00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>that's a bad thing.</v>

134
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:03.070
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for education.</v>

135
00:05:03.071 --> 00:05:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It's bad for broader society.</v>

136
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

137
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

138
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 1>it's altogether bad.</v>

139
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

140
00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.781
<v Speaker 1>Jordan,</v>

141
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>you've been around the world talking your book up.</v>

142
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

143
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:11.111
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

144
00:05:11.111 --> 00:05:12.850
<v Speaker 1>people stop you on the street all the time.</v>

145
00:05:12.851 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

146
00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.440
<v Speaker 1>what's the one thing you have learned since your book a 12 rules for life and</v>

147
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:19.060
<v Speaker 1>antidote to chaos came out.</v>

148
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>How has the response been and how has it impacted you?</v>

149
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>

150
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:24.311
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

152
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 1>I've learned two things.</v>

153
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>I've learned that people are starving for a real conversation about</v>

154
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>responsibility and meaning and about the relationship between those two things.</v>

155
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 1>Because people need us sustaining meaning in their life.</v>

156
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.430
<v Speaker 1>And it's not to be found through rights and impulsive gratification.</v>

157
00:05:39.431 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It's to be found through the adoption of responsibility.</v>

158
00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 1>That's the first thing.</v>

159
00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>And the second thing is that people are a lot smarter than we think.</v>

160
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 1>So if you allow them longform dialogue time,</v>

161
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>even in public lectures,</v>

162
00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a huge market for it.</v>

163
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>There's a huge hunger for it,</v>

164
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.120
<v Speaker 1>podcasts and,</v>

165
00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.850
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

166
00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>and the new video that's emerging online with these long form discussions is</v>

167
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.990
<v Speaker 1>that people are smarter than we thought and more,</v>

168
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.420
<v Speaker 1>and people can listen to very complex material.</v>

169
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.260
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

170
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a really positive thing.</v>

171
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

172
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

173
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>it's always a pleasure.</v>

174
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:10.671
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much.</v>

175
00:06:10.671 --> 00:06:11.481
<v Speaker 1>Thanks very much for the,</v>

176
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually going to be on PBS very shortly.</v>

177
00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>And of course the big book is called 12 rules for life.</v>

178
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.740
<v Speaker 1>It's a worldwide bestseller.</v>

179
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Jordan Peterson.</v>

180
00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.691
<v Speaker 1>Thank you,</v>

181
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>

182
00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.530
<v Speaker 1>Thanks very much.</v>
