1
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.751
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

2
00:00:06.751 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>It is the case that we live in a field.</v>

3
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.160
<v Speaker 1>It's defined by the extent of our vision.</v>

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.080
<v Speaker 1>It is the case that we live in a hierarchical structure on that plane.</v>

5
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It is the case that there's a king ship at the top.</v>

6
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.220
<v Speaker 1>It is the case that that's always threatened by malevolence and sin.</v>

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.850
<v Speaker 1>It is the case that that can make you corrupt and cynical and irresponsible.</v>

8
00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.880
<v Speaker 1>It is the case that that's the inappropriate response and that it's your</v>

9
00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:38.881
<v Speaker 1>responsibility to repair the damage structure of tradition despite the fact that</v>

10
00:00:40.481 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>it veers towards corruption.</v>

11
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>It is the case that if you take that responsibility on yourself,</v>

12
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>that the rain falls again and everything flourishes.</v>

13
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>It's correct.</v>

14
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the right way of looking at the world,</v>

15
00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 1>and if we didn't know that deeply,</v>

16
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>everyone in this room wouldn't have watched that movie.</v>

17
00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.481
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

18
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:01.631
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

19
00:01:01.631 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>it's so strange that we can watch that movie without understanding it.</v>

20
00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.551
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

21
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:08.350
<v Speaker 1>You can fall into it because you do.</v>

22
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.453
<v Speaker 1>When you go to,</v>

23
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.301
<v Speaker 1>you might wonder,</v>

24
00:01:10.301 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.880
<v Speaker 1>do people have religious experiences?</v>

26
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.060
<v Speaker 1>Because people wonder about the truth of religion,</v>

27
00:01:16.061 --> 00:01:16.894
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

28
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.510
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not going to go very deeply into that issue,</v>

29
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>but I can tell you that what you're doing when you go to a movie like that that</v>

30
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:27.430
<v Speaker 1>has that mythological structure and you fall into it,</v>

31
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.320
<v Speaker 1>which is what you do,</v>

32
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.650
<v Speaker 1>that what you're having is absolutely indistinguishable from a religious</v>

33
00:01:32.651 --> 00:01:33.484
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

34
00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.060
<v Speaker 1>It's the revelation of knowledge that you know,</v>

35
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:37.900
<v Speaker 1>but you don't know.</v>

36
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:38.734
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>and there's something about it that's so deeply engaging in meaningful that you</v>

38
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:47.590
<v Speaker 1>will line up and pay for the privilege of being exposed to it.</v>

39
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.020
<v Speaker 1>And this is not an easy thing to understand.</v>

40
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.130
<v Speaker 1>Like if you bring,</v>

41
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.420
<v Speaker 1>your child will be very excited about the possibility of going to the lion king,</v>

42
00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 1>And maybe want to watch it 20 times.</v>

44
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.270
<v Speaker 1>My son watched the d,</v>

45
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.340
<v Speaker 1>The whale seen in Pinocchio.</v>

46
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>I bet he watched that 115 times when he was four or five years old.</v>

47
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>He just watched it over and over and over and over.</v>

48
00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.501
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

49
00:02:11.501 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>what the hell are you doing kid?</v>

50
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.870
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

51
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

52
00:02:14.111 --> 00:02:17.080
<v Speaker 1>it was so interesting to watch that he was so obsessed by it.</v>

53
00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.110
<v Speaker 1>But there's a tremendous amount of information in that movie,</v>

54
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:20.751
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

55
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>an almost unlimited amount of information.</v>

56
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:25.750
<v Speaker 1>And he was gripped by it and was trying,</v>

57
00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>however it is that a child's imagination tries to come to terms with what the</v>

58
00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:32.560
<v Speaker 1>movie was representing.</v>

59
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.270
<v Speaker 1>And it wasn't like he enjoyed it.</v>

60
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

61
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Not In the least.</v>

62
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:37.091
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

63
00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:37.930
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

64
00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:02:38.201 --> 00:02:38.591
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

66
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 1>if you watch the scene,</v>

67
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.230
<v Speaker 1>how many of you have seen the Movie Pinocchio?</v>

68
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.280
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

69
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.180
<v Speaker 1>So it's the same thing.</v>

70
00:02:43.181 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the 10 most highest grossing movies of all time,</v>

71
00:02:47.111 --> 00:02:47.830
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>

72
00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:48.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

73
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a scene where Pinocchio,</v>

74
00:02:50.261 --> 00:02:50.860
<v Speaker 1>who's turned in,</v>

75
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.430
<v Speaker 1>he's a wooden puppet who's been turned into a jackass and for some,</v>

76
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>which is supposed to make sense to you and apparently does.</v>

77
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>And he goes to the bottom of the ocean to rescue his father who was somehow</v>

78
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>swallowed by a whale.</v>

79
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>So think about what you're watching.</v>

80
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.590
<v Speaker 1>You're watching a drawing of a puppet turned into a jackass.</v>

81
00:03:08.591 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>Go to the bottom of the ocean and rescue his father from a fire-breathing whale</v>

82
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>and you're all perfectly okay with that.</v>

83
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

84
00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>So it's very peculiar and so,</v>

85
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>and it's very frightening.</v>

86
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Like the whale is a while it does breathe fire because it's actually a dragon,</v>

87
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.563
<v Speaker 1>not a whale.</v>

88
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

89
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.750
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

90
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>the animators used locomotive noises to,</v>

91
00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

92
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>to add the audio background and the whale is hell bent on destroying the hero of</v>

93
00:03:36.881 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 1>the story of Pinocchio and also Japan and,</v>

94
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>and it's a very tense scene.</v>

95
00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.080
<v Speaker 1>And so my son was just like this like the whole time watching it.</v>

96
00:03:45.081 --> 00:03:45.310
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

97
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

98
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't think that he would,</v>

99
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

100
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.030
<v Speaker 1>he's like these terrified,</v>

101
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:53.280
<v Speaker 1>like a rabbit who's being watched by a wolf and then it makes his heartbeat and</v>

102
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>he's all exhausted and it goes,</v>

103
00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 1>and then the first thing he wants to do is to do it again.</v>

104
00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.241
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

105
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is going well?</v>

106
00:03:59.441 --> 00:03:59.711
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

107
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:00.550
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there?</v>

108
00:04:00.551 --> 00:04:01.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's a cake walk.</v>

109
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 1>It's not that at all.</v>

110
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>It's like he could hardly even stand to watch it.</v>

111
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>It's so tense,</v>

112
00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.020
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're for,</v>

113
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's bad enough when you're an adult,</v>

114
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

115
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.940
<v Speaker 1>and you've seen a thousand things like that.</v>

116
00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>And at least in principle,</v>

117
00:04:14.141 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>your little tougher and a little wiser.</v>

118
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:17.830
<v Speaker 1>But when you're for that just blows you away.</v>

119
00:04:17.831 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

120
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.750
<v Speaker 1>like everything in the world does.</v>

121
00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>And yet all he would do is expose himself to it over and over and over and over</v>

122
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:23.974
<v Speaker 1>and over.</v>

123
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.000
<v Speaker 1>And in the lion king,</v>

124
00:04:25.001 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>like if you watch children when they go see that they're just demolished when</v>

125
00:04:28.931 --> 00:04:29.221
<v Speaker 1>Simba,</v>

126
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:30.310
<v Speaker 1>his father dies,</v>

127
00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.850
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

128
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Just tears them apart.</v>

129
00:04:32.201 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>They can't believe that,</v>

130
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>the king has disappeared.</v>

132
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>And yet they'll watch it over and over and over and over just like you do.</v>

133
00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.981
<v Speaker 1>And it's because,</v>

134
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.191
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

135
00:04:42.191 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>the whole story we used to tell our son when we took them to movies because he'd</v>

136
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 1>get all shorted out by what was happening.</v>

137
00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.900
<v Speaker 1>And unsurprisingly,</v>

138
00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>watch the hero.</v>

139
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.740
<v Speaker 1>Keep your eye on the hero because that's the pathway through.</v>

140
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly right because you're supposed to keep your eye on the hero</v>

141
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>because that is the pathway through and there isn't anything that's more true</v>

142
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:07.114
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

143
00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a true story.</v>

144
00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:10.211
<v Speaker 1>You think?</v>

145
00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:10.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>it's fictional.</v>

147
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like fiction presents abstractions.</v>

148
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Abstractions aren't false hoods.</v>

149
00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.090
<v Speaker 1>They're abstractions.</v>

150
00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Think about numbers.</v>

151
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Numbers are abstractions.</v>

152
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:27.220
<v Speaker 1>They're abstracted away from individual entities in the real world.</v>

153
00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>But if you know the numbers,</v>

154
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.660
<v Speaker 1>you know abstractions of tremendous truth.</v>

155
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.360
<v Speaker 1>While the abstraction of the idea of the individual hero from the collective of</v>

156
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:41.980
<v Speaker 1>human action is the abstraction of it's more true than true.</v>

157
00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>Deep fiction is more true than truth.</v>

158
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>That's a way of thinking about it.</v>

159
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.090
<v Speaker 1>It's more real than reality itself.</v>

160
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.230
<v Speaker 1>In the same way that an abstraction can be more real than the thing that it's</v>

161
00:05:53.231 --> 00:05:56.200
<v Speaker 1>abstracted from all of the,</v>

162
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:03.070
<v Speaker 1>all of the landscape in a mythological tale like the lion king is an abstract</v>

163
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:04.544
<v Speaker 1>landscape.</v>

164
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>What's common across all landscapes?</v>

165
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

166
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.681
<v Speaker 1>wherever you go,</v>

167
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>there are things that you know and there are things that you don't know and</v>

168
00:06:14.331 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>that's the human world and it doesn't matter who the human being is.</v>

169
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.080
<v Speaker 1>You might know more than you do,</v>

170
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 1>but doesn't matter because your knowledge is still bounded by your limitless</v>

171
00:06:25.521 --> 00:06:26.354
<v Speaker 1>ignorance.</v>

172
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.540
<v Speaker 1>And the possibility that that domain of limitless ignorance will make mockery of</v>

173
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>what you know at any moment.</v>

174
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.860
<v Speaker 1>It's a reality and it's a universal reality,</v>

175
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>and you have to orient yourself in that landscape.</v>

176
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>And and so does everyone else.</v>

177
00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:47.330
<v Speaker 1>You have to deal with what you knew and what you don't know everywhere.</v>

178
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.440
<v Speaker 1>And the way you do that is by straddling the divide between what you know and</v>

179
00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:52.274
<v Speaker 1>what you don't know.</v>

180
00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.820
<v Speaker 1>You do that by staying firmly grounded to some degree in what you understand,</v>

181
00:06:58.101 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>but by putting a tentative foot outward into what you don't understand so that</v>

182
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:03.770
<v Speaker 1>you can remain stable,</v>

183
00:07:03.771 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 1>but you can stretch yourself and challenge yourself simultaneously.</v>

184
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:08.511
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

185
00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 1>And that's the proper place to stand.</v>

186
00:07:10.131 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a real place.</v>

187
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the line between chaos and order.</v>

188
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's the place of meaning.</v>
