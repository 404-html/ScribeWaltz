00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:09.783
<v Speaker 1>If you don't mind,</v>

2
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>you have a whole corpus of work and there are,</v>

3
00:00:14.711 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>we current seems in some sense one of them being things are getting better in</v>

4
00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>ways that we really don't know.</v>

5
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.713
<v Speaker 1>What are you,</v>

6
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.220
<v Speaker 1>what if you could have what you wanted with regards to the impact of your books,</v>

7
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:28.520
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.680
<v Speaker 1>what would you want that impact to be and also what do you think?</v>

9
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things I've done on Twitter recently because I'm trying to</v>

10
00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:37.060
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to use Twitter,</v>

11
00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:42.061
<v Speaker 1>is to tilt my tweets towards people like human progress.org someone you site in</v>

12
00:00:42.821 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>your introduction and people who are purveying information while including</v>

13
00:00:46.481 --> 00:00:47.350
<v Speaker 1>yourself by the way,</v>

14
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>who are purveying information about how much better things are getting.</v>

15
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>And so what impact would you like to have your books have and how do you see</v>

16
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:56.470
<v Speaker 1>that playing out psychologically,</v>

17
00:00:56.471 --> 00:01:00.940
<v Speaker 1>politically and what do you think people who are listening now say could do</v>

18
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:04.270
<v Speaker 1>practically to get the good news out so to speak?</v>

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

20
00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.120
<v Speaker 2>certainly intellectual life should be more data driven.</v>

21
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.300
<v Speaker 2>I bet you shouldn't be allowed to say talk about any reported trend based on an</v>

22
00:01:16.051 --> 00:01:18.540
<v Speaker 2>event that happened yesterday or this year.</v>

23
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Because trend means change over time and in so many areas we really do have data</v>

24
00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 2>and if you're responsible not to to a site those data,</v>

25
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.250
<v Speaker 2>particularly since they have become increasingly available through websites like</v>

26
00:01:32.251 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 2>our world in data and cubit progress.</v>

27
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 2>So I'd like to see a replacement of ideological debate,</v>

28
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.980
<v Speaker 2>which so much of our,</v>

29
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.270
<v Speaker 2>our current debate is,</v>

30
00:01:45.271 --> 00:01:48.900
<v Speaker 2>it's whether the right or the left is more saintly,</v>

31
00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:49.734
<v Speaker 2>moral,</v>

32
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.793
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 2>praiseworthy,</v>

34
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.283
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

35
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 2>And more,</v>

36
00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.461
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

37
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:53.740
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

38
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.931
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

39
00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:54.780
<v Speaker 2>let's look at the data.</v>

40
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.140
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

41
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.130
<v Speaker 2>chances are that neither an off the shelf position of the left nor an off the</v>

42
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 2>shelf position and the right is likely to have it all figured out.</v>

43
00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.000
<v Speaker 2>No one is this,</v>

44
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:03.460
<v Speaker 2>the end or,</v>

45
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 2>or infallible.</v>

46
00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 2>These ideologies go back to the,</v>

47
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 2>to the French revolution and they're unlikely to be the font of solutions to</v>

48
00:02:10.741 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 2>complex problems.</v>

49
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Let's try to see what works,</v>

50
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.581
<v Speaker 2>what doesn't,</v>

51
00:02:14.581 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 2>and come up with the mixture of what is most likely to solve our problems.</v>

52
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.210
<v Speaker 1>Spoken like a true proponent of the enlightenment.</v>

53
00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

54
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:22.813
<v Speaker 2>I guess,</v>

55
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

56
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.190
<v Speaker 2>and stepping back even farther,</v>

57
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.400
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see a greater integration of the,</v>

58
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:29.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

59
00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

61
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 2>the insights and mindset of the science into social and cultural affairs.</v>

62
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.530
<v Speaker 2>As we talked about earlier in the conversation.</v>

63
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 2>This very ideas often met with horror.</v>

64
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Well you don't just,</v>

66
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.710
<v Speaker 1>the humanities types I suppose in some sense aren't very happy with the idea of</v>

67
00:02:48.711 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>that they'd have to learn statistics.</v>

68
00:02:50.191 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>And I can I have a certain amount of sympathy for that perspective button?</v>

69
00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

70
00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:55.290
<v Speaker 2>there is,</v>

71
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.561
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

72
00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 2>there is a,</v>

73
00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.271
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

74
00:02:56.271 --> 00:02:57.104
<v Speaker 2>a horror,</v>

75
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 2>the expanding realm of a bad number in data and a horror at the,</v>

76
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

77
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 2>the thought that,</v>

78
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

79
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 2>ideas about human nature from,</v>

80
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 2>from science,</v>

81
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 2>from evolutionary psychology,</v>

82
00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 2>from behavioral genetics,</v>

83
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.430
<v Speaker 2>from social and personality and cognitive psychology might be brought to bear on</v>

84
00:03:18.431 --> 00:03:20.560
<v Speaker 2>our understanding of society,</v>

85
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.520
<v Speaker 2>of justice,</v>

86
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>of art,</v>

87
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 2>literature and fiction.</v>

88
00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 2>Quite contrary to be the mindset of the enlightenment where all of the</v>

89
00:03:29.801 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 2>enlightenment philosophers off.</v>

90
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.900
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

91
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.281
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

92
00:03:32.281 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 2>we're pretty serious psychologists.</v>

93
00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 2>It'd be the field didn't exist at the time,</v>

94
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>so they weren't called that.</v>

95
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.043
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>

96
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

97
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.530
<v Speaker 2>mind the observations from,</v>

98
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.800
<v Speaker 2>from travelers of missionaries and a and explorers out be ways of other</v>

99
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:47.884
<v Speaker 2>cultures.</v>

100
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 2>They relied on their own observations and common sense.</v>

101
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 2>They tapped into what brain science existed at the time.</v>

102
00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:55.181
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a,</v>

103
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:58.740
<v Speaker 2>it's hardly a radical idea that our understanding of,</v>

104
00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

105
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 2>of art and culture and society should be informed by our understanding of human</v>

106
00:04:03.281 --> 00:04:04.000
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>

107
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 2>But now that the disciplines have become so professionalized and they're housed</v>

108
00:04:07.541 --> 00:04:10.540
<v Speaker 2>in different buildings on campus and there are rivals for,</v>

109
00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

110
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.220
<v Speaker 2>money from the dean,</v>

111
00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.770
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

112
00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 2>there's great hostility to the old enlightenment idea of consilience is often a,</v>

113
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.740
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

114
00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.980
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

115
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.330
<v Speaker 2>a paranoid fear that this means that the sciences we'll take over the</v>

116
00:04:22.331 --> 00:04:23.164
<v Speaker 2>humanities,</v>

117
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 2>which of course is preposterous.</v>

118
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.070
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't,</v>

119
00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.841
<v Speaker 2>they would want to,</v>

120
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't there to be here.</v>

121
00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.511
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

122
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:30.210
<v Speaker 1>and I think the sciences can really inform the humanities.</v>

123
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:30.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

124
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.171
<v Speaker 1>my first side,</v>

125
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:32.004
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

126
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.690
<v Speaker 1>I had to be trained as a scientist.</v>

127
00:04:33.691 --> 00:04:37.230
<v Speaker 1>My appreciation for the humanities is actually substantially deepened.</v>

128
00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:38.840
<v Speaker 1>So in here</v>

129
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.010
<v Speaker 2>and indeed in many fields,</v>

130
00:04:41.011 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 2>this is a authentic,</v>

131
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.490
<v Speaker 2>complete,</v>

132
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.830
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>

133
00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.580
<v Speaker 2>one of my own fields of linguistics.</v>

134
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.590
<v Speaker 2>It's just taken for granted and no one really cares where the humanities</v>

135
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.610
<v Speaker 2>influences.</v>

136
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.880
<v Speaker 2>I ended the scientific ones begin studies of philology classical grammar of uh,</v>

137
00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:01.671
<v Speaker 2>of texts now blend into statistical studies of uh,</v>

138
00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 2>of Corpora,</v>

139
00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Speaker 2>of laboratory studies,</v>

140
00:05:04.861 --> 00:05:09.861
<v Speaker 2>of speech and language processing and where the science ends up in the ends off</v>

141
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:12.270
<v Speaker 2>in the humanities begins no one even talks.</v>

142
00:05:12.271 --> 00:05:12.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

143
00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.490
<v Speaker 1>Oh the science can also really change,</v>

144
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:15.900
<v Speaker 1>can really change your mind.</v>

145
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:20.070
<v Speaker 1>Like I've looked at individual differences in relationship to political belief</v>

146
00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.610
<v Speaker 1>and so I've learned three things from doing that that I think are revolutionary</v>

147
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:27.270
<v Speaker 1>had been revolutionary for me.</v>

148
00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So the first is that</v>

149
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:30.763
<v Speaker 1>mmm,</v>

150
00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.640
<v Speaker 1>liberal lefty types are characterized by higher trade openness and lower</v>

151
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:37.610
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and then conservatives the reverse.</v>

152
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.091
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

153
00:05:39.091 --> 00:05:41.880
<v Speaker 1>well that's quite interesting cause it puts the liberal left types in the</v>

154
00:05:41.881 --> 00:05:45.570
<v Speaker 1>creative entrepreneurial domain cause that's characterized by high openness and</v>

155
00:05:45.571 --> 00:05:48.780
<v Speaker 1>it puts the conservative types in the managerial and administrative domain.</v>

156
00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:54.000
<v Speaker 1>And so that implies that the liberal left types create new ideas and new</v>

157
00:05:54.001 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 1>enterprises including entrepreneurial enterprises cause the doubted there is</v>

158
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.274
<v Speaker 1>fairly solid.</v>

159
00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.690
<v Speaker 1>Where's the conservative types,</v>

160
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.810
<v Speaker 1>manage and administer those enterprises.</v>

161
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And so each needs the other.</v>

162
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 1>And so there's that nice polarity dynamic.</v>

163
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.480
<v Speaker 1>And then there's also</v>

164
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.750
<v Speaker 1>the idea that the reason that openness and conscientiousness unite to predict</v>

165
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:17.030
<v Speaker 1>political behavior is because of borders.</v>

166
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>So open people like the borders between concepts to be fluid so that there's</v>

167
00:06:21.651 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 1>information exchange and they're not orderly,</v>

168
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.980
<v Speaker 1>the liberal types because they're not conscientious and so they don't see any</v>

169
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.620
<v Speaker 1>utility and keeping things categorically distinct.</v>

170
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the conservatives are afraid of the contamination of things because of</v>

171
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>the movement of information and they like to see the borders between things to,</v>

172
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>to ensure that that's the case.</v>

173
00:06:41.601 --> 00:06:46.040
<v Speaker 1>So the reason that openness and conscientiousness stack together as predictors</v>

174
00:06:46.041 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>of political behavior seems to be because of the,</v>

175
00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.160
<v Speaker 1>I've two did fundamentally different attitudes toward towards borders all the</v>

176
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:55.990
<v Speaker 1>way from the conceptual to the political.</v>

177
00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So the right wingers think while borders are good because that stops</v>

178
00:06:59.861 --> 00:07:04.030
<v Speaker 1>contamination and is a real problem and a definitely problem often.</v>

179
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.950
<v Speaker 1>And the liberal lefty type thing,</v>

180
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:06.131
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

181
00:07:06.131 --> 00:07:06.251
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

182
00:07:06.251 --> 00:07:08.500
<v Speaker 1>We want as much information to flow as possible.</v>

183
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>And both of those perspectives are valid and need to be discussed.</v>

184
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Then the other thing I learned from the American empirical doubt,</v>

185
00:07:16.361 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>it was that orderliness,</v>

186
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:18.960
<v Speaker 1>which is part of conscious,</v>

187
00:07:18.961 --> 00:07:23.290
<v Speaker 1>the part of conscientiousness predicts conservatism is associated with disgust,</v>

188
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:24.124
<v Speaker 1>sensitivity,</v>

189
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:29.760
<v Speaker 1>and so that that feeds that desire to maintain borders so that there's no cross</v>

190
00:07:30.031 --> 00:07:33.990
<v Speaker 1>contamination that's associated with what's being called the behavioral immune</v>

191
00:07:33.991 --> 00:07:34.380
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

192
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.040
<v Speaker 1>And so those are actually quite revolutionary ideas from the perspective of</v>

193
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:38.874
<v Speaker 1>political theory.</v>

194
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.770
<v Speaker 1>You know that the political belief is temperamentally determined that the reason</v>

195
00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:47.010
<v Speaker 1>that the two temperamental traits determined political belief is because of a</v>

196
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:48.390
<v Speaker 1>difference in attitude,</v>

197
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:52.290
<v Speaker 1>fundamental difference in attitude towards the borders between things that you</v>

198
00:07:52.291 --> 00:07:57.090
<v Speaker 1>can make a case for open and closed borders on evolutionary grounds and that</v>

199
00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.600
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

200
00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:00.330
<v Speaker 1>there's an association between conservatism and discussed,</v>

201
00:08:00.331 --> 00:08:02.670
<v Speaker 1>which to me shed tremendous light,</v>

202
00:08:02.671 --> 00:08:03.211
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

203
00:08:03.211 --> 00:08:07.110
<v Speaker 1>on the motivations of Hitler who is an extraordinarily orderly person and who</v>

204
00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:08.850
<v Speaker 1>use disgust oriented language.</v>

205
00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:12.180
<v Speaker 1>It's all the time when he was formulating his policies of extermination.</v>

206
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.990
<v Speaker 1>So those are revolutionary contributions of individual,</v>

207
00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>different science to political theory and it's all driven by hard data</v>

208
00:08:20.441 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 1>statistically derived.</v>

209
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

210
00:08:23.311 --> 00:08:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

211
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.640
<v Speaker 2>I agree and I can sense the kind of paranoid reaction that these claims might</v>

212
00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:34.761
<v Speaker 2>elicit among some traditional political theorist and thinkers that,</v>

213
00:08:35.161 --> 00:08:35.341
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

214
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:40.290
<v Speaker 2>are you saying that the conservative beliefs are nothing but an expression of</v>

215
00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:40.741
<v Speaker 2>disgust,</v>

216
00:08:40.741 --> 00:08:43.740
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity and of course it doesn't apply that these,</v>

217
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

218
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.780
<v Speaker 2>big fascinating findings don't say that the earned income tax credit is a good</v>

219
00:08:48.781 --> 00:08:52.830
<v Speaker 2>or a bad idea or the Paris climate accords by themselves.</v>

220
00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 2>I'd be issues still have to be decided on their merits.</v>

221
00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:57.900
<v Speaker 2>The other hand,</v>

222
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 2>if you do,</v>

223
00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:03.770
<v Speaker 2>if you are aware of your own potential biases and that that is a source of</v>

224
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:04.261
<v Speaker 2>insight,</v>

225
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 2>it's a source of understanding your cook.</v>

226
00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>It could cause you to step back from your own convictions and be more receptive</v>

227
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.910
<v Speaker 2>to arguments on both sides.</v>

228
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

229
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 2>that was not for me,</v>

230
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 2>that it can't not be a helpful,</v>

231
00:09:17.011 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 2>cannot be an important source of insight as to how political debates unfold.</v>

232
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.731
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

233
00:09:21.731 --> 00:09:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Well if you know that the liberal left types are necessary for the fostering of</v>

234
00:09:26.021 --> 00:09:28.990
<v Speaker 1>new enterprises and the Conservatives are necessary to run them,</v>

235
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:34.540
<v Speaker 1>then that certainly indicates why both groups not only are necessary but are all</v>

236
00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.860
<v Speaker 1>of mutual benefit.</v>

237
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Somebody has to maintain systems and someone has to expand the and those things</v>

238
00:09:40.661 --> 00:09:44.350
<v Speaker 1>are going to work in opposition to one another because expanding a system often</v>

239
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:45.263
<v Speaker 1>fragments it.</v>

240
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:50.670
<v Speaker 1>So there's going to be tension but no system can remain static forever and,</v>

241
00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.310
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

242
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:56.140
<v Speaker 1>and completely untrammeled transformation throws everything into chaos.</v>

243
00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:59.050
<v Speaker 1>So there obviously has to be a dialogue between those two viewpoints.</v>

244
00:09:59.200 --> 00:09:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Like a,</v>

245
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.680
<v Speaker 1>it's like an opponent process issue essentially.</v>

246
00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:04.621
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

247
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:04.971
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

248
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:05.461
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

249
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:06.930
<v Speaker 2>all of us ought to be,</v>

250
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:07.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

251
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.311
<v Speaker 2>more aware,</v>

252
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 2>have more insight into how our own psych,</v>

253
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.660
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>

254
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:13.783
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:15.090
<v Speaker 2>proclivities might,</v>

256
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

257
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:20.640
<v Speaker 2>affect the positions that seem to each of us to be obvious to meet welding</v>

258
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.000
<v Speaker 1>and that is what they do.</v>

259
00:10:22.001 --> 00:10:22.211
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

260
00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Cause the temperamental variable variables actually tell you what is self</v>

261
00:10:26.291 --> 00:10:27.040
<v Speaker 1>evident.</v>

262
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.150
<v Speaker 1>That's how they operate.</v>

263
00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

264
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.890
<v Speaker 2>My understanding from,</v>

265
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.020
<v Speaker 2>from the literature that you're citing is that the,</v>

266
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:33.100
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

267
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.700
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

268
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:37.810
<v Speaker 2>variance and opinions that is correlated with an eight personality differences</v>

269
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:40.670
<v Speaker 2>is also the hardest to get people to,</v>

270
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:41.500
<v Speaker 2>to give out,</v>

271
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:41.780
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

272
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:42.760
<v Speaker 2>to persuade them.</v>

273
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

274
00:10:43.271 --> 00:10:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

275
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.150
<v Speaker 1>no doubt because I think the,</v>

276
00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.510
<v Speaker 1>those temperamental differences are like axiomatic values,</v>

277
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:50.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

278
00:10:50.321 --> 00:10:50.481
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

279
00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:55.360
<v Speaker 1>and they're grounded and I think they're grounded in the hyper development of</v>

280
00:10:55.361 --> 00:10:56.380
<v Speaker 1>separate circuitry.</v>

281
00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to be very,</v>

282
00:10:58.841 --> 00:10:59.170
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

283
00:10:59.170 --> 00:10:59.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

284
00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:01.210
<v Speaker 1>and I also think that like if you're an x,</v>

285
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.080
<v Speaker 1>if you're an introvert,</v>

286
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.250
<v Speaker 1>you want to learn to be an extrovert.</v>

287
00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.380
<v Speaker 1>You have to learn it.</v>

288
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Micro skill by micro skill,</v>

289
00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:08.261
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

290
00:11:08.261 --> 00:11:09.730
<v Speaker 1>There's no revolution.</v>

291
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:13.000
<v Speaker 1>There is no revolutionary cognitive transformation that's going to turn you into</v>

292
00:11:13.001 --> 00:11:13.780
<v Speaker 1>an extrovert.</v>

293
00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.010
<v Speaker 1>You can pick up the skills,</v>

294
00:11:15.011 --> 00:11:15.550
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

295
00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.590
<v Speaker 1>it's bit by bit it and it's incremental.</v>

296
00:11:17.591 --> 00:11:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And so I think it's the same with political attitudes is you can develop an</v>

297
00:11:21.341 --> 00:11:25.420
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for the viewpoint of people who are on the other side of the</v>

298
00:11:25.421 --> 00:11:26.440
<v Speaker 1>temperamental divide.</v>

299
00:11:26.441 --> 00:11:27.520
<v Speaker 1>But it's a,</v>

300
00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.760
<v Speaker 1>it's an increment by increment and bounce and it's very,</v>

301
00:11:30.761 --> 00:11:31.630
<v Speaker 1>very effortful,</v>

302
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:32.860
<v Speaker 1>but necessary.</v>

303
00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.760
<v Speaker 1>It's necessary.</v>

304
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.361
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

305
00:11:34.361 --> 00:11:34.491
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

306
00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:39.491
<v Speaker 1>it's been really useful to me to see where the cognitive,</v>

307
00:11:39.691 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Speaker 1>sociological,</v>

308
00:11:40.831 --> 00:11:45.390
<v Speaker 1>political utility of both political temperaments lights and,</v>

309
00:11:45.930 --> 00:11:46.500
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

310
00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.090
<v Speaker 1>and why it's so crucially important.</v>

311
00:11:48.091 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

312
00:11:48.570 --> 00:11:50.430
<v Speaker 1>with regards to discuss the sensitivity,</v>

313
00:11:50.431 --> 00:11:51.211
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might think,</v>

314
00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:54.640
<v Speaker 1>well that's pure reduct purely reductionistic regards to the conservative</v>

315
00:11:54.641 --> 00:11:55.121
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint.</v>

316
00:11:55.121 --> 00:11:55.871
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

317
00:11:55.871 --> 00:12:00.871
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people in history have died as a consequence of cross cultural</v>

318
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:02.200
<v Speaker 1>contamination,</v>

319
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.501
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

320
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are estimates that up to 90%,</v>

321
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe even 95% of the native Americans perished because of their exposure to the</v>

322
00:12:08.951 --> 00:12:09.784
<v Speaker 1>Spaniards.</v>

323
00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:10.883
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

324
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:15.610
<v Speaker 1>And so the idea that contamination is a problem when,</v>

325
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:18.630
<v Speaker 1>when two things that were distinct unite is,</v>

326
00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

327
00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>is a truism and it's a powerful evolutionary force.</v>

328
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>An equally powerful is the observation that well,</v>

329
00:12:25.121 --> 00:12:25.391
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

330
00:12:25.391 --> 00:12:26.224
<v Speaker 1>despite that,</v>

331
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.400
<v Speaker 1>despite that though,</v>

332
00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.380
<v Speaker 1>the benefit of information flow,</v>

333
00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 1>free information flow and trade is so overwhelming that you can't throw the baby</v>

334
00:12:32.831 --> 00:12:33.470
<v Speaker 1>out with them.</v>

335
00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:34.303
<v Speaker 2>Water.</v>

336
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:35.341
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

337
00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:36.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a case where the</v>

338
00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.920
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary adaptive value of a,</v>

339
00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

340
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:42.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

341
00:12:42.710 --> 00:12:46.050
<v Speaker 2>have a motive or a oven emotion is explicable.</v>

342
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:46.620
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

343
00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:51.420
<v Speaker 2>and we can also recognize that thanks to advances in science and technology,</v>

344
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.950
<v Speaker 2>the emotions themselves are no longer particularly effective defenses against,</v>

345
00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:56.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

346
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:59.010
<v Speaker 2>in this case infection by my packages.</v>

347
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.710
<v Speaker 2>We have much better ways of protecting ourselves,</v>

348
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.020
<v Speaker 2>but we are stuck with these ancient,</v>

349
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:04.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

350
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.160
<v Speaker 2>adaptations,</v>

351
00:13:05.190 --> 00:13:05.650
<v Speaker 2>which are,</v>

352
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.670
<v Speaker 2>are no longer whites who are adaptive for the DB can be harmful,</v>

353
00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:12.840
<v Speaker 2>especially when they're right to treat.</v>

354
00:13:12.841 --> 00:13:17.790
<v Speaker 2>Other people on the metaphor of contaminants are pathogens.</v>

355
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:19.130
<v Speaker 2>And you're certainly right that in,</v>

356
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:20.700
<v Speaker 2>in not in Hitler's rhetoric,</v>

357
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.380
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that he is often,</v>

358
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

359
00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:23.730
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

360
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:28.730
<v Speaker 2>claimed to have used eugenic ideas to motivate a genocide against the Jews.</v>

361
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm much more of his language came from,</v>

362
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:32.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

363
00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.540
<v Speaker 2>from pathology and Estonia.</v>

364
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

365
00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:36.223
<v Speaker 2>It's contempt.</v>

366
00:13:36.510 --> 00:13:37.343
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

367
00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.850
<v Speaker 2>there was a enterocytes parasites.</v>

368
00:13:41.851 --> 00:13:42.684
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

369
00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:44.040
<v Speaker 2>Microbiology,</v>

370
00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.210
<v Speaker 2>not genetics that daddy gave him or is a toxic ideas.</v>
