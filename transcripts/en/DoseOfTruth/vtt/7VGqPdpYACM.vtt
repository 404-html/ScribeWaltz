00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2
00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>If you hold something sacred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then your team's circles around it and</v>

3
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>it's only those who circled around with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and sometimes literally circled</v>

4
00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:19.980
<v Speaker 1>around like Muslims at prayer in Mecca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they literally circle the kebabs.</v>

5
00:00:19.981 --> 00:00:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Circling is a very primitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ancient.</v>

6
00:00:21.861 --> 00:00:24.980
<v Speaker 1>It feels right to circle something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even if even if you do it</v>

7
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:28.970
<v Speaker 1>symbolically or you all bow at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time that binds you together,</v>

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>children do that with their mothers when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

9
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.490
<v Speaker 1>when they engage in exploratory behavior</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>well they use their mother as a center</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world and children differ in the</v>

11
00:00:37.641 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>degree to which they'll move outward</v>
<v Speaker 1>from their mothers.</v>

12
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>So they move out until they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

13
00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>they trip over their uncertainty</v>
<v Speaker 1>threshold.</v>

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.120
<v Speaker 1>Neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a distance,</v>

15
00:00:47.121 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>like it's a district that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

16
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:48.711
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:48.711 --> 00:00:51.110
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the more exploratory kids who are</v>

18
00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:54.170
<v Speaker 1>lower negative emotion will go out</v>
<v Speaker 1>farther before they come back to their</v>

19
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:54.680
<v Speaker 1>mother.</v>

20
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.130
<v Speaker 1>So the mother is the center and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that would be associated</v>

21
00:00:58.131 --> 00:01:01.520
<v Speaker 1>symbolically with the idea of the center</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a motherland or potentially as a</v>

22
00:01:01.521 --> 00:01:03.050
<v Speaker 1>father like that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

23
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.110
<v Speaker 1>So this way that we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're incredibly symbolic creatures.</v>

24
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>We're not just out to make as much money</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we can.</v>

25
00:01:08.571 --> 00:01:12.170
<v Speaker 1>Where's the symbolic and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>creatures and this psychology of</v>

26
00:01:12.171 --> 00:01:15.500
<v Speaker 1>sanctity or purity has become really</v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

27
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>not just on the right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been important for</v>

28
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>especially religious conservatives were</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to see it even on the campus</v>

29
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I think we see some of</v>

30
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:29.921
<v Speaker 1>the odd things we see on campus that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>campus must be kept as a sacred and pure</v>

31
00:01:30.231 --> 00:01:32.900
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that really alarms me</v>

32
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>about what's happened on campus and last</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of years is that the older idea</v>

33
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>we had that it's a place for contesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

34
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a zone of enormous choice.</v>

35
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:45.770
<v Speaker 1>People can take what courses they want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say what they want.</v>

36
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a wonderful free for all</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some with norms of respect.</v>

37
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.110
<v Speaker 1>It's now becoming much more of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious zone where the perimeter of</v>

38
00:01:54.111 --> 00:01:59.111
<v Speaker 1>the campus is the boundaries and within</v>
<v Speaker 1>it they're almost their blasphemy laws</v>

39
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.850
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I really started noticing this.</v>

40
00:02:01.851 --> 00:02:04.400
<v Speaker 1>When you look at the videos of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middlebury,</v>

41
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 1>a protest when Charles Murray spoke at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middlebury and as,</v>

42
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.120
<v Speaker 1>as everybody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was shouted down so the students are</v>

43
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>chanting and they're chanting in unison</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like a religious revival</v>

44
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:19.040
<v Speaker 1>meeting and they're swaying and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying they're sacred,</v>

45
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.971
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racist,</v>

46
00:02:19.971 --> 00:02:21.380
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antigay,</v>

47
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>Charles Murray go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a ritual incantation.</v>

48
00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that all the space is safe and it's</v>

49
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:30.530
<v Speaker 1>safe and maternal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not yet.</v>

50
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>So far all this happening is they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>binding together.</v>

51
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.540
<v Speaker 1>They're moving and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>synchronous movement and call and</v>

52
00:02:35.541 --> 00:02:38.690
<v Speaker 1>response.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's using a lot of tropes from</v>

53
00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.820
<v Speaker 1>religion and religious worship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the cool thing,</v>

54
00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 1>when the administrator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it is,</v>

55
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 1>comes on to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

56
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>we have moved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're moving the talk.</v>

57
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.820
<v Speaker 1>And then you hear a couple of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>screaming up off campus off campus and</v>

58
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>he says to another location on campus</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's like,</v>

59
00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

60
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one had to go to this talk.</v>

61
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So everyone could have just stayed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>home and the students did succeed in</v>

62
00:03:09.251 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>shutting down to venues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could have declared victory,</v>

63
00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's not a full victory unless he is</v>
<v Speaker 1>physically off the campus.</v>

64
00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:21.130
<v Speaker 1>We can't have him speaking on campus</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that defiles us.</v>

65
00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>That pollutes us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We must shut that down.</v>

66
00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's where I started saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

67
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>this is like full blown psychology of</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

68
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>Durkheim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctity,</v>

69
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 1>purity blast for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that I think,</v>

70
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:35.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't describe most students,</v>

71
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:37.840
<v Speaker 1>but that describes this sort of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>core.</v>

72
00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.970
<v Speaker 1>Those who who really have their identity</v>
<v Speaker 1>is wrapped up in this movement.</v>
