Do you have suggestions for how to make a schedule that doesn't make you a

2
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.640
tyrant?

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.110
I have watched your previous videos,

4
00:00:13.111 --> 00:00:15.690
but I'm struggling to make the week to schedule that it's productive.

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.441
Hey,

6
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:17.274
Joshua,

7
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.420
start by making a weekly schedule that you want.

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.321
Really,

9
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:22.680
like,

10
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.400
imagine that you're designing your schedule so that you can have the life you

11
00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:26.820
want.

12
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.090
Just start with that like,

13
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.540
and be easy on yourself to begin with.

14
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:30.841
You know,

15
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:31.830
you'll get better at it.

16
00:00:31.831 --> 00:00:33.990
You can add more responsibilities as you,

17
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.400
as you practice.

18
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.473
So,

19
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.310
so start by just scheduling and a few things that you'd like to do and then load

20
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:42.270
it up over time.

21
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.021
But remember,

22
00:00:43.021 --> 00:00:43.471
like get,

23
00:00:43.471 --> 00:00:44.340
get your attitude,

24
00:00:44.341 --> 00:00:45.090
right?

25
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.070
I'm using the schedule so that I can have the days and the weeks and the months

26
00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.390
that would make my life,

27
00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.610
that would optimize my life,

28
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:53.970
right?

29
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.490
Not so that I should do what I need to get done.

30
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.821
I mean,

31
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.110
obviously that's necessary,

32
00:00:58.111 --> 00:00:59.430
but that's not the right goal.
