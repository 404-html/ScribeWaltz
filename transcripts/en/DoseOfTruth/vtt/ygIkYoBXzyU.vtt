00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.880
<v Speaker 1>The agreeableness trait that divides men and women most.</v>

2
00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>There's three things that divide women and men most particularly from the</v>

3
00:00:13.231 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>psychometric perspective.</v>

4
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>One is that women are more agreeable than men.</v>

5
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 1>And so that seems to be the primary maternal dimension as far as I can tell.</v>

6
00:00:21.091 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with,</v>

7
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

8
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>a desire to avoid conflict.</v>

9
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:24.911
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

10
00:00:24.911 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 1>it's associated with interpersonal closeness,</v>

11
00:00:27.181 --> 00:00:27.841
<v Speaker 1>compassion,</v>

12
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:28.674
<v Speaker 1>politeness.</v>

13
00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>Women are reliably higher than men,</v>

14
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.630
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Scandinavian countries and in the countries where</v>

15
00:00:33.631 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>egalitarianism has progressed the farthest.</v>

16
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 1>So that's where the differences maximize,</v>

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.910
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things James Demora pointed out quite correctly in his</v>

18
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>infamous Google memo.</v>

19
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:43.711
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

20
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:45.420
<v Speaker 1>Women are higher in negative emotion.</v>

21
00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:47.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's anxiety and emotional pain,</v>

22
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.700
<v Speaker 1>that that difference is approximately the same size.</v>

23
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.211
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

24
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>that maximizes any Galitary in societies,</v>

25
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>which is extremely interesting.</v>

26
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>And then the biggest difference is the difference in interest between people and</v>

27
00:00:58.861 --> 00:00:59.694
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

28
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>And so women are more interested in people and men are more interested in</v>

29
00:01:02.671 --> 00:01:03.001
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

30
00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>which goes along quite nicely with your car anecdote.</v>

31
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 1>But the thing about men interacting with men again is that it isn't that they</v>

32
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>respect each other's viewpoints.</v>

33
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.100
<v Speaker 1>That's not exactly right.</v>

34
00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>What happens with a man,</v>

35
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.570
<v Speaker 1>and I know a lot of men that I would regard is as remarkably tough people for</v>

36
00:01:21.121 --> 00:01:22.080
<v Speaker 1>one reason or another.</v>

37
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>And everything you do with them is a form of combat.</v>

38
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want your viewpoint taken seriously,</v>

39
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.560
<v Speaker 1>often you have to yell them down and like they're not going to stop talking</v>

40
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>unless you start talking over them.</v>

41
00:01:33.181 --> 00:01:33.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

42
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:33.900
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

43
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>it's not like are automatically giving respect to other men because that just</v>

44
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:38.641
<v Speaker 1>doesn't happen.</v>

45
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

46
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.230
<v Speaker 1>the combat is there and it's expected and one of the problems,</v>

47
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and so this is part of the reason why I think men are bailing out of,</v>

48
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.420
<v Speaker 1>of so much of academia and,</v>

49
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:48.561
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

50
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the academic world in general,</v>

51
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>and maybe the world in general,</v>

52
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.220
<v Speaker 1>is that men actually don't have any idea how to compete with women.</v>

53
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Because the problem is,</v>

54
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:01.050
<v Speaker 1>is that if you unleash yourself completely,</v>

55
00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>then you're an absolute bully.</v>

56
00:02:02.251 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 1>And there's no doubt about that because if men unleash themselves on other men,</v>

57
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:08.400
<v Speaker 1>that can be pretty God damn brutal,</v>

58
00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.910
<v Speaker 1>especially for the men that are really tough and this,</v>

59
00:02:10.911 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>so that just doesn't happen with women.</v>

60
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.970
<v Speaker 1>But so you can't unleash yourself completely if you,</v>

61
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:17.930
<v Speaker 1>when you're a bully,</v>

62
00:02:17.931 --> 00:02:20.090
<v Speaker 1>if you lose while you're just bloody pathetic.</v>

63
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.670
<v Speaker 1>So how the hell are you supposed to play a game like that?</v>

64
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.451
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

65
00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:24.140
<v Speaker 1>So in,</v>

66
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.980
<v Speaker 1>I've worked with lots of women in law firms and in Canada for example,</v>

67
00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:28.191
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

68
00:02:28.191 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>and high achieving women,</v>

69
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>like really remarkable people,</v>

70
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:32.084
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

71
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.550
<v Speaker 1>And they're often nonplussed,</v>

72
00:02:34.551 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>I would say by the attitude of the man in the law firm because they would like</v>

73
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 1>to see everyone pulling together because they're all part of the same team,</v>

74
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.840
<v Speaker 1>whereas the manner like at each other's throats in an,</v>

75
00:02:44.841 --> 00:02:49.460
<v Speaker 1>in a cooperative way because they want the law firm to succeed,</v>

76
00:02:49.461 --> 00:02:52.910
<v Speaker 1>but they want to be the person who's at the top of the success hierarchy.</v>

77
00:02:52.911 --> 00:02:53.211
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

78
00:02:53.211 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

79
00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.260
<v Speaker 1>and that,</v>

80
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.260
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't jive well with the more competitive or cooperative ethos that's and</v>

81
00:02:59.261 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>parcel of agreeableness.</v>

82
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:05.461
<v Speaker 1>And so we don't really have any idea how to integrate male and female dominant</v>

83
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:06.350
<v Speaker 1>tower Gleason.</v>

84
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

85
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.413
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

86
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.253
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

87
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>This is why I love this show.</v>

88
00:03:09.821 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 2>And we real housewives.</v>

89
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 2>And I went to,</v>

90
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.740
<v Speaker 2>which is the fourth item scorings and just said just last night,</v>

91
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:14.930
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

92
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.620
<v Speaker 2>I was watching one episode all right.</v>

93
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 2>Where the women were at each other.</v>

94
00:03:18.341 --> 00:03:18.551
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

95
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 2>At a party and in,</v>

96
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.550
<v Speaker 2>in recounting.</v>

97
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.870
<v Speaker 2>But I said this to you and,</v>

98
00:03:21.871 --> 00:03:22.671
<v Speaker 2>but you said this to me.</v>

99
00:03:22.671 --> 00:03:23.110
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

100
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.390
<v Speaker 2>and the men I got,</v>

101
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.690
<v Speaker 2>we got together there and said,</v>

102
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:25.871
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

103
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 2>this is the way they communicate with each other.</v>

104
00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.790
<v Speaker 2>And antisense ended up,</v>

105
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

106
00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.853
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

107
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:30.581
<v Speaker 2>we men,</v>

108
00:03:30.581 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

109
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.301
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

110
00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:33.070
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a fist fight and wheel him in.</v>

111
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.890
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes later we're going to have a beer at the bar where they sat next to</v>

112
00:03:35.891 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 2>each other and so on.</v>

113
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.590
<v Speaker 2>And I have observed that mine to mine,</v>

114
00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.810
<v Speaker 2>my daughter,</v>

115
00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.380
<v Speaker 1>my daughter used to be really irritated about that because she,</v>

116
00:03:43.381 --> 00:03:43.890
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

117
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.180
<v Speaker 1>like most people,</v>

118
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.273
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

119
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.300
<v Speaker 1>was the target of feminine.</v>

120
00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

121
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.930
<v Speaker 1>conspiratorial bullying at one is she's no pushover,</v>

122
00:03:51.931 --> 00:03:52.381
<v Speaker 1>my daughter.</v>

123
00:03:52.381 --> 00:03:55.590
<v Speaker 1>So this wasn't like this was a continual thing or that she didn't know what to</v>

124
00:03:55.591 --> 00:03:56.131
<v Speaker 1>do about it,</v>

125
00:03:56.131 --> 00:04:01.070
<v Speaker 1>but she had to observe these girls conspiring against her and then blackening or</v>

126
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.681
<v Speaker 1>name on,</v>

127
00:04:01.681 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 1>on Facebook,</v>

128
00:04:02.551 --> 00:04:03.390
<v Speaker 1>which is part of it,</v>

129
00:04:03.391 --> 00:04:06.780
<v Speaker 1>part and parcel of the typical female bullying routine,</v>

130
00:04:06.781 --> 00:04:08.760
<v Speaker 1>which is often reputation demolition,</v>

131
00:04:08.761 --> 00:04:09.001
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

132
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:10.380
<v Speaker 1>That there's a good literature on that.</v>

133
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.420
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd watched what would happen if my brother or my son would have a</v>

134
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:16.950
<v Speaker 1>dispute with his friends,</v>

135
00:04:16.951 --> 00:04:17.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:04:17.281 --> 00:04:19.650
<v Speaker 1>and maybe they were drinking and there was a dispute they'd have a fight and</v>

137
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:21.050
<v Speaker 1>then the next day they were friends again.</v>

138
00:04:21.051 --> 00:04:25.500
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing that's strange is that like men have a way of bringing</v>

139
00:04:25.501 --> 00:04:28.230
<v Speaker 1>a conflict to a head and resolving it right.</v>

140
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:31.440
<v Speaker 1>And that it isn't obvious to me that women have that same,</v>

141
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 1>perhaps you might call it a luxury,</v>

142
00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.690
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the case that men don't know what to do when they get into a</v>

143
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:39.450
<v Speaker 1>conflict with a woman because what the hell are you supposed to do?</v>

144
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

145
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 1>mostly what you're supposed to do is avoid it.</v>

146
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

147
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.880
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

148
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

149
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

150
00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.120
<v Speaker 2>I don't know whether this crosses into other countries,</v>

151
00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 2>but that there was a certain kind of taunting and teasing that men and boys do</v>

152
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:53.670
<v Speaker 2>with each other that toughens them.</v>

153
00:04:53.671 --> 00:04:53.941
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

154
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:54.061
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

155
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:54.720
<v Speaker 2>and where they don't,</v>

156
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 2>they don't take things seriously,</v>

157
00:04:55.861 --> 00:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>but a girl's feelings become extremely hurt to have to hear something like that.</v>

158
00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.570
<v Speaker 2>It was very tough,</v>

159
00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

160
00:05:00.781 --> 00:05:01.080
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

161
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.760
<v Speaker 2>like sarcastic against her.</v>

162
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:03.480
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>

163
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>I do feel that there are profound differences between the sexes in terms of your</v>

164
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:08.280
<v Speaker 2>emotions,</v>

165
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.870
<v Speaker 2>in terms of communication patterns.</v>

166
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 2>I know my father used to say that he could never follow women's can</v>

167
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:13.981
<v Speaker 2>conversations.</v>

168
00:05:13.981 --> 00:05:14.221
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

169
00:05:14.221 --> 00:05:14.580
<v Speaker 2>here's the deal.</v>

170
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.821
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

171
00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 2>women don't even finish the finish sentences there.</v>

172
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:20.160
<v Speaker 2>Then with the women understand immediately what the other woman is saying.</v>

173
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

174
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:21.240
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

175
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.073
<v Speaker 2>and um,</v>

176
00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

177
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.950
<v Speaker 2>in the way the women tend to be more interested in or have been traditionally</v>

178
00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 2>more interested in soap operas,</v>

179
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.600
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the women who were home without jobs is that I honestly,</v>

180
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.120
<v Speaker 2>I believe that soap opera does reflect,</v>

181
00:05:33.121 --> 00:05:35.400
<v Speaker 2>does mirror the way women talk to each other.</v>

182
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.641
<v Speaker 2>Those are,</v>

183
00:05:35.641 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 2>these communication patterns have been built up through women in the world of</v>

184
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:39.630
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

185
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:39.811
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

186
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:39.991
<v Speaker 2>Which,</v>

187
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 2>which was it made sense?</v>

188
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:42.750
<v Speaker 2>There was a division of labor.</v>

189
00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:43.320
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

190
00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.200
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't sexism against women that there was a division of labor.</v>

191
00:05:46.201 --> 00:05:48.420
<v Speaker 2>The men went off to hunt and did the dangerous things.</v>

192
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.000
<v Speaker 2>The women stayed around the hearth because you had pregnant women,</v>

193
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.983
<v Speaker 2>nursing women,</v>

194
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.420
<v Speaker 2>older women were cooking and so on.</v>

195
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:57.440
<v Speaker 2>So I feel that these communication patterns that we're talking about have been</v>

196
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 2>built up over the centuries and the men had to toughen each other.</v>

197
00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.991
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

198
00:06:01.991 --> 00:06:03.060
<v Speaker 2>It took a while to go out and you know,</v>

199
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>the hunting parties and native Americans,</v>

200
00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:04.971
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

201
00:06:04.971 --> 00:06:05.380
<v Speaker 2>it would be,</v>

202
00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.120
<v Speaker 2>they could be gone for two weeks and when,</v>

203
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 2>when the temperature was below zero and in many of them die.</v>

204
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

205
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:11.810
<v Speaker 2>The idea that somehow,</v>

206
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

207
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 2>any kind of separation of the sexes or different spheres of the sexes is</v>

208
00:06:16.641 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>inherently sexist.</v>

209
00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.833
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

210
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:22.280
<v Speaker 2>the answer to all of this,</v>

211
00:06:22.281 --> 00:06:22.481
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

212
00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 2>That everything that we're talking about,</v>

213
00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

214
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Is Education into early history.</v>

215
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:28.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

216
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.091
<v Speaker 2>And until you are,</v>

217
00:06:29.091 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 2>until people understand the stone age,</v>

218
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 2>but nomadic period,</v>

219
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.360
<v Speaker 2>the agrarian era and how culture,</v>

220
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:36.950
<v Speaker 2>how civilization built up.</v>

221
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.191
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

222
00:06:37.191 --> 00:06:38.210
<v Speaker 2>In Mesopotamia,</v>

223
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 2>the great irrigation projects,</v>

224
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>or in or in Egypt where you had,</v>

225
00:06:42.471 --> 00:06:45.800
<v Speaker 2>for the first centralized government authority became necessary.</v>

226
00:06:45.801 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

227
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.470
<v Speaker 2>To master these,</v>

228
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:47.821
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

229
00:06:47.821 --> 00:06:48.060
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

230
00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:48.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

231
00:06:48.401 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 2>we had a situation where at an environmentally,</v>

232
00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

233
00:06:51.571 --> 00:06:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

234
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:52.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

235
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

236
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.730
<v Speaker 2>difficult situation like the deserts of Mesopotamia or,</v>

237
00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:56.400
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>

238
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 2>the peculiar character of,</v>

239
00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:00.860
<v Speaker 2>of Egyptian geography where you can only have a little tiny,</v>

240
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.191
<v Speaker 2>tiny,</v>

241
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:03.730
<v Speaker 2>fertile line along the edges of the Nile.</v>

242
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:03.951
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

243
00:07:03.951 --> 00:07:05.660
<v Speaker 2>And not otherwise it desert landscape.</v>

244
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 2>So th this civilization and a 14.</v>

245
00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:09.430
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

246
00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.920
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

247
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 2>I ask not necessarily about power grabbing,</v>

248
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.650
<v Speaker 2>but about organization to achieve something for the good of the people as a</v>

249
00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:18.140
<v Speaker 2>whole.</v>
