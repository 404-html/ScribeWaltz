1
00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>You've been betrayed by someone.</v>

2
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>And so you fall into that underworld of,</v>

3
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.000
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.380
<v Speaker 1>of doubt about everything.</v>

5
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>And it's a serious place to be in that underworld a,</v>

6
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>because not only do you not know where you came from or who you are or where</v>

7
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>you're going,</v>

8
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>that's bad enough.</v>

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's the underworld itself.</v>

10
00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>But there's a subdivision of the underworld,</v>

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 1>like the worst suburb,</v>

12
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:27.570
<v Speaker 1>which is I think what hell is essentially from a metaphysical perspective</v>

13
00:00:27.571 --> 00:00:28.830
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>

14
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.260
<v Speaker 1>if someone really cuts you off at the knees,</v>

15
00:00:31.261 --> 00:00:33.390
<v Speaker 1>especially if they do it in a malevolent way,</v>

16
00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>and if you're going to be betrayed and you really want to be,</v>

17
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>be trade properly,</v>

18
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>you want to be betrayed by someone who's really out to hurt you.</v>

19
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.201
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:41.610
<v Speaker 1>they just weren't being stupid.</v>

21
00:00:41.611 --> 00:00:43.890
<v Speaker 1>They were like after you for whatever reason.</v>

22
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>And then that's also you plunged into that underworld space.</v>

23
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's also when you start to nurse feelings of resentment and a grievement</v>

24
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>and murder and homicide.</v>

25
00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:54.660
<v Speaker 1>And even worse,</v>

26
00:00:54.661 --> 00:00:54.961
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

27
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>because if people are betrayed enough,</v>

28
00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>they start,</v>

29
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.660
<v Speaker 1>they start to obsess about the utility of being itself and perhaps go to places</v>

30
00:01:02.821 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that no one would ever want to go if they were in their right mind and to,</v>

31
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>and to develop a nurse fantasies of the ultimate revenge.</v>

32
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>And that's a horrible place to be.</v>

33
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>And that's held as far as I can tell.</v>

34
00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>And that's why hell is always been a suburb of the underworld.</v>

35
00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:17.694
<v Speaker 1>Because if,</v>

36
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.600
<v Speaker 1>if you get plunged into a situation that you don't understand and things are not</v>

37
00:01:21.601 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>good for you anymore,</v>

38
00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>it's one step from being completely confused.</v>

39
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>It's only one step from being completely confused to being completely outraged</v>

40
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.750
<v Speaker 1>and resentful.</v>

41
00:01:30.751 --> 00:01:34.200
<v Speaker 1>And then it's only one step from there to really looking for revenge.</v>

42
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 1>And that can take you places that well that,</v>

43
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.650
<v Speaker 1>that merely to imagine properly can be traumatic.</v>

44
00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen that happen with people many times.</v>

45
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.050
<v Speaker 1>And I think that anybody who uses their imagination on themselves can see how</v>

46
00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:52.530
<v Speaker 1>that happens because I don't imagine there's a single person in the room that</v>

47
00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:55.590
<v Speaker 1>hasn't nursed fairly intense fantasies of revenge,</v>

48
00:01:55.591 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>at least at one point in their life.</v>

49
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.871
<v Speaker 1>And usually,</v>

50
00:01:57.871 --> 00:01:58.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

51
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.120
<v Speaker 1>for what appear to be good reasons,</v>

52
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.490
<v Speaker 1>it's no picnic to get betrayed.</v>

53
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:03.231
<v Speaker 1>That's for sure.</v>

54
00:02:03.231 --> 00:02:04.740
<v Speaker 1>That can shake your faith in being,</v>

55
00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.880
<v Speaker 1>but if it shakes it so badly that you turn against being itself,</v>

56
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 1>that certainly no solution,</v>

57
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:10.981
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>

58
00:02:10.981 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>All it does is make everything that's bad.</v>

59
00:02:13.051 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Even worse.</v>
