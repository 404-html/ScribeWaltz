1
00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.460
<v Speaker 1>So you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2
00:00:07.461 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>what happens when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you feel one way and you say</v>

3
00:00:10.431 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you're all in,</v>

4
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.820
<v Speaker 1>you're all perfectly,</v>

5
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>it's the middle year with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>

6
00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my experience with people has been that,</v>

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.350
<v Speaker 1>and this is another issue with</v>
<v Speaker 1>instrumental use of language.</v>

8
00:00:25.351 --> 00:00:25.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you say,</v>

9
00:00:25.891 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>well what are you using your language</v>
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>

10
00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to get what you want,</v>

11
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>but that can be consciously manipulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then maybe we'll say,</v>

12
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>well that's what the psychopath is like</v>
<v Speaker 1>except the psychopath is not only</v>

13
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:39.390
<v Speaker 1>consciously manipulative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's also unconsciously manipulative</v>

14
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>because he's been practicing it for like</v>
<v Speaker 1>three decades.</v>

15
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>So all the little machines in his head</v>
<v Speaker 1>or deceptive too,</v>

16
00:00:45.181 --> 00:00:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and they run on automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he'll just lie just to see if he can</v>

17
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>pull one over on you because that</v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrates that not only is he smarter</v>

18
00:00:52.591 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 1>than you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that you deserve to be victimized</v>

19
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>because you're such an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

20
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.210
<v Speaker 1>but people use instrumental language</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

21
00:01:00.211 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>Not only consciously to get what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>want,</v>

22
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:05.010
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that we definitely think</v>

23
00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>of is characteristic for example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenagers.</v>

24
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

25
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a teen movie that's be made</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last 50 years.</v>

26
00:01:12.241 --> 00:01:15.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't deal with the negative</v>

27
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:17.250
<v Speaker 1>consequences of using instrumental</v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

28
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically the team has put in some</v>

29
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:24.420
<v Speaker 1>position where they're being pulled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulled by maybe various social forces,</v>

30
00:01:24.421 --> 00:01:26.660
<v Speaker 1>different friendship groups or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or there's a,</v>

31
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was a</v>

32
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.850
<v Speaker 1>contradictory relationship between what</v>
<v Speaker 1>their friends want and their parents</v>

33
00:01:34.851 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>want or what their friends want and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's school wants or what they want</v>

34
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 1>and their friends want or what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>school wants.</v>

35
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>So all of these things are pulling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushing in different directions and the</v>

36
00:01:44.091 --> 00:01:47.390
<v Speaker 1>directions are essentially in some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense the directions or moral</v>

37
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 1>because they're all about what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

38
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>the plot of the movie is how the</v>
<v Speaker 1>teenager,</v>

39
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.720
<v Speaker 1>it's usually a Rogerian plot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's usually about how the teenager</v>

40
00:01:56.721 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>comes to more to fuller self</v>
<v Speaker 1>realization.</v>

41
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that they're able to,</v>

42
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.900
<v Speaker 1>that they're able to stave off the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the temptations that are posed sometimes</v>

43
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:11.990
<v Speaker 1>by the authorities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they don't become too obedient and</v>

44
00:02:11.991 --> 00:02:16.991
<v Speaker 1>sometimes by their peers so that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't become only a reflection of peer</v>

45
00:02:17.121 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

46
00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 2>Question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just going to say,</v>

47
00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.690
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

48
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 2>Peer pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peer peer pressure is absolutely that.</v>

49
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're using language to fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

50
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>well that's also instrumental use of</v>
<v Speaker 1>language and for,</v>

51
00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>and for Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be one of the sources of</v>

52
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:39.740
<v Speaker 1>pathology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

53
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.990
<v Speaker 1>it's very much worth taking this</v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

54
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.093
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

55
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.090
<v Speaker 1>here's an example that I thought about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

56
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.180
<v Speaker 1>What do you do if you're at work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone tells you to do something that</v>

57
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I don't mean that,</v>

58
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.440
<v Speaker 1>forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume you're disciplined,</v>

59
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're not just lazy and</v>

60
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:03.610
<v Speaker 1>worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you don't want to do it.</v>

61
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>And you want to ask yourself that first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:03:05.651 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Because maybe you're just being lazy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>worthless and you should pull yourself</v>

63
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:11.860
<v Speaker 1>together and do the thing you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

64
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:14.650
<v Speaker 1>but failing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that you're being asked to do</v>

65
00:03:14.651 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 1>something that you're finding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're having a very difficult time to</v>

66
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 1>get motivated to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that'd be one clue.</v>

67
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>And that it's also making you uneasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're waking up in the middle of the</v>

68
00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>night and you're being anxious and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running through your mind.</v>

69
00:03:29.261 --> 00:03:32.080
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should you do?</v>

70
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your job.</v>

71
00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Someone who is in the hierarchy above</v>
<v Speaker 1>you is telling you to do it.</v>

72
00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you should just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you might ask yourself,</v>

73
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why can't you just go ahead and do it?</v>

74
00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

75
00:03:50.841 --> 00:03:52.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's because I criminal and you're</v>

76
00:03:52.461 --> 00:03:54.650
<v Speaker 1>afraid of getting caught,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's forget about that for a</v>

77
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.350
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that the probability,</v>

78
00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.140
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's a low level moral</v>
<v Speaker 1>transgression,</v>

79
00:04:00.141 --> 00:04:03.470
<v Speaker 1>it's not precisely illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even so the probability that you're</v>

80
00:04:03.471 --> 00:04:08.471
<v Speaker 1>going to get caught is very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would it bother you and should you</v>

81
00:04:09.021 --> 00:04:14.021
<v Speaker 1>take that seriously?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Rogers would claim that the reason</v>

82
00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:20.141
<v Speaker 1>it would bother you is because it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the structure of yourself system</v>

83
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Speaker 1>inconsistent.</v>

84
00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.353
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

85
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.880
<v Speaker 1>imagine you're trying to organize a</v>
<v Speaker 1>group of people to do some tasks.</v>

86
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe they were in a row and you</v>

87
00:04:32.641 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 1>have to fill it in a hole in the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so you have to put people in a row</v>

88
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>and you've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you handed rocks down the line.</v>

89
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you got one person in there who is</v>

90
00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>trying to put rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the rocks go the other way or</v>

91
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:47.640
<v Speaker 1>dropping them or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then obviously the entire structure</v>

92
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.720
<v Speaker 1>is not going to function properly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's because there's an internally</v>

93
00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:54.780
<v Speaker 1>to consistency in 10 you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fundamental presupposition of,</v>

94
00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.430
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of logic.</v>

95
00:04:56.431 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>It's maybe the most fundamental</v>
<v Speaker 1>principle of communication that a thing</v>

96
00:05:01.261 --> 00:05:04.470
<v Speaker 1>can't be itself and something else at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

97
00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the principle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>noncontradiction.</v>

98
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:10.080
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the hypothesis here would be that</v>

99
00:05:10.081 --> 00:05:14.310
<v Speaker 1>you have to follow the principle of</v>
<v Speaker 1>noncontradiction with regards to the</v>

100
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:16.620
<v Speaker 1>organization of your own self.</v>

101
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.620
<v Speaker 1>The self would be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger's thinks about that as an are a</v>

102
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.230
<v Speaker 1>differentiated field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>subfield of the phenomenal field.</v>

103
00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:27.690
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're always experiencing things and</v>

104
00:05:27.691 --> 00:05:32.280
<v Speaker 1>part of what you've experienced is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you at the center of that and that's the</v>

105
00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:37.281
<v Speaker 1>self as far as Roger's is concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the proposition would be you have to</v>

106
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.950
<v Speaker 1>organize the self in a non contradictory</v>
<v Speaker 1>manner or well or what well or you feel</v>

107
00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:48.990
<v Speaker 1>negative emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he would think about that as anxiety</v>

108
00:05:48.991 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes we can start the narrative around,</v>

109
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:00.890
<v Speaker 1>well that might work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

110
00:06:00.891 --> 00:06:05.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's a very good and</v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated question because what you're</v>

111
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.840
<v Speaker 1>asking is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well why,</v>

112
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>why can't you rationalize effectively?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really,</v>

113
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.463
<v Speaker 1>well</v>

114
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.510
<v Speaker 1>that's a postmodern theory I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>in some sense because the postmodern</v>

115
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.250
<v Speaker 1>like to claim that there's nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside of the text.</v>

116
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then things in some sense are</v>

117
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>infinitely malleable and that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>malleability comes as a consequence of</v>

118
00:06:32.241 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 1>the different narratives that you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>might weave.</v>

119
00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.770
<v Speaker 1>But Rogers would point out that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the first thing he pointed out is</v>

120
00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:41.790
<v Speaker 1>that stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it is.</v>

121
00:06:41.791 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's all sorts of things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are characteristics of your</v>

122
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 1>characteristic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your experience that haven't gone.</v>

123
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Pets like phenomenology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

124
00:06:51.681 --> 00:06:54.680
<v Speaker 1>like I think it's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very difficult to claim that pain is,</v>

125
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 1>is textual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

126
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.090
<v Speaker 1>And we do know that you can,</v>

127
00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.690
<v Speaker 1>you can manipulate the way an organism</v>
<v Speaker 1>feels pain quite extensively.</v>

128
00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:05.680
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

129
00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.100
<v Speaker 1>if you whack the dog on the nose with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>newspaper,</v>

130
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:11.950
<v Speaker 1>every time it goes to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will starve to death.</v>

131
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.810
<v Speaker 1>You can teach it not to eat very</v>
<v Speaker 1>rapidly.</v>

132
00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.170
<v Speaker 1>And so what you're doing is you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching the dog that hunger is</v>

133
00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:21.340
<v Speaker 1>punishing and then it transforms hunger</v>
<v Speaker 1>into anxiety and then it go heat.</v>

134
00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.420
<v Speaker 1>So the reason I'm telling you that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>because even something as fundamental as</v>

135
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:27.550
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you might think about as a basic</v>

136
00:07:27.551 --> 00:07:30.250
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be modulated by learning,</v>

137
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.340
<v Speaker 1>but there are limits to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There evident limits to that.</v>

138
00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the problem with weaving a</v>

139
00:07:35.741 --> 00:07:39.760
<v Speaker 1>narrative is that even if it's complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sophisticated,</v>

140
00:07:40.090 --> 00:07:43.930
<v Speaker 1>and so you've convinced yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't necessarily mean that the</v>

141
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:48.760
<v Speaker 1>actions and perceptions undertaken as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that formulation are</v>

142
00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:51.460
<v Speaker 1>going to be commensurate with the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of your personality.</v>

143
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a big risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

144
00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:58.530
<v Speaker 1>So and I think it is the risk that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people run when they tell themselves or</v>

145
00:07:59.711 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>act out at the false owed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

146
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.750
<v Speaker 1>because for Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could also act out false hoods.</v>

147
00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.531
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

148
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:07.780
<v Speaker 1>the philosophers call that a</v>
<v Speaker 1>performative contradiction.</v>

149
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:09.940
<v Speaker 1>That's when you say one thing and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

150
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a form of lie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's an embodied line.</v>

151
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Rogers was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a very,</v>

152
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.350
<v Speaker 1>he was very cognizant of embodiment as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>

153
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 1>as a central human feature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

154
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was very concerned about the fact</v>

155
00:08:23.201 --> 00:08:27.430
<v Speaker 1>that the representational structures had</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take into account the realities of</v>

156
00:08:27.431 --> 00:08:30.550
<v Speaker 1>the underlying biology and those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So those would be felt states in a</v>

157
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:33.640
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the Rogerian answers,</v>

158
00:08:33.641 --> 00:08:37.660
<v Speaker 1>you can't get away with it that easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What that'll do is it'll produce</v>

159
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:41.680
<v Speaker 1>contradictions as you move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those contradictions will,</v>

160
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.750
<v Speaker 1>will unsettle you either in a minor way</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in a deep way.</v>

161
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as I can tell by Rogers,</v>

162
00:08:50.321 --> 00:08:55.321
<v Speaker 1>never really formalized a theory about</v>
<v Speaker 1>why something is deep and why something</v>

163
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 1>was shallow in terms of it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>misrepresentation.</v>

164
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:05.270
<v Speaker 1>But we've already talked about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think about the hierarchical</v>

165
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>structure that I showed you many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea there is that higher level of</v>

166
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 1>the abstraction that you mess around</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

167
00:09:12.151 --> 00:09:14.730
<v Speaker 1>the more of your personality you</v>
<v Speaker 1>pathologize.</v>

168
00:09:14.731 --> 00:09:17.330
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking this week too that,</v>

169
00:09:17.331 --> 00:09:18.980
<v Speaker 1>that that hierarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

170
00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>the one I showed you many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe I have any ways little eggs in</v>

171
00:09:22.531 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>rows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the structure of the</v>

172
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>unconscious actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

173
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:31.200
<v Speaker 1>and you miss about without at your peril</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you're programming your own</v>

174
00:09:31.201 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 1>perceptions and your actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the Rogerian presupposition,</v>

175
00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I'm talking about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>presuppositions that underlied is</v>

176
00:09:38.701 --> 00:09:42.850
<v Speaker 1>thinking because the Rogerian approach</v>
<v Speaker 1>is based on a deep presupposition,</v>

177
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>which is that honest integration</v>
<v Speaker 1>matters.</v>

178
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

179
00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 1>perhaps not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

180
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's been the question that people</v>

181
00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.810
<v Speaker 1>have been debating since the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 1>of time.</v>

182
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.310
<v Speaker 1>But my experience as a therapist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so you know,</v>

183
00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.590
<v Speaker 1>I've never seen anyone get away with</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

184
00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:06.630
<v Speaker 1>I think every time you do something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know isn't right,</v>

185
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.090
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get wall up for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sooner or later.</v>

186
00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Now you may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>may have blinded yourself so badly</v>

187
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>because of your ms apprehensions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>deceptions that you can't see the causal</v>

188
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 1>connection between what you did and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

189
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes it takes years of</v>

190
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:27.591
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapeutic investigation to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to lay out the causal narrative,</v>

191
00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:30.680
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why,</v>

192
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.840
<v Speaker 1>why would anybody ever think they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>bend the structure of reality and get</v>

193
00:10:33.841 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 1>away with it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

194
00:10:34.830 --> 00:10:37.800
<v Speaker 1>To me it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know those plastic rulers,</v>

195
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:41.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like you can hold one of those in</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of your nose and bend it forward</v>

196
00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you let go,</v>

197
00:10:42.991 --> 00:10:45.480
<v Speaker 1>it's going to hit you in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

198
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you're going to curse,</v>

199
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>faced fake because you got hit in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>face,</v>

200
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:50.820
<v Speaker 1>but you've been the down ruler.</v>
