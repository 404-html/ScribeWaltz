00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Why are you now Francoise seat orange asked,</v>

2
00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:09.781
<v Speaker 1>why are,</v>

3
00:00:09.781 --> 00:00:10.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.570
<v Speaker 1>hiding the amount you receive from Patriot?</v>

5
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I found it very motivating to see the amount skyrocket and telled glad to be</v>

6
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 1>part of this as if you were an artist.</v>

7
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I now feel more like I'm buying a product and I find it less appealing.</v>

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.981
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:22.981 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>Well it's one of those things where I'm kind of damned if I do and damned if I</v>

10
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:26.611
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

11
00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

12
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.370
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what's correct.</v>

13
00:00:29.371 --> 00:00:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I guess I probably got tired of,</v>

14
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

15
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.270
<v Speaker 1>the sort of more left leaning,</v>

16
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>let's say radical left leaning press people jumping up and down on me every</v>

17
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>chance they got because people were donating money for,</v>

18
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>for services that I s particularly rent,</v>

19
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

20
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>that I render essentially for free.</v>

21
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.343
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

22
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.461
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

23
00:00:53.461 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

24
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 1>there must be 10 articles in the last week following the Lindsay Shepherd</v>

25
00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.600
<v Speaker 1>incident pointing out that I'm somehow being manipulative and,</v>

26
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.571
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

27
00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:04.404
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

28
00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>evil in a capitalist sort of way for daring to</v>

29
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

30
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.970
<v Speaker 1>allow people to donate money to help support what I'm doing.</v>

31
00:01:13.971 --> 00:01:15.770
<v Speaker 1>And it gets kind of tiring.</v>

32
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.840
<v Speaker 1>And so I dunno,</v>

33
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

34
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>and I guess I also thought that maybe there's a part of it.</v>

35
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:21.974
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

36
00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.241
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

37
00:01:23.241 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't exactly call it bragging,</v>

38
00:01:25.101 --> 00:01:26.510
<v Speaker 1>but because it's not,</v>

39
00:01:26.511 --> 00:01:27.344
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

40
00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

41
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.640
<v Speaker 1>that spoke good enough.</v>

42
00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

43
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>it was an appeal to privacy,</v>

44
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:34.341
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

45
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:34.971
<v Speaker 1>in part two.</v>

46
00:01:34.971 --> 00:01:36.350
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno if it's the right thing.</v>

47
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 1>I could do a poll on Twitter and find out,</v>

48
00:01:38.901 --> 00:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I guess I did that first.</v>

49
00:01:40.581 --> 00:01:41.690
<v Speaker 1>Some other things this week.</v>

50
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

51
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

52
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.240
<v Speaker 1>that's the answer to that.</v>
