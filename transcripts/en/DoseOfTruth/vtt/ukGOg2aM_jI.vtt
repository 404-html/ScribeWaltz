00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2
00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:06.610
<v Speaker 1>can we revive the state of Western civilization using the new idea that God is</v>

3
00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:07.694
<v Speaker 1>dead?</v>

4
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:08.783
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

5
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 2>it's the wrong question in some sense because I think it's too diffuse.</v>

6
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.110
<v Speaker 2>they issue more is do you have problems in your life that you're not addressing</v>

8
00:00:19.111 --> 00:00:20.310
<v Speaker 2>that you could solve?</v>

9
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.050
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is yes.</v>

10
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 2>And it's an easy thing to figure out.</v>

11
00:00:23.971 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 2>You sit on your bed one morning and say,</v>

12
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:26.544
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

13
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 2>there's some things that need to be done that I don't want to do that I could do</v>

14
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.330
<v Speaker 2>that would make things better by the end of the day.</v>

15
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.763
<v Speaker 2>What are they?</v>

16
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.341
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

17
00:00:35.341 --> 00:00:36.174
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

18
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 2>your conscience will deliver those suckers,</v>

19
00:00:38.191 --> 00:00:39.400
<v Speaker 2>no time flat map.</v>

20
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.980
<v Speaker 2>And then you might have to say,</v>

21
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:41.221
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

22
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 2>well how do I entice myself into doing a few of those?</v>

23
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.530
<v Speaker 2>And if you ask,</v>

24
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:48.540
<v Speaker 2>instead of trying to force yourself to do it,</v>

25
00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:51.300
<v Speaker 2>like you're a tyrant and a slave at the same time,</v>

26
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 2>you can usually negotiate with yourself so that you'll start to sort those</v>

27
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:56.544
<v Speaker 2>things out,</v>

28
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 2>sort them out,</v>

29
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 2>put your house in order and then move out.</v>

30
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Move on and out.</v>

31
00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:06.453
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

32
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 2>That's a Freudian slip by the way.</v>

33
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.733
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

34
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 2>so it's important because the thing is you,</v>

35
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 2>you have a practice domain right there.</v>

36
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.840
<v Speaker 2>There are things that are within your grasp that you can fix,</v>

37
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 2>fix them and you'll learn.</v>

38
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 2>You'll learn cause it's harder than it looks.</v>

39
00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Fix them and you'll learn how to fix things and then something else will beckon</v>

40
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.580
<v Speaker 2>as another problem that you could fix.</v>

41
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

42
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.220
<v Speaker 2>you all have your problems.</v>

43
00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>

44
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Like there's an infinite number of problems in the world.</v>

45
00:01:35.191 --> 00:01:36.420
<v Speaker 2>Some of them happened to be yours.</v>

46
00:01:36.421 --> 00:01:37.254
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>

47
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't know exactly,</v>

48
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 2>but you have your problems.</v>

49
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.573
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

50
00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Solve them.</v>

51
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.470
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

52
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 2>one of the things I learned as a therapist,</v>

53
00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:49.050
<v Speaker 2>every therapist has to learn this is because one of the things you wonder when</v>

54
00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.370
<v Speaker 2>you're first starting to be a clinician is how do you not take the catastrophes</v>

55
00:01:53.371 --> 00:01:54.690
<v Speaker 2>of your client's home with you?</v>

56
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 2>And the answer to that is because it's immoral to,</v>

57
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.630
<v Speaker 2>they're not your problems.</v>

58
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.870
<v Speaker 2>They're their problems like their,</v>

59
00:02:03.871 --> 00:02:04.111
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

60
00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 2>their life.</v>

61
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.511
<v Speaker 2>You all,</v>

62
00:02:05.511 --> 00:02:06.900
<v Speaker 2>your problems are your life.</v>

63
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to solve someone else's problems for them because you take away</v>

64
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:11.210
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

65
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.150
<v Speaker 2>the deep meaning.</v>

66
00:02:12.151 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 2>That's to be found in having them work through the problems on their own.</v>

67
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 2>And then you steal the credit.</v>

68
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Well I can help you with that.</v>

69
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.980
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

70
00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.870
<v Speaker 2>well yeah maybe,</v>

71
00:02:21.871 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 2>but I don't help you with the next problem then.</v>

72
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.280
<v Speaker 2>So in any case,</v>

73
00:02:26.281 --> 00:02:29.790
<v Speaker 2>you sort of sort out the problems that are right in front of you and you will,</v>

74
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.380
<v Speaker 2>it will make you grow very,</v>

75
00:02:31.381 --> 00:02:34.620
<v Speaker 2>very rapidly and then you'll be able to sort out more complex problems without</v>

76
00:02:34.621 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 2>making them worse.</v>

77
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:37.043
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

78
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.630
<v Speaker 1>so you mentioned that through discussion and dialogue,</v>

79
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 1>we can order the chaos,</v>

80
00:02:43.251 --> 00:02:44.061
<v Speaker 1>the world together,</v>

81
00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:46.400
<v Speaker 1>but do you not think that there needs to be a higher creator,</v>

82
00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:47.530
<v Speaker 1>an essence of grapes?</v>

83
00:02:47.531 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>

84
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>it would be possible.</v>

85
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 1>Like how can we each being flawed,</v>

86
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>still even working together create meaning or something good.</v>

87
00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:58.703
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

88
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.700
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

89
00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.680
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand what we are,</v>

90
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.950
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand our own consciousness.</v>

91
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.550
<v Speaker 2>It has a quality of some sort and it meant,</v>

92
00:03:13.551 --> 00:03:15.170
<v Speaker 2>it manifests itself within us.</v>

93
00:03:15.171 --> 00:03:16.760
<v Speaker 2>It's an orientation towards the good.</v>

94
00:03:16.761 --> 00:03:18.410
<v Speaker 2>That might be one way of thinking about it.</v>

95
00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.090
<v Speaker 2>Freedom to do evil,</v>

96
00:03:20.091 --> 00:03:21.740
<v Speaker 2>but an orientation towards the good.</v>

97
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.690
<v Speaker 2>And so you participate in whatever that transcendent element of you is while you</v>

98
00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:29.720
<v Speaker 2>try to speak the truth and sort out the world.</v>

99
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.220
<v Speaker 2>It serves as a guide.</v>

100
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.120
<v Speaker 2>So I know that you're making a,</v>

101
00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.523
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

102
00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.930
<v Speaker 2>a query about some transcendent reality may be the transcendent reality of God,</v>

103
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.360
<v Speaker 2>but that's the best answer you're going to get out of me,</v>

104
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.480
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>

105
00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.313
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

106
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.831
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

107
00:03:54.831 --> 00:03:55.551
<v Speaker 2>Two questions.</v>

108
00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:58.580
<v Speaker 2>What's my opinion on the alt right and what's my opinion on cultural</v>

109
00:03:58.581 --> 00:03:59.414
<v Speaker 2>appropriation?</v>

110
00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.540
<v Speaker 2>The idea of cultural appropriation is absolute nonsense.</v>

111
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 3>That's that [inaudible]</v>

112
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

113
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference between cultural appropriation and learning from one</v>

114
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:14.374
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

115
00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 2>They're the same thing.</v>

116
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.290
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean I can't,</v>

117
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't mean that there's no theft between people.</v>

118
00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:22.413
<v Speaker 2>There is,</v>

119
00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

120
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't mean that just because you encounter someone else's ideas,</v>

121
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 2>you have an immediate right to those ideas as if they were your own.</v>

122
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.870
<v Speaker 2>But the idea that manifesting in your own behavior,</v>

123
00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 2>some element of another culture,</v>

124
00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:39.160
<v Speaker 2>the idea that that's somehow immoral is insane.</v>

125
00:04:39.161 --> 00:04:41.770
<v Speaker 2>It's actually one of the basis of peace.</v>

126
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

127
00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that the various groups of human beings that exist have to</v>

128
00:04:46.361 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 2>offer each other is the tremendous value of their culture.</v>

129
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

130
00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 2>it's been really interesting to me,</v>

131
00:04:51.851 --> 00:04:52.421
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

132
00:04:52.421 --> 00:04:56.800
<v Speaker 2>to watch the responsive of wall of everyone.</v>

133
00:04:56.801 --> 00:04:58.430
<v Speaker 2>But for this argument too,</v>

134
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 2>for young Caucasian males to hip hop,</v>

135
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 2>there's an aggressiveness about hip hop that's pretty attractive to young</v>

137
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:05.351
<v Speaker 2>Caucasian males.</v>

138
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 2>And there's something absurd about,</v>

139
00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 2>about the,</v>

140
00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

141
00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.830
<v Speaker 2>the spectacle of the young Caucasian males taking on the persona of inner city</v>

142
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 2>black gang members,</v>

143
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:17.343
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

144
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

145
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sympathetic to it because there's an aggressiveness to that,</v>

146
00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 2>to that art form that's a necessary corrective to the insistence that the</v>

147
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 2>highest moral virtue for a modern man is harmlessness,</v>

148
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 2>which is absurd.</v>

149
00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Women don't even like cardless man,</v>

150
00:05:34.931 --> 00:05:35.800
<v Speaker 2>they hate them.</v>

151
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.933
<v Speaker 2>They liked that</v>

152
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.083
<v Speaker 3>park.</v>

153
00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:42.030
<v Speaker 3>Women</v>

154
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.030
<v Speaker 2>want are dangerous men who are civilized and they want to help civilize them.</v>

155
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.430
<v Speaker 2>That's beauty and the beast.</v>

156
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.361
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

157
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:51.661
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

158
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:54.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you a funny story and only engineers could have come up with this</v>

159
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 2>because they are the only ones that have the unparalleled blindness to social</v>

160
00:05:59.661 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>convention that would allow them to discover it.</v>

161
00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>So the Google engineers,</v>

162
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 2>I like engineers by the way,</v>

163
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 2>cause they're very straightforward.</v>

164
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 2>The Google engineers wrote a book awhile back called a billion wicked thoughts,</v>

165
00:06:10.341 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 2>which was a study of Internet searches,</v>

166
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>billions of them literally.</v>

167
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 2>And they were looking a lot at pornography use.</v>

168
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:19.100
<v Speaker 2>And while there's lots of known about male pornography use,</v>

169
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 2>partly and it's easy to understand,</v>

170
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:25.870
<v Speaker 2>I mean males are pretty visually oriented and what attracts them to pornography</v>

171
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:27.580
<v Speaker 2>is fairly straight forward.</v>

172
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

173
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>you can tell that if you look at graffiti and a men's washroom,</v>

174
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:31.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

175
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:36.590
<v Speaker 2>it's like two circles and a triangle and the men are absolutely transfixed.</v>

176
00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.523
<v Speaker 3>Bye</v>

177
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.340
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

178
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:50.563
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

179
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:53.040
<v Speaker 3>for women,</v>

180
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 2>his story is more complex.</v>

181
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.490
<v Speaker 2>They use pornography too.</v>

182
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:58.730
<v Speaker 2>But it tends to be literary because women tend to like words more than they like</v>

183
00:06:58.731 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 2>visual stimuli.</v>

184
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:04.020
<v Speaker 2>And so the Google guys tried to track down the architectural structure of all,</v>

185
00:07:04.021 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 2>they didn't use those words of female pornography use.</v>

186
00:07:06.561 --> 00:07:11.420
<v Speaker 2>And so some of you know how many of you know what a Harlequin romance is.</v>

187
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

188
00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:12.951
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

189
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>So those are archetypal stories,</v>

190
00:07:14.481 --> 00:07:14.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

191
00:07:14.661 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 2>That's the taming of the wild man,</v>

192
00:07:16.461 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 2>essentially by the,</v>

193
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 2>by the desirable in virgin a woman.</v>

194
00:07:19.431 --> 00:07:21.680
<v Speaker 2>And if you think women don't want that,</v>

195
00:07:21.681 --> 00:07:25.520
<v Speaker 2>then you better bloody well come up with an explanation for 50 shades of grey,</v>

196
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

197
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:27.494
<v Speaker 2>Which is the most,</v>

198
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 2>the most rapid selling novel in human history and merged at exactly the same</v>

199
00:07:32.241 --> 00:07:35.930
<v Speaker 2>time that all of this noise about the lack of the absence of gender roles is,</v>

200
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:36.950
<v Speaker 2>is being produced.</v>

201
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:37.221
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

202
00:07:37.221 --> 00:07:37.850
<v Speaker 2>on mosques.</v>

203
00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 2>It's like perfect female fantasy.</v>

204
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly Arkan typically correct.</v>

205
00:07:41.301 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 2>It's beauty and the beast.</v>

206
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:46.820
<v Speaker 2>So what the Google guys showed was the structure of beauty and the beast,</v>

207
00:07:46.821 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 2>although they didn't use that as a reference that the female pornographic</v>

208
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 2>fantasy was wild guy.</v>

209
00:07:52.510 --> 00:07:53.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

210
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:53.720
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

211
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 2>somewhat careless about the wants and desires of others,</v>

212
00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.980
<v Speaker 2>attractive to everyone.</v>

213
00:07:57.981 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 2>Therefore High Status Tamed by the Magic of a single woman and brought into a</v>

214
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:03.350
<v Speaker 2>relationship with her.</v>

215
00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.071
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

216
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:04.371
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

217
00:08:04.371 --> 00:08:05.660
<v Speaker 2>but here's the comical part.</v>

218
00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 2>This just made me laugh,</v>

219
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:07.131
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

220
00:08:07.131 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

221
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:12.790
<v Speaker 2>why were the five categories of most desirable male entity used most broadly and</v>

222
00:08:13.461 --> 00:08:14.600
<v Speaker 2>female pornography?</v>

223
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:15.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

224
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:16.310
<v Speaker 2>it's so embarrassing.</v>

225
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:16.581
<v Speaker 2>Women,</v>

226
00:08:16.581 --> 00:08:17.660
<v Speaker 2>you have to cover your head.</v>

227
00:08:17.661 --> 00:08:17.841
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

228
00:08:17.841 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I say this because vampire,</v>

229
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:26.980
<v Speaker 2>we're both billionaire surgeon and pirate.</v>

230
00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:37.843
<v Speaker 3>All</v>

231
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.263
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

232
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Another question.</v>
