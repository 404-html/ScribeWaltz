1
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the September version of my Q and A's.</v>

2
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.750
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3
00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much for tuning in again.</v>

4
00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:24.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

5
00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.830
<v Speaker 1>hopefully we'll have an interesting discussion tonight.</v>

6
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>I want to stop start that is with a demonstration of some new newly managed</v>

7
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker 1>technical wizardry.</v>

8
00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>I have a program that I developed with my colleagues that I want to talk to you</v>

9
00:00:40.341 --> 00:00:41.960
<v Speaker 1>guys about for just a few seconds.</v>

10
00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Some of you already know about this called self authoring and self authoring</v>

11
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.770
<v Speaker 1>helps people write about their past to guide it autobiography,</v>

12
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.550
<v Speaker 1>that's the past authoring program and to write about their virtues and their</v>

13
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:53.001
<v Speaker 1>faults.</v>

14
00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:57.620
<v Speaker 1>That's there's to present offering programs and a future authoring program that</v>

15
00:00:57.621 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>helps people write out a vision and a destination,</v>

16
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:06.311
<v Speaker 1>let's say an ethical destination for their lives as well as formulate a plan to</v>

17
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.500
<v Speaker 1>put that vision into,</v>

18
00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 1>to make that vision into reality.</v>

19
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.000
<v Speaker 1>And our experimental investigations have indicated,</v>

20
00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:14.661
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

21
00:01:14.661 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker 1>that university students who complete this program,</v>

22
00:01:17.451 --> 00:01:18.770
<v Speaker 1>even if they do it badly,</v>

23
00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 1>and I would recommend at least doing it badly,</v>

24
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.790
<v Speaker 1>increase their probability of staying at university by about 30% and it has a</v>

25
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>positive effect on their grade point average as well.</v>

26
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>So there's a fair bit of evidence that your personality is organized at the</v>

27
00:01:33.141 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>highest level through articulated speech.</v>

28
00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Some of that you can formulate internally by thinking and some of it you have to</v>

29
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:39.650
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

30
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.730
<v Speaker 1>you can do by writing.</v>

31
00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.280
<v Speaker 1>You also do that in discussion with other people.</v>

32
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>But these programs are designed to break down the problem of articulating your</v>

33
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 1>life in the past,</v>

34
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>present and future into a series of steps that are at least in principle</v>

35
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.290
<v Speaker 1>manageable and uh,</v>

36
00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

37
00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people have done them and I think they're very helpful programs and</v>

38
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

39
00:02:00.891 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>we spent a lot of time perfecting them,</v>

40
00:02:03.621 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 1>I suppose to the degree that they are perfected.</v>

41
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.321
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

42
00:02:06.321 --> 00:02:07.154
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

43
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>here's the high tech part of this.</v>

44
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.280
<v Speaker 1>You see that's the website self authoring.com and I've put a coupon together.</v>

45
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

46
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>the coupon name is September.</v>

47
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you have to enter for this coupon.</v>

48
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.000
<v Speaker 1>And that gives you a 20% discount at self authoring.</v>

49
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.841
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

50
00:02:26.841 --> 00:02:31.841
<v Speaker 1>and now all this is even more high tech because this marker is in a different</v>

51
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:32.714
<v Speaker 1>color.</v>

52
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Speaker 1>And this program is a personality test based on the big five aspect scale,</v>

53
00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:43.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a scale that calling the young one of my students developed when he</v>

54
00:02:43.911 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>worked in my lab along with Lena quilty.</v>

55
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.510
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

56
00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.040
<v Speaker 1>the big five aspects scale offers you a five dimensional readout of your</v>

58
00:02:52.041 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>personality,</v>

59
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.631
<v Speaker 1>extroversion,</v>

60
00:02:53.631 --> 00:02:54.291
<v Speaker 1>neuroticism,</v>

61
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:54.891
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

62
00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:56.300
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness and openness.</v>

63
00:02:56.301 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>The classic big five and minute breaks each of the factors of the traits into</v>

64
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:01.481
<v Speaker 1>two aspects.</v>

65
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:05.530
<v Speaker 1>So you get a high resolution map of your personality that takes the test,</v>

66
00:03:05.531 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>takes about a hundred questions,</v>

67
00:03:07.001 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>takes about 15 minutes to do and you'll learn about yourself.</v>

68
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll learn interesting things.</v>

69
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:16.480
<v Speaker 1>I had my kids do repeated iterations of the big five aspects scale when they</v>

70
00:03:16.481 --> 00:03:17.201
<v Speaker 1>were teenagers.</v>

71
00:03:17.201 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And I learned a lot about them even though I thought I knew them quite well.</v>

72
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>I learned things that were very useful.</v>

73
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.804
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

74
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

75
00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>you can do that and maybe you'll understand yourself a little bit better.</v>

76
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.783
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

77
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.380
<v Speaker 1>this is the site</v>

78
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.600
<v Speaker 1>and the coupon is September just as it was for self authoring</v>

79
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.250
<v Speaker 1>and that's 20% as well.</v>

80
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.730
<v Speaker 1>And you'll see that amazingly enough,</v>

81
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 1>this advertisement I suppose,</v>

82
00:03:57.041 --> 00:03:57.940
<v Speaker 1>which is what it is,</v>

83
00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>is in purple instead of blue.</v>

84
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 1>And so that's another technological miracle brought to you by the Internet and</v>

85
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>the intelligence of modern human beings.</v>

86
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>So all right,</v>

87
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:10.990
<v Speaker 1>so we've dispensed with that.</v>

88
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's self authoring and understand myself and you might find those useful</v>

89
00:04:15.791 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>and I hope you do so onto more,</v>

90
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:20.903
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.350
<v Speaker 1>fall on different things.</v>

92
00:04:23.351 --> 00:04:27.070
<v Speaker 1>I guess I just got back to Toronto yesterday,</v>

93
00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I think it was yesterday.</v>

94
00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>I was out in western Canada.</v>

95
00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.330
<v Speaker 1>I went to a family reunion on Vancouver Island and then a,</v>

96
00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>a reunion of sorts as well in Saskatchewan with my side of the family and a</v>

97
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>finished the talk and Regina and Saskatoon as well,</v>

98
00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 1>which seemed to be relatively well received.</v>

99
00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>So hurray for that.</v>

100
00:04:47.861 --> 00:04:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I've really enjoyed all these lectures that I've been giving.</v>

101
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.073
<v Speaker 1>And Tammy and I,</v>

102
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.230
<v Speaker 1>Tammy's my wife,</v>

103
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.680
<v Speaker 1>we visited 65 cities now on this tour and we're starting again on September 5th</v>

104
00:04:59.561 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 1>we're going to go down the eastern seaboard.</v>

105
00:05:01.091 --> 00:05:02.240
<v Speaker 1>There's 20 cities in,</v>

106
00:05:02.241 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 1>in the northeastern us.</v>

107
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 1>And then we're off to Europe for another 15 cities or so.</v>

108
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.180
<v Speaker 1>And then in February I think we're going to go to Australia.</v>

109
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And then in March and April back to Europe.</v>

110
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:14.830
<v Speaker 1>And then in May,</v>

111
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to spend four months diligently finishing up what I hope to be my next</v>

112
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:21.641
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

113
00:05:21.641 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>if assuming that I can get that done in that period of time.</v>

114
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>And also that other opportunities,</v>

115
00:05:27.551 --> 00:05:28.001
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

116
00:05:28.001 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>or distractions don't rear their head either positively or negatively.</v>

117
00:05:31.871 --> 00:05:32.950
<v Speaker 1>And who knows,</v>

118
00:05:32.951 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

119
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.680
<v Speaker 1>Because life is a very uncertain business.</v>

120
00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.800
<v Speaker 1>I've really enjoyed the lecture tour a lot.</v>

121
00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:40.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

122
00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

123
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 1>I've been speaking to audiences of about 2,500 to 3000 people and mostly about</v>

124
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

125
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say mostly about the nexus,</v>

126
00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between meaning and responsibility,</v>

127
00:05:53.651 --> 00:05:57.830
<v Speaker 1>trying to make the case that because life is difficult as everyone with any</v>

128
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>sense knows.</v>

129
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 1>And because we can make that worse with our own stupidity and malevolence that</v>

130
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.770
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to find a sustaining meaning in life.</v>

131
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>And my sense is,</v>

132
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>and I think people tend to agree to this,</v>

133
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:16.001
<v Speaker 1>is that the most sustaining meaning can be found a and the adoption of voluntary</v>

134
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

135
00:06:17.601 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>So in attempts to decrease the suffering in life and to do things that are</v>

136
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile and admirable and to take care of yourself individually and your</v>

137
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:27.171
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

138
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>and to have a little bit leftover for your community and to have goodwill across</v>

139
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:35.380
<v Speaker 1>all those dimensions if you can possibly manage it despite the fact that there's</v>

140
00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 1>something in life to make people relatively bitter.</v>

141
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.133
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

142
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.193
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

143
00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>as well the necessity of conducting yourself in a truthful manner.</v>

144
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

145
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>making also the case to my listeners,</v>

146
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:53.321
<v Speaker 1>I suppose that that one of the most ancient presuppositions that underlies the</v>

147
00:06:53.781 --> 00:06:55.460
<v Speaker 1>structure of Western civilization,</v>

148
00:06:55.461 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>which is a very functional civilization in my estimation,</v>

149
00:06:58.911 --> 00:07:01.550
<v Speaker 1>is the idea derived from genesis,</v>

150
00:07:01.551 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 1>that truthful speech,</v>

151
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 1>if you confront truthful speech,</v>

152
00:07:06.351 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 1>if you confront potential,</v>

153
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>the chaos and potential that is in front of you with truthful speech,</v>

154
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>that you engender the order that is good.</v>

155
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's a fundamental ethical dictum.</v>

156
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:17.301
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

157
00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:17.631
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

158
00:07:17.631 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a presupposition in some sense that the order that you bring into existence</v>

159
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.900
<v Speaker 1>in all the choices that you make will be the best possible order in proportion</v>

160
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:30.110
<v Speaker 1>to the degree that you conduct yourself in a truthful manner.</v>

161
00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.060
<v Speaker 1>And so those ideas seem to be falling on very receptive ears and they are the</v>

162
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:39.710
<v Speaker 1>most resilient ideas that I think I've ever come across.</v>

163
00:07:39.711 --> 00:07:40.011
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

164
00:07:40.011 --> 00:07:44.720
<v Speaker 1>I always take an ice pick and a hammer to any idea that I encounter and I really</v>

165
00:07:44.721 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>do that diligently because I don't want to rely on ideas that can fall apart and</v>

166
00:07:48.891 --> 00:07:49.221
<v Speaker 1>break,</v>

167
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 1>especially when they're stressed.</v>

168
00:07:50.571 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 1>And I don't see,</v>

169
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:52.790
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

170
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>I haven't come across ideas that are more solid than that.</v>

171
00:07:56.391 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

172
00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>the first proposition,</v>

173
00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you know that life is suffering and that we make it worse with our malevolence.</v>

174
00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone understands that to be true.</v>

175
00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 1>But the second is that the best way to confront that is to shoulder</v>

176
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.920
<v Speaker 1>responsibility voluntarily and to live in truth.</v>

177
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 1>I think those are even more powerful ideas because you could say that the cure</v>

178
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:20.990
<v Speaker 1>for a malaise or the treatment for a disease is more powerful than the Malaysia</v>

179
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Malays or the disease itself.</v>

180
00:08:22.881 --> 00:08:27.860
<v Speaker 1>And If responsibility and truth are antidotes to suffering and malevolence,</v>

181
00:08:27.861 --> 00:08:30.170
<v Speaker 1>then that means that they're there.</v>

182
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.210
<v Speaker 1>They have a power that's transcendent over suffering and malevolence and you</v>

183
00:08:35.211 --> 00:08:35.361
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

184
00:08:35.361 --> 00:08:35.571
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

185
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:37.070
<v Speaker 1>it's a very pessimistic viewpoint.</v>

186
00:08:37.071 --> 00:08:37.671
<v Speaker 1>And the one hand,</v>

187
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:42.110
<v Speaker 1>because I'm stressing for everybody that is coming to listen to me talk,</v>

188
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the fact that life has an inalienable element of difficulty and,</v>

189
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.190
<v Speaker 1>and travail and suffering and all of that,</v>

190
00:08:49.191 --> 00:08:52.280
<v Speaker 1>and you certainly see that sort of thing when you go to a family reunion.</v>

191
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:52.551
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

192
00:08:52.551 --> 00:08:54.440
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of my relatives,</v>

193
00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>my parents' generation,</v>

194
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:56.251
<v Speaker 1>they're getting,</v>

195
00:08:56.251 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 1>all of my parents are in their eighties now and,</v>

196
00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:58.921
<v Speaker 1>and their friends,</v>

197
00:08:58.921 --> 00:08:59.371
<v Speaker 1>some of the,</v>

198
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 1>they have friends that are older and everyone's starting to suffer from the</v>

199
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:06.690
<v Speaker 1>inevitable deterioration that's associated with old age.</v>

200
00:09:06.691 --> 00:09:07.291
<v Speaker 1>And it's very,</v>

201
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 1>very trying and very difficult for people.</v>

202
00:09:09.391 --> 00:09:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

203
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>it's in those situations that you see more clearly the fragility of life and</v>

204
00:09:15.211 --> 00:09:17.010
<v Speaker 1>also the importance of having,</v>

205
00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:17.933
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

206
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.410
<v Speaker 1>having a family that's functional and people around you that love you and all</v>

207
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:26.340
<v Speaker 1>those things that in principle can help sustain you through difficult times.</v>

208
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

209
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm here in Toronto for about 10 days,</v>

210
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.700
<v Speaker 1>got a lot of media interviews again partly to discuss the upcoming talks.</v>

211
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.133
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

212
00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:44.150
<v Speaker 1>my book 12 rules for life still appears to be selling extraordinarily well.</v>

213
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

214
00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:45.503
<v Speaker 1>it's quite</v>

215
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:47.701
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

216
00:09:47.701 --> 00:09:48.900
<v Speaker 1>All things considered.</v>

217
00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.960
<v Speaker 1>It's approaching 2 million sales in,</v>

218
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.480
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

219
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.740
<v Speaker 1>in the English version.</v>

220
00:09:53.741 --> 00:09:54.574
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

221
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:57.390
<v Speaker 1>there are foreign versions coming out all the time.</v>

222
00:09:57.870 --> 00:09:58.703
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

223
00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:00.420
<v Speaker 1>and I've also,</v>

224
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm also in the process of putting together the final arrangements for my next</v>

225
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:06.631
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

226
00:10:06.631 --> 00:10:07.500
<v Speaker 1>which I talked about.</v>

227
00:10:07.501 --> 00:10:08.820
<v Speaker 1>So the plan is to,</v>

228
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.510
<v Speaker 1>to write,</v>

229
00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 1>I'm writing that now.</v>

230
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:11.730
<v Speaker 1>I've got it about half written,</v>

231
00:10:11.731 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe a little bit more expanding on the themes that I developed in 12 rules for</v>

232
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:19.800
<v Speaker 1>life and also extending them as much as I possibly can.</v>

233
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.053
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

234
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and I hope to continue writing during this period of touring as well so that I</v>

235
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:30.150
<v Speaker 1>can stay on top of my deadlines and then from May to September to spend most of</v>

236
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 1>that time finalizing and editing and polishing and all of that.</v>

237
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.800
<v Speaker 1>And then hopefully the book is due in September and the current plan is to spend</v>

238
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:41.610
<v Speaker 1>September through December,</v>

239
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:42.870
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

240
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.550
<v Speaker 1>likely concentrating on a return to the biblical lectures starting with exodus,</v>

241
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 1>which is something I'm really looking forward to but haven't really been able to</v>

242
00:10:51.091 --> 00:10:51.924
<v Speaker 1>turn my hand to.</v>

243
00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 1>The other thing I'm really thinking hard about doing,</v>

244
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to do a series of lectures and I don't know if I could do them publicly</v>

245
00:10:58.141 --> 00:10:58.471
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

246
00:10:58.471 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>but I might be able to finagle that in some manner.</v>

247
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:05.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to do a series of lectures on the sacred icons of the radical left.</v>

248
00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:11.100
<v Speaker 1>So I'd like to do a lecture series on marks and Fuco and Derrida,</v>

249
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 1>and then some,</v>

250
00:11:12.210 --> 00:11:13.860
<v Speaker 1>some of the famous feminist too,</v>

251
00:11:13.861 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 1>like Betty for Dan whose work I'm not a fan of,</v>

252
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

253
00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 1>for a variety of reasons and do Judith Butler as well.</v>

254
00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.340
<v Speaker 1>But I'd really like to concentrate on marks.</v>

255
00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:24.211
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

256
00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:25.044
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

257
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.700
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I might duty for you guys tonight or two you have,</v>

258
00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.690
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I might do to you tonight is I found a poem by Karl Marx that</v>

259
00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 1>is extraordinarily interesting and that might be worth reading if I can.</v>

260
00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.800
<v Speaker 1>I just thought about doing that,</v>

261
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 1>if I can scrape it up in time.</v>

262
00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:47.070
<v Speaker 1>So let me just check very quickly and see if I can find it and then I'll get to</v>

263
00:11:47.071 --> 00:11:47.731
<v Speaker 1>some questions.</v>

264
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:48.511
<v Speaker 1>Because after all,</v>

265
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>this is a Q and a,</v>

266
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:51.143
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

267
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the theory.</v>

268
00:11:53.460 --> 00:11:53.910
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
