00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I realized that a belief system was</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a set of moral guidelines</v>

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.840
<v Speaker 1>and moral guidelines are guidelines</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how you should behave.</v>

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you should perceive,</v>

4
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>and the reason that a moral guideline is</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary for you to perceive is that</v>

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you can't look at anything without a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy of value,</v>

6
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it like how many things in</v>

7
00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>this room could you look out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's an in innumerable things in this</v>

8
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>room to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just all this squares,</v>

9
00:00:32.311 --> 00:00:36.000
<v Speaker 1>the little tiny squares in this fabric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could look at those things for till</v>

10
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>the end of time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one at a time,</v>

11
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>but you don't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

12
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:44.610
<v Speaker 1>if I took most of you out of this room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very low probability that</v>

13
00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:46.500
<v Speaker 1>you'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be able to tell me what color the</v>

14
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.650
<v Speaker 1>walls were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even if those things were on the</v>

15
00:00:49.651 --> 00:00:50.484
<v Speaker 1>walls.</v>

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that who</v>
<v Speaker 1>cares?</v>

17
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.680
<v Speaker 1>As long as the walls don't move,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colors irrelevant,</v>

18
00:00:58.681 --> 00:01:00.480
<v Speaker 1>and there's no reason for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember it.</v>

19
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.440
<v Speaker 1>It has no emotional significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has no value.</v>

20
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>And so what you do instead is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.680
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why are you here?</v>

22
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Do I don't mean in the broad</v>
<v Speaker 1>metaphysical sense?</v>

23
00:01:14.701 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are you here right now?</v>

24
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.631
<v Speaker 1>And I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

25
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you're a students obviously and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get a degree and you know,</v>

26
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 1>you believe that that will have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional utility.</v>

27
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you'll be a little wiser and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little more literate and a little and be</v>

28
00:01:30.061 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>able to think a little better and be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to write a little better.</v>

29
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.010
<v Speaker 1>And so you'll actually be more</v>
<v Speaker 1>functional in the world.</v>

30
00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>That would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

31
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and maybe you're interested in,</v>

32
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.960
<v Speaker 1>but anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

33
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.830
<v Speaker 1>you're in this particular lecture so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can take this particular class</v>

34
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.550
<v Speaker 1>so that you can get a particular kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>degree so that you can launch your life.</v>

35
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And then in your life you're probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to meet someone that you have a</v>

36
00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 1>longterm relationship with and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have children and you're going</v>

37
00:01:57.091 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>to partake in the society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you're here.</v>

38
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>All of those reasons simultaneously is</v>
<v Speaker 1>why you're here.</v>

39
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>And so then that helps you decide what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at.</v>

40
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.760
<v Speaker 1>And so what you look at is at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

41
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.510
<v Speaker 1>or listen to is me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in principle,</v>

42
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm the gateway to that set of</v>
<v Speaker 1>accomplishments at this moment.</v>

43
00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.260
<v Speaker 1>And so you focus on me and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you value that.</v>

44
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.710
<v Speaker 1>And so what that means.</v>
