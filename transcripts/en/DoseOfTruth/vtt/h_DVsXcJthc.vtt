00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>Joseph's father is Jacob and Jacob is the patriarch of Israel,</v>

2
00:00:12.641 --> 00:00:15.220
<v Speaker 1>essentially that the father of the 12 tribes.</v>

3
00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

5
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.811
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

6
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>you might remember that,</v>

7
00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:20.943
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.420
<v Speaker 1>he had a very morally</v>

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>ambivalent halfway through life.</v>

10
00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's one of the things that I think so interesting about the stories in the,</v>

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament is that</v>

12
00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>these so-called patriarchal figures are very realistic.</v>

13
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:48.450
<v Speaker 1>And it's something that I was also being struck by that accounts in the new</v>

14
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:49.350
<v Speaker 1>testament that way.</v>

15
00:00:49.351 --> 00:00:54.351
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of things that Christ does that you'd think would have been edited</v>

16
00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.510
<v Speaker 1>out over time and sanitize,</v>

17
00:00:56.511 --> 00:00:57.191
<v Speaker 1>but they're not.</v>

18
00:00:57.191 --> 00:01:00.010
<v Speaker 1>And the Old Testament is definitely not a book that's been sanitized.</v>

19
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

20
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.500
<v Speaker 1>it's quite interesting that that's the case.</v>

21
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.800
<v Speaker 1>So you sort of see people with all their flaws and I've been trying to also</v>

22
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.060
<v Speaker 1>derive some general conclusions about</v>

23
00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.910
<v Speaker 1>the moral of the story of the genesis stories and um,</v>

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>because these stories are fundamentally moral and moral as far as I'm concerned,</v>

25
00:01:21.791 --> 00:01:22.830
<v Speaker 1>it has to do with action,</v>

26
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

27
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.100
<v Speaker 1>Because moral decisions are the decisions that you make when you're structuring</v>

28
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.941
<v Speaker 1>action.</v>

29
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>When you decide to do one thing or another,</v>

30
00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>generally want to do things that are the best things that you can think of to do</v>

31
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.180
<v Speaker 1>and hence good.</v>

32
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.210
<v Speaker 1>But sometimes you also want to do things that are the worst things you can do.</v>

33
00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.541
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

34
00:01:41.541 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>because you're angry or resentful or bitter.</v>

35
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.130
<v Speaker 1>And so the moral decisions that you make that govern your actions are really the</v>

36
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:51.260
<v Speaker 1>most important decisions that you make in your life.</v>

37
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>And it's not that easy to figure out how to make moral decisions.</v>

38
00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.050
<v Speaker 1>We don't have an unerring</v>

39
00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>technology for that the same way as we do for say,</v>

40
00:02:02.081 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>making decisions about empirical reality,</v>

41
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>which in some ways seem a lot simpler.</v>

42
00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:08.293
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>partly because we can work collectively at it,</v>

44
00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:13.210
<v Speaker 1>partly because we have a rigorous methodology for deciding what's true and</v>

45
00:02:13.211 --> 00:02:14.044
<v Speaker 1>what's not.</v>

46
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.190
<v Speaker 1>So one of the things that's really struck me,</v>

47
00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>like it's an overarching theme,</v>

48
00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I would say that emerges out of genesis,</v>

49
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>especially after the really ancient stories,</v>

50
00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:25.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.343
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

52
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>especially after the stories of Cain and Abel and Noah and</v>

53
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>the Tower of Babel.</v>

54
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.450
<v Speaker 1>When you get to the accounts of the historically or historically real people,</v>

55
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.080
<v Speaker 1>one injunction seems to be get the hell out there and do something.</v>

56
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.401
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

57
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

58
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>one of the major themes for all of the Patriarchs that we've talked about,</v>

59
00:02:55.411 --> 00:02:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Abraham say Jacob and Joseph is</v>

60
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>move out into the world regardless of the circumstances at hand.</v>

61
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Now that's in,</v>

62
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 1>in in the Old Testament stories that's basically portrayed as hearkening to the</v>

63
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:13.120
<v Speaker 1>voice of God.</v>

64
00:03:13.121 --> 00:03:13.871
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

65
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:17.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you could think about that as destiny or a psychological calling.</v>

66
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.423
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

67
00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.070
<v Speaker 1>and the funny thing too is,</v>

68
00:03:20.071 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>is that it's not that these people have an easy time of it when they heed that</v>

69
00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:24.514
<v Speaker 1>call.</v>

70
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.031
<v Speaker 1>So what's,</v>

71
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 1>what's fascinating is that they often run into extreme difficulties right away.</v>

72
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's very interesting.</v>

73
00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:33.611
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

74
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:37.330
<v Speaker 1>because life is obviously full of extreme difficulties.</v>

75
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.793
<v Speaker 1>And second,</v>

76
00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.010
<v Speaker 1>it's another example of the failure to sugarcoat things,</v>

77
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the things that I think makes a mockery of anti religious</v>

78
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:48.730
<v Speaker 1>theories that are even quite sophisticated,</v>

79
00:03:48.731 --> 00:03:48.911
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

80
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:49.770
<v Speaker 1>like Freud,</v>

81
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Freud thought of religion as a,</v>

82
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 1>as a wish fulfillment essentially.</v>

83
00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.410
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

84
00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.160
<v Speaker 1>and also marked who thought about religion as the opiate of the masses.</v>

85
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.800
<v Speaker 1>It's if those were true,</v>

86
00:04:02.801 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that there'd be a lot more wish and a lot less reality,</v>

87
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>a lot less stark,</v>

88
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>harsh reality.</v>

89
00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:10.090
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

90
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

91
00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.390
<v Speaker 1>the first thing that Abraham encounters is a famine and then he has to hide his</v>

92
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:17.890
<v Speaker 1>wife and then he,</v>

93
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>he basically journeys into a tyranny.</v>

94
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.040
<v Speaker 1>So that's about as bad as it gets in some ways.</v>

95
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>And those themes re recur continually.</v>

96
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>And no one ever lives where they're supposed to live.</v>

97
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>They leave in live in Canaan and not the promised land.</v>

98
00:04:32.081 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a pretty rough,</v>

99
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a pretty rough series of stories.</v>

100
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 1>But the fundamental idea is something like,</v>

101
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no time for sitting around.</v>

102
00:04:42.221 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>There's time to go out into the world and engage.</v>
