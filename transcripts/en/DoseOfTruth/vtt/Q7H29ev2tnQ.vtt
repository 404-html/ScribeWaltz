00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:07.923
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

2
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.900
<v Speaker 1>now I talked to you about these fingers before and I was trying to make,</v>

3
00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:17.291
<v Speaker 1>so here's,</v>

4
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.800
<v Speaker 1>here's kind of an overview of what I'm attempting to describe to you.</v>

5
00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:21.700
<v Speaker 1>So one,</v>

6
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.360
<v Speaker 1>there's one category of representation that has to do with the territory that</v>

7
00:00:25.361 --> 00:00:29.860
<v Speaker 1>you inhabit and that you understand that's primarily social territory and it</v>

8
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>tends to be symbolized by masculine and usually like older male symbols.</v>

9
00:00:34.741 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>So that's the patriarchal structure.</v>

10
00:00:36.431 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I really think what it is is a,</v>

11
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>it's a personified representation of the dominance hierarchy structure.</v>

12
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

13
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.740
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

14
00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.120
<v Speaker 1>if remember the lion king,</v>

15
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:47.470
<v Speaker 1>you know the pride rock thing.</v>

16
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>So the pride rock has sort of associated with the,</v>

17
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:51.700
<v Speaker 1>with the symbols father.</v>

18
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.073
<v Speaker 1>And so that's,</v>

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.140
<v Speaker 1>that's that category of symbol is the symbol that I'm talking about.</v>

20
00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:57.070
<v Speaker 1>So he used that,</v>

21
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.450
<v Speaker 1>that high place on the mountain as an indicator of dominance structure.</v>

22
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.870
<v Speaker 1>You saw that at the opening of the lion king movie where all the animals come,</v>

23
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.040
<v Speaker 1>they gather around,</v>

24
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>they all bow before the,</v>

25
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.340
<v Speaker 1>the rock with the king on top of it.</v>

26
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.151
<v Speaker 1>And the king,</v>

27
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>like the lion is a symbol,</v>

28
00:01:11.471 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>generally a symbol of something like solar power because the lion is a top</v>

29
00:01:15.701 --> 00:01:16.181
<v Speaker 1>Predator,</v>

30
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:19.630
<v Speaker 1>it's apex Predator and it lives in Africa under the sun.</v>

31
00:01:19.631 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Speaker 1>And it has a main that sort of like a son.</v>

32
00:01:21.641 --> 00:01:26.110
<v Speaker 1>And then later in the lion king will actually see this today you'll see the,</v>

33
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>the Father Lion Mufasa,</v>

34
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.513
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

35
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>he appears in the sky with a solar halo around him.</v>

36
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

37
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.090
<v Speaker 1>so that's the masculine category.</v>

38
00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And then the feminine category I told you a little about a bit about is a more</v>

39
00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:42.880
<v Speaker 1>chaotic category and it's a,</v>

40
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>it's a chaotic and plastic category out of which new forms emerge.</v>

41
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.470
<v Speaker 1>And then one of the categories that we haven't talked about is the category of</v>

42
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 1>the individual and the individual is the hero and hero stories and is the</v>

43
00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:56.590
<v Speaker 1>initiate an initiatory routines.</v>

44
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.010
<v Speaker 1>And so the hero is the person who is attempting to become a complete biological</v>

45
00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:08.101
<v Speaker 1>and historical entity personality so that they're capable not only of,</v>

46
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

47
00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

48
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.923
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>adopting independent existence,</v>

50
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 1>but if adopting independent existence that's productive and that's productive in</v>

51
00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:20.620
<v Speaker 1>a way that's also a benefit to the community.</v>

52
00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:25.330
<v Speaker 1>So it's a particular pattern of development and that that needs to be catalyzed</v>

53
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 1>by human societies because in order for a society to,</v>

54
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.340
<v Speaker 1>to maintain its structure and for the people within it to thrive,</v>

55
00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.540
<v Speaker 1>the developing individuals have to mature to the point where they can take care</v>

56
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:40.780
<v Speaker 1>of themselves in a way that doesn't disrupt the whole social structure.</v>

57
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.370
<v Speaker 1>And so that's the path.</v>

58
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.380
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural path for human beings.</v>

59
00:02:44.381 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say to some degree,</v>

60
00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:47.980
<v Speaker 1>because we're such intensely social creatures,</v>

61
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.900
<v Speaker 1>but because we're also quite malleable and complex and also grounded in history</v>

62
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 1>and cultural creatures,</v>

63
00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>it's also something that has to be taught both from the perspective of</v>

64
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.220
<v Speaker 1>invitation and explicitly.</v>
