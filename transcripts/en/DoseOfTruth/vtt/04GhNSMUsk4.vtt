1
00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.120
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that the only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you're healthy and energetic,</v>

2
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to be successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's very hard to be successful</v>

3
00:00:06.331 --> 00:00:10.170
<v Speaker 1>if you're ill obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean so because the competition is</v>

4
00:00:10.171 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>just too high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And both,</v>

5
00:00:11.731 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>both genders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both sexes select each other for</v>

6
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:16.050
<v Speaker 1>attractiveness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both select for intelligence,</v>

7
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:19.590
<v Speaker 1>both at select for personality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although the different,</v>

8
00:00:19.591 --> 00:00:22.590
<v Speaker 1>there are differences there in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's what stressed.</v>

9
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

10
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>so I think you can derive a couple of</v>
<v Speaker 1>things out of out of this.</v>

11
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.240
<v Speaker 1>And this is where I think people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>different than,</v>

12
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>than other animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Importantly different is that,</v>

13
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.120
<v Speaker 1>so you imagine that there's tremendous</v>
<v Speaker 1>selection pressure to,</v>

14
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towards the production,</v>

15
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>let's say of men who are good at</v>
<v Speaker 1>climbing male dominance hierarchies or</v>

16
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>are climbing the male dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

17
00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's so interesting</v>
<v Speaker 1>about people is that we've multiplied</v>

18
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>our dominance hierarchies.</v>

19
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take an animal that's got a</v>

20
00:00:53.341 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>rather static behavioral pattern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's,</v>

21
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>there's a single hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elephant seals are a good example of</v>

22
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So elephant seals,</v>

23
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:03.120
<v Speaker 1>the males are absolutely massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're way,</v>

24
00:01:03.121 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>way bigger than the females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they basically have harems roughly</v>

25
00:01:06.571 --> 00:01:10.830
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they use physical prowess as their</v>

26
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 1>marker of status essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And obviously size is a huge part of</v>

27
00:01:14.551 --> 00:01:17.170
<v Speaker 1>that because otherwise the male elephant</v>
<v Speaker 1>seals wouldn't be as,</v>

28
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>they're massive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These things are absolutely enormous.</v>

29
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just power slash health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe aggression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

31
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.280
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever makes them more um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suitable for the kind of physical combat</v>

32
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.250
<v Speaker 1>that elephant seals engage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

33
00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.720
<v Speaker 1>and the degree to which power is</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with dominance status in</v>

34
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:44.940
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of situations seems to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with the size differential</v>

35
00:01:44.941 --> 00:01:49.800
<v Speaker 1>between males and females.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more power is an issue with</v>

36
00:01:49.801 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>regards to male competence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the larger the bales are compared to the</v>

37
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:56.250
<v Speaker 1>females and the more likely the males</v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to have a harem relationship</v>

38
00:01:56.251 --> 00:01:57.084
<v Speaker 1>with the females.</v>

39
00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>And you see that a little bit in human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings because men are bigger than</v>

40
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.550
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not overwhelmingly bigger.</v>

41
00:02:02.551 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>That's sexual dimorphism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

42
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>there's some men that are smaller than</v>
<v Speaker 1>some women,</v>

43
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>but on average men are tolerant there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have more upper body strength and</v>

44
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there is a power element to male</v>

45
00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as extended as it would be</v>

46
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>among animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say like,</v>

47
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 1>like elephant seals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the elephant seal you see maybe</v>

48
00:02:20.551 --> 00:02:25.551
<v Speaker 1>there's one stable set of traits that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>being selected for that makes the males</v>

49
00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:28.500
<v Speaker 1>more likely to reproduce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But human beings,</v>

50
00:02:28.501 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>we're very weird creatures because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>so conceptually flexible.</v>

51
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:37.551
<v Speaker 1>And so what seems to have happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we started males started selecting</v>

52
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>each other for don in dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitions for something like</v>

53
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>cognitive flexibility and</v>
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

54
00:02:44.071 --> 00:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the ability to</v>

55
00:02:48.091 --> 00:02:51.570
<v Speaker 1>abstractly represent the world and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to operate effectively</v>

56
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 1>within it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to represent yourself socially in a way.</v>

57
00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>And then to carry through with that</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that enables people to trust</v>

58
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:58.860
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's something like,</v>

59
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.010
<v Speaker 1>and so that produced cortical expansion</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then women were selecting men who</v>

60
00:03:05.521 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>are good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that produce cortical expansion.</v>

61
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>And then there's an arms race between</v>
<v Speaker 1>women and men with regards to</v>

62
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the women kept up or they certainly</v>

63
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:16.200
<v Speaker 1>kept up with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

64
00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>with intelligence as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the evolutionary cycle continued.</v>

65
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 1>But one of the consequences of selection</v>
<v Speaker 1>for cortical expansion and increased</v>

66
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 1>cognitive flexibility was that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>number of dominance hierarchies that</v>

67
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.420
<v Speaker 1>human beings could produce started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiply,</v>

68
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's all sorts of ways that</v>

69
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:39.400
<v Speaker 1>you can be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's you think about how many ways</v>

70
00:03:39.401 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 1>you can be successful in a modern</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture and and you can be successful in</v>

71
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.670
<v Speaker 1>dimensions that aren't really even</v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with each other.</v>

72
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>So you can be successful socially that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what an extrovert would do.</v>

73
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 1>You could be successful in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate relationships.</v>

74
00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what a agreeable person would do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A disagreeable person would be more</v>

75
00:03:56.201 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>successful with regards to competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A person who's high in neuroticism would</v>

76
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:02.440
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be tried to protect themselves and</v>

77
00:04:02.441 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>to establish some sort of security and</v>
<v Speaker 1>open person would be looking for a</v>

78
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:10.020
<v Speaker 1>flexible creative environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this multiplicity of,</v>

79
00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 1>of ways that you can establish a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy and be successful in</v>

80
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're creative,</v>

81
00:04:16.361 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>you can come up with your own damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchy,</v>

82
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're creative,</v>

83
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:21.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

84
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.610
<v Speaker 1>you spin up a game that's your game and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you,</v>

85
00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>you make the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard because if you make a</v>

86
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:29.500
<v Speaker 1>new game with new rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's hard to monetize it,</v>

87
00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.290
<v Speaker 1>but you can be the best at playing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

88
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.860
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a huge advantage to being</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative if you can pull it off.</v>

89
00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:37.300
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

90
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:42.250
<v Speaker 1>what's happened among human beings is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the multiplication of the set of</v>

91
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:45.220
<v Speaker 1>possible dominance hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's become very broad.</v>

92
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.570
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

93
00:04:46.571 --> 00:04:48.550
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's driving selection now is the</v>

94
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>ability to be successful across multiple</v>
<v Speaker 1>sets of dominance,</v>

95
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that accounts,</v>

96
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:54.910
<v Speaker 1>at least in part for our cognitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility.</v>

97
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really what a human being</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

98
00:04:57.041 --> 00:05:01.570
<v Speaker 1>A human being is a creature that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>high potential for succeeding across a</v>

99
00:05:01.571 --> 00:05:04.510
<v Speaker 1>very wide range of potential human</v>
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies.</v>

100
00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>And so that gives us our transformative</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche.</v>

101
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:11.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the niche that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the niche that we've both</v>

102
00:05:11.291 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>produced and occupy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's out of that,</v>

103
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>that hero mythology emerges</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally because I think what the</v>

104
00:05:17.621 --> 00:05:19.930
<v Speaker 1>hero is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mythological hero is a</v>

105
00:05:19.931 --> 00:05:24.400
<v Speaker 1>representation of that part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psyche that's particularly good at being</v>

106
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>successful across sets of dominance</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies.</v>

107
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very biological way of thinking about</v>

108
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:32.650
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought about this for a long</v>

109
00:05:32.651 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any way that that just can't</v>

110
00:05:35.591 --> 00:05:37.750
<v Speaker 1>be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how else,</v>

111
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:42.840
<v Speaker 1>how else could it work if we had a fixed</v>
<v Speaker 1>behavioral pattern like beavers,</v>

112
00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you know you're the most successful</v>
<v Speaker 1>beaver.</v>

113
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.130
<v Speaker 1>If you build the best damn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like fine.</v>

114
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Then you know what's going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>selected for it.</v>

115
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what people are like and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also why we're so multipurpose.</v>

116
00:05:52.511 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>You know we have hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's a hand for?</v>

117
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.900
<v Speaker 1>What's the evolutionary of a hand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you,</v>

118
00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:01.850
<v Speaker 1>you can't specify that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could say it's something like,</v>

119
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.060
<v Speaker 1>well the hand is useful for doing a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of different things with</v>

120
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 1>well and mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tongue,</v>

121
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are words for while it's the same</v>

122
00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore very there for communicating a</v>

123
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>very wide range of information.</v>

124
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.830
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So were were these weird general purpose</v>

125
00:06:18.831 --> 00:06:19.611
<v Speaker 1>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:06:19.611 --> 00:06:24.611
<v Speaker 1>we're not great at any one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can swim better than most</v>

127
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:27.140
<v Speaker 1>terrestrial animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

128
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:31.370
<v Speaker 1>we can run faster than most animals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could certainly run longer.</v>

129
00:06:31.371 --> 00:06:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Like a human being can run a horse to</v>
<v Speaker 1>death over the course of a week if</v>

130
00:06:35.181 --> 00:06:37.070
<v Speaker 1>they're in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

131
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.760
<v Speaker 1>we're really good at being multipurpose</v>
<v Speaker 1>entity,</v>

132
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:41.870
<v Speaker 1>like a rat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

133
00:06:41.871 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>were they call rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weedy species because they can be</v>

134
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a specific niche.</v>

135
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:48.741
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

136
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 1>there's animals down in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

137
00:06:50.391 --> 00:06:52.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Amazon that are specialized for like</v>

138
00:06:52.941 --> 00:06:54.380
<v Speaker 1>one tree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.080
<v Speaker 1>or one type of tree in one tiny little</v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

140
00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.660
<v Speaker 1>That's not what human beings like is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were we're like,</v>

141
00:06:59.661 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>cockroaches are rats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is nasty comparison,</v>

142
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 1>but we can go anywhere and thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

143
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:11.570
<v Speaker 1>and so being particularly good at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being particularly good at being able to</v>

144
00:07:11.571 --> 00:07:15.650
<v Speaker 1>go anywhere and thrive also seems to me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a canonical element of the hero</v>

145
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:17.300
<v Speaker 1>mythology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

146
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:18.913
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

147
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:20.630
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
