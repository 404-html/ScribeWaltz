00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>How do you identify?</v>

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>How do you justify a rejection of identity ism when a pillar of the neo Marxist</v>

3
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.010
<v Speaker 1>strategy is to demographically replaced the indigenous people of Europe,</v>

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.671
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>

5
00:00:17.671 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>it's less than half ethnically English.</v>

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.723
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

7
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.380
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>So let's take that question apart.</v>

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.953
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

10
00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>it isn't self evident to me that it is specifically a neo Marxist strategy to</v>

11
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>demographically replaced the indigenous peoples of Europe and um,</v>

12
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.080
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the strategy anyways,</v>

13
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>even if that's the outcome because you have to distinguish between strategy and</v>

14
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:41.214
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>

15
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.353
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

16
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.620
<v Speaker 1>the strategy and principle is to bring in immigrants to balance out the</v>

17
00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 1>declining birth rate.</v>

18
00:00:47.671 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm not saying I agree with that.</v>

19
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that that's what the strategy is.</v>

20
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:52.551
<v Speaker 1>A,</v>

21
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:57.551
<v Speaker 1>and then the next part of the question is predicated on the assumption that</v>

22
00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.590
<v Speaker 1>identitarianism is necessarily the answer to the problem of,</v>

23
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:04.743
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

24
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 1>the problem that's being identified,</v>

25
00:01:06.961 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>which is characterized as excess immigration.</v>

26
00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.471
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

27
00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 1>we'd have to figure out exactly what identitarianism means because it isn't</v>

28
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:15.024
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

29
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

30
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 1>if it means radical right wing ethnic nationalism,</v>

31
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's going to be particularly constructive.</v>

32
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 1>If it means having a sensible discussion about what the appropriate limits might</v>

33
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>be on immigration,</v>

34
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.040
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.140
<v Speaker 1>and to think about that over the long run.</v>

36
00:01:34.141 --> 00:01:36.180
<v Speaker 1>And also to have a serious discussion about</v>

37
00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.830
<v Speaker 1>the degree to which say is lamb and,</v>

38
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.150
<v Speaker 1>and the west,</v>

39
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 1>the values of Islam and the West are actually commensurate,</v>

40
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.730
<v Speaker 1>then that has to be,</v>

41
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>obviously has to be done.</v>

42
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.543
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

43
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.623
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

44
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>so I'm afraid that to answer that question,</v>

45
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.900
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to know more about exactly how these terms we're being,</v>

46
00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>we're being defined,</v>

47
00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.800
<v Speaker 1>especially with regards to identitarianism cause it's a vague word.</v>

48
00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>
