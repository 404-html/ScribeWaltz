00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 1>You've talked about the difference between intelligence and wisdom.</v>

2
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Jason Clark,</v>

3
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.190
<v Speaker 1>you have talked about the difference between intelligence and wisdom saying</v>

4
00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.430
<v Speaker 1>intelligence isn't a shortcut to wisdom.</v>

5
00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.791
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:20.624
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

7
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>let's point something else out,</v>

8
00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

9
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.010
<v Speaker 1>Stupidity isn't a shortcut to wisdom either.</v>

10
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.290
<v Speaker 1>What is your definition of wisdom?</v>

11
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.613
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>there's the Old Testament view.</v>

14
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>That's the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom.</v>

15
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.293
<v Speaker 1>That's a good one.</v>

16
00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>I think wisdom is in part the willingness to come to terms the knowledge of your</v>

17
00:00:58.931 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Speaker 1>own capacity for malevolence.</v>

18
00:01:00.641 --> 00:01:01.474
<v Speaker 1>That's wisdom.</v>

19
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.960
<v Speaker 1>The the desire to rectify that.</v>

20
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.930
<v Speaker 1>The wish to set the world on a pathway that leads it closer to have it and</v>

21
00:01:10.931 --> 00:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>farther away from hell.</v>

22
00:01:12.461 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>That's wisdom.</v>

23
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.190
<v Speaker 1>The humility to know that there's more things that you don't know then that you</v>

24
00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:31.191
<v Speaker 1>know and that you should be open to what you don't know when people inform you</v>

25
00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:36.441
<v Speaker 1>of it because it's better to learn that it is to walk nose first into a wall or</v>

26
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.540
<v Speaker 1>blind folded off a cliff.</v>

27
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.363
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

28
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.950
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge that you don't have the right to be a judge of being without</v>

29
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>having given it your utmost.</v>

30
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>That's wisdom.</v>

31
00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:09.813
<v Speaker 1>Wisdom.</v>

32
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.953
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

33
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>The knowledge.</v>

34
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Wisdom is also the knowledge that hell is real enough so that you should do</v>

35
00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>everything you can to avoid either inhabiting it or producing it.</v>

36
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>That's what I learned from,</v>

37
00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 1>from psychological analysis of the history of the 20th century.</v>

38
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.740
<v Speaker 1>Hell's real enough and,</v>

39
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

40
00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.430
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

41
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you're duty bound.</v>

42
00:02:35.421 --> 00:02:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's say your honor bound,</v>

43
00:02:36.741 --> 00:02:40.730
<v Speaker 1>you're ethically bound to do the opposite of whatever produces those hellish</v>

44
00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>

45
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
