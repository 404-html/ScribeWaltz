00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.363
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau,</v>

2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>our prime minister's great example of that.</v>

3
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:15.041
<v Speaker 1>So back I think it was in 2015 he announced that half of his cabinet was going</v>

4
00:00:15.721 --> 00:00:20.721
<v Speaker 1>to be women because it was 2015 or some like muddle headed virtue signaling,</v>

5
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>signaling excuse for not thinking.</v>

6
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.310
<v Speaker 1>I think only 20% or 25% of the elected mps were female.</v>

7
00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:33.510
<v Speaker 1>So the proper balance on average would it be 25% female,</v>

8
00:00:33.511 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>75% male.</v>

9
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>What he should've done was figured out who,</v>

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>what qualities would make for a competent cabinet minister,</v>

11
00:00:41.821 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>because it's actually quite important to have competent cabinet ministers and</v>

12
00:00:45.541 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>then selected from among his people for nothing other than competence,</v>

13
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>but he could virtue signal and then he set up the most important board,</v>

14
00:00:54.601 --> 00:00:54.991
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

15
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:59.130
<v Speaker 1>of the entire comp country on a quasi random basis.</v>

16
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>

17
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>how pathetic.</v>

18
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.620
<v Speaker 1>He should've been pilloried by Canadians for that.</v>

19
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.850
<v Speaker 1>But we're so clued out and and also in this situation that you described,</v>

20
00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>it's like if I say,</v>

21
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:10.801
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

22
00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:13.710
<v Speaker 1>50% of Trudeau's cabinet shouldn't have been women.</v>

23
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

24
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.761
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

25
00:01:14.761 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>you're a misogynist.</v>

26
00:01:15.841 --> 00:01:16.201
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

27
00:01:16.201 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

28
00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.980
<v Speaker 1>only 25% of the elected officials were women.</v>

29
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.761
<v Speaker 1>Now you might say,</v>

30
00:01:20.761 --> 00:01:21.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

31
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:23.610
<v Speaker 1>it would be better if 50% of the were elected.</v>

32
00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:24.060
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

33
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be better,</v>

34
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.610
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't happen.</v>

35
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>So you can't,</v>

36
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>you can't fix it at the top end.</v>

37
00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.340
<v Speaker 1>It was appalling.</v>

38
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>So it's a hard argument to make,</v>

39
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:34.921
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:34.921 --> 00:01:39.921
<v Speaker 1>because you need to know that there's more difference within groups then between</v>

41
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:43.320
<v Speaker 1>them in order to be able to come up with a credible argument,</v>

42
00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

43
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.990
<v Speaker 1>And then so yeah.</v>
