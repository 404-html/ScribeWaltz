1
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Having your economic needs as being higher than dealing with this unsettled</v>

2
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.140
<v Speaker 1>scenario.</v>

3
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Like being at work and fulfilling the needs of the attached to the sides of you</v>

5
00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:26.990
<v Speaker 1>by your superior,</v>

6
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.540
<v Speaker 1>then you still have,</v>

7
00:00:29.541 --> 00:00:30.261
<v Speaker 1>you still get to survive.</v>

8
00:00:30.261 --> 00:00:32.210
<v Speaker 1>So get to easily to have a roof over your head,</v>

9
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>but you just have to sort of deal with the consequences of this.</v>

10
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:36.650
<v Speaker 1>Like Ben settle.</v>

11
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

12
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:38.150
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.983
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

14
00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I would say sometimes people are put into positions that unsettled them and they</v>

15
00:00:43.661 --> 00:00:44.800
<v Speaker 2>don't know what to do.</v>

16
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

17
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.833
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of,</v>

18
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.750
<v Speaker 2>they're screwed if they do this and they're screwed if they do that and that's</v>

19
00:00:49.751 --> 00:00:50.381
<v Speaker 2>all they can see,</v>

20
00:00:50.381 --> 00:00:53.380
<v Speaker 2>the dude and people get put no situations all the time.</v>

21
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.810
<v Speaker 2>But I'm not really going to talk about those except that people really suffer</v>

22
00:00:58.811 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 2>for that.</v>

23
00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

24
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.783
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

25
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.410
<v Speaker 2>partly what Rogers is talking about is a form of optimal organization,</v>

26
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.951
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

27
00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's to be considered as the final goal.</v>

28
00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:14.031
<v Speaker 2>In some sense.</v>

29
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:15.380
<v Speaker 2>It's what you're working towards.</v>

30
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very difficult to live in a way that you,</v>

31
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.890
<v Speaker 2>so that you never encounter contradictions as you move forward.</v>

32
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.730
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

33
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 2>that's precisely what does happen as you move forward.</v>

34
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And it's up to you on the fly to argue,</v>

35
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.960
<v Speaker 2>to organize your response to those contradictions in a manner that doesn't</v>

36
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.060
<v Speaker 2>destabilize the entire structure.</v>

37
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.021
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

38
00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:38.300
<v Speaker 2>the entire structure is a strange thing because again,</v>

39
00:01:38.301 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 2>Rogers Rogers has got a psychoanalytic,</v>

40
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.901
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

41
00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:43.100
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly right.</v>

42
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.570
<v Speaker 2>It's complicated.</v>

43
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

44
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 2>The hierarchy that Roger's describes this characteristic of the self,</v>

45
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>this is something he doesn't discuss that much.</v>

46
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 2>The hierarchy that you make of yourself is not independent of the way that you</v>

47
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 2>fit into hierarchies in the world.</v>

48
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 2>So really by hierarchically re organizing yourself at the same time you're</v>

49
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 2>hierarchically organizing the world.</v>

50
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:09.500
<v Speaker 2>And so part of the problem is,</v>

51
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:13.790
<v Speaker 2>is that if you destabilize yourself or if you've come up with a sub optimal</v>

52
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:14.624
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>

53
00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.440
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

54
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.020
<v Speaker 2>there's a twist there that's going to,</v>

55
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.830
<v Speaker 2>it's going to follow you up.</v>

56
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.371
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

57
00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker 2>it may be the best that you've got.</v>

58
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes that happens,</v>

59
00:02:22.521 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

60
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying you can always solve a problem in an optimal manner,</v>

61
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

62
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.900
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the movie Sophie's choice?</v>

63
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.911
<v Speaker 2>You can never see that.</v>

64
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:31.744
<v Speaker 2>It's an old movie.</v>

65
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.380
<v Speaker 1>MMM Sophie.</v>

66
00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a movie about that,</v>

67
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.120
<v Speaker 2>about Germany during the Nazi period,</v>

68
00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.520
<v Speaker 2>she had to choose which of her two children was going to be shocked.</v>

69
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.801
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

70
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:45.101
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:02:45.101 --> 00:02:47.500
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty hard to come up with an optimal.</v>

72
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 2>So let me shift to that.</v>

73
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

74
00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:51.523
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

75
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.030
<v Speaker 2>Roger's though didn't really think that that actual problems in life constituted</v>

76
00:02:58.031 --> 00:02:59.140
<v Speaker 2>psychopathology.</v>

77
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 2>That's sort of more of the existentialist,</v>

78
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 2>although he had an existential quit,</v>

79
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.750
<v Speaker 2>he was thinking more that what constituted psychopathology per se instead of</v>

80
00:03:07.751 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 2>just plain ordinary suffering was the contradictions that arose because people</v>

81
00:03:12.341 --> 00:03:17.341
<v Speaker 2>fail to use their potential for articulation in a manner that continually</v>

82
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 2>fostered their integration.</v>

83
00:03:21.791 --> 00:03:22.571
<v Speaker 2>So he would say,</v>

84
00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>well to the degree that you are going to use instrumental language,</v>

85
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 2>it's not a term he used,</v>

86
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's a good summary of,</v>

87
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.800
<v Speaker 2>of his philosophy that you were bringing to bear on yourself,</v>

88
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.360
<v Speaker 2>unnecessary and others around you.</v>

89
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 2>Unnecessary pain and suffering.</v>

90
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.710
<v Speaker 2>And that was psychopathological.</v>

91
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 2>It's psychopathological because it's unnecessary because in principle it could</v>

92
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:43.114
<v Speaker 2>be avoided.</v>

93
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.203
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

94
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.030
<v Speaker 2>so that's the idea.</v>

95
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 2>And so the idea as well is that the organizing principle that brings you into</v>

96
00:03:55.191 --> 00:04:00.191
<v Speaker 2>this optimally functioning hierarchy is your commitment to truth to accurately</v>

97
00:04:01.071 --> 00:04:03.620
<v Speaker 2>represent what it is that you experience.</v>

98
00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:04.790
<v Speaker 2>And that's again,</v>

99
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.230
<v Speaker 2>you know how Piaget talked about the fundamental truth as a process rather than</v>

100
00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:10.690
<v Speaker 2>as a state or a fact.</v>

101
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.750
<v Speaker 2>It's the case for Rogerian phenomena phenomenology as well.</v>

102
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:17.480
<v Speaker 2>And you could kind of understand that because of course therapists are dealing</v>

103
00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:18.620
<v Speaker 2>with people,</v>

104
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.170
<v Speaker 2>living people and life is a process,</v>

105
00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:22.010
<v Speaker 2>not a state.</v>

106
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.840
<v Speaker 2>And so Rogers was concentrating very much on the process,</v>

107
00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:31.100
<v Speaker 2>which he regarded as absolutely crucial and believed that the process,</v>

108
00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.300
<v Speaker 2>the process properly implemented would bring about the best possible</v>

109
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>

110
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.380
<v Speaker 2>And then we'll update that organization has necessary too.</v>

111
00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.260
<v Speaker 2>So it's a radical idea.</v>

112
00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 2>But I would also say that it's fundamentally rooted in his Protestant</v>

113
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.880
<v Speaker 2>Christianity because one of the tenants of Christianity is that the word orders</v>

114
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.723
<v Speaker 2>chaos.</v>

115
00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 2>And so that idea was lurking at the bottom of Roger's conceptual structure and</v>

116
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:57.831
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

117
00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:02.150
<v Speaker 2>he was intelligent enough to articulate it fully in a modern way.</v>

118
00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.860
<v Speaker 2>That's still where it came from.</v>

119
00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

120
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Now it's an older idea of,</v>

121
00:05:06.781 --> 00:05:07.614
<v Speaker 2>of Christianity.</v>

122
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:08.120
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
