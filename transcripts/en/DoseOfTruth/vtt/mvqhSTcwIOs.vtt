WEBVTT

1
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.183
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 2>believe some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where I think he gets a little</v>

3
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 2>bit optimistic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

4
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 2>Rogers is one of those optimists you</v>
<v Speaker 2>really have to contend with.</v>

5
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.470
<v Speaker 2>Now he believed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is a classical</v>

6
00:00:25.471 --> 00:00:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Protestant belief,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this as well,</v>

7
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 2>that what evil was was basically the</v>
<v Speaker 2>absence of good and that people had a</v>

8
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:37.551
<v Speaker 2>strong intrinsic impulse towards the</v>
<v Speaker 2>good that you could help them realize</v>

9
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 2>and the way you help them realize.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was by setting the preconditions</v>

10
00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:47.781
<v Speaker 2>for the emergence of that good and he</v>
<v Speaker 2>believed that the preconditions were</v>

11
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 2>the provision of a space for</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication</v>

12
00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.320
<v Speaker 2>where there was no judgment in the sense</v>
<v Speaker 2>of rejection.</v>

13
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 2>And so here's the Rogerian theory with</v>
<v Speaker 2>regards to therapeutic endeavor.</v>

14
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Now the first thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this seems critical and I think</v>

15
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 2>Rogers was right about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the client has to want to change,</v>

16
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 2>and this is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a funny thing about therapy</v>

17
00:01:26.481 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 2>because my observation has been that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not something you can impose on</v>

18
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:35.480
<v Speaker 2>people unless they've decided that</v>
<v Speaker 2>things could be better and that</v>

19
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 2>alterations in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

20
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 2>in something they're doing might make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

21
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.450
<v Speaker 2>It's a nonstarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I've had clients who were court</v>

22
00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:47.240
<v Speaker 2>ordered to attend therapy and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just complete waste of time,</v>

23
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.540
<v Speaker 2>especially if they're more on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychopath,</v>

24
00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:53.660
<v Speaker 2>that gift of things because you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they don't want to change,</v>

25
00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:56.240
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to learn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is actually another Rogerian</v>

26
00:01:56.241 --> 00:02:01.100
<v Speaker 2>principle and because Roger's had an</v>
<v Speaker 2>educational philosophy as well and the</v>

27
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>educational philosophy was students will</v>
<v Speaker 2>not learn things that are not relevant</v>

28
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so one of the teachers duties was to</v>

29
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 2>make the material at hand relevant</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that would</v>

30
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>help the students remember it.</v>

31
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Why remembered if it's not relevant to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I tried to do in my</v>

32
00:02:19.821 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 2>lectures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I try to tell people when I'm lecturing,</v>

33
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.880
<v Speaker 2>why they should know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the fundamental answer always,</v>

34
00:02:25.881 --> 00:02:29.090
<v Speaker 2>if you push it down far enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that if you know this,</v>

35
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 2>your life will go better and so will the</v>
<v Speaker 2>life of people around you.</v>

36
00:02:32.781 --> 00:02:35.660
<v Speaker 2>So you should listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then there's some things that</v>

37
00:02:35.661 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 2>are sharp and pointy that you will run</v>
<v Speaker 2>into while you're wandering around in</v>

38
00:02:39.261 --> 00:02:40.970
<v Speaker 2>the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

39
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.710
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's the fundamental issue.</v>

40
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:44.570
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's necessary to know these things and</v>

41
00:02:44.571 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 2>so if you're dealing with someone who</v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't decided that there's something</v>

42
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:50.780
<v Speaker 2>wrong and that they have something to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>

43
00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 2>then maybe they could change that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>make things better.</v>

44
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 2>You're not going anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Rogers would also say that's</v>

45
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 2>actually a precondition for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship period because he didn't</v>

46
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 2>really make much of a distinction</v>
<v Speaker 2>between a therapeutic relationship and a</v>

47
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 2>genuine relationship because he thought</v>
<v Speaker 2>the genuine relationships with</v>

48
00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:14.721
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic and so one of the principles</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can extract from that is that</v>

49
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:19.921
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one useful proposition is that,</v>

50
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.780
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're pretty perfect,</v>

51
00:03:22.781 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>but you're probably not quite as perfect</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you could be.</v>

52
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 2>And so it's possible that your partner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no matter how deeply flawed they are,</v>

53
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 2>might now and then have something to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>to you that would,</v>

54
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 2>if you incorporated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would bring you to an even higher state</v>

55
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 2>of perfection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

56
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 2>And so that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that means you have to listen.</v>

57
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 2>And it's worse than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this again is a Rogerian</v>

58
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.550
<v Speaker 2>observation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might have to help them criticize</v>

59
00:03:48.551 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 2>you because maybe they're not very good</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>

60
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so there's something they're trying</v>

61
00:03:53.561 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 2>to tell you and they're stumbling way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

62
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.460
<v Speaker 2>it's an actual thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they can't articulate it and so it'd</v>

63
00:04:00.461 --> 00:04:03.070
<v Speaker 2>be easy for you just to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're trying to use</v>

64
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 2>language instrumentally and to get away</v>
<v Speaker 2>with it just to,</v>

65
00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 2>while you could even make fun of the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're poorly articulating the problem,</v>

66
00:04:11.171 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>that's a really good one because then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can convince them not to do such</v>

67
00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:14.860
<v Speaker 2>things in the future.</v>

68
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.410
<v Speaker 2>But if you take the other stance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is,</v>

69
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.230
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got some things to learn and you've</v>

70
00:04:20.231 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 2>got some things to learn and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>some things to teach me and I've got</v>

71
00:04:23.201 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 2>some things to teach you and God only</v>
<v Speaker 2>knows when that's gonna happen,</v>

72
00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:29.620
<v Speaker 2>but it might happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the object of the conversation is for</v>

73
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:32.020
<v Speaker 2>each person to help the other person</v>
<v Speaker 2>make their point.</v>

74
00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a lot different than winning</v>

75
00:04:34.121 --> 00:04:36.130
<v Speaker 2>the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can tell you one thing,</v>

76
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:41.200
<v Speaker 2>you will not win an argument with any</v>
<v Speaker 2>intimate partner ever because you're not</v>

77
00:04:41.201 --> 00:04:44.830
<v Speaker 2>playing the game of the argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're playing the game of iterated</v>

78
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:48.640
<v Speaker 2>arguments across time and so if you win</v>
<v Speaker 2>an argument,</v>

79
00:04:48.641 --> 00:04:53.500
<v Speaker 2>you just set up another one winning and</v>
<v Speaker 2>solving the problem and the same thing,</v>

80
00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 2>so from a Rogerian perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 2>winning would be the maintenance of your</v>

81
00:04:57.401 --> 00:05:02.401
<v Speaker 2>current self structure at the cost of</v>
<v Speaker 2>failure to integrate some disintegrated</v>

82
00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.310
<v Speaker 2>element of the phenomenological realm.</v>

83
00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it'd be the unhappiness of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>partner.</v>

84
00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 2>That might be one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you can.</v>

85
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 2>If you win the argument,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the rationalization issue.</v>

86
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:18.721
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally you don't have to change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact is you do have to change</v>

87
00:05:18.791 --> 00:05:23.330
<v Speaker 2>because the way you are is giving rise</v>
<v Speaker 2>to this situation and that's not going</v>

88
00:05:23.331 --> 00:05:26.590
<v Speaker 2>to change unless you fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So winning an argument and fixing</v>

89
00:05:26.591 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are completely different things.</v>

90
00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.430
<v Speaker 2>You fix the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It goes away and often couples have to</v>

91
00:05:33.431 --> 00:05:37.540
<v Speaker 2>have conflict because there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between conflict and</v>

92
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:40.240
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thinking is a form of Lore.</v>

93
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:41.630
<v Speaker 2>It's just that you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

94
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.830
<v Speaker 2>you make it an interior form of war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

95
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.650
<v Speaker 2>You can't have accomplished without</v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict because life is different,</v>

96
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.410
<v Speaker 2>difficult and people differ from one</v>
<v Speaker 2>another.</v>

97
00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.610
<v Speaker 2>So they have different value structures</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you can't just ignore that you</v>

98
00:05:54.611 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 2>have to set up a dialogue because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily obvious clues,</v>

99
00:05:57.891 --> 00:05:58.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

100
00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 2>Of course rogers bleed that in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic round two.</v>

101
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>So he thought if therapy is something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that emerged as a consequence of the</v>

102
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 2>adoption of certain axiomatic</v>
<v Speaker 2>presuppositions and those were</v>

103
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 2>things could be better than they are and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could make them that way and that's</v>

104
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.440
<v Speaker 2>also true for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the next presumption is,</v>

105
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.480
<v Speaker 2>well maybe we can figure out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in a collaborative with</v>

106
00:06:23.481 --> 00:06:28.481
<v Speaker 2>collaborative communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Rogers believed that the therapist</v>

107
00:06:28.581 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 2>was just as transformed during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic process as the person.</v>

108
00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that wasn't happening then whatever</v>

109
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 2>was happening wasn't the kind of healing</v>
<v Speaker 2>therapy that Rogers would like to have</v>

110
00:06:39.531 --> 00:06:42.050
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he also said that's all.</v>

111
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>I'll read you something he said later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he also pointed out quite strongly</v>

112
00:06:46.251 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 2>that that's why people don't really like</v>
<v Speaker 2>to listen.</v>

113
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe there's some flaw in</v>

114
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

115
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Structure at some fundamental level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally axiomatic level,</v>

116
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you're narcissistic.</v>

117
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.390
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

118
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.900
<v Speaker 2>if you listen to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to tell you you're</v>

119
00:07:02.901 --> 00:07:03.950
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

120
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.940
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to find that out because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to blow a huge hole and</v>

121
00:07:06.941 --> 00:07:09.850
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna blow a huge hole in</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

122
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 2>Structure that's not very fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

123
00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>hypothetically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that beats running into the obstacles</v>

124
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>that you will run into if you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissistic repeatedly as you move</v>

125
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:25.820
<v Speaker 2>forward through life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can either live with your flaws</v>

126
00:07:25.821 --> 00:07:29.220
<v Speaker 2>are correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the,</v>

127
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.470
<v Speaker 2>the pathway to correction is dialogue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>communication.</v>
