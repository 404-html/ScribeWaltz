00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:04.430
<v Speaker 1>How is it that society has not learned from history about the dangers of</v>

2
00:00:04.431 --> 00:00:05.001
<v Speaker 1>socialism,</v>

3
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:05.834
<v Speaker 1>Marxism,</v>

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.060
<v Speaker 1>ideology,</v>

5
00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:07.460
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

6
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.293
<v Speaker 1>after years,</v>

7
00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.890
<v Speaker 1>how to Marxists get away with it?</v>

8
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.641
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:10.641 --> 00:00:11.474
<v Speaker 1>let's,</v>

10
00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:17.300
<v Speaker 1>let's not go with the dangers of etiology.</v>

11
00:00:17.301 --> 00:00:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's go with the dangers of like call it radical left wing ideology.</v>

12
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I think the reason for this,</v>

14
00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:25.670
<v Speaker 1>and this also might buy the reason,</v>

15
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.440
<v Speaker 1>be the reason that there's a strange thing that the iconography of,</v>

16
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.220
<v Speaker 1>of social communism is still acceptable socially,</v>

17
00:00:34.221 --> 00:00:36.740
<v Speaker 1>whereas the iconography of Nazi-ism isn't.</v>

18
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

19
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying that we should make the icons of Nazi as socially acceptable</v>

20
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:44.084
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

21
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that the communist icon shouldn't be socially acceptable,</v>

22
00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:48.614
<v Speaker 1>but they are.</v>

23
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>And there's probably a reason for that.</v>

24
00:00:50.541 --> 00:00:51.374
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

25
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.311
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

26
00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:55.790
<v Speaker 1>part of it is that the left has never taken on.</v>

27
00:00:55.791 --> 00:01:00.791
<v Speaker 1>The radical left has ne never taken responsibility for being on the same side as</v>

28
00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 1>the Stalinists and the Maoists and the Cambodian murderers and all of that.</v>

29
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>So that's part of it.</v>

30
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>But then the next part is I think there's something deeper.</v>

31
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.913
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

32
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:13.911 --> 00:01:18.911
<v Speaker 1>inequality is a reality and it's a reality that cannot be put at the feet of</v>

34
00:01:19.521 --> 00:01:23.180
<v Speaker 1>capitalism or at the feet of human political structure.</v>

35
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a good book you guys might want to read this called the great leveler by</v>

36
00:01:27.771 --> 00:01:31.430
<v Speaker 1>Walter Shy Dale and it's a new book and it's the study of inequality.</v>

37
00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:35.120
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he does is do an empirical analysis of the relationship</v>

38
00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 1>between inequality,</v>

39
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:37.760
<v Speaker 1>the Gini Coefficient,</v>

40
00:01:37.761 --> 00:01:42.500
<v Speaker 1>which is a measure of inequality and the ideological position of governments.</v>

41
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>So here's the theory.</v>

42
00:01:44.061 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 1>The hypothesis would be,</v>

43
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

44
00:01:45.921 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 1>because the left wingers are concerned with inequality,</v>

45
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>if you measured inequality in left wing under left wing governments and you</v>

46
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>measured inequality under right wing governments,</v>

47
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:57.980
<v Speaker 1>you'd expect a reduction in inequality under left wing governments.</v>

48
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.380
<v Speaker 1>And the results are</v>

49
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.040
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

50
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.940
<v Speaker 1>no difference.</v>

51
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>And so what does that mean?</v>

52
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that left wings are hypocrites,</v>

53
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>although it might mean that because people can be hypocrites.</v>

54
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:14.571
<v Speaker 1>But what it means is the problem of inequality is so intractable that we don't</v>

55
00:02:16.561 --> 00:02:18.120
<v Speaker 1>know of any appropriate</v>

56
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.700
<v Speaker 1>political sociological or economic solutions that actually work.</v>

57
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a real catastrophe.</v>

58
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.023
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

59
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.310
<v Speaker 1>inequality in itself might not be a bad thing unless it's too extreme.</v>

60
00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.091
<v Speaker 1>It's extreme.</v>

61
00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>When people say start to starve and then clearly somethings,</v>

62
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.931
<v Speaker 1>you know it's,</v>

63
00:02:39.931 --> 00:02:41.100
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to,</v>

64
00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.240
<v Speaker 1>I think everyone would agree that that's a suboptimal outcome.</v>

65
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.571
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.640
<v Speaker 1>we don't need to get all ideological about that,</v>

67
00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.850
<v Speaker 1>but some degree of inequality is useful because,</v>

68
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:54.460
<v Speaker 1>it gives people something to strive for.</v>

70
00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>It gives them an op,</v>

71
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.373
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

72
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.640
<v Speaker 1>It means,</v>

73
00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this,</v>

74
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.190
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you actually want people to be rich because if a new product is</v>

75
00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>introduced into the market,</v>

76
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>the people there have to be people around who have substantial pools of capital</v>

77
00:03:08.951 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>to be able to afford it when it's still novel.</v>

78
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And then that market brings the price down for everyone else.</v>

79
00:03:15.311 --> 00:03:17.950
<v Speaker 1>And so if everyone had exactly the same income,</v>

80
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:21.220
<v Speaker 1>it would be very difficult to introduce expensive products into the market with</v>

81
00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>the hope that their price would plummet.</v>

82
00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Not actually is a big deal.</v>

83
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.790
<v Speaker 1>You want large pools of capital sitting around too,</v>

84
00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:29.290
<v Speaker 1>so that people can invest in very,</v>

85
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:30.640
<v Speaker 1>very complex things.</v>

86
00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:34.780
<v Speaker 1>And you also want large pools of capital to be the hands have to be in the hands</v>

87
00:03:34.781 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>of private individuals so that there's competitive,</v>

88
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>there's forces that are powerful,</v>

89
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:43.510
<v Speaker 1>that are competitive with the government and with other large organizations.</v>

90
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>So anyways though,</v>

91
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 1>back to the Marxists,</v>

92
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.910
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that there are reasons for inequality and despite the fact that</v>

93
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't lay the fact of inequality at the feet of capitalism and despite the</v>

94
00:03:58.751 --> 00:04:03.751
<v Speaker 1>fact that capitalism also appears to be making every one not absolutely poor at</v>

95
00:04:05.801 --> 00:04:08.860
<v Speaker 1>the same time as it makes some people very rich,</v>

96
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.040
<v Speaker 1>there's still inequality is still painful reality and no one really likes it.</v>

97
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.971
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

98
00:04:15.971 --> 00:04:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can lord it over someone,</v>

99
00:04:17.771 --> 00:04:18.341
<v Speaker 1>I suppose,</v>

100
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

101
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 1>and extract out some sense of your moral superiority because you happen to</v>

102
00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>occupy a hierarchical position that's higher.</v>

103
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:28.150
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes there's some validity in that,</v>

104
00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:29.350
<v Speaker 1>especially if you've earned it.</v>

105
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Although I would say like glorying in it is probably a suboptimal outcome.</v>

106
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>It's still the case that that inequality violates a moral intuition that</v>

107
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:40.151
<v Speaker 1>everyone has.</v>

108
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:40.481
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

109
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:44.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's probably the moral intuitions that lie along the agreeable access.</v>

110
00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

111
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.311
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

112
00:04:45.311 --> 00:04:47.350
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be better if everyone had enough?</v>

113
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.461
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

114
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:48.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

115
00:04:48.671 --> 00:04:49.810
<v Speaker 1>who argues with that?</v>

116
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

117
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.561
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

118
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>everyone feels that way.</v>

119
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

120
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

121
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.270
<v Speaker 1>a thoughtless,</v>

122
00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>a thoughtless compassion makes Marxism,</v>

123
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.890
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

124
00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Naively attractive.</v>

125
00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not being cynical about that because there is some utility in naive</v>

126
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:10.840
<v Speaker 1>agreeableness,</v>

127
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.730
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately the world is a very complicated place.</v>

128
00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.120
<v Speaker 1>And merely wanting to be nice about things and wishing that everything was fair</v>

129
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 1>doesn't justify imposing an equity outcome and Gerrymandering,</v>

130
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:31.540
<v Speaker 1>complex economic systems that will bite you if you mess with them because you're</v>

131
00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:32.920
<v Speaker 1>ideologically possessed.</v>

132
00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I am 46,</v>

133
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 1>retired executive,</v>

134
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:47.831
<v Speaker 1>wealthy,</v>

135
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:49.330
<v Speaker 1>competent and full of Jews.</v>

136
00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Who could I talk to if I want to invest time slash money slash energy in your</v>

137
00:05:54.341 --> 00:05:55.180
<v Speaker 1>university</v>

138
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.130
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

139
00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>lots of people are,</v>

140
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>are asking me such things and it's very much appreciated.</v>

141
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.341
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird,</v>

142
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:04.581
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

143
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:08.960
<v Speaker 1>because you'd think that if people are offering you time and money that it would</v>

144
00:06:08.961 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>be a straight forward thing to say,</v>

145
00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.391
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

146
00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:12.980
<v Speaker 1>please climb aboard and help.</v>

147
00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>But it's not that simple because first of all,</v>

148
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to involve people in something that I can't be sufficiently</v>

149
00:06:20.451 --> 00:06:21.284
<v Speaker 1>committed to.</v>

150
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:22.790
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair to them.</v>

151
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

152
00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.370
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't obvious to me how I can be committed to this yet fully committed to</v>

153
00:06:28.371 --> 00:06:28.521
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

154
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:32.300
<v Speaker 1>And so I'm sort of playing with it at the level that I can manage.</v>

155
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:33.920
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's a game.</v>

156
00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:39.100
<v Speaker 1>We have a good product in involved or a good product in,</v>

157
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.000
<v Speaker 1>in motion at the moment,</v>

158
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:43.250
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not,</v>

159
00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the wherewithal to scale at the moment.</v>

160
00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.680
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

161
00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.821
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

162
00:06:50.821 --> 00:06:54.150
<v Speaker 1>and people who are developing new businesses like to do this,</v>

163
00:06:54.151 --> 00:06:57.390
<v Speaker 1>like let's say I could come up with a draft business plan for an online</v>

164
00:06:57.391 --> 00:07:00.210
<v Speaker 1>university and then I could contact people like you,</v>

165
00:07:00.211 --> 00:07:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Paul and say,</v>

166
00:07:02.731 --> 00:07:03.031
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

167
00:07:03.031 --> 00:07:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm ready to gather investments in,</v>

168
00:07:04.951 --> 00:07:08.760
<v Speaker 1>let's say I could raise $20 million or let's say I could raise $200 million.</v>

169
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Then I have a new problem.</v>

170
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.671
<v Speaker 1>The problem is,</v>

171
00:07:11.671 --> 00:07:11.881
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

172
00:07:11.881 --> 00:07:12.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

173
00:07:12.481 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 1>I've got all this money now I have to figure out something to do with it.</v>

174
00:07:14.791 --> 00:07:17.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually a really big responsibility.</v>

175
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Not,</v>

176
00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:18.863
<v Speaker 1>it's not like,</v>

177
00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:19.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

178
00:07:19.261 --> 00:07:20.730
<v Speaker 1>it's a success catastrophe,</v>

179
00:07:20.731 --> 00:07:22.350
<v Speaker 1>let's say it's a first world problem.</v>

180
00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:23.071
<v Speaker 1>I get all that,</v>

181
00:07:23.071 --> 00:07:25.620
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that it isn't real.</v>

182
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.000
<v Speaker 1>So I have to do a lot more thinking and planning</v>

183
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.880
<v Speaker 1>and figure out how to disperse my time most effectively before I dare to take on</v>

184
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>any additional people who would like to help.</v>

185
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:41.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

186
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:46.300
<v Speaker 1>once my organization as it is in a place where that sort of help would be</v>

187
00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:48.471
<v Speaker 1>useful,</v>

188
00:07:48.471 --> 00:07:51.950
<v Speaker 1>then I'll make a public announcement and I would be more than happy for people</v>

189
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 1>to jump on board.</v>

190
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:55.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's say climb on board,</v>

191
00:07:55.311 --> 00:07:56.240
<v Speaker 1>start pushing,</v>

192
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.560
<v Speaker 1>devote resources,</v>

193
00:07:57.561 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>all of those things.</v>

194
00:07:58.401 --> 00:07:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happy for that to happen that,</v>

195
00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:05.020
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want to do it prematurely because I don't want people to,</v>

196
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.360
<v Speaker 1>to risk their valuable resources in an endeavor that isn't yet solid.</v>

197
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.553
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

198
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:15.641
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

199
00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:17.470
<v Speaker 1>so I'm only going to do,</v>

200
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.790
<v Speaker 1>I think one more question.</v>

201
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.823
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

202
00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.800
<v Speaker 1>I am a sober alcoholic slash drug addict.</v>

203
00:08:37.801 --> 00:08:41.910
<v Speaker 1>How can I find my way back to belief in a higher power after 10 years in the</v>

204
00:08:41.911 --> 00:08:43.200
<v Speaker 1>empty void of atheism,</v>

205
00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm falling apart.</v>

206
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:52.741
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

207
00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:57.741
<v Speaker 1>I would say your best bet is to actually start devoting some time to it.</v>

208
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:00.840
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

209
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:01.673
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

210
00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>I became convinced of the validity of a religious viewpoint.</v>

211
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 1>I think as a consequence of study</v>

212
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:12.961
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

213
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Campbell read Carl Young Young's hard.</v>

214
00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:19.050
<v Speaker 1>Campbell's a good introduction though.</v>

215
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.030
<v Speaker 1>Richa Ellie out as well.</v>

216
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you can find your way back to belief,</v>

217
00:09:26.111 --> 00:09:30.010
<v Speaker 1>but you might be able to find your way back to meaningful engagement and that</v>

218
00:09:30.011 --> 00:09:30.844
<v Speaker 1>might,</v>

219
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:33.710
<v Speaker 1>that's a better way of thinking about it.</v>

220
00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:34.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

221
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the belief thing is a really tricky one.</v>

222
00:09:36.321 --> 00:09:36.951
<v Speaker 1>People ask me,</v>

223
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:38.060
<v Speaker 1>do you believe in God?</v>

224
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:39.553
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

225
00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:40.641
<v Speaker 1>I really think,</v>

226
00:09:40.641 --> 00:09:42.530
<v Speaker 1>how dare you ask that question.</v>

227
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's really what I think.</v>

228
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.303
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

229
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.660
<v Speaker 1>But on a more prosaic level,</v>

230
00:09:49.661 --> 00:09:50.321
<v Speaker 1>I usually think,</v>

231
00:09:50.321 --> 00:09:50.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

232
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you mean by belief.</v>

233
00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:56.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you mean by belief and I don't know what you mean by God.</v>

234
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.800
<v Speaker 1>These are very,</v>

235
00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:59.050
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

236
00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.050
<v Speaker 1>these are very difficult questions and none of that self evident.</v>

237
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:03.610
<v Speaker 1>Now I would say,</v>

238
00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>do I believe in the crucifixion?</v>

239
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:07.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

240
00:10:07.751 --> 00:10:08.261
<v Speaker 1>certainly,</v>

241
00:10:08.261 --> 00:10:09.094
<v Speaker 1>I mean people,</v>

242
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:10.420
<v Speaker 1>the crucifixion,</v>

243
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.210
<v Speaker 1>how can you not believe in it if,</v>

244
00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.900
<v Speaker 1>if you think symbolically,</v>

245
00:10:14.170 --> 00:10:16.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like human beings are,</v>

246
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.850
<v Speaker 1>we're eternally crucified,</v>

247
00:10:19.180 --> 00:10:20.013
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

248
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:23.080
<v Speaker 1>Our lives are tragic and they end in death and were,</v>

249
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.370
<v Speaker 1>we're all betrayed.</v>

250
00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:25.930
<v Speaker 1>We're all betrayed.</v>

251
00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:28.900
<v Speaker 1>We all experienced betrayal.</v>

252
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.830
<v Speaker 1>So how could you,</v>

253
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:34.120
<v Speaker 1>you can't not believe in the crucifixion.</v>

254
00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe in the resurrection?</v>

255
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

256
00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.210
<v Speaker 1>people die and are reborn all the time.</v>

257
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

258
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:42.010
<v Speaker 1>they go through,</v>

259
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.450
<v Speaker 1>this is what you're after here.</v>

260
00:10:43.451 --> 00:10:45.760
<v Speaker 1>I'm a sober drug and alcohol and drug addict.</v>

261
00:10:45.761 --> 00:10:45.941
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

262
00:10:45.941 --> 00:10:46.211
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

263
00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:46.930
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

264
00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you had to let a lot of you die when you stop being an addict and something new</v>

265
00:10:50.381 --> 00:10:51.250
<v Speaker 1>be reborn.</v>

266
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.910
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the ultimate significance of that and how is it tied to the</v>

267
00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:56.830
<v Speaker 1>notion of bodily resurrection?</v>

268
00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:57.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

269
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the ultimate significance is,</v>

270
00:10:59.621 --> 00:11:02.050
<v Speaker 1>but it does seem to be the pathway through life</v>

271
00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.853
<v Speaker 1>to believe.</v>

272
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I would say you start believing not by attempting to</v>

273
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:21.370
<v Speaker 1>convince yourself that the statement there is a god is true,</v>

274
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.380
<v Speaker 1>like a fact is true,</v>

275
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:29.710
<v Speaker 1>but to act out the proposition that you should shoulder your cross and stumble</v>

276
00:11:30.321 --> 00:11:32.510
<v Speaker 1>uphill towards the city of God.</v>

277
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:33.890
<v Speaker 1>That's belief,</v>

278
00:11:33.891 --> 00:11:34.724
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

279
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:37.470
<v Speaker 1>and you can do that</v>

280
00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:40.133
<v Speaker 1>right away.</v>

281
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Now you might ask,</v>

282
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:43.751
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

283
00:11:43.751 --> 00:11:48.751
<v Speaker 1>do I have any guarantee that that has transcendent and universal significance?</v>

284
00:11:49.001 --> 00:11:49.834
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

285
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:50.883
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

286
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad model for emulation.</v>

287
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It has universal significance in that regard.</v>

288
00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.670
<v Speaker 1>We each have to shoulder the tragedy of our existence and stumble upwards.</v>

289
00:12:02.910 --> 00:12:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Despite that it has universal significance.</v>

290
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:11.390
<v Speaker 1>Does it have significance outside of life and like get the internal eternal</v>

291
00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:12.224
<v Speaker 1>realm?</v>

292
00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:13.443
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

293
00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.370
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't surprise me if it did.</v>

294
00:12:19.370 --> 00:12:22.040
<v Speaker 1>I suppose it depends on what you mean by the eternal realm.</v>

295
00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:22.874
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

296
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.930
<v Speaker 1>seems to have significance in the eternal realm of consciousness.</v>

297
00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.210
<v Speaker 1>It seems to have significance in the eternal realm of unconscious fantasy,</v>

298
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:34.730
<v Speaker 1>implicit fantasy and mythology.</v>

299
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.390
<v Speaker 1>How is it connected with the factual world?</v>

300
00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.153
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

301
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.960
<v Speaker 1>That's a hard question because the factual world in some sense divorced itself</v>

302
00:12:48.961 --> 00:12:53.220
<v Speaker 1>from that transcendental world during the development of the scientific</v>

303
00:12:53.221 --> 00:12:54.060
<v Speaker 1>methodology.</v>

304
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.960
<v Speaker 1>So never the Twain shall meet.</v>

305
00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.520
<v Speaker 1>It's a methodological issue.</v>

306
00:12:59.521 --> 00:13:00.354
<v Speaker 1>In part,</v>

307
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:10.970
<v Speaker 1>I think you probably have to draw on the same forces that enabled you to sober</v>

308
00:13:10.971 --> 00:13:12.830
<v Speaker 1>up and abandoned your drug addiction.</v>

309
00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:14.331
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

310
00:13:14.331 --> 00:13:16.460
<v Speaker 1>something was guiding you forward.</v>

311
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:17.750
<v Speaker 1>Go forward again,</v>

312
00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:19.461
<v Speaker 1>go forward again,</v>

313
00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:21.320
<v Speaker 1>as if there is a higher power.</v>

314
00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:23.300
<v Speaker 1>That's your manifestation of faith.</v>

315
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.040
<v Speaker 1>Go forward again,</v>

316
00:13:25.041 --> 00:13:28.940
<v Speaker 1>as if being is benevolent and God is good.</v>

317
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.820
<v Speaker 1>That's the hallmark of courage</v>

318
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.100
<v Speaker 1>and that's a good place to stop.</v>

319
00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.730
<v Speaker 1>Thank you all for showing up today and uh,</v>

320
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.100
<v Speaker 1>and for all the support and,</v>

321
00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.830
<v Speaker 1>and that's enough for March,</v>

322
00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:52.290
<v Speaker 1>March 4th,</v>

323
00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.090
<v Speaker 1>2018 bye bye.</v>
