1
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.100
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the great stories of Ma'am timed and it's,</v>

2
00:00:10.101 --> 00:00:10.934
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

3
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.240
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the only variant of this story.</v>

4
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.250
<v Speaker 1>There's many variants of it,</v>

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:16.143
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.480
<v Speaker 1>but this variant is useful for,</v>

7
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.770
<v Speaker 1>for our purposes.</v>

8
00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a story I stumbled across a long time ago.</v>

9
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

10
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you the second story first because I don't have the energy to</v>

11
00:00:30.121 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>tell you the first story.</v>

12
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.260
<v Speaker 1>So this is a story that the ancient Egyptians predicated their society on.</v>

13
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>And to understand this story,</v>

14
00:00:38.911 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>the first thing you have to know is what the characters were in.</v>

15
00:00:41.251 --> 00:00:42.540
<v Speaker 1>These characters were gods.</v>

16
00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.973
<v Speaker 1>There's four of them.</v>

17
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.980
<v Speaker 1>Although the Egyptians had far more than four gods.</v>

18
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>You might think of these as the central gods.</v>

19
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.121
<v Speaker 1>And you might think,</v>

20
00:00:51.121 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>what is the central God?</v>

21
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>And then you might think,</v>

22
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:53.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

23
00:00:53.671 --> 00:00:57.690
<v Speaker 1>imagine that the gods compete for dominance across time and people's</v>

24
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.690
<v Speaker 1>imaginations and some gods win.</v>

25
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>And they occupied the primary position of dominance in the hierarchy,</v>

26
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>in the dominance hierarchy of gods.</v>

27
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.440
<v Speaker 1>And those are ideals and ideals compete across time for dominance and their</v>

28
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:13.554
<v Speaker 1>embodied.</v>

29
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.310
<v Speaker 1>And so when diverse tribal people come together,</v>

30
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.840
<v Speaker 1>they throw all their gods into the ring and they fight across time and something</v>

31
00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>emerges as a victor,</v>

32
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.450
<v Speaker 1>and that's the emergence of monotheism out of polytheism and it,</v>

33
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 1>it parallels the development of our unified morality in within each of us as we</v>

34
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:35.940
<v Speaker 1>develop across time</v>

35
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:40.550
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

36
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.550
<v Speaker 1>the god that emerges as dominant across time bears a substantial represent a</v>

37
00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:47.140
<v Speaker 1>substantial</v>

38
00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>resemblance.</v>

39
00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you have a set of gods in this locale that are competing across time and</v>

40
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:54.400
<v Speaker 1>something emerges as dominant.</v>

41
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>And then over here you have another set of gods that compete across time for</v>

42
00:01:58.061 --> 00:01:59.410
<v Speaker 1>dominance and something emerges.</v>

43
00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 1>You'll see major commonalities across the two things that emerge.</v>

44
00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:05.920
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because the emergent,</v>

45
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>the process of emergence that gives rise to both of them is similar in both</v>

46
00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:10.294
<v Speaker 1>situations.</v>

47
00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 1>And that's part of what accounts for the cross cultural similarity of high order</v>

48
00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:17.950
<v Speaker 1>religious ideas.</v>

49
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.880
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

50
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.400
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

51
00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.740
<v Speaker 1>you need to know the characters.</v>

52
00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

53
00:02:21.731 --> 00:02:26.530
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus Cyrus is the old king.</v>

54
00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.031
<v Speaker 1>He's Dumbledore.</v>

55
00:02:28.031 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>For all intents and purposes,</v>

56
00:02:29.261 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 1>he's the old king.</v>

57
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.443
<v Speaker 1>He's the,</v>

58
00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.313
<v Speaker 1>he's the,</v>

59
00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.320
<v Speaker 1>the spirit that established the Egyptian state.</v>

60
00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:35.981
<v Speaker 1>When he was young,</v>

61
00:02:35.981 --> 00:02:36.880
<v Speaker 1>he was a great hero.</v>

62
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:39.280
<v Speaker 1>But now he's old and he's Wilf,</v>

63
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.560
<v Speaker 1>he's archaic and he's willfully blind.</v>

64
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.250
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

65
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.083
<v Speaker 1>oh Cyrus.</v>

66
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.501
<v Speaker 1>He has a brother,</v>

67
00:02:44.501 --> 00:02:45.334
<v Speaker 1>Seth.</v>

68
00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Seth is set and set is Satan because the word Satan comes from the word Seth and</v>

69
00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:54.520
<v Speaker 1>set via the Coptic Christians.</v>

70
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.360
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

71
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

72
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.960
<v Speaker 1>so he's a precursor to the western idea.</v>

73
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.913
<v Speaker 1>Satan,</v>

74
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.420
<v Speaker 1>you have isis.</v>

75
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Isis is queen of the underworld and Isis was the goddess of a religious</v>

76
00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>structure that</v>

77
00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>okay</v>

78
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 1>prevailed across thousands and thousands of years.</v>

79
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>Isis and you have Horace.</v>

80
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Horace is a Falcon and the Egyptian I,</v>

81
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.260
<v Speaker 1>everyone's knows that I write the eye with the open pupil.</v>

82
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.183
<v Speaker 1>That's Horace.</v>

83
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>And Horace is a fall can because falcons can see way better.</v>

84
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.810
<v Speaker 1>They can see better than us.</v>

85
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:31.540
<v Speaker 1>They can see better than anything else except for perhaps eagles.</v>

86
00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>And they fly above everything is a zoo in the lion.</v>

87
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 1>King is Horace,</v>

88
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

89
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.280
<v Speaker 1>And Move Fossa is,</v>

90
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.581
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

91
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus and scar is Seth</v>

92
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.210
<v Speaker 1>and there's no specific representation of Isis.</v>

93
00:03:49.211 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>But the closest there is in that story is probably the queen of the hyenas.</v>

94
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.470
<v Speaker 1>That's played by a WHO's the actress?</v>

95
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>Um hmm.</v>

96
00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.981
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

97
00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:00.814
<v Speaker 1>Whoopi Goldberg.</v>

98
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.331
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

99
00:04:01.331 --> 00:04:01.781
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

100
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>Because she,</v>

101
00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:03.280
<v Speaker 1>they inhabit,</v>

102
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>she's like the queen of the underworld,</v>

103
00:04:05.081 --> 00:04:05.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

104
00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.770
<v Speaker 1>She's the queen of the hyenas that live out among the death.</v>

105
00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.611
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>

106
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

107
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.093
<v Speaker 1>Seth.</v>

108
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.321
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

109
00:04:12.321 --> 00:04:13.154
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus.</v>

110
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.013
<v Speaker 1>Seth,</v>

111
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:16.101
<v Speaker 1>are you,</v>

112
00:04:16.101 --> 00:04:17.090
<v Speaker 1>so send Horace,</v>

113
00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.740
<v Speaker 1>here's how the story goes.</v>

114
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

115
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:21.650
<v Speaker 1>serious is a great king.</v>

116
00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.210
<v Speaker 1>He established the Egyptian state.</v>

117
00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:25.880
<v Speaker 1>You could think about him as the embodiment of the,</v>

118
00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.710
<v Speaker 1>of Egyptian custom and tradition.</v>

119
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.310
<v Speaker 1>You could think about him as the thing that the pyramid represents.</v>

120
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.240
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>

121
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.100
<v Speaker 1>But he was great when he was young,</v>

122
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:35.210
<v Speaker 1>but he's not young anymore.</v>

123
00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:37.760
<v Speaker 1>He's old and he's willfully blind.</v>

124
00:04:37.761 --> 00:04:40.460
<v Speaker 1>And what that means is that he doesn't see what he could see.</v>

125
00:04:40.461 --> 00:04:42.260
<v Speaker 1>He refuses to see what he could see.</v>

126
00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Why is ocirus old and willfully blind?</v>

127
00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.550
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what culture is.</v>

128
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.060
<v Speaker 1>It's a paternal spirit that's old and willfully blind.</v>

129
00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:51.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's always that way,</v>

130
00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:52.310
<v Speaker 1>always that way.</v>

131
00:04:52.311 --> 00:04:55.070
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because it's a construction of the dad.</v>

132
00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.720
<v Speaker 1>The Dad aren't alive.</v>

133
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.230
<v Speaker 1>They can't,</v>

134
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.640
<v Speaker 1>so they're out of date and they can't update themselves anymore and you inhabit</v>

135
00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:02.474
<v Speaker 1>their corpse.</v>

136
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.720
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually what happens in an earlier story that I'll tell you next</v>

137
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.270
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

138
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.640
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] early Mesopotamian gods inhabited the corpse of their father,</v>

139
00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.620
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking anyway,</v>

140
00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:13.310
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

141
00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.461
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

142
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:15.920
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus was great and when he was young,</v>

143
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Speaker 1>but he hasn't young anymore.</v>

144
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:18.530
<v Speaker 1>He's old and he's willfully blind.</v>

145
00:05:18.531 --> 00:05:20.480
<v Speaker 1>He won't look where he knows he should look.</v>

146
00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't have the energy or maybe he doesn't have the spirit.</v>

147
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.960
<v Speaker 1>His brother Seth is not a good guy and was,</v>

148
00:05:26.961 --> 00:05:27.771
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus knows it,</v>

149
00:05:27.771 --> 00:05:32.300
<v Speaker 1>but he underestimates his malevolence and power and so Seth wants to rule the</v>

150
00:05:32.301 --> 00:05:33.134
<v Speaker 1>kingdom.</v>

151
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:34.220
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

152
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.150
<v Speaker 1>It's easy.</v>

153
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Every stable society is,</v>

154
00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.690
<v Speaker 1>is threatened by willful blindness and malevolence always.</v>

155
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>Every bureaucracy has that proclivity to stagnate and to become blind.</v>

156
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.010
<v Speaker 1>That's why corporations die all the time.</v>

157
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:52.790
<v Speaker 1>That's why a fortune 500 company only lasts 30 years.</v>

158
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.680
<v Speaker 1>It's why we have to have elections.</v>

159
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.580
<v Speaker 1>It's to stop the Dad from staying control for too long.</v>

160
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Seth,</v>

161
00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.561
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

162
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus turns a blind eye to Seth.</v>

163
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:03.380
<v Speaker 1>Seth is happy about that.</v>

164
00:06:03.381 --> 00:06:04.820
<v Speaker 1>Same thing happens in the lion king,</v>

165
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:05.660
<v Speaker 1>roughly speaking.</v>

166
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Seth one day waits for a Cyrus to make a mistake and to be weak,</v>

167
00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>and he attacks him and he chops them up into pieces and he distributes the</v>

168
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.430
<v Speaker 1>pieces across the entire Egyptian state.</v>

169
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.001
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

170
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptians regarded their provinces as pieces of,</v>

171
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:20.331
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

172
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus's body.</v>

173
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.521
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

174
00:06:22.521 --> 00:06:26.090
<v Speaker 1>so now you can't kill our Cyrus because he's a god.</v>

175
00:06:26.091 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 1>And why is he god a God?</v>

176
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Because he represents the spirit of structure and there's always structure.</v>

177
00:06:32.511 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>It can't be destroyed.</v>

178
00:06:33.771 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 1>It always reconstitutes itself.</v>

179
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.270
<v Speaker 1>It can be hurt and broken into pieces,</v>

180
00:06:38.271 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what happens to a Cyrus.</v>

181
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart.</v>

182
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:42.583
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

183
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 1>Because they get old and because malevolence undermines them.</v>

184
00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Egyptians were trying to sort it out.</v>

185
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.071
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:51.690
<v Speaker 1>So Seth distributors though,</v>

187
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus all over Egypt,</v>

188
00:06:52.911 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 1>so he can't get himself back together.</v>

189
00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

190
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Things fall apart and they can't be brought back together.</v>

191
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.281
<v Speaker 1>But the spirit of,</v>

192
00:07:00.281 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

193
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Sarah's still lives in the pieces.</v>

194
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>

195
00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Orders demolished.</v>

196
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.990
<v Speaker 1>What would you expect?</v>

197
00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Chaos emerges.</v>

198
00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.293
<v Speaker 1>That's isis.</v>

199
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Isis as queen of the underworld.</v>

200
00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.690
<v Speaker 1>She's well Cyrus's wife order and chaos.</v>

201
00:07:14.691 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>Just like the Yin and the Yang order collapses.</v>

202
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Up comes the queen of the underworld.</v>

203
00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:21.290
<v Speaker 1>She's looking for order.</v>

204
00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Chaos cries out for order.</v>

205
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.930
<v Speaker 1>She's looking for order.</v>

206
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.920
<v Speaker 1>She goes all around Egypt trying to put ice.</v>

207
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 1>So Cyrus back together.</v>

208
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a state of chaos.</v>

209
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 1>She finds this Fellas,</v>

210
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.560
<v Speaker 1>she makes herself pregnant with it.</v>

211
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>

212
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:35.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

213
00:07:35.601 --> 00:07:38.290
<v Speaker 1>it means it's like it's like Japan.</v>

214
00:07:38.291 --> 00:07:38.440
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

215
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 1>in the belly of the whale.</v>

216
00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>That thing has the potential to reemerge this,</v>

217
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.830
<v Speaker 1>the thing that collapses into its pieces,</v>

218
00:07:45.831 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>it's still alive.</v>

219
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.540
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

220
00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:51.050
<v Speaker 1>it can unite with the chaos and produce something new.</v>

221
00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:54.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of the dissolution of structure into chaos.</v>

222
00:07:54.861 --> 00:07:56.120
<v Speaker 1>And then it's reverification.</v>

223
00:07:57.890 --> 00:07:59.240
<v Speaker 1>Isis makes herself pregnant.</v>

224
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 1>She goes back down to the underworld.</v>

225
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:02.060
<v Speaker 1>She gives birth to Horace.</v>

226
00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.430
<v Speaker 1>Horace is the Egyptian I,</v>

227
00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>he's the son of the great father and the great mother.</v>

228
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.240
<v Speaker 1>He's a,</v>

229
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.800
<v Speaker 1>he's a messianic figure.</v>

230
00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:10.634
<v Speaker 1>And in fact,</v>

231
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:15.670
<v Speaker 1>much of the mythology that described Horace was extracted without much</v>

232
00:08:16.221 --> 00:08:19.790
<v Speaker 1>modification and then attributed to Christ very much maybe.</v>

233
00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:20.191
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

234
00:08:20.191 --> 00:08:21.550
<v Speaker 1>you can read about the parallels.</v>

235
00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>You can read about it online if you want.</v>

236
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 1>There's any number of parallels.</v>

237
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>And of course there is a methodology that the Jews came out of Egypt and of</v>

238
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>course the Christians emerged from the juice.</v>

239
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And so there was a tremendous influence of Egyptian thinking on the development</v>

240
00:08:34.671 --> 00:08:35.780
<v Speaker 1>of these later ideas.</v>

241
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And you see pictures of Isis with Horace on her lap that are virtually identical</v>

242
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:45.110
<v Speaker 1>in content and form to the later pictures of Mary with the Intranet Christ.</v>

243
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.080
<v Speaker 1>But that's the holy mother of God and the hero.</v>

244
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:48.340
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

245
00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.970
<v Speaker 1>it's not a Christian motif.</v>

246
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.040
<v Speaker 1>It's far deeper than a Christian motif.</v>

247
00:08:52.041 --> 00:08:53.240
<v Speaker 1>It's a human motif.</v>

248
00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:54.501
<v Speaker 1>So Isis,</v>

249
00:08:54.501 --> 00:08:59.501
<v Speaker 1>queen of the gives birth to Horace and Horace grows up outside the kingdom.</v>

250
00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:00.623
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

251
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.613
<v Speaker 1>In underworld?</v>

252
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what human beings do.</v>

253
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>You're alienated from your culture always.</v>

254
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.540
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

255
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.570
<v Speaker 1>It's old and dead and corrupt.</v>

256
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 1>And so that leaves you growing up in chaos.</v>

257
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

258
00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>what would you call alienated from your fundamental culture?</v>

259
00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:18.060
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of adolescence.</v>

260
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Horace grows up,</v>

261
00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.490
<v Speaker 1>he can see that's what differentiates them from old Cyrus.</v>

262
00:09:23.491 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>That's why he's a falcon.</v>

263
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>He goes and has a fight with Seth.</v>

264
00:09:26.791 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 1>And now the difference between those Cyrusone and Horace is that horse does not</v>

265
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:31.770
<v Speaker 1>or underestimates Seth.</v>

266
00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 1>He knows exactly what he's up against and he goes and has a terrible battle with</v>

267
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:36.840
<v Speaker 1>him trying to get his kingdom back.</v>

268
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Something else that's echoed in the lion king story and well,</v>

269
00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:41.620
<v Speaker 1>Horace An and,</v>

270
00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:42.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

271
00:09:42.041 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

272
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Seth are fighting Seth terrorists out one of his eyes.</v>

273
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:46.681
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

274
00:09:46.681 --> 00:09:47.514
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

275
00:09:48.330 --> 00:09:52.050
<v Speaker 1>Because Seth is the embodiment of destruction and malevolence and no matter how</v>

276
00:09:52.051 --> 00:09:53.250
<v Speaker 1>conscious you are,</v>

277
00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.710
<v Speaker 1>if you encounter that even voluntarily,</v>

278
00:09:55.711 --> 00:10:00.150
<v Speaker 1>the probability that it's going to damage your consciousness is extraordinarily</v>

279
00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:00.720
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

280
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.150
<v Speaker 1>That's why people don't do it,</v>

281
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 1>so the eyes torn out,</v>

282
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:10.760
<v Speaker 1>but Seth is defeated and Horace banishes him to the nether regions of the</v>

283
00:10:10.831 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 1>kingdom.</v>

284
00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 1>You can't kill him.</v>

285
00:10:12.750 --> 00:10:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

286
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Because the malevolent,</v>

287
00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.730
<v Speaker 1>destructive force,</v>

288
00:10:15.731 --> 00:10:17.700
<v Speaker 1>the threatened states never dies.</v>

289
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 1>It's always there.</v>

290
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.650
<v Speaker 1>You can only remove it temporarily.</v>

291
00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 1>Now Horace is King Pharaoh,</v>

292
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:26.910
<v Speaker 1>King God,</v>

293
00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:29.100
<v Speaker 1>he's got his eye and so you think,</v>

294
00:10:29.101 --> 00:10:29.281
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

295
00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:32.580
<v Speaker 1>he's going to just pop that back in his hand and then he's going to be able to</v>

296
00:10:32.581 --> 00:10:33.414
<v Speaker 1>lead.</v>

297
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.290
<v Speaker 1>He's going to be able to take his place at the upper most pantheon,</v>

298
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 1>pantheon of gods properly.</v>

299
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.820
<v Speaker 1>But that isn't what he does.</v>

300
00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.420
<v Speaker 1>He takes his eye and he goes back to the underworld,</v>

301
00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>just like Pinocchio,</v>

302
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:48.090
<v Speaker 1>going into the depths to rescue,</v>

303
00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:48.750
<v Speaker 1>to pedal.</v>

304
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:50.880
<v Speaker 1>And down there is the spirit of all Cyrus,</v>

305
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:51.480
<v Speaker 1>who's,</v>

306
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 1>who's extent as a kind of half dad ghost</v>

307
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.760
<v Speaker 1>and it gives us,</v>

308
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:57.860
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

309
00:10:57.860 --> 00:10:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Cyrus's I</v>

310
00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:00.591
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

311
00:11:00.591 --> 00:11:00.711
<v Speaker 1>we'll,</v>

312
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:00.971
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

313
00:11:00.971 --> 00:11:01.804
<v Speaker 1>Russ can see.</v>

314
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.320
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

315
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.090
<v Speaker 1>You go down into the chaotic when threatened by malevolence,</v>

316
00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>even to the point of damage to your consciousness.</v>

317
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.900
<v Speaker 1>You go down into the chaos and you find the dead spirit of your tradition and</v>

318
00:11:18.901 --> 00:11:23.901
<v Speaker 1>you give it vision and so provided with vision or Cyrus regenerates.</v>

319
00:11:24.751 --> 00:11:27.300
<v Speaker 1>And then it was Cyrus and Horace go back up to,</v>

320
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:27.990
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

321
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 1>to the world linked together and rule jointly.</v>

322
00:11:33.390 --> 00:11:38.390
<v Speaker 1>And the Egyptians believed that the Pharaoh who had an immortal spirit was the</v>

323
00:11:39.121 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of the conjunction of Horace and or Cyrus.</v>

324
00:11:42.930 --> 00:11:44.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's what gave him sovereignty.</v>

325
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.430
<v Speaker 1>And so you think about how brilliant that is.</v>

326
00:11:47.431 --> 00:11:50.490
<v Speaker 1>The Egyptians are trying to puzzle out who should lead,</v>

327
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.140
<v Speaker 1>who should be feral and what do you have to be?</v>

328
00:11:53.141 --> 00:11:54.130
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be pharaoh,</v>

329
00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:55.570
<v Speaker 1>in order for things to work,</v>

330
00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:01.980
<v Speaker 1>you have to be awake to malevolence and chaos and you have to embody your</v>

331
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:08.461
<v Speaker 1>tradition and that puts you at the highest pinnacle of the dominant structure.</v>

332
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:09.640
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

333
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>and that's the same as,</v>

334
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>it's the same thing.</v>

335
00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.970
<v Speaker 1>It's the same thing as the battle between the gods across centuries or Ian's and</v>

336
00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:23.731
<v Speaker 1>the emergence of the highest possible moral virtue as a consequence of that</v>

337
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:24.873
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

338
00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:28.270
<v Speaker 1>It's the eye on the top of the pyramid,</v>

339
00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

340
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.680
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

341
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:12:30.021 --> 00:12:33.280
<v Speaker 1>on the Washington monument there's a cap on the Washington monument.</v>

343
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.040
<v Speaker 1>The top of the Washington monument is a pyramid.</v>

344
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 1>At the top of the pyramid is a cap.</v>

345
00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>It's made out of aluminum.</v>

346
00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's made out of aluminum is because when they made the</v>

347
00:12:42.011 --> 00:12:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Washington monument,</v>

348
00:12:42.941 --> 00:12:45.160
<v Speaker 1>it was the most valuable metal known.</v>

349
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>And so what does it mean?</v>

350
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>It means there's a pyramid and there's something up the top of it.</v>

351
00:12:49.721 --> 00:12:53.500
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's a tall at the top of the pyramid isn't the same as the rest</v>

352
00:12:53.501 --> 00:12:54.334
<v Speaker 1>of the pyramid.</v>

353
00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.690
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>

354
00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 1>The pyramid exists.</v>

355
00:12:57.221 --> 00:12:58.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a dominance hierarchy.</v>

356
00:12:58.331 --> 00:12:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Something climbs up to the top,</v>

357
00:12:59.831 --> 00:13:02.590
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just at the top of one pyramid.</v>

358
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.570
<v Speaker 1>It's at the top of all of them.</v>

359
00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:08.680
<v Speaker 1>The thing that rises to the top at any given pyramid is the same thing that can</v>

360
00:13:08.681 --> 00:13:10.120
<v Speaker 1>dominate all pyramids.</v>

361
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:15.430
<v Speaker 1>It isn't good enough to be the best at a dominance hierarchy.</v>

362
00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 1>What do you want to be is the best at the set of all possible dominance</v>

363
00:13:19.601 --> 00:13:20.434
<v Speaker 1>hierarchies,</v>

364
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:22.330
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

365
00:13:22.330 --> 00:13:24.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's the thing that's gold at the top of the pyramid.</v>

366
00:13:24.911 --> 00:13:25.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's the eye.</v>

367
00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:27.640
<v Speaker 1>That's what the Egyptians figured out.</v>

368
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.570
<v Speaker 1>And what does that mean?</v>

369
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:33.310
<v Speaker 1>It means the thing that puts you at the top is attention,</v>

370
00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.050
<v Speaker 1>pay attention,</v>

371
00:13:35.290 --> 00:13:36.370
<v Speaker 1>keep your eyes open.</v>

372
00:13:36.371 --> 00:13:37.840
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same as thinking.</v>

373
00:13:38.770 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 1>It's not the same thing.</v>

374
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like watching.</v>

375
00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:45.490
<v Speaker 1>And the thing about human beings is we can see,</v>

376
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.530
<v Speaker 1>we can see better than any other creature except birds of prey.</v>

377
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:55.750
<v Speaker 1>And so our capacity to see is in fact what we use in the world.</v>

378
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.970
<v Speaker 1>Our brains are actually organized around vision.</v>

379
00:13:57.971 --> 00:13:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Unlike most animals,</v>

380
00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:00.640
<v Speaker 1>their brains are organized around smell,</v>

381
00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:01.593
<v Speaker 1>not us.</v>

382
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:03.530
<v Speaker 1>We can see we stand up,</v>

383
00:14:03.531 --> 00:14:03.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:14:03.761 --> 00:14:08.020
<v Speaker 1>So we can see a long distance and in our ability to see is what saves us and</v>

385
00:14:08.021 --> 00:14:09.310
<v Speaker 1>what saves our communities.</v>

386
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:12.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's what these stories are trying to portray.</v>

387
00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

388
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:14.621
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

389
00:14:14.621 --> 00:14:14.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

390
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.480
<v Speaker 1>why didn't people just say so?</v>

391
00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is because they didn't know</v>

392
00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:23.840
<v Speaker 1>it took a long time to figure it out forever.</v>

393
00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.270
<v Speaker 1>It's taken forever to figure it out.</v>

394
00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:29.120
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

395
00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.710
<v Speaker 1>it's part of what I hoped when I wrote this book.</v>

396
00:14:32.711 --> 00:14:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

397
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:36.880
<v Speaker 1>and part of the reason that I'm teaching it is because it seems to me that it</v>

398
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:41.320
<v Speaker 1>would be useful for everyone to actually understand this instead of just having</v>

399
00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:42.610
<v Speaker 1>it told as a story.</v>

400
00:14:42.611 --> 00:14:42.911
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

401
00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:43.541
<v Speaker 1>that's great,</v>

402
00:14:43.541 --> 00:14:43.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

403
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

404
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:45.280
<v Speaker 1>you need the story,</v>

405
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:47.980
<v Speaker 1>but why not also just understand it.</v>

406
00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.673
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

407
00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:53.280
<v Speaker 1>muscle,</v>

408
00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.330
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're trying to do.</v>

409
00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:55.950
<v Speaker 1>We're trying to understand this</v>

410
00:14:57.450 --> 00:14:57.870
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>
