1
00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:04.700
<v Speaker 1>So the question is Pontius Pilate,</v>

2
00:00:04.701 --> 00:00:05.311
<v Speaker 1>this question,</v>

3
00:00:05.311 --> 00:00:07.320
<v Speaker 1>the first postmodernist what is truth?</v>

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And it was taken up many times,</v>

5
00:00:10.351 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>but by nature and the genealogy of morals were all truth is interpretation.</v>

6
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>And of course this is not the case with Nisha and anybody who follows him as you</v>

7
00:00:18.091 --> 00:00:18.924
<v Speaker 1>pointed out,</v>

8
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>because that's somebody else's truth,</v>

9
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>that there is no truth and therefore what do you do with that?</v>

10
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.800
<v Speaker 1>And you're into the problem of the creek and liar.</v>

11
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>But here is the problem for me even with your talk,</v>

12
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>which is as usual,</v>

13
00:00:30.961 --> 00:00:35.460
<v Speaker 1>brilliant and I think grounded and and tremendous amount of factual information.</v>

14
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>I was asked once after a book of mine came out,</v>

15
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>which was contested hottie by many people.</v>

16
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.030
<v Speaker 1>What gave me the right to think I had the truth.</v>

17
00:00:45.031 --> 00:00:48.150
<v Speaker 1>This was an interviewer in Toronto for the Random House thing.</v>

18
00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.960
<v Speaker 1>And why did I think what I was saying was true.</v>

19
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>Who was I to say that I had the truth and I said I don't have the truth and I</v>

20
00:00:57.901 --> 00:01:01.050
<v Speaker 1>have to come up with some explanation quickly and some kind of phrase.</v>

21
00:01:01.051 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>And it just occurred to me.</v>

22
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:02.191
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

23
00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:06.630
<v Speaker 1>all I have is this credible verisimilitude what is credible?</v>

24
00:01:06.631 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>Various similitude he wanted to know.</v>

25
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.870
<v Speaker 1>I said a,</v>

26
00:01:09.871 --> 00:01:13.320
<v Speaker 1>it depends on gathering as much evidence as you possibly can,</v>

27
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.930
<v Speaker 1>even if you have to counter your own biases,</v>

28
00:01:15.931 --> 00:01:20.931
<v Speaker 1>you just said with as least at least amount of deceit or self self-indulgence as</v>

29
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:21.984
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

30
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>And the second factor is common sense,</v>

31
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>which seems to be not so common these days.</v>

32
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>So if you can put evidence and common sense together and at the same time try</v>

33
00:01:32.551 --> 00:01:35.370
<v Speaker 1>and Marshall and monitor your own proclivities,</v>

34
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.020
<v Speaker 1>I went right,</v>

35
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>but that was hard with my book as I was left before I could go right.</v>

36
00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.080
<v Speaker 1>And I had to make that decision.</v>

37
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.310
<v Speaker 1>Do I want to go right and lose all my friends or do I want to stay left?</v>

38
00:01:47.311 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

39
00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.750
<v Speaker 1>I have Catherine and join my friends and saw I had to go right?</v>

40
00:01:51.751 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what the evidence told me against my own desires.</v>

41
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>So honesty,</v>

42
00:01:56.161 --> 00:01:57.150
<v Speaker 1>if you can manage it,</v>

43
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.200
<v Speaker 1>evidence and common sense,</v>

44
00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:02.250
<v Speaker 1>but here's the problem.</v>

45
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.563
<v Speaker 1>Truths,</v>

46
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>it's still there.</v>

47
00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>How do you get from credible,</v>

48
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>various similitude to truth.</v>

49
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.340
<v Speaker 1>Where is the bridge?</v>

50
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.203
<v Speaker 1>How do you get there?</v>

51
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can say that.</v>

52
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Ultimately,</v>

53
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

54
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.351
<v Speaker 1>the problem,</v>

55
00:02:16.351 --> 00:02:17.580
<v Speaker 1>I think you can,</v>

56
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>you can say certain things are true,</v>

57
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:19.900
<v Speaker 1>certain dates et Cetera,</v>

58
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>said certain things of happens with men have suffered as a result of feminism.</v>

59
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>All of this is true,</v>

60
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>but where truth seems to founders,</v>

61
00:02:26.671 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>when you enter the realm of,</v>

62
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:32.931
<v Speaker 1>because who has the truth to explain why feminism developed in the way it did or</v>

63
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 1>why climate warming or global warming developed in the way it did.</v>

64
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.680
<v Speaker 1>We can point out the facts,</v>

65
00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:41.221
<v Speaker 1>this is wrong,</v>

66
00:02:41.221 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>this is wrong,</v>

67
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.563
<v Speaker 1>this is happening.</v>

68
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>But when you get out of the element,</v>

69
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>the region of events and into the region of the causes,</v>

70
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the bridge,</v>

71
00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.670
<v Speaker 1>the gap from credible,</v>

72
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.230
<v Speaker 1>various similitude to truth.</v>

73
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>And I frankly don't know how to manage that.</v>

74
00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.260
<v Speaker 1>So the conclusion I'm coming to is a little bit different from your conclusion.</v>

75
00:03:02.261 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>It's not the one that I want to come to and I would like to resist it,</v>

76
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.130
<v Speaker 1>but the conclusion I'm coming to is quite simply we're fucked.</v>

77
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.041
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

78
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:13.180
<v Speaker 2>But that's always been true,</v>

79
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:13.451
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

80
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:14.980
<v Speaker 2>That's the apocalypse is always,</v>

81
00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.790
<v Speaker 2>that's why the apocalypse is eternal because the world's always coming to an end</v>

82
00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.240
<v Speaker 2>and it's actually true small ways and in great ways.</v>

83
00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I mean with regards to your,</v>

84
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.700
<v Speaker 2>your ideas about truth,</v>

85
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.130
<v Speaker 2>I would say that like language,</v>

86
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.560
<v Speaker 2>truth is more like a process.</v>

87
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 2>And I would say it's,</v>

88
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

89
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a process that you actually embody rather than conceptualize abstractly to,</v>

90
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.740
<v Speaker 2>one of the ways I've thought about it is that if you're seeking the truth and</v>

91
00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 2>what you don't know is more important to you than what you know,</v>

92
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 2>and that's a fundamental orientation,</v>

93
00:03:49.931 --> 00:03:50.171
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

94
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

95
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:51.431
<v Speaker 2>what I'm doing,</v>

96
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 2>what I've been doing since September,</v>

97
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:55.720
<v Speaker 2>and I've had friends who've been helping me with this,</v>

98
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:58.510
<v Speaker 2>but I think I've been doing this for a long time as I'm trying to figure out</v>

99
00:03:58.511 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>where I'm wrong.</v>

100
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm watching the audience to see if I'm making a mistake.</v>

101
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening to my friends who are watching my youtube videos telling me what</v>

102
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:10.531
<v Speaker 2>I'm a little too angry maybe or maybe too pompous or too noisy or you know,</v>

103
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 2>all the different ways that you can fail in front of an audience.</v>

104
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm listening to them and listening to the comments and I'm trying to modify</v>

105
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 2>myself accordingly.</v>

106
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.451
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

107
00:04:19.451 --> 00:04:23.920
<v Speaker 2>And so you live in error and strive towards the truth and it's in that striving</v>

108
00:04:23.921 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 2>that the truth is most accurately embodied.</v>

109
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 2>But then I would also say one other thing,</v>

110
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I like about the existentialists is that,</v>

111
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.451
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:31.840
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

113
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.770
<v Speaker 2>there's a kind of emphasis on pragmatic truth among the existentialists because</v>

114
00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 2>they claim that your truth is something that you should act out,</v>

115
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 2>not merely hold.</v>

116
00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 2>Because to act out is to believe that it's a definition,</v>

117
00:04:44.381 --> 00:04:44.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

118
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.831
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

119
00:04:44.831 --> 00:04:45.041
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

120
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:45.401
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>

121
00:04:45.401 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 2>it's not precisely a proposition,</v>

122
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:47.770
<v Speaker 2>it's a definition.</v>

123
00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 2>And so I found some things that I was confident in,</v>

124
00:04:52.211 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 2>enough into risk acting out.</v>

125
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 2>And so that's what I'm doing to the best of my ability.</v>

126
00:04:58.871 --> 00:05:00.500
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm watching what happens and,</v>

127
00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.080
<v Speaker 2>and I'm watching what happens if other people act out the propositions and w as</v>

128
00:05:05.081 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 2>far as I can tell,</v>

129
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 2>so far so good.</v>

130
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.183
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

131
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

132
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.193
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

133
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say that my position right now is to be,</v>

134
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.570
<v Speaker 2>what would you envied?</v>

135
00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 2>It's very stressful.</v>

136
00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean since September,</v>

137
00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 2>I basically be in a position of</v>

138
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:27.130
<v Speaker 2>any mistake is fatal for for all intents and purposes,</v>

139
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.791
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

140
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:30.370
<v Speaker 2>and that's very stressful to be that hypervigilant.</v>

141
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.563
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

142
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.550
<v Speaker 2>but by the same token,</v>

143
00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 2>the public response to what I've been doing has been overwhelmingly positive.</v>

144
00:05:38.231 --> 00:05:38.411
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

145
00:05:38.411 --> 00:05:40.390
<v Speaker 2>I've only got three pieces of hate mail,</v>

146
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

147
00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 2>which just staggers me,</v>

148
00:05:42.371 --> 00:05:42.760
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

149
00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.031
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

150
00:05:43.031 --> 00:05:45.310
<v Speaker 2>and the comments on Youtube for example,</v>

151
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

152
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.290
<v Speaker 2>are like 50 to one positive and who,</v>

153
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 2>I mean who,</v>

154
00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:49.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

155
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:50.440
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a biased sample,</v>

156
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:51.340
<v Speaker 2>I can't tell but,</v>

157
00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.833
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

158
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing know I've been trying to rip holes in the ideas that I</v>

159
00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 2>presented to you today for really like with all my intellectual capability for</v>

160
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 2>as long.</v>

161
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 2>Every time I lecture I'm trying to do the same thing.</v>

162
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:06.501
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

163
00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 2>is there something in this that I haven't got right?</v>

164
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:09.981
<v Speaker 2>Cause I'm trying to,</v>

165
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to look for some,</v>

166
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 2>a rock at the bottom of things,</v>

167
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:14.204
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 2>and partly why I decided that I wasn't going to use those damn words is because</v>

169
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:22.100
<v Speaker 2>I think the rock at the bottom of things is honest speech.</v>

170
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.700
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that it,</v>

171
00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me to be right and that's good enough.</v>

172
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>So I'll act that out and see what happens as best I can.</v>

173
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:31.821
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

174
00:06:31.821 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 2>I'm not claiming to be,</v>

175
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 2>I'm not claiming to be any more honest than anyone else.</v>

176
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:36.711
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

177
00:06:36.711 --> 00:06:37.371
<v Speaker 2>seriously.</v>

178
00:06:37.371 --> 00:06:38.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

179
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.900
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>

180
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.260
<v Speaker 2>That's a big claim to make you better watch your bloody step if you're going to</v>

181
00:06:42.261 --> 00:06:43.094
<v Speaker 2>say that.</v>

182
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't mean I don't believe that arms speech is the pathway to</v>

183
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:48.321
<v Speaker 2>redemption,</v>

184
00:06:48.321 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 2>because I do believe that.</v>

185
00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.250
<v Speaker 2>So I know that's strange language,</v>

186
00:06:52.251 --> 00:06:54.020
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

187
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.890
<v Speaker 2>that's still,</v>

188
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 2>it's the most accurate language for that kind of conceptualization.</v>
