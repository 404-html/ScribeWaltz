1
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.810
<v Speaker 1>I think part of the problem with the classical media,</v>

2
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:10.590
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

3
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.430
<v Speaker 1>trying to make a transition to the digital age is that they have no idea what</v>

4
00:00:14.431 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 1>the digital media is.</v>

5
00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>I was watching an MSNBC,</v>

7
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>a clip the other day about this robot.</v>

8
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I think her name is Sophia,</v>

9
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.360
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

10
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

11
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.350
<v Speaker 1>who has a fairly advanced degree of artificial intelligence and who can manifest</v>

12
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.630
<v Speaker 1>pretty realistic human facial emotions.</v>

13
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.531
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

14
00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:32.364
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

15
00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.430
<v Speaker 1>it was a four minute clip and add a 32nd ad at the beginning of it and you</v>

16
00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>couldn't skip the ad.</v>

17
00:00:36.811 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>And I thought there's a real arrogance on the part of the MBA,</v>

18
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>ms NBC people to put that on youtube because anybody who's familiar with the</v>

19
00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.594
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

20
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.111
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

21
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>culture knows that what you get to put a ten second ad on and then you get to</v>

22
00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:52.530
<v Speaker 1>skip it after five seconds if you want.</v>

23
00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:57.390
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't ask people to pay 30 seconds of attention for four minutes of</v>

24
00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:57.900
<v Speaker 1>content.</v>

25
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>It violates the norms.</v>

26
00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And so it had only had about 12,000 views.</v>

27
00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.910
<v Speaker 1>And that's a really interesting example of Marshall Mcluhan's idea that the</v>

28
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.380
<v Speaker 1>medium is the message,</v>

29
00:01:07.381 --> 00:01:07.591
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

30
00:01:07.591 --> 00:01:09.810
<v Speaker 1>As you build a new technological infrastructure.</v>

31
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's sort of like the old thing because youtube is sort of like a TV</v>

32
00:01:13.891 --> 00:01:14.724
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>

33
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not like a TV network at all,</v>

34
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>partly for example,</v>

35
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:19.890
<v Speaker 1>because when you put something on Youtube,</v>

36
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:20.724
<v Speaker 1>it's permanent.</v>

37
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's way different than broadcast TV.</v>

38
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Like it's raw,</v>

39
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 1>it's seriously revolutionarily different.</v>

40
00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.883
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

41
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 1>and it's also the case too,</v>

42
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:35.490
<v Speaker 1>that this is a strange thing and I don't think the classic media understands</v>

43
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:35.941
<v Speaker 1>this either,</v>

44
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:38.610
<v Speaker 1>is that youtube people don't like high production values.</v>

45
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.151
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

46
00:01:39.151 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>they're very cynical about them.</v>

47
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's because they've come to identify advanced editing and Glitz</v>

48
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>as markers that the information is actually being manipulated,</v>

49
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>which of course it is now for better or worse.</v>

50
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean editing doesn't have to be manipulating,</v>

51
00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.670
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly can be.</v>

52
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.923
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

53
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.771
<v Speaker 1>and besides that,</v>

54
00:01:58.771 --> 00:02:02.730
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the more tech savvy people that watch youtube can duplicate those sort</v>

55
00:02:02.731 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>of special effects in their own home in half an hour.</v>

56
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>So they're not there.</v>

57
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>They're no longer markers of the kind of competence and technological prowess</v>

58
00:02:11.401 --> 00:02:15.030
<v Speaker 1>that would signal the sort of competence that you could trust.</v>

59
00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

60
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.320
<v Speaker 1>so what youtube viewers seem to like is basically ordinary people more or less</v>

61
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>trying to have an intelligent conversation about something confusing and</v>

62
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:31.821
<v Speaker 1>important and the attention span that people are willing to devote to that is</v>

63
00:02:31.981 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>actually quite remarkable for for a medium that was nothing but cute cat videos</v>

64
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>say five years ago.</v>

65
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.520
<v Speaker 1>The fact that like a lot of my lectures and like Joe Rogan's podcast like three</v>

66
00:02:41.521 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>hours long,</v>

67
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>it's like what the hell?</v>

68
00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>People weren't supposed to have that capacity to pay attention in this era of</v>

69
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>fragmented attention.</v>

70
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.801
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

71
00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:50.634
<v Speaker 1>in Rogan,</v>

72
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you know this or not,</v>

73
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 1>he has 120 million downloads a month now.</v>

74
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's 1.5 billion a year.</v>

75
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>And so the last time I saw him,</v>

76
00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>and that was with Brett who just spoke,</v>

77
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.893
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

78
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

79
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.560
<v Speaker 1>I asked him what it was like to be the most powerful interview or the world has</v>

80
00:03:08.561 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>ever seen because I think he probably is,</v>

81
00:03:10.811 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it and sheer numbers.</v>

82
00:03:12.281 --> 00:03:12.491
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:03:12.491 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>maybe Walter Cronkite back in the 60s had some comparable influence,</v>

84
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:17.530
<v Speaker 1>but he said,</v>

85
00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:18.700
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think about it.</v>

86
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.901
<v Speaker 1>And we're like,</v>

87
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

88
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is he supposed to think about it?</v>

89
00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>Because no one knows what to think about that.</v>

90
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And so he just has the conversations and posts them and way he goes,</v>

91
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>but he has no idea what role he's currently playing in society and we don't have</v>

92
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:36.550
<v Speaker 1>proper metrics for measuring it and we don't understand it at all.</v>

93
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.953
<v Speaker 1>So anyways,</v>

94
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I did these big idea lectures with,</v>

95
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.340
<v Speaker 1>with Whoa deck and,</v>

96
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

97
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>they were ranked on,</v>

98
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

99
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

100
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>the Dvo channel and the five lectures or six lectures I did all ended up in the</v>

101
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.201
<v Speaker 1>top 20,</v>

102
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:51.670
<v Speaker 1>which really surprised me.</v>

103
00:03:51.671 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>But it was an indication that there was something about what I was talking about</v>

104
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.070
<v Speaker 1>that for which there was a market.</v>

105
00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And now there's,</v>

106
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>there's some reasons for that.</v>

107
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:00.401
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

108
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:00.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

109
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:01.510
<v Speaker 1>when I.</v>
