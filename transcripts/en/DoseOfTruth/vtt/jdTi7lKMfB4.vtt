1
00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.040
<v Speaker 1>But the big three factors that I think are explaining,</v>

2
00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:12.620
<v Speaker 1>explaining what's happening on campus are one,</v>

3
00:00:12.621 --> 00:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>the loss of the unsupervised place so that the kids have always,</v>

4
00:00:16.371 --> 00:00:17.390
<v Speaker 1>there's always an adult present.</v>

5
00:00:17.391 --> 00:00:20.030
<v Speaker 1>And so they come to college and they expect there to be an adult or dean,</v>

6
00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>somebody if there's a conflict.</v>

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.363
<v Speaker 1>That's one.</v>

8
00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Two is social media which hit just as ign.</v>

9
00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So ign,</v>

10
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Internet generation.</v>

11
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:29.180
<v Speaker 1>This is Jeanne Twinkies work.</v>

12
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.871
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:29.871 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>we used to,</v>

14
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>we used to think that,</v>

15
00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.563
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

16
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.290
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

17
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.290
<v Speaker 1>we used to think that the millennial generation ends in 1998 or 2000 let Jean 20</v>

18
00:00:39.591 --> 00:00:43.100
<v Speaker 1>shows looking at for large datasets that birth year,</v>

19
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:47.750
<v Speaker 1>1995 kids born in 1995 and after are really different.</v>

20
00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:48.890
<v Speaker 1>They're values are different.</v>

21
00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>They have much higher rates of anxiety and depression,</v>

22
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:53.780
<v Speaker 1>especially the girls.</v>

23
00:00:53.781 --> 00:00:54.411
<v Speaker 1>Boys have gone up,</v>

24
00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:54.591
<v Speaker 1>grows,</v>

25
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:55.550
<v Speaker 1>are going way up.</v>

26
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.103
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

27
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>and the reason it seems to be that Facebook lowered its age.</v>

28
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.453
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

29
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.140
<v Speaker 1>so in 2005,</v>

30
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.580
<v Speaker 1>you had to be a college student at a certain number of colleges to get Facebook.</v>

31
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 1>In 2006 you could be any 11 year old who lies and says that she's 13 and you've</v>

32
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>got a Facebook account.</v>

33
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

35
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>but then you're using on your parent's PC,</v>

36
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.050
<v Speaker 1>it's in 2007 the iPhone comes out and it saturates the market fashion.</v>

37
00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.650
<v Speaker 1>Any consumer product ever has.</v>

38
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>So by 2010 or 11 a lot of adolescents have have Facebook and other social</v>

39
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>platforms and this is just devastating,</v>

40
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>especially to girls because it's not texting,</v>

41
00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 1>texting is just me to you.</v>

42
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:38.510
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

43
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:39.141
<v Speaker 1>that's back and forth.</v>

44
00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>That's fine that you know,</v>

45
00:01:40.221 --> 00:01:40.431
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

46
00:01:40.431 --> 00:01:40.971
<v Speaker 1>when we were kids,</v>

47
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:41.960
<v Speaker 1>you called your friends on the phone,</v>

48
00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:42.794
<v Speaker 1>that's fine.</v>

49
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>The problem seems to be according to 20 it's especially platforms in which he</v>

50
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:51.530
<v Speaker 1>puts something out and then you wait and see what everyone says and that</v>

51
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>especially as damaging to girls who already are at risk of eating disorders and</v>

52
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.983
<v Speaker 1>image disorders.</v>

53
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

54
00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 1>so girls become more susceptible to negative emotion when they hit puberty?</v>

55
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.711
<v Speaker 1>Well there,</v>

56
00:02:00.711 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

57
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.790
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

58
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.001
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

59
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:02.120
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

60
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.901
<v Speaker 1>That's always been the case.</v>

61
00:02:02.901 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Then there's another issue too with regards to female aggression.</v>

62
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.883
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

63
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.973
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>it's clearly the case that males are more likely to be physically damaging slash</v>

65
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:14.470
<v Speaker 1>aggressive than females are.</v>

66
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.710
<v Speaker 1>But what females use his reputation savaging that's right.</v>

67
00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's Nikki cricks work.</v>

68
00:02:18.741 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 1>Nikki Crick passed away a couple of years ago,</v>

69
00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>showed that if you add it all up,</v>

70
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>boys and girls equally aggressive,</v>

71
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.120
<v Speaker 1>but the boys aggression is more physical.</v>

72
00:02:26.121 --> 00:02:26.451
<v Speaker 1>The girls,</v>

73
00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:27.284
<v Speaker 1>the more relational.</v>

74
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>So if you imagine a bunch of 13,</v>

75
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:34.160
<v Speaker 1>14 year olds in their middle schools and then you parachute in a whole bunch of</v>

76
00:02:34.161 --> 00:02:34.994
<v Speaker 1>iPhones,</v>

77
00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>everybody's got one of their pots,</v>

78
00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.940
<v Speaker 1>what are the boys going to do?</v>

79
00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna play video games and that doesn't hurt anybody,</v>

80
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 1>but the girls are going to use it to amplify the social interactions.</v>

81
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>So this is 20 twenty's explanation.</v>

82
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it makes a lot of sense.</v>

83
00:02:47.481 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

84
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.781
<v Speaker 1>it's a catastrophe.</v>

85
00:02:48.781 --> 00:02:50.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a crisis and we're really hurting,</v>

86
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:51.740
<v Speaker 1>especially the girls.</v>

87
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

88
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.470
<v Speaker 1>so we've got to change something about that anyway.</v>

89
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:55.630
<v Speaker 1>But social media is,</v>

90
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>is possibly the largest single reason why things are going haywire.</v>

91
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.183
<v Speaker 1>Campus.</v>

92
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:01.610
<v Speaker 1>The third big factor,</v>

93
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>do you think it's primarily Facebook or can you tell?</v>

94
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.421
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:04.751
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

96
00:03:04.751 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>

97
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

98
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 1>the kids use a lot of different platforms,</v>

99
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>but from what I hear,</v>

100
00:03:08.921 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Instagram,</v>

101
00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.201
<v Speaker 1>Facebook,</v>

102
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>snapchat,</v>

103
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.851
<v Speaker 1>it again,</v>

104
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 1>the thing is it's one to many.</v>

105
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>That's what's bad.</v>

106
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.610
<v Speaker 1>It's anything if it,</v>

107
00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.081
<v Speaker 1>if it's,</v>

108
00:03:17.081 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>if it's you put something out there and you see how many people like it,</v>

109
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:21.140
<v Speaker 1>that's what's been right.</v>

110
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 1>And there's always the threat that it'll go viral and the terrible way.</v>

111
00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.561
<v Speaker 1>So that's right.</v>

112
00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>Hammer.</v>

113
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.863
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

114
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.590
<v Speaker 1>There's this sort of damage that's limited damage.</v>

115
00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.330
<v Speaker 1>Unlimited downside to saying something.</v>

116
00:03:31.331 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 1>So what do you do?</v>

117
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Careful.</v>

118
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.070
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know if I want to like that post because you know,</v>

119
00:03:36.071 --> 00:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I could get in big trouble for it.</v>

120
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

121
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:37.631
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

122
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 1>the benefit to liking it as minimal and the potential catastrophe for does</v>

123
00:03:40.931 --> 00:03:42.190
<v Speaker 1>unless you're expected to like it,</v>

124
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>in which case you better like it because if you don't like it,</v>

125
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:45.544
<v Speaker 1>you'll get in trouble.</v>

126
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.010
<v Speaker 1>So it's a much more of a mob mentality.</v>

127
00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:48.641
<v Speaker 1>Kids are afraid,</v>

128
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:48.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

129
00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I'm not blaming the kids,</v>

130
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sympathetic to them.</v>

131
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.611
<v Speaker 1>And these are my kids.</v>

132
00:03:51.611 --> 00:03:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Are My kids are 11 and seven,</v>

133
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come up into this.</v>

134
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

135
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.430
<v Speaker 1>so the kids have been raised in a,</v>

136
00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:58.440
<v Speaker 1>in a social environment,</v>

137
00:03:58.441 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>it's much more about mob,</v>

138
00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.940
<v Speaker 1>mob formation and mob attacks and Bob defend defenses against mobs.</v>

139
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.233
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

140
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

141
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>so the third factor then is the political polarization and that purification or</v>

142
00:04:09.641 --> 00:04:10.474
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

143
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.070
<v Speaker 1>So if you imagine coming up in the 90s when political polarization is going up,</v>

144
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 1>we're beginning to hate each other more across party lines,</v>

145
00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:18.820
<v Speaker 1>but it's not that hard.</v>

146
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.440
<v Speaker 1>Not that,</v>

147
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.273
<v Speaker 1>that nasty,</v>

148
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.310
<v Speaker 1>but it's been getting much,</v>

149
00:04:21.311 --> 00:04:22.210
<v Speaker 1>much more hostile.</v>

150
00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.010
<v Speaker 1>So that now if someone,</v>

151
00:04:24.011 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>like if someone's is,</v>

152
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.470
<v Speaker 1>if someone goes to a campus,</v>

153
00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:27.550
<v Speaker 1>Republicans meeting,</v>

154
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.160
<v Speaker 1>if it's a Democrat who goes to a meeting of the campus,</v>

155
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 1>Republicans has happened at UC Santa Cruz a couple weeks ago,</v>

156
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.233
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

157
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

158
00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>and someone finds out,</v>

159
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:36.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.320
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

161
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.700
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

162
00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.940
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

163
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.741
<v Speaker 1>the hatred,</v>

164
00:04:38.741 --> 00:04:41.890
<v Speaker 1>the Cross party hatred is so much stronger now.</v>

165
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 1>And many of our institutions are much pure.</v>

166
00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>So if you went to college in the 90s,</v>

167
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>there might've been a few conservative professors around,</v>

168
00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.350
<v Speaker 1>but now there aren't.</v>

169
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.951
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

170
00:04:50.951 --> 00:04:51.611
<v Speaker 1>as you said before,</v>

171
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.510
<v Speaker 1>it's like exposure therapy.</v>

172
00:04:52.511 --> 00:04:54.790
<v Speaker 1>If you've never encountered a conservative idea,</v>

173
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Speaker 1>and then a conservative like Heather MacDonald comes to speak on your campus.</v>

174
00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

175
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>this is like a major immune response problem.</v>

176
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:03.790
<v Speaker 1>We've got to get the tribe together and mob her and you know,</v>

177
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.713
<v Speaker 1>shut her down.</v>

178
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

179
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 1>so those are the,</v>

180
00:05:07.211 --> 00:05:07.361
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

181
00:05:07.361 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 1>there are many other reasons,</v>

182
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>but the loss of unsupervised play,</v>

183
00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>social media and rice and polarization,</v>

184
00:05:13.091 --> 00:05:14.080
<v Speaker 1>those are the three big ones.</v>
