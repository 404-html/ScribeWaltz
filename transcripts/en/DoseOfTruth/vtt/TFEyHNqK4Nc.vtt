00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Like I've often thought of rep of marriage as a wrestling match,</v>

2
00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:10.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:11.601
<v Speaker 1>If you're lucky,</v>

4
00:00:11.601 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>the person that you marry is someone you contend with.</v>

5
00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:15.470
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly,</v>

6
00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:17.000
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's exactly,</v>

7
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not tranquil.</v>

8
00:00:18.621 --> 00:00:19.454
<v Speaker 1>Precisely.</v>

9
00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 1>you might have noticed that some of you and,</v>

11
00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

12
00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is if you have something to contend against,</v>

13
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.230
<v Speaker 1>then that strengthens you and,</v>

14
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>and that's actually better than having nothing to contend against.</v>

15
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:39.071
<v Speaker 1>And so Jacob is the person who's also strengthened by the necessity of this</v>

16
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:44.870
<v Speaker 1>contending and that that seems to be the proper relationship with God or the</v>

17
00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:47.720
<v Speaker 1>angel is that contending the battling,</v>

18
00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

19
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>Rather than some sort of kind of loose,</v>

20
00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.040
<v Speaker 1>weak statement of belief.</v>

21
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to denigrate that to any great degree.</v>

23
00:00:58.311 --> 00:01:01.700
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't seem like the right motive conceptualization,</v>

24
00:01:01.701 --> 00:01:01.911
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:01.911 --> 00:01:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Because human beings aren't,</v>

26
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.910
<v Speaker 1>aren't like that were contentious creatures.</v>

27
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually seems to be something that meets with God's favor in this</v>

28
00:01:11.511 --> 00:01:12.141
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

29
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:16.400
<v Speaker 1>So especially given that that's actually what he names the while the whole</v>

30
00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:21.401
<v Speaker 1>kingdom of the chosen people is the idea is that that's composed of those who</v>

31
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>contend with God.</v>

32
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

33
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>that's a hell of an idea that that's for sure.</v>
