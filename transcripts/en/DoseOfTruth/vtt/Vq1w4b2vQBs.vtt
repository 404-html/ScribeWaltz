00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.760
<v Speaker 1>A story that we've been telling Rosette and stories that we've been telling for</v>

2
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.030
<v Speaker 1>3000 years,</v>

3
00:00:10.031 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me to have something to offer.</v>

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.640
<v Speaker 1>And so when,</v>

5
00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>when I look at the stories in the Bible,</v>

6
00:00:16.591 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>I do it,</v>

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I would say in some sense with a beginner's mind,</v>

8
00:00:19.411 --> 00:00:20.490
<v Speaker 1>it's a mystery.</v>

9
00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>This book,</v>

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.320
<v Speaker 1>how the Hell it was made,</v>

11
00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:23.101
<v Speaker 1>why it was made,</v>

12
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>why we preserved it,</v>

13
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 1>how it happened to motivate an entire culture for 2000 years and to transform</v>

14
00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:30.564
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

15
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.590
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on?</v>

16
00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:32.550
<v Speaker 1>How did that happen?</v>

17
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>It's by no means obvious.</v>

18
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:38.730
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that bothers me about casual critics of religion is that</v>

19
00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>they don't take the phenomena seriously.</v>

20
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:42.440
<v Speaker 1>And it's a serious phenomenon.</v>

21
00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:43.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.830
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

23
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>not at least because people have the capacity for religious experience and no</v>

24
00:00:47.341 --> 00:00:48.330
<v Speaker 1>one knows why that is.</v>

25
00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:48.631
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>

26
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>you can induce it reliably and all sorts of different ways.</v>

27
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 1>You could do it with brain stimulation.</v>

28
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>You can certainly do it with drugs.</v>

29
00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.540
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

30
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>especially the psychedelic variety,</v>

31
00:00:57.271 --> 00:01:02.271
<v Speaker 1>they produce intimations of the divine extraordinarily regularly.</v>

32
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>People have been using drugs like that for God only knows how long,</v>

33
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 1>50,000 years,</v>

34
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:08.130
<v Speaker 1>maybe more than that,</v>

35
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>to produce some sort of intimate union with the divine.</v>

36
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like we don't understand any of that.</v>

37
00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 1>When we discovered the psychedelics and the late sixties it shocked everybody so</v>

38
00:01:17.791 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>badly that they were instantly made illegal and abandoned in terms of research</v>

39
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 1>for like 50 years.</v>

40
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>And it's no wonder because who the hell would expected that nobody.</v>
