1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Crippled religions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the right way to think about</v>

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:06.030
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're like a religion that's missing</v>

3
00:00:06.031 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>an arm and a leg but can still haul bill</v>
<v Speaker 1>along and it,</v>

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.460
<v Speaker 1>it provides a certain amount of security</v>
<v Speaker 1>and group identity,</v>

5
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's warped and twisted and demented and</v>

6
00:00:14.251 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>banter and it's a parasite on something</v>
<v Speaker 1>underlying that's rich and true.</v>

7
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's how it looks to me anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

8
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.230
<v Speaker 1>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think it's very important that we</v>

9
00:00:25.231 --> 00:00:27.470
<v Speaker 1>sort out this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.660
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that there isn't anything more</v>

11
00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:32.490
<v Speaker 1>important that needs to be done than</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

12
00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.620
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've thought that for a long,</v>

13
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.650
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably since the early eighties when I</v>

14
00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>started looking at the site,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role that belief systems played in</v>

15
00:00:43.351 --> 00:00:46.680
<v Speaker 1>regulating psychological and social</v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

16
00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.370
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they,</v>

17
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.290
<v Speaker 1>you can tell that they do that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of how upset people get.</v>

18
00:00:52.291 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>If you challenge their belief systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

19
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.410
<v Speaker 1>why the hell do they care?</v>

20
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What difference does it make if,</v>

21
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>if all of your ideological axioms are</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent correct?</v>

22
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Like people get unbelievably upset when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

23
00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.530
<v Speaker 1>when you poke them in the axioms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to speak,</v>

24
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.980
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not by any stretch of the</v>

25
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 1>imagination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious why,</v>

26
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some,</v>

27
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.850
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's a fundamental truth</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they're standing on.</v>

28
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.540
<v Speaker 1>It's like they're on a raft in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the ocean and you're starting</v>

29
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:22.800
<v Speaker 1>to pull up the logs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

30
00:01:22.801 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>and they're afraid they're going to fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>in and drown.</v>

31
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like drowning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What and what are the logs protecting</v>

32
00:01:28.171 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protecting them from and why are they so</v>

33
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>afraid to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to move beyond the confines of the</v>

34
00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.770
<v Speaker 1>ideological system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are not obvious things.</v>
