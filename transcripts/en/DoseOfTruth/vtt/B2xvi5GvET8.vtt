1
00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Political correctness,</v>

2
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.280
<v Speaker 1>the seems to be taking up more and more space now when you've been quite vocal</v>

3
00:00:12.281 --> 00:00:13.114
<v Speaker 1>against it,</v>

4
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.990
<v Speaker 1>but it feels like a lot of people don't really understand what it is.</v>

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.020
<v Speaker 1>It is often mixed up with common courtesy.</v>

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.503
<v Speaker 1>For an example,</v>

7
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.010
<v Speaker 1>can you define political correctness for us?</v>

8
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Why is it not,</v>

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.583
<v Speaker 1>not good?</v>

10
00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.240
<v Speaker 1>political correctness I would say is fundamentally a collectivist doctrine and</v>

12
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>collectivist doctrines insists that the proper way of parsing up the world is</v>

13
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.340
<v Speaker 1>through the lens of group identity.</v>

14
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about it as the,</v>

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>as part of the expression of identity politics,</v>

16
00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.630
<v Speaker 1>which is something that script the left,</v>

17
00:00:49.631 --> 00:00:54.400
<v Speaker 1>probably something that cost Hillary Clinton the election law in the United</v>

18
00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.720
<v Speaker 1>States in the last election cycle.</v>

19
00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.153
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

20
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Speaker 1>and the the people who are politically correct insists that individuals are</v>

21
00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:09.331
<v Speaker 1>basically avatars of their group and that the world is a battle ground of groups</v>

22
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.470
<v Speaker 1>vying for dominance,</v>

23
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.000
<v Speaker 1>power competition.</v>

24
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter who you are as an individual,</v>

25
00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>it's only what group you belong.</v>

26
00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

27
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I would say in in within the confines of the politically correct doctrine,</v>

29
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.300
<v Speaker 1>there aren't individuals.</v>

30
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.120
<v Speaker 1>There are only groups vying for power.</v>

31
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.890
<v Speaker 1>That's why the politically correct types oppose free speech.</v>

32
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.050
<v Speaker 1>It isn't that they oppose it.</v>

33
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.280
<v Speaker 1>It's worse than that.</v>

34
00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>It's that from within the confines of the politically correct doctrine.</v>

35
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no such thing as free speech because what you claim as your free speech</v>

36
00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:49.420
<v Speaker 1>is actually nothing but your justification of the hierarchy that gives your</v>

37
00:01:49.421 --> 00:01:50.380
<v Speaker 1>group dominance.</v>

38
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.610
<v Speaker 1>That's everything from the politically correct perspective and so there's no</v>

39
00:01:54.611 --> 00:01:59.230
<v Speaker 1>real possibility even for dialogue between well meaning individuals because</v>

40
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>there's no such thing as dialogue to begin with and there's no such thing as</v>

41
00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:08.200
<v Speaker 1>well meaning individuals and so it's almost impossible to overstate how</v>

42
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 1>pernicious that doctrine is.</v>

43
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.980
<v Speaker 1>It demolishes the idea of individual sovereignty and the possibility of</v>

44
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:16.750
<v Speaker 1>communication across individuals.</v>

45
00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.760
<v Speaker 1>That's why it produces ideas like</v>

46
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.490
<v Speaker 1>cultural appropriation because there's no,</v>

47
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 1>all that happens.</v>

48
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.290
<v Speaker 1>If you utilize the artifacts of another culture,</v>

49
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>it isn't that you admire the more that it's a part of trade or that is part of</v>

50
00:02:33.041 --> 00:02:34.540
<v Speaker 1>the free expression of ideas.</v>

51
00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.020
<v Speaker 1>It's that your taking away the artifacts of power from that other group in an</v>

52
00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:43.810
<v Speaker 1>attempt to foster your own group dominance.</v>

53
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Everything's viewed through that lens as if I,</v>

54
00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.930
<v Speaker 1>if I would dress up as an Indian for a costume party.</v>

55
00:02:49.931 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

56
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.921
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

57
00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:51.520
<v Speaker 1>Well that's,</v>

58
00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>you know that that sort of thing has caused all sorts of trouble in American</v>

59
00:02:55.391 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>universities where because their end and they've produced about Halloween</v>

60
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:00.821
<v Speaker 1>costumes,</v>

61
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.821
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's absurd in many ways as if the dressing up in Mexican national</v>

62
00:03:05.951 --> 00:03:06.550
<v Speaker 1>uniform,</v>

63
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.270
<v Speaker 1>let's say national clothing or Dutch national clothing for that matter is some</v>

64
00:03:10.271 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>kind of insult.</v>

65
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.230
<v Speaker 1>It isn't an insult and even if it was,</v>

66
00:03:14.231 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>that's Halloween,</v>

67
00:03:15.071 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 1>is it time to break rules?</v>

68
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole point of the,</v>

69
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.030
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>

70
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>of the celebration.</v>

71
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>So political correctness has corrupted the university.</v>

72
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>So lots fields as far as I'm concerned it has.</v>

73
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:31.750
<v Speaker 1>And the universities are doing everything they can to corrupt other institutions</v>

74
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:32.171
<v Speaker 1>and their,</v>

75
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 1>and the other institutions are foolishly going along for the ride.</v>

76
00:03:35.921 --> 00:03:36.461
<v Speaker 1>So you see,</v>

77
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.294
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

78
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably more true in the u s than anywhere else,</v>

79
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:41.140
<v Speaker 1>although also in Canada,</v>

80
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Australia as well,</v>

81
00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.880
<v Speaker 1>that corporations are under the pressure of this politically correct fostering</v>

82
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>of guilt are admitting despite the fact that there's no scientific validity for</v>

83
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:54.970
<v Speaker 1>this claim whatsoever,</v>

84
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>that their employees are on Mohs,</v>

85
00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>structurally racist,</v>

86
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>and that people are viewing the world through the lens of implicit bias and that</v>

87
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.990
<v Speaker 1>we're all fundamentally racist and that that should be rectified through like</v>

88
00:04:07.991 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>reeducation.</v>

89
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

90
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:10.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

91
00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 1>what unconscious bias retraining programs for which there is,</v>

92
00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>there is no evidence whatsoever that those programs work and it's a substantial</v>

93
00:04:17.951 --> 00:04:19.780
<v Speaker 1>amount of evidence that they're counterproductive.</v>

94
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>And the implicit association test that has been put forward hypothetically to</v>

95
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:26.494
<v Speaker 1>diagnose,</v>

96
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

97
00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.971
<v Speaker 1>racism.</v>

98
00:04:27.971 --> 00:04:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Implicit racism is not a valid or reliable test and cannot be used for those</v>

99
00:04:32.441 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>

100
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>And even the makers of the test,</v>

101
00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:39.991
<v Speaker 1>Brian Nosek and Anthony Greenwald have admitted publicly that their test is</v>

102
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 1>being misused.</v>

103
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.893
<v Speaker 1>All of that's,</v>

104
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.761
<v Speaker 1>it's all of that.</v>

105
00:04:42.761 --> 00:04:44.110
<v Speaker 1>That's extraordinarily dangerous.</v>

106
00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:46.480
<v Speaker 1>And if corporate executives had any sense,</v>

107
00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>they would stop rushing to admit that are corporations are structurally racist.</v>

108
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bad idea.</v>

109
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And this is all under the influence.</v>

110
00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.250
<v Speaker 1>You say off postmodernism and neo meal monks,</v>

111
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.863
<v Speaker 1>those things,</v>

112
00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.220
<v Speaker 1>two separate things,</v>

113
00:05:03.221 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>they're completely separate.</v>

114
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.940
<v Speaker 1>and this is something I've been criticized for.</v>

116
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.000
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Peterson doesn't understand the difference between neo Marxism and</v>

117
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] and postmodernism.</v>

118
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.010
<v Speaker 1>It's like I understand the difference perfectly.</v>

119
00:05:15.011 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't me that's conflating them.</v>

120
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 1>It turns out that the people who push postmodern doctrines in the university</v>

121
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.910
<v Speaker 1>almost always ally themselves with the Marxist viewpoint and that is logically</v>

122
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.223
<v Speaker 1>incoherent.</v>

123
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>But I would say the postmodernists really don't give a damn for logical</v>

124
00:05:32.471 --> 00:05:36.650
<v Speaker 1>coherence because they regard that as part of the oppressive Patriarchal</v>

125
00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Eurocentric view of the world.</v>

126
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.620
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's an objective reality and all of that and that you can deal</v>

127
00:05:41.621 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>with it with logic.</v>

128
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.863
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

129
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I think that there is a,</v>

130
00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.660
<v Speaker 1>an alliance between the postmodern types and the Neo Marxists.</v>

131
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I can can tell,</v>

132
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>when I looked at the development of postmodern ideas,</v>

133
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.490
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>

134
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.590
<v Speaker 1>which really came to prominence in France,</v>

135
00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.170
<v Speaker 1>it was all failed Marxists who pushed the doctrine forward.</v>

136
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.430
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's,</v>

137
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.590
<v Speaker 1>it's a wolf in sheep's clothing.</v>

138
00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Identity politics is just Marxism under a different guise.</v>

139
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:12.310
<v Speaker 1>So instead of the narrative being the privileged economic class,</v>

140
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.600
<v Speaker 1>the z against the proletariat that didn't sell so well and produce tens of</v>

141
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.881
<v Speaker 1>millions of deaths,</v>

142
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>that fundamental narrative,</v>

143
00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.060
<v Speaker 1>there was this slight of hand and said,</v>

144
00:06:23.061 --> 00:06:23.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

145
00:06:23.271 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>it's not economic class.</v>

146
00:06:25.731 --> 00:06:29.570
<v Speaker 1>It's race or it's gender or ethnicity or it's sex,</v>

147
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because the fundamental narrative is still victimizer</v>

148
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 1>versus victim.</v>

149
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.650
<v Speaker 1>And so it's Marxism under another guise.</v>

150
00:06:36.651 --> 00:06:41.651
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that postmodernists technically are skeptical of Meta narratives</v>

151
00:06:43.071 --> 00:06:47.480
<v Speaker 1>like large scale explanatory structures should mean that they're equally</v>

152
00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:51.110
<v Speaker 1>skeptical about Marxists claims because that's a grand narrative.</v>

153
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:53.660
<v Speaker 1>But in practically speaking,</v>

154
00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:55.010
<v Speaker 1>that isn't how it works out.</v>

155
00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:56.840
<v Speaker 1>And so this alliance does exist,</v>

156
00:06:56.841 --> 00:06:59.750
<v Speaker 1>even though conceptually it's completely incoherent,</v>

157
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 1>says,</v>

158
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 1>I really don't believe that the post,</v>

159
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.000
<v Speaker 1>that postmodernism is something in and of itself.</v>

160
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.080
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

161
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 1>it's a camouflage for,</v>

162
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 1>for Marxism under another name.</v>

163
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.650
<v Speaker 1>And these ideas of yours,</v>

164
00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.920
<v Speaker 1>they are the ones that gain you the largest groups of enemies and,</v>

165
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:18.670
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

166
00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:19.503
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

167
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:19.851
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

168
00:07:19.851 --> 00:07:22.550
<v Speaker 1>the thing is the left is the radical leftist types.</v>

169
00:07:22.551 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>And I would say they're the leftist collectivists and I'm,</v>

170
00:07:25.041 --> 00:07:25.521
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

171
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.290
<v Speaker 1>no fan of right wing collectivists.</v>

172
00:07:27.291 --> 00:07:30.290
<v Speaker 1>So either it's just that they don't threaten the universities.</v>

173
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>There's no right wing collectivists in the universities.</v>

174
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Like none.</v>

175
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:35.030
<v Speaker 1>There's no right wingers,</v>

176
00:07:35.031 --> 00:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>there's no conservatives.</v>

177
00:07:36.101 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 1>There are hardly any liberals in most of the,</v>

178
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.190
<v Speaker 1>in most of the activists,</v>

179
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.073
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

180
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:41.953
<v Speaker 1>disciplines.</v>

181
00:07:42.530 --> 00:07:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

182
00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:43.311
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

183
00:07:43.311 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>the radical left types don't like me at all.</v>

184
00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.710
<v Speaker 1>And that's okay because the feeling is mutual.</v>

185
00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.810
<v Speaker 1>I think that the veil,</v>

186
00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.380
<v Speaker 1>they can orchestrate vicious attacks and hit pieces in the biggest media as</v>

187
00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

188
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:57.410
<v Speaker 1>And I've been,</v>

189
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:57.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

190
00:07:57.711 --> 00:08:00.050
<v Speaker 1>I've had the full gamut of treatment in the media.</v>

191
00:08:00.051 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I would say in Canada for example,</v>

192
00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>there's a handful of outstanding journalists who act as individuals.</v>

193
00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:07.610
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

194
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:08.361
<v Speaker 1>a dozen of them,</v>

195
00:08:08.361 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>let's say a maybe slightly less than that,</v>

196
00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>and they've been firmly supporting me the whole time.</v>

197
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>And the post media group in Canada,</v>

198
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:20.450
<v Speaker 1>which was a consortium of 200 have newspapers,</v>

199
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:25.600
<v Speaker 1>came out in favor of my free speech stance in relationship to bill [inaudible].</v>

200
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.590
<v Speaker 1>And so I've been treated very well by the,</v>

201
00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>by some elements of the media,</v>

202
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 1>but it's definitely the case that I've also been pilloried as a and caricatured</v>

203
00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 1>and stereotyped as a,</v>

204
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:40.490
<v Speaker 1>as an outright figure,</v>

205
00:08:40.491 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>I suppose.</v>

206
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes there's a far right figure for that matter by,</v>

207
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:46.030
<v Speaker 1>by venues that have,</v>

208
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.430
<v Speaker 1>that should have known much that of should have known better.</v>

209
00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:52.370
<v Speaker 1>And BC did a terrible video hit piece on me.</v>

210
00:08:52.371 --> 00:08:53.930
<v Speaker 1>It was an appalling piece of,</v>

211
00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>of careless,</v>

212
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>provocative journalism.</v>

213
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:57.861
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

214
00:08:57.861 --> 00:08:58.120
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

215
00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>

216
00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.400
<v Speaker 1>They were exposed.</v>

217
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>They were exposed.</v>

218
00:09:00.331 --> 00:09:00.631
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

219
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:01.710
<v Speaker 1>why was it was,</v>

220
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't believe it when I watched it.</v>

221
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

222
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.490
<v Speaker 1>not only are you people crooked,</v>

223
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>but you're stupid and incompetent.</v>

224
00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>You should get one of those things right.</v>

225
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>He shouldn't be all three of those things at the same time.</v>

226
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:17.130
<v Speaker 1>They interviewed me for 90 minutes and it was a contentious interview conducted</v>

227
00:09:17.131 --> 00:09:18.780
<v Speaker 1>by a narcissistic interviewer,</v>

228
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:24.060
<v Speaker 1>and then they chopped it into like a three minute teaser that was just outright</v>

229
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.163
<v Speaker 1>falsehoods.</v>

230
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:29.760
<v Speaker 1>And then people on Youtube took the actual interview and the edited version and</v>

231
00:09:29.761 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 1>juxtapose them showing that they'd actually reversed the meaning of some of the</v>

232
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:34.740
<v Speaker 1>things I said.</v>

233
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I sold it to so and,</v>

234
00:09:36.511 --> 00:09:38.880
<v Speaker 1>but so far the attacks have been,</v>

235
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>I would say highly counterproductive.</v>

236
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 1>And I've been in this very strange situation,</v>

237
00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.840
<v Speaker 1>which I have.</v>

238
00:09:45.841 --> 00:09:46.674
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

239
00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:47.490
<v Speaker 1>I have,</v>

240
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:47.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

241
00:09:47.791 --> 00:09:52.791
<v Speaker 1>I feel that it's a tenuous situation that every time there's been a protest,</v>

242
00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 1>say against my appearance on the university campus,</v>

243
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.480
<v Speaker 1>which has happened many times,</v>

244
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 1>or an attack piece,</v>

245
00:10:00.270 --> 00:10:03.270
<v Speaker 1>then like it's very stressful and,</v>

246
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:07.050
<v Speaker 1>and the potential for damaging my reputation appears high.</v>

247
00:10:07.051 --> 00:10:11.850
<v Speaker 1>But that medium to longterm consequence of that is that the journalists end up</v>

248
00:10:11.851 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>more discredited than me.</v>
