00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Amy pellegrini says,</v>

2
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>why is self sabotage such a huge feature of human life?</v>

3
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.463
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.750
<v Speaker 1>I have a chapter about that in my new book too.</v>

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.283
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

6
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.750
<v Speaker 1>which chapter is it now?</v>

7
00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:21.813
<v Speaker 1>I think it's it.</v>

8
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't always match the content with the chapter title.</v>

9
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:26.583
<v Speaker 1>Oddly enough.</v>

10
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I think it's the chapter about picking friends that are good for you.</v>

11
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.741
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

12
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:38.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

13
00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:39.120
<v Speaker 1>I have it right here.</v>

14
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>And I didn't set that up by the way.</v>

15
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>I genuinely did remember,</v>

16
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 1>make friends with the people</v>

17
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.740
<v Speaker 1>who wants the best for you.</v>

18
00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:48.251
<v Speaker 1>Was that it?</v>

19
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:48.491
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

20
00:00:48.491 --> 00:00:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping.</v>

21
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.443
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

22
00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:54.663
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

23
00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.280
<v Speaker 1>Why are self sabotage such a feature?</v>

24
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.731
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

25
00:00:58.731 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>here's a couple of reasons.</v>

26
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:00.261
<v Speaker 1>The first is,</v>

27
00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:04.430
<v Speaker 1>is that there's a lot of responsibility with success,</v>

28
00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.293
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

30
00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.023
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

31
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.330
<v Speaker 1>if you say yes to things and you do a good job and you bear a large burden,</v>

32
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:14.260
<v Speaker 1>then you have to carry it.</v>

33
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of that might be success.</v>

34
00:01:15.941 --> 00:01:17.050
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

35
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>failure is a lot easier than success.</v>

36
00:01:19.301 --> 00:01:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Plus you can complain about it and whine about it and be a victim and garner all</v>

37
00:01:23.561 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 1>sorts of Kudos from yourself and others that way.</v>

38
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 1>So there's that.</v>

39
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.670
<v Speaker 1>It's just failure to adopt responsibility.</v>

40
00:01:30.671 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 1>But then I would say too,</v>

41
00:01:31.571 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>there's also revenge on on the self and God,</v>

42
00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>that's partly why I liked the Cain and Abel story so much.</v>

43
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Once I sort of figured out what it meant.</v>

44
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.803
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

45
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 1>people have a hard time not having the kind of contempt that borders on self</v>

46
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:51.020
<v Speaker 1>hatred for the cells,</v>

47
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.340
<v Speaker 1>partly because you know,</v>

48
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:57.341
<v Speaker 1>we are fragile and mortal creatures and prone to error and malevolence and we</v>

49
00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 1>know that of ourselves better than anyone else.</v>

50
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

51
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Because we know that we're prone to punish ourselves and,</v>

52
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.540
<v Speaker 1>and to think ill of ourselves.</v>

53
00:02:06.541 --> 00:02:07.310
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

54
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 1>one of the things I learned from young was that the injunction to do unto your</v>

56
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:16.740
<v Speaker 1>neighbor as you would have him do unto you was an equation rather than,</v>

57
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

58
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>a statement about how to be nice to people and that you have an ethical</v>

59
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:24.030
<v Speaker 1>obligation to treat yourself as if you're some,</v>

60
00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>a person of value.</v>

61
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't really feel that,</v>

62
00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:29.720
<v Speaker 1>that you owe yourself the,</v>

63
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>that you owe yourself the same treatment that you would give someone that you</v>

64
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:35.280
<v Speaker 1>cared for in love.</v>

65
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Now it's a really hard thing to learn,</v>

66
00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

67
00:02:37.651 --> 00:02:40.980
<v Speaker 1>cause you kind of have to detach yourself from your knowledge of all your</v>

68
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.750
<v Speaker 1>insufficiencies and your flaws and treat yourself with dignity and respect.</v>

69
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.670
<v Speaker 1>At least the dignity and respect.</v>

70
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Do someone who's faulty that could conceivably learn.</v>

71
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very difficult ethical lesson to learn.</v>

72
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:55.021
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

73
00:02:55.021 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>it's easier to beat yourself continually on the hip,</v>

74
00:02:57.601 --> 00:03:02.601
<v Speaker 1>back of the head with a club and to feel it's justified given how much you know</v>

75
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>about how wretched and useless you are.</v>

76
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.883
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

77
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.320
<v Speaker 1>so let's say there's two reasons.</v>

78
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.553
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

79
00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.850
<v Speaker 1>one is that you don't want the responsibility.</v>

80
00:03:12.851 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 1>So it's not really self sabotage,</v>

81
00:03:14.531 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>it's just avoidance of responsibility and consequent failure.</v>

82
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>And the second is</v>

83
00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.861
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>

84
00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>self punishment.</v>

85
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.450
<v Speaker 1>That seems only just given what you know about all your pathology and,</v>

86
00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.430
<v Speaker 1>and an error and,</v>

87
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>and insufficiencies.</v>

88
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.430
<v Speaker 1>So I would say that that's the big two there.</v>
