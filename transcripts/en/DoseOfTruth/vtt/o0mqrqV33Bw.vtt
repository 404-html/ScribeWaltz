1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.123
<v Speaker 1>There's the,</v>

2
00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.670
<v Speaker 1>you talked about the availability heuristic and some of the role that the press</v>

3
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:05.451
<v Speaker 1>might be playing,</v>

4
00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:08.540
<v Speaker 1>the fact that negative events stand out.</v>

5
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>We can also see negative events all over the world now,</v>

6
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.960
<v Speaker 1>so we can't fake of all over the world.</v>

7
00:00:14.961 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you hear about a negative event,</v>

8
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.390
<v Speaker 1>it's as if it's happening next door and this is,</v>

9
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.573
<v Speaker 1>he is a threat.</v>

10
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>So are the breadth of our news is exaggerated and the coverage is exaggerated,</v>

11
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>but there still seems to me to be this,</v>

12
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 1>this mystery at the bottom of all this,</v>

13
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:35.150
<v Speaker 1>which is in the face of such radically good news.</v>

14
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Why is there such an insistence that the system is corrupt?</v>

15
00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.510
<v Speaker 1>We're going to hell in a handbasket then that,</v>

16
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.261
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 1>human beings are a cancer on the planet and everything is heading towards the</v>

18
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:46.761
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse.</v>

19
00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:47.360
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

20
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.193
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

21
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>it's so deep and,</v>

22
00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.660
<v Speaker 1>and it doesn't seem to be moved by the fact much.</v>

23
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.900
<v Speaker 1>I kind of think sometimes that it's a hangover from the cold war,</v>

24
00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:59.870
<v Speaker 1>that was so deeply pessimistic for so long.</v>

26
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.401
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

27
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.680
<v Speaker 2>I think it goes back before the Cold War.</v>

28
00:01:04.681 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 2>It certainly as a,</v>

29
00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 2>as a psychological syndrome,</v>

30
00:01:07.621 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 2>it goes back at least to the Old Testament prophets who combined kind of social</v>

31
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Speaker 2>criticism with,</v>

32
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

33
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

34
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.530
<v Speaker 2>for telling a apocalyptic disaster that slat that syndrome.</v>

35
00:01:19.531 --> 00:01:21.090
<v Speaker 2>That combination of,</v>

36
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

37
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>moral schooling with predictions of doom is something that our species quite</v>

38
00:01:27.091 --> 00:01:28.130
<v Speaker 2>naturally falls into.</v>

39
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 2>Part of it is frankly,</v>

40
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:32.661
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of,</v>

41
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

42
00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

43
00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.820
<v Speaker 2>perfect interprofessional competition that society has various elites.</v>

44
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

45
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 2>there's the politicians,</v>

46
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:40.701
<v Speaker 2>the business people,</v>

47
00:01:40.701 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>the military,</v>

48
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 2>religious elites,</v>

49
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.251
<v Speaker 2>the academics,</v>

50
00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:44.084
<v Speaker 2>the journalists,</v>

51
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.300
<v Speaker 2>and they're always kind of competing for status.</v>

52
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.190
<v Speaker 2>And since intellectuals don't deserve a whole lot of credit for getting society</v>

53
00:01:52.191 --> 00:01:53.024
<v Speaker 2>to run for,</v>

54
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 2>for putting food in the stores and that keeping the peace and,</v>

55
00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.921
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

56
00:01:57.921 --> 00:01:58.490
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

57
00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.570
<v Speaker 2>protecting the streets,</v>

58
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Speaker 2>it's very easy to,</v>

59
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

60
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.480
<v Speaker 2>to look down on other societal elites on,</v>

61
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:06.201
<v Speaker 2>on government,</v>

62
00:02:06.201 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 2>on business and to say,</v>

63
00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:08.091
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

64
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:13.070
<v Speaker 2>you guys are all failing and we're the ones who are morally refined enough to</v>

65
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:13.904
<v Speaker 2>point it out.</v>

66
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

67
00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.080
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't put down just a sheer human competitiveness.</v>

68
00:02:18.081 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm not the first to say this.</v>

69
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.340
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite explanations of the veneration of,</v>

70
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

71
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.870
<v Speaker 2>of the past of Golden Ages comes from Thomas Hobbs who said competition of</v>

72
00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 2>praise inclined to a reverence of antiquity or men contend with the living,</v>

73
00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:34.573
<v Speaker 2>not with the dad.</v>

74
00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

75
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Well it also seems that the,</v>

76
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.020
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

77
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of resentment that is driving that as well.</v>

78
00:02:42.231 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 1>And that would go along with the status competition because there's anger,</v>

79
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:51.251
<v Speaker 1>I suppose if you're a member of any meat group to see that your paradigm,</v>

80
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.320
<v Speaker 1>let's say isn't leading the charge forward.</v>

81
00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.823
<v Speaker 3>MMM,</v>

82
00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.261
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

83
00:02:57.261 --> 00:03:02.261
<v Speaker 2>And you talked about the astonishing in global poverty and a part of that story</v>

84
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 2>is it did not come about through massive redistribution,</v>

85
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.150
<v Speaker 2>which for,</v>

86
00:03:07.151 --> 00:03:11.800
<v Speaker 2>for many people on the left was the only route to lifting up the poor,</v>

87
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:12.321
<v Speaker 2>namely to,</v>

88
00:03:12.321 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>to redistribute resources.</v>

89
00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Now that have been of course,</v>

90
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:21.150
<v Speaker 2>adjust adjustments either to shocks the fact that China and India and Bangladesh</v>

91
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 2>and Indonesia have risen out of poverty,</v>

92
00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

93
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 2>came in part of the expense of manufacturing jobs in the United.</v>

94
00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

95
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.140
<v Speaker 2>That's not exactly what people meant by redistribution.</v>

97
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.700
<v Speaker 2>And it literally is a redistribution of resources.</v>

98
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

99
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.180
<v Speaker 2>although it is a shaking up of the economies of many,</v>

100
00:03:39.181 --> 00:03:40.014
<v Speaker 2>many nations.</v>

101
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.230
<v Speaker 2>But this massive increase in the wealth of that Asian countries did not come</v>

102
00:03:45.691 --> 00:03:47.280
<v Speaker 2>because it was horses were,</v>

103
00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.581
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 2>were shipped from the wealthy west to the impoverished east.</v>

105
00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.171
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

106
00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:54.690
<v Speaker 1>So that's also a threat to the doctrine itself.</v>

107
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.280
<v Speaker 1>Direct threat,</v>

108
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.910
<v Speaker 1>the fact that wealth is being produced and it's being distributed to people at</v>

109
00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:04.911
<v Speaker 1>the low end means that implies that that redistributive philosophy is likely in</v>

110
00:04:07.801 --> 00:04:08.460
<v Speaker 1>error.</v>

111
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.940
<v Speaker 1>And you can understand why that might be regarded as a catastrophic threat,</v>

112
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.040
<v Speaker 1>particularly to people on the radical left.</v>

113
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.661
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

114
00:04:14.661 --> 00:04:15.141
<v Speaker 2>certainly,</v>

115
00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:15.741
<v Speaker 2>certainly for,</v>

116
00:04:15.741 --> 00:04:17.870
<v Speaker 2>for a radical notions of redistribution,</v>

117
00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:19.610
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>

118
00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.150
<v Speaker 2>the more limited kinds of redistribution that have,</v>

119
00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

120
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 2>that are ubiquitous in wealthy countries,</v>

121
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I have a graph showing that the amount,</v>

122
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.260
<v Speaker 2>the proportion of GDP allocated to social spending a skyrocketed in the 20th</v>

123
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:38.261
<v Speaker 2>century from about 1% to about 22% in every developed country.</v>

124
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:39.320
<v Speaker 2>No exceptions.</v>

125
00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.011
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

126
00:04:40.011 --> 00:04:40.590
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

127
00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

128
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.510
<v Speaker 2>thanks to,</v>

129
00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.990
<v Speaker 2>to spending on the cooler on children on the sick,</v>

130
00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.651
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

131
00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 2>on the online rates of absolute poverty have fallen in,</v>

132
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.960
<v Speaker 2>in a wealthy countries.</v>

133
00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 2>So not only,</v>

134
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.851
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

135
00:04:52.851 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

136
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

137
00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 2>has been developed developing worlds become wealthier and not directly at the</v>

138
00:04:59.041 --> 00:05:00.590
<v Speaker 2>expensive of the developed world,</v>

139
00:05:00.591 --> 00:05:01.650
<v Speaker 2>but it within the developed world,</v>

140
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.360
<v Speaker 2>thanks to some amount of social spending,</v>

141
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:04.980
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could call it redistribution.</v>

142
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.250
<v Speaker 2>The even as inequality has risen,</v>

143
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.600
<v Speaker 2>poverty has not.</v>

144
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

145
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.671
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

146
00:05:10.671 --> 00:05:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

147
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.840
<v Speaker 1>I was just reading a book by Walter Shadelle called the great leveler.</v>

148
00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

149
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:16.713
<v Speaker 1>excellent.</v>

150
00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.110
<v Speaker 1>It is an excellent book.</v>

151
00:05:18.111 --> 00:05:22.370
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things he did was an empirical analysis of left versus right wing</v>

152
00:05:22.371 --> 00:05:23.204
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

153
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I think across the 20th century,</v>

154
00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:28.460
<v Speaker 1>but it might've gone farther back to now to see if there is any difference in</v>

155
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.400
<v Speaker 1>the Gini Coefficient across the classes of government.</v>

156
00:05:31.401 --> 00:05:35.360
<v Speaker 1>And what he found was that there was no difference whatsoever.</v>

157
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.830
<v Speaker 1>He makes a fairly strong case that the only redistributive techniques that work</v>

158
00:05:39.831 --> 00:05:40.360
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

159
00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

160
00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 1>pestilence and war essentially.</v>

161
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:45.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's because they knock everyone down to zero.</v>

162
00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:46.940
<v Speaker 1>But you're making a different case,</v>

163
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.740
<v Speaker 1>like an incremental case in some sense,</v>

164
00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:53.741
<v Speaker 1>which is that governments perhaps regardless of their ideological proclivities</v>

165
00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:58.170
<v Speaker 1>in the 20th centuries as they've become more wealthy,</v>

166
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.550
<v Speaker 1>they have incrementally devoted a larger part of their,</v>

167
00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:03.270
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

168
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.020
<v Speaker 1>of their resources to incremental improvements in,</v>

169
00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.500
<v Speaker 1>you might think about it as an investment in the future rather than</v>

170
00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:15.501
<v Speaker 1>redistribution or investment in social capital education and healthcare and</v>

171
00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.710
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of things that,</v>

172
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.581
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

173
00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 2>it's pounded with some,</v>

174
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:19.830
<v Speaker 2>it's probably some combination.</v>

175
00:06:19.831 --> 00:06:23.280
<v Speaker 2>It's a combination of investment in public goods because of course the whole</v>

176
00:06:23.281 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 2>society is better off if the,</v>

177
00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.070
<v Speaker 2>if everyone's educated.</v>

178
00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I also want assurance people support,</v>

179
00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

180
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:30.900
<v Speaker 2>a a safety net.</v>

181
00:06:30.901 --> 00:06:34.500
<v Speaker 2>That's the most popular euphemism for social spending because you never know</v>

182
00:06:34.501 --> 00:06:37.980
<v Speaker 2>whether it's going to be you or your or your mother or your brother who is going</v>

183
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:38.400
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>

184
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.420
<v Speaker 2>who's going to be a need in the lottery of misfortune.</v>

185
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.121
<v Speaker 2>I had been,</v>

186
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:44.190
<v Speaker 2>part of it's part of it is,</v>

187
00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:44.611
<v Speaker 2>is a,</v>

188
00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:45.444
<v Speaker 2>is charity.</v>

189
00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:45.810
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

190
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:49.410
<v Speaker 2>the modern conscience won't allow the little match girl to freeze to death.</v>

191
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.290
<v Speaker 2>The jokes to Barry,</v>

192
00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Grandpa by the side of route 66.</v>

193
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 2>And so I think social spending has been pushed along by,</v>

194
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:58.380
<v Speaker 2>by all three.</v>

195
00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

196
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.210
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't necessary in some countries it probably has reduced the Gini</v>

197
00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Coefficient in western European countries,</v>

198
00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:05.380
<v Speaker 2>which have a more,</v>

199
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:05.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

200
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.810
<v Speaker 2>aggressive system of taxation then in the United States or Canada.</v>

201
00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.010
<v Speaker 2>But more important than the Jenny distribution is that it's reduced the number</v>

202
00:07:14.011 --> 00:07:15.090
<v Speaker 2>of people living in poverty,</v>

203
00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.360
<v Speaker 2>which is the morally relevant measuring in any case.</v>

204
00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:18.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

205
00:07:18.871 --> 00:07:23.340
<v Speaker 1>So those two things are complicated because obviously you want to raise people</v>

206
00:07:23.341 --> 00:07:24.480
<v Speaker 1>out of abject poverty.</v>

207
00:07:24.481 --> 00:07:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

208
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.650
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

209
00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.820
<v Speaker 1>that's a zero argument proposition and that seems to be happening very rapidly.</v>

210
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.943
<v Speaker 1>The theme,</v>

211
00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:35.760
<v Speaker 1>the question after that I suppose is to what degree does the remaining degree of</v>

212
00:07:35.761 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 1>inequality that's generated by productive capital assistance also constitute a</v>

213
00:07:40.101 --> 00:07:40.934
<v Speaker 1>social threat?</v>

214
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.120
<v Speaker 1>Is there is evidence it was reviewed best buy in the spirit level,</v>

215
00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:48.930
<v Speaker 1>that as inequality increases rates of male homicide,</v>

216
00:07:48.931 --> 00:07:49.591
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

217
00:07:49.591 --> 00:07:52.140
<v Speaker 1>increase in all sorts of other negative measures.</v>

218
00:07:52.141 --> 00:07:57.141
<v Speaker 1>So there's some weird interaction between raising absolute levels of wealth and</v>

219
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.640
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that inequality doesn't,</v>

220
00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:00.901
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

221
00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:05.901
<v Speaker 1>exceed some hypothetical optimum that that needs to be considered in social</v>

222
00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:07.284
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

223
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:11.730
<v Speaker 2>There I cite some skeptical re analyses of the,</v>

224
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:11.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

225
00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:15.630
<v Speaker 2>the data in the spirit level and,</v>

226
00:08:15.631 --> 00:08:16.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

227
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:21.110
<v Speaker 2>probably absolute prosperity matters more than inequality in determining a</v>

228
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.380
<v Speaker 2>social health include such as happiness,</v>

229
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.513
<v Speaker 2>crime,</v>

230
00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.420
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

231
00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.060
<v Speaker 2>other kinds of social pathologies like drug addictions.</v>

232
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:30.571
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

233
00:08:30.571 --> 00:08:30.801
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

234
00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:31.634
<v Speaker 2>it's not easy to,</v>

235
00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:33.210
<v Speaker 2>to tease them apart.</v>

236
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

237
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.501
<v Speaker 2>definitely not.</v>

238
00:08:34.501 --> 00:08:34.740
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

239
00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:34.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

240
00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.490
<v Speaker 2>countries like Sweden are a very egalitarian,</v>

241
00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:39.510
<v Speaker 2>but they're also very rich,</v>

242
00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:42.870
<v Speaker 2>are a more lopsided,</v>

243
00:08:42.871 --> 00:08:44.460
<v Speaker 2>but they're also very poor.</v>

244
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.880
<v Speaker 2>And so it takes a little bit of statistical wizardry to type them apart.</v>

245
00:08:47.881 --> 00:08:51.330
<v Speaker 2>And my reading of the literature is that it's actually prosperity that is more</v>

246
00:08:51.331 --> 00:08:53.130
<v Speaker 2>important than that in any quality.</v>

247
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:53.911
<v Speaker 2>But also,</v>

248
00:08:53.911 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 2>and this is a,</v>

249
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:54.780
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

250
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.390
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

251
00:08:55.390 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 2>that I in the psychological literature was emphasized by Christina Storman's and</v>

252
00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:02.893
<v Speaker 2>Paul Bloom,</v>

253
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.470
<v Speaker 2>that what people sometimes think of as an,</v>

254
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 2>as an aversion to inequality,</v>

256
00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 2>to people having different amounts is actually an aversion to unfairness</v>

257
00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.253
<v Speaker 2>injustice.</v>

258
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

259
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:15.280
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

260
00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.720
<v Speaker 2>but people that really infuriates people is that they think that the people at</v>

261
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 2>the top half ill gotten gains equal.</v>

262
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.020
<v Speaker 2>If they sense that the system is basically fair,</v>

263
00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:27.660
<v Speaker 2>that either greater effort,</v>

264
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.470
<v Speaker 2>talent,</v>

265
00:09:28.470 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 2>or even luck,</v>

266
00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:29.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

267
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.710
<v Speaker 2>result in an unequal distribution,</v>

268
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

269
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:33.720
<v Speaker 2>by an impartial library,</v>

270
00:09:33.721 --> 00:09:34.510
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

271
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:35.311
<v Speaker 2>They're okay with that.</v>

272
00:09:35.311 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 2>It's cheating that really gets under,</v>

273
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:37.600
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

274
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.930
<v Speaker 2>people are really good at remembering cheating and recognizing it as well.</v>

275
00:09:40.931 --> 00:09:41.750
<v Speaker 2>And stitching.</v>
