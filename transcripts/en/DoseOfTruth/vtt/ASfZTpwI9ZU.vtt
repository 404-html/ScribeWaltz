00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.350
<v Speaker 1>Why am I telling you this?</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.760
<v Speaker 1>what the children were doing,</v>

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>you think about how the tail,</v>

5
00:00:13.021 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 1>did the children come up with these weird ideas,</v>

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.621
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:20.910
<v Speaker 1>first of all we should note the children are not stupid and they can also dream</v>

9
00:00:20.911 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>up the most horrible things,</v>

10
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

11
00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:24.030
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

12
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.410
<v Speaker 1>because they have an imagination that's capable of extending itself out into the</v>

13
00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:29.071
<v Speaker 1>terrifying.</v>

14
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:31.770
<v Speaker 1>Now everyone knows that because all you have to do is remember when you were a</v>

15
00:00:31.771 --> 00:00:32.580
<v Speaker 1>kid,</v>

16
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

17
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>when you were hiding under the covers,</v>

18
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.870
<v Speaker 1>because there were horrible things in your dark room.</v>

19
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>you can populate the darkness with monsters with no problem.</v>

21
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>And you should be able to,</v>

22
00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:43.950
<v Speaker 1>because there are monsters in the darkness.</v>

23
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Even though your parents might tell you there aren't,</v>

24
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.430
<v Speaker 1>it's like there might not be any dirt monsters in that particular piece of</v>

25
00:00:50.431 --> 00:00:51.264
<v Speaker 1>darkness.</v>

26
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 1>And that's a perfectly reasonable thing to tell your children.</v>

27
00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.650
<v Speaker 1>But in the darkness as a whole,</v>

28
00:00:55.651 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

29
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.431
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

30
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.450
<v Speaker 1>look the hell out.</v>

31
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.330
<v Speaker 1>So the children aren't stupid now.</v>

32
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.310
<v Speaker 1>So then the,</v>

33
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

34
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>the adults start to question them and the kids or the back of their brain,</v>

35
00:01:05.401 --> 00:01:06.990
<v Speaker 1>the little imaginative part is thinking,</v>

36
00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.340
<v Speaker 1>what are these people want?</v>

37
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>What do these people want?</v>

38
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>What do these people want?</v>

39
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.620
<v Speaker 1>And so they'll throw him out a little bit of information and they'll,</v>

40
00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>the adults will perk up.</v>

41
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>They'll focus right on that piece of information.</v>

42
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:22.221
<v Speaker 1>So maybe it's a cop who really hates childs satanist abductors,</v>

43
00:01:22.261 --> 00:01:23.011
<v Speaker 1>which you know,</v>

44
00:01:23.011 --> 00:01:25.020
<v Speaker 1>is perfectly reasonable stance.</v>

45
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>And so when the child offers any information about,</v>

46
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>about the existence of such a thing,</v>

47
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.780
<v Speaker 1>well the cop will perk up and then the child thinks,</v>

48
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.991
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

49
00:01:33.991 --> 00:01:34.351
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

50
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:34.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>so sort of what's going on?</v>

52
00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>It seems to have something to do.</v>

53
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't think this consciously,</v>

54
00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.061
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

55
00:01:39.061 --> 00:01:40.740
<v Speaker 1>but their imagination is working.</v>

56
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>How do I model the reality that's been presented to me?</v>

57
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And that's when the dream start to kick in too.</v>
