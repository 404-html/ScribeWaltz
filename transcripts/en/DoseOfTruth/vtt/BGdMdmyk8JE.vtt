00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.970
<v Speaker 1>So since studying your work,</v>

2
00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:15.830
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that I find most fascinating is your analysis of the story of</v>

3
00:00:15.831 --> 00:00:16.664
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel.</v>

4
00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 1>And my question is,</v>

5
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.203
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.830
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

7
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>if came got to the point that he did right before,</v>

8
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

9
00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>killing his brother,</v>

10
00:00:28.731 --> 00:00:33.731
<v Speaker 1>murdering his ideal and decided that that was something he didn't want to do,</v>

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.470
<v Speaker 1>what advice or guidance would you,</v>

12
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.110
<v Speaker 1>would you give a person that got to that point?</v>

13
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.183
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

14
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 2>there's a story I read called the cocktail party.</v>

15
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.480
<v Speaker 2>I've mentioned this before by Tsa Elliot.</v>

16
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.510
<v Speaker 2>In the cocktail party,</v>

17
00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:55.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a scene,</v>

18
00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.310
<v Speaker 2>it's a play where this woman approaches a psychiatrist and starts talking to him</v>

19
00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:01.770
<v Speaker 2>about her problems.</v>

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.930
<v Speaker 2>And she said something that surprises him.</v>

21
00:01:03.931 --> 00:01:04.351
<v Speaker 2>She says,</v>

22
00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 2>I hope that I'm the problem.</v>

23
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.531
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

24
00:01:07.531 --> 00:01:07.681
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

25
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 2>why would you hope that?</v>

26
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.571
<v Speaker 2>And she says,</v>

27
00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:09.721
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

28
00:01:09.721 --> 00:01:10.740
<v Speaker 2>I thought about it a lot.</v>

29
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:12.750
<v Speaker 2>And if the world's the problem,</v>

30
00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.210
<v Speaker 2>then I'm done because I can't change the world.</v>

31
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.410
<v Speaker 2>But if I'm the problem,</v>

32
00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 2>then maybe there's something about myself I can change.</v>

33
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 2>I can undo this terrible situation that I meant.</v>

34
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.470
<v Speaker 2>And so I would say that's repentance.</v>

35
00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Fundamentally.</v>

36
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like there if,</v>

37
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.070
<v Speaker 2>and I say this carefully because I understand that people are susceptible to bad</v>

38
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:36.324
<v Speaker 2>fortune.</v>

39
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.950
<v Speaker 2>Sin and ignorance can make that worse,</v>

40
00:01:40.951 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 2>but independently of that like good people suffer.</v>

41
00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 2>Make no mistake about it,</v>

42
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 2>but if things aren't right for you,</v>

43
00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 2>if you're resentful about being,</v>

44
00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.640
<v Speaker 2>because that's the right way of cause,</v>

45
00:01:56.641 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 2>that's the deepest way of thinking about if you read the writings of the people</v>

46
00:02:00.031 --> 00:02:01.800
<v Speaker 2>who do the mass killings for example,</v>

47
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.360
<v Speaker 2>that's what you see over and over.</v>

48
00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:03.931
<v Speaker 2>It's cane.</v>

49
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:08.931
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're angry beyond comprehension at the intolerability of being and</v>

50
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 2>they're angry at God.</v>

51
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.860
<v Speaker 2>Even if they don't say it exactly like that.</v>

52
00:02:13.861 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 2>They come so close to saying it like that,</v>

53
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:16.940
<v Speaker 2>that it's,</v>

54
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference.</v>

55
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.120
<v Speaker 2>You know what God says to Cain is look to yourself first before you criticize</v>

56
00:02:24.121 --> 00:02:24.954
<v Speaker 2>being,</v>

57
00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 2>and that strikes me is right.</v>

58
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.170
<v Speaker 2>It's because to not do that as arrogant beyond belief that say tannic arrogance.</v>

59
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.161
<v Speaker 2>Literally,</v>

60
00:02:35.161 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 2>if something like that can be literal,</v>

61
00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 2>it's like don't make yourself the judge of being before you clean up your your</v>

62
00:02:42.481 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

63
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.063
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

64
00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.990
<v Speaker 2>And it because,</v>

65
00:02:46.991 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 2>and the other thing too,</v>

66
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.720
<v Speaker 2>this is something I learned in some part from soldier Nixon when he,</v>

67
00:02:50.721 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 2>when he was in the prison camps and trying to understand how these heroic people</v>

68
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:55.740
<v Speaker 2>he saw could possibly manage it.</v>

69
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.720
<v Speaker 2>One of the exercises he undertook,</v>

70
00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>and he really viewed this within Christian Orthodox context of Repentance and</v>

71
00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.034
<v Speaker 2>redemption,</v>

72
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.160
<v Speaker 2>is he said he went over his life with a fine tooth comb and tried to imagine all</v>

73
00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:14.581
<v Speaker 2>of the ethical mistakes he made in his entire life that he knew were mistakes,</v>

74
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:15.021
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

75
00:03:15.021 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

76
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.401
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

77
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 2>it was this was a soul search,</v>

78
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>

79
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.150
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't relying on external standards of morality except in so far as we're</v>

80
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 2>inevitably influenced by those.</v>

81
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 2>And then his idea was,</v>

82
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:28.480
<v Speaker 2>is there something I could do right now to put that right?</v>

83
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 2>And that's the right question.</v>

84
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 2>Like if things aren't going your way,</v>

85
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.750
<v Speaker 2>and I think that means that you're resentful and arrogant and deceitful.</v>

86
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Those are the three things that clump together.</v>

87
00:03:39.821 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I think that that,</v>

88
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 2>that constitute the core of evil.</v>

89
00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 2>It's something like that.</v>

90
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 2>And so if you're possessed by that,</v>

91
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.320
<v Speaker 2>which is a hell,</v>

92
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 2>then it's repentance.</v>

93
00:03:49.541 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 2>That's the right answer.</v>

94
00:03:50.741 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is you have to figure out what you did wrong and you have to</v>

95
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:55.594
<v Speaker 2>pay for it.</v>

96
00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 2>And then at least you could think,</v>

97
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:57.851
<v Speaker 2>well look,</v>

98
00:03:57.851 --> 00:04:00.490
<v Speaker 2>I can try that with all of my soul,</v>

99
00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>

100
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 2>and see what happens,</v>

101
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.521
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

102
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:04.960
<v Speaker 2>It could at least be an experiment.</v>

103
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 2>And then I would also say that that's an act of faith.</v>

104
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.110
<v Speaker 2>It's an act of faith to conduct that experiment because you put yourself on the</v>

105
00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:11.471
<v Speaker 2>line,</v>

106
00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

107
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 2>And that's what an act of faith is.</v>

108
00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.350
<v Speaker 2>You don't know the outcome,</v>

109
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.030
<v Speaker 2>but you don't know the outcome of your life.</v>

110
00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.790
<v Speaker 2>So to live in some senses,</v>

111
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.663
<v Speaker 2>an act of faith.</v>

112
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 2>You're putting faith in something that that's why you're moving forward.</v>

113
00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.640
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't move forward without an act of faith,</v>

114
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.691
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

115
00:04:25.691 --> 00:04:26.261
<v Speaker 2>And people say,</v>

116
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:26.441
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

117
00:04:26.441 --> 00:04:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I only move forward on the basis of the fact.</v>

118
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:29.081
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

119
00:04:29.081 --> 00:04:29.261
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

120
00:04:29.261 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 2>but you select the fact and there's an infinity of facts and they don't just</v>

121
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 2>tell you what to do.</v>

122
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 2>So it's not a credible answer.</v>

123
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.200
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in that situation,</v>

124
00:04:38.201 --> 00:04:39.034
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

125
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:41.830
<v Speaker 2>look to yourself,</v>

126
00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.821
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

127
00:04:42.821 --> 00:04:43.051
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

128
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 2>and one of the things about soldier that's a bloody amazing is that's what he</v>

129
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:46.860
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

130
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.990
<v Speaker 2>And then he wrote the Gulag archipelago and you know,</v>

131
00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.320
<v Speaker 2>he took an ax to the intellectual and moral substructure of,</v>

132
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.780
<v Speaker 2>of the totalitarian communist states.</v>

133
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 2>So while he was redeeming himself,</v>

134
00:04:58.361 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 2>let's say he was simultaneously redeeming the world,</v>

135
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.921
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

136
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:04.120
<v Speaker 2>you see something like that,</v>

137
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:04.810
<v Speaker 2>like you,</v>

138
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>you got to wake up,</v>

139
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

140
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.843
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

141
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>that was really something.</v>
