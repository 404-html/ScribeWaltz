00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.571
<v Speaker 1>I get striked,</v>

2
00:00:08.571 --> 00:00:12.000
<v Speaker 1>I've heard depressed people who stopped antidepressants 70 never helped in the</v>

3
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:12.631
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

4
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>What do you say to that,</v>

5
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:14.454
<v Speaker 1>Mr. Peterson?</v>

6
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.791
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

7
00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

8
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly possible.</v>

9
00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:17.703
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

10
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.030
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants don't necessarily work for everyone.</v>

11
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.210
<v Speaker 1>My personal opinion is that antidepressants work quite well for many people</v>

12
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 1>whose lives are in decent order.</v>

13
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.280
<v Speaker 1>So they have friends,</v>

14
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>they have family that loved them,</v>

15
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:34.800
<v Speaker 1>they have a career,</v>

16
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>they're educated approximately to the level of their intelligence.</v>

17
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 1>They have things to look forward to,</v>

18
00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.530
<v Speaker 1>but for some reason their mood is extremely distorted.</v>

19
00:00:43.531 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>M and,</v>

20
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.053
<v Speaker 1>and negative.</v>

21
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.470
<v Speaker 1>And I've seen antidepressants have miraculous effects on people like that.</v>

22
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:54.471
<v Speaker 1>I think they're less likely to work when people have a plethora of life</v>

23
00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

24
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 1>which isn't exactly the same thing as being</v>

25
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.863
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>

26
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

27
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>like you've been having a terrible life is not the same thing as being</v>

28
00:01:05.641 --> 00:01:06.474
<v Speaker 1>depressed.</v>

29
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.860
<v Speaker 1>Although the two can overlap.</v>

30
00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't obvious to me that people who,</v>

31
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.681
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:10.681 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 1>maybe they have a drinking problem or a drug abuse problem and they're</v>

33
00:01:13.681 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>unemployed and they have a pathological family and their friends aren't good for</v>

34
00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:18.751
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

35
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

36
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.243
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

37
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.701
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:20.991
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

39
00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

40
00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 1>they have a string of failures behind them and they don't have much to look</v>

41
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:25.950
<v Speaker 1>forward to in the future and all that.</v>

42
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

43
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot for an antidepressant overcome.</v>

44
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.210
<v Speaker 1>But under those circumstances,</v>

45
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:35.211
<v Speaker 1>maybe the antidepressants can help stave off feelings of like suicidal feelings</v>

46
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>and that sort of thing.</v>

47
00:01:36.721 --> 00:01:39.120
<v Speaker 1>But antidepressants don't work for everyone,</v>

48
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>but some people they work really well for.</v>

49
00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:43.290
<v Speaker 1>And if you're depressed,</v>

50
00:01:43.291 --> 00:01:44.820
<v Speaker 1>they're definitely worth a try.</v>

51
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:45.421
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:01:45.421 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>in a month if they're going to work.</v>

53
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.851
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

54
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:51.150
<v Speaker 1>there are a variety of different kinds of antidepressants and you have to figure</v>

55
00:01:51.151 --> 00:01:54.270
<v Speaker 1>up dose and you have to figure out when you should take them during the day and</v>

56
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:54.421
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

57
00:01:54.421 --> 00:01:55.830
<v Speaker 1>and you have to figure out tight.</v>

58
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>So they're,</v>

59
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.620
<v Speaker 1>they're not a cure or they're a tool for helping control negative emotion and</v>

60
00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>they can be very effective.</v>

61
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.601
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

62
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean that there aren't people that they didn't help.</v>

63
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.700
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would say about that.</v>
