00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.970
<v Speaker 1>So you've been an educator through the rise of the smartphone.</v>

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And my question basically relates to procrastination and task delay,</v>

3
00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>needless task delay specifically and given the unprecedented level of</v>

4
00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:16.330
<v Speaker 1>distraction that we have in today's world.</v>

5
00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to get your perspective from a psychological standpoint on other</v>

6
00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:23.020
<v Speaker 1>than cleaning your damn room,</v>

7
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.010
<v Speaker 1>what would you suggest to a student who's looking to overcome these things?</v>

8
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.461
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>I think with any,</v>

10
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.580
<v Speaker 1>let's call it an addictive process.</v>

11
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean emails powerfully addictive,</v>

12
00:00:37.031 --> 00:00:37.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

13
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.170
<v Speaker 1>Hardly it's,</v>

14
00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.540
<v Speaker 1>it's a slot machine and I mean that technically.</v>

15
00:00:40.541 --> 00:00:41.390
<v Speaker 1>So when you pull,</v>

16
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.890
<v Speaker 1>that's a variable ratio reinforcement schedule,</v>

17
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:45.850
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly.</v>

18
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And it's very addictive because if you pour on the slot machine arm enough,</v>

19
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:55.891
<v Speaker 1>you will win and you never know which pole will reward you.</v>

20
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.900
<v Speaker 1>And so not only is that addictive,</v>

21
00:00:58.901 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to extinguish that.</v>

22
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.613
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

23
00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.880
<v Speaker 1>emails like that because there's always something beckoning and now and then</v>

24
00:01:06.881 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>it's a jackpot.</v>

25
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.140
<v Speaker 1>And social media is like that because you know,</v>

26
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:16.141
<v Speaker 1>people are posting interesting things and so well how do you overcome an</v>

27
00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>addictive process?</v>

28
00:01:17.141 --> 00:01:20.440
<v Speaker 1>And partly you do it by replacing it with something better.</v>

29
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

30
00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 1>So when people study drug and alcohol use,</v>

31
00:01:25.721 --> 00:01:27.610
<v Speaker 1>they often make an elementary mistake,</v>

32
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:30.670
<v Speaker 1>which is to try to figure out why people use drugs and alcohol.</v>

33
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

34
00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 1>that's not a smart thing to wonder.</v>

35
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 1>We know why people use cocaine.</v>

36
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Cocaine directly stimulates the systems that produce positive emotion.</v>

37
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.201
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

38
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 1>so there's no mystery there.</v>

39
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>The mystery with cocaine is very,</v>

40
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:48.064
<v Speaker 1>very simple.</v>

41
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Why don't people take cocaine all the time until they die?</v>

42
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the mystery really.</v>

43
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:55.060
<v Speaker 1>Cause you can get isolated rats to do that.</v>

44
00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:55.770
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

45
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

46
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.310
<v Speaker 1>and for some people,</v>

47
00:01:57.311 --> 00:02:00.880
<v Speaker 1>alcohol has the same kind of effect except it's mediated by opiates.</v>

48
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.100
<v Speaker 1>But often what people have to do to get themselves out of an addictive process</v>

49
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>is to find something better to do to replace it.</v>

50
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.230
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say the problem with the gadgets,</v>

51
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are amazing things is that they interfere with the proximately</v>

52
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:20.140
<v Speaker 1>interfere with medium to longterm goals,</v>

53
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.003
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

54
00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>And so I think the first thing you have to do to bring them under control is</v>

55
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.370
<v Speaker 1>figure out what it is that their use is interfering with.</v>

56
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 1>It has to be something important,</v>

57
00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:28.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

58
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.321
<v Speaker 1>So you think,</v>

59
00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

60
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.570
<v Speaker 1>I want to do something important.</v>

61
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.783
<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

62
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 1>Or it could be personal.</v>

63
00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you want to have a relationship.</v>

64
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.843
<v Speaker 1>You want to get married,</v>

65
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.870
<v Speaker 1>you want to have kids,</v>

66
00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a career that's meaningful.</v>

67
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

68
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:41.284
<v Speaker 1>you want to have a life,</v>

69
00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 1>you want to have an Abrahamic adventure and be the father of nations,</v>

70
00:02:45.161 --> 00:02:45.521
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

71
00:02:45.521 --> 00:02:45.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:48.670
<v Speaker 1>you can't be ratting away on your cell phone and doing that.</v>

73
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.290
<v Speaker 1>And so I think,</v>

74
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.620
<v Speaker 1>I think part of it is to set your sights high ed and make a plan and figure out</v>

75
00:02:56.381 --> 00:03:01.381
<v Speaker 1>who you could be and see if obsessive utilization of smart phone fits into that</v>

76
00:03:02.951 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 1>vision of nobility.</v>

77
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.261
<v Speaker 1>And it will,</v>

78
00:03:05.261 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>partly because they're,</v>

79
00:03:06.161 --> 00:03:08.710
<v Speaker 1>they're unbelievably powerful communication devices.</v>

80
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:09.630
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>

81
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>so often it's,</v>

82
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.760
<v Speaker 1>it's for lack of something better to do and it also interferes.</v>

83
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 1>So that's about the best I can do with that.</v>
