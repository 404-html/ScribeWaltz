00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>You're supposed to read this week was gray marble of the limbic system and Basal</v>

2
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.273
<v Speaker 1>Ganglia.</v>

3
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:18.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a hard paper,</v>

4
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>but it's easy compared to the options paper,</v>

5
00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:22.440
<v Speaker 1>which was Swanson.</v>

6
00:00:22.441 --> 00:00:24.300
<v Speaker 1>And I had everybody read that last year,</v>

7
00:00:24.301 --> 00:00:25.160
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.110
<v Speaker 1>people were basically having convulsions.</v>

9
00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:30.900
<v Speaker 1>And so I decided that it wasn't really fair to get,</v>

10
00:00:30.901 --> 00:00:31.411
<v Speaker 1>you'd read it.</v>

11
00:00:31.411 --> 00:00:32.011
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

12
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:34.200
<v Speaker 1>I would very much recommend that you read it.</v>

13
00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:36.710
<v Speaker 1>And because it's a bloody brilliant paper and the old,</v>

14
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>you'll learn so much from it that it will be worth,</v>

15
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're interested in the scientific element of psychology at</v>

16
00:00:42.871 --> 00:00:43.381
<v Speaker 1>Swanson.</v>

17
00:00:43.381 --> 00:00:45.390
<v Speaker 1>He's a smart guy and that's a great paper.</v>

18
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.060
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I really liked about it,</v>

19
00:00:48.061 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 1>and this is what I'm going to an end about grades,</v>

20
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:50.904
<v Speaker 1>papers as well.</v>

21
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.980
<v Speaker 1>They're there,</v>

22
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.300
<v Speaker 1>they're there.</v>

23
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.470
<v Speaker 1>You're describing brain physiology and the relationship between that physiology</v>

24
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>and behavior in a way that's sufficiently sophisticated so that I actually think</v>

25
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>it's psychologically revealing.</v>

26
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.640
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

27
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.091
<v Speaker 1>it's so,</v>

28
00:01:06.091 --> 00:01:06.241
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

29
00:01:06.241 --> 00:01:08.280
<v Speaker 1>it's useful and important to know these things.</v>

30
00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:09.330
<v Speaker 1>And I think what's happening,</v>

31
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:10.231 --> 00:01:13.170
<v Speaker 1>I've been thinking more and more that that hierarchy that I'm showing you guys</v>

33
00:01:13.171 --> 00:01:14.004
<v Speaker 1>over and over,</v>

34
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.040
<v Speaker 1>I really think that that's basically a map of the unconscious.</v>

35
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that and it's not that hierarchy I showed you isn't</v>

36
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>obviously a fully worked out representation of the unconscious,</v>

37
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

38
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.930
<v Speaker 1>it's not a bad schemata.</v>

39
00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>And I think what it's missing is that,</v>

40
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:34.440
<v Speaker 1>the at near the bottom where you have the actual actions,</v>

42
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>those actions are actually sequenced into what you might call a motor melodies</v>

43
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>that have a perceptual frame associated with them.</v>

44
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>And then those are nested inside fundamental motivational systems.</v>

45
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>And Swanson's paper does a lovely job of detailing the,</v>

46
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.910
<v Speaker 1>the physiological substrate for that,</v>

47
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.451
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

48
00:01:54.451 --> 00:01:58.230
<v Speaker 1>So basically what he shows is that the nervous system is built up of</v>

49
00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:03.231
<v Speaker 1>hierarchical modules that start in the body that basically start with spinal</v>

50
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>reflexes.</v>

51
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.173
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

52
00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 1>sort of quick and dirty spinal reflexes that cause your,</v>

53
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.691
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

54
00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:11.910
<v Speaker 1>your people think of their brain is in their head.</v>

55
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

56
00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:13.463
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

57
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a big part of your brain in your head,</v>

58
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.540
<v Speaker 1>but a huge part of it's distributed through your body.</v>

59
00:02:18.541 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>So I re I re,</v>

60
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.990
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading and I hope this is correct,</v>

61
00:02:21.991 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 1>that there are more neurons in your autonomic nervous system,</v>

62
00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:27.930
<v Speaker 1>then there are in your central nervous system and the autonomic nervous system</v>

63
00:02:27.931 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>is distributed throughout the body and it's the part of the nervous system that</v>

64
00:02:30.691 --> 00:02:31.920
<v Speaker 1>governs all the things.</v>

65
00:02:31.921 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>You're too stupid to take care of,</v>

66
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.660
<v Speaker 1>like how your liver works and how your heart should stay beating and how you</v>

67
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:38.080
<v Speaker 1>digest food and you know,</v>

68
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 1>complicated things that consciousness isn't capable of dealing with and you</v>

69
00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:43.140
<v Speaker 1>don't want to,</v>

70
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.381
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to downplay the complexity of those sorts of functions.</v>

72
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 1>There are so important that evolution doesn't let you mess around with them.</v>

73
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.113
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

74
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.163
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

75
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.003
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.970
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

78
00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

79
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.920
<v Speaker 1>the voluntary motor system and the sensory system.</v>

80
00:02:56.921 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>So the central nervous system,</v>

81
00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.140
<v Speaker 1>your spine is fairly hefty bit of neural tissue and then of course the neurons</v>

84
00:03:04.721 --> 00:03:06.670
<v Speaker 1>themselves are distributed through your body.</v>

85
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:09.470
<v Speaker 1>So really your brain is distributed through your body.</v>

86
00:03:09.471 --> 00:03:13.150
<v Speaker 1>And there's also a tremendous number of neurons in your gut as well.</v>

87
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.280
<v Speaker 1>And some of those seem to actually produce information that might actually even</v>

88
00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:19.300
<v Speaker 1>acquire consciousness.</v>

89
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.451
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

90
00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't necessarily need it the gut level,</v>

91
00:03:21.311 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly informs you.</v>

92
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.033
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

93
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>so Swanson's basic proposition is that it's a Piagetian proposition.</v>

94
00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:29.171
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

95
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>that you lay out these initial reflex of behaviors and then they're sequenced</v>

96
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>into more complex melodies.</v>

97
00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

98
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

99
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.691
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

100
00:03:37.691 --> 00:03:38.524
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

101
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:38.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>the lowest level,</v>

103
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>highest resolution behaviors you practice and practice until you're an expert at</v>

104
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

105
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.561
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

106
00:03:44.561 --> 00:03:45.371
<v Speaker 1>you know how to grip,</v>

107
00:03:45.371 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to figure that out.</v>

108
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:50.560
<v Speaker 1>So you've got these elements of behavior that you can basically parse off to</v>

109
00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 1>automated systems.</v>

110
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:55.900
<v Speaker 1>And some of those automated systems are so automated that they're handled by</v>

111
00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>very low brain areas,</v>

112
00:03:57.131 --> 00:03:58.050
<v Speaker 1>like spinal levels.</v>

113
00:03:58.051 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

114
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:01.300
<v Speaker 1>if you take a paraplegic person and you,</v>

115
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.921
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

116
00:04:02.921 --> 00:04:03.754
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

117
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.170
<v Speaker 1>if you take a paraplegic person and you suspend them under the arms,</v>

118
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.180
<v Speaker 1>over a treadmill and tilt them forward,</v>

119
00:04:10.181 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>they'll walk has pretty remarkable because you wouldn't think that.</v>

120
00:04:13.661 --> 00:04:16.210
<v Speaker 1>But walking isn't that complicated.</v>

121
00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't say that.</v>

122
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.533
<v Speaker 1>Walking could be,</v>

123
00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>can be handled by the spine.</v>

124
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Figuring out where you want to walk.</v>

125
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:24.100
<v Speaker 1>That's more complicated.</v>

126
00:04:24.101 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 1>So higher order brain systems are involved in that,</v>

127
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:29.200
<v Speaker 1>but so you think about it as a hierarchy.</v>

128
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Now one of the things that that,</v>

129
00:04:31.151 --> 00:04:31.984
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

130
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>at Swanson really concentrates on is this is the function of the hypothalamus</v>

131
00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.720
<v Speaker 1>and she'd tell you some things about the hypothalamus.</v>

132
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>It's Sorta sits at the top of the,</v>

133
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>of the spinal cord and it's,</v>

134
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 1>it's not that big.</v>

135
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bitty brain area.</v>

136
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 1>Although it's,</v>

137
00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:49.750
<v Speaker 1>it's also not,</v>

138
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.591
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

139
00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:54.850
<v Speaker 1>you got to remember that when you hear a word like hypothalamus or word like</v>

140
00:04:54.851 --> 00:04:57.040
<v Speaker 1>emotion or word like brain,</v>

141
00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>those are low resolution words,</v>

142
00:04:58.871 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>The phenomena itself isn't homogenous.</v>

144
00:05:01.901 --> 00:05:04.300
<v Speaker 1>And so if you look at the hypothalamus,</v>

145
00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.650
<v Speaker 1>it's composed of modules and then those modules are composed of modules and</v>

146
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:12.520
<v Speaker 1>those modules modules are composed of modules and all the way down to the</v>

147
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>cellular level.</v>

148
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:16.630
<v Speaker 1>And then there's some modules there and that goes all the way down to the</v>

149
00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 1>molecular level.</v>

150
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 1>And then there's sub module is at the molecular level.</v>

151
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:21.550
<v Speaker 1>So it's really,</v>

152
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:22.600
<v Speaker 1>really complicated.</v>

153
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:26.620
<v Speaker 1>And to think about it as a homogenous system is just a low resolution</v>

154
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:27.490
<v Speaker 1>representations.</v>

155
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>So the hypothalamus isn't an entity,</v>

156
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.690
<v Speaker 1>it's a group of functionally related entities that are composed of groups of</v>

157
00:05:34.691 --> 00:05:35.900
<v Speaker 1>functionally related entities.</v>
