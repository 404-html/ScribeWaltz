1
00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.290
<v Speaker 1>You Start Your path and you think that you're heading towards your star and so</v>

2
00:00:11.411 --> 00:00:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you go in that direction and then because you're here,</v>

3
00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the world looks a particular way,</v>

4
00:00:17.561 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>but then when you move here,</v>

5
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>the world looks different and you're different as a consequence of having made</v>

6
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:28.090
<v Speaker 1>that voyage and so what that means is that now that thing that glimmers in front</v>

7
00:00:28.091 --> 00:00:32.920
<v Speaker 1>of you is going to have shifted its location because you weren't very good at</v>

8
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:36.550
<v Speaker 1>specifying it to begin with and now that you're a little sharper and more</v>

9
00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:37.930
<v Speaker 1>focused than you were,</v>

10
00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.040
<v Speaker 1>it's going to reveal itself with more accuracy to you.</v>

11
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.430
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have to take a.</v>

12
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

13
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.980
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like 180 degree reversal.</v>

14
00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 1>But it isn't because you know you've.</v>

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean you've gone this far and that's a long ways to get that far,</v>

16
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.190
<v Speaker 1>but that's a lot farther than you would be if you just stayed where you were</v>

17
00:01:03.411 --> 00:01:04.244
<v Speaker 1>waiting.</v>

18
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.170
<v Speaker 1>And so it doesn't matter that you overshoot continually.</v>

19
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Because as you overshoot,</v>

20
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.900
<v Speaker 1>even if you don't learn what you should have done,</v>

21
00:01:14.901 --> 00:01:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you're going to continually learn what you shouldn't keep doing.</v>

22
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 1>And if you learn enough about what you shouldn't keep doing,</v>

23
00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>then that's tantamount at some point to learning at the same time what you</v>

24
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:27.734
<v Speaker 1>should be doing.</v>

25
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.390
<v Speaker 1>So it's okay.</v>

26
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>So it's like this.</v>

27
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.520
<v Speaker 1>Now what's cool about it though,</v>

28
00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 1>I think is that as you progress,</v>

29
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:40.550
<v Speaker 1>the degree of overshooting starts to decline,</v>

30
00:01:40.551 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.180
<v Speaker 1>And that we know that there was nothing hypothetical about that.</v>

32
00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:45.860
<v Speaker 1>As you learn a new skill,</v>

33
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.730
<v Speaker 1>like even to play it,</v>

34
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>play a song on the piano,</v>

35
00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:48.441
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

36
00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:49.640
<v Speaker 1>you overshoot madly,</v>

37
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.440
<v Speaker 1>you make an all sorts of mistakes to begin with.</v>

38
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 1>And then the mistakes</v>

39
00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>they disappear.</v>

40
00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>There's a great ted talk,</v>

41
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.700
<v Speaker 1>I think it was about sky,</v>

42
00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

43
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>set up a really advanced computational recording system in his home and recorded</v>

44
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 1>every single utterance his young child made while learning to speak.</v>

45
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>And then he put together the child's attempts to say certain phonemes and put</v>

46
00:02:18.431 --> 00:02:22.570
<v Speaker 1>them in the list and you can hear the child deviating madly to begin with.</v>

47
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.970
<v Speaker 1>And then after hundreds and hundreds of repetitions,</v>

48
00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:28.240
<v Speaker 1>just zeroing in on the exact phoneme.</v>

49
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.463
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

50
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:30.610
<v Speaker 1>you might not know this,</v>

51
00:02:30.611 --> 00:02:31.820
<v Speaker 1>but when kids babble,</v>

52
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:33.670
<v Speaker 1>because they start babbling when they're quite young,</v>

53
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.470
<v Speaker 1>they babble every human phoneme including all sorts of phonemes that adults</v>

54
00:02:38.471 --> 00:02:39.304
<v Speaker 1>can't say,</v>

55
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.460
<v Speaker 1>and then they they die into their language so that after they learn,</v>

56
00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.791
<v Speaker 1>say English,</v>

57
00:02:45.791 --> 00:02:48.700
<v Speaker 1>then there's all sorts of phonemes they can no longer here or pronounced,</v>

58
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.391
<v Speaker 1>but to begin with,</v>

59
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:50.224
<v Speaker 1>it's all there,</v>

60
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.430
<v Speaker 1>which is really quite interesting,</v>

61
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but so they Z,</v>

62
00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>as they learn a particular language,</v>

63
00:02:55.391 --> 00:03:00.391
<v Speaker 1>they zero in on the proper way to pronounce that and their minimized and every</v>

64
00:03:00.731 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>time you learn something now that's how it is and that's really useful to know</v>

65
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:08.350
<v Speaker 1>too because it means that it's okay to wander around stupidly before you fix</v>

66
00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>your destination.</v>

67
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Now you see that echoed in exodus,</v>

68
00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

69
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.020
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is that the Egyptians or the Hebrews escape materiality,</v>

70
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of whatever you do personally and psychologically,</v>

71
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>when you escape from your previous set of stupidly held and ignorant and</v>

72
00:03:25.871 --> 00:03:27.130
<v Speaker 1>stubborn axioms,</v>

73
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like away from that tyranny.</v>

74
00:03:28.841 --> 00:03:29.141
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

75
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.471
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

76
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>I freed myself from that.</v>

77
00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.863
<v Speaker 1>Well then what?</v>

78
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

79
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:33.221
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

80
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>well now I'm on the way,</v>

81
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:34.511
<v Speaker 1>it's no,</v>

82
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:34.841
<v Speaker 1>you're not.</v>

83
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Now you're in the desert where you wonder around stupidly,</v>

84
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.480
<v Speaker 1>you know and worship the wrong things until you finally organized yourself</v>

85
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:45.940
<v Speaker 1>morally again and head in the proper direction,</v>

86
00:03:45.941 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 1>so that's worth knowing too because you think,</v>

87
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.601
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

88
00:03:49.601 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I got rid of a lot of things,</v>

89
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:51.911
<v Speaker 1>baggage,</v>

90
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>excess baggage that I didn't need in my life,</v>

91
00:03:53.951 --> 00:03:55.240
<v Speaker 1>and now everything's okay.</v>

92
00:03:55.241 --> 00:03:55.571
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

93
00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:55.721
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

94
00:03:55.721 --> 00:03:56.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

95
00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.430
<v Speaker 1>You've got rid of a whole set of scaffolds that were keeping you in place even</v>

96
00:04:00.431 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 1>though they were pathological.</v>

97
00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you have nothing and nothing actually turns out to be better than something</v>

98
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:07.780
<v Speaker 1>pathological,</v>

99
00:04:07.781 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>but you're still stuck with the problem of nothing,</v>

100
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

101
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.221
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:04:12.221 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly why exit this is structured the way that it is.</v>

103
00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:16.870
<v Speaker 1>It's that you escaped from maturity.</v>

104
00:04:16.871 --> 00:04:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It's hooray.</v>

105
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:18.910
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer slaves.</v>

106
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:19.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

107
00:04:19.091 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>well now you're nihilistic and lost.</v>

108
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not necessarily an improvement,</v>

109
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.940
<v Speaker 1>but it is,</v>

110
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:25.773
<v Speaker 1>but it is the pre.</v>

111
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

112
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.450
<v Speaker 1>it's also useful to know that because you can also be diluted into the idea that</v>

113
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>imagine that you're trying to become enlightened,</v>

114
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>which might mean to turn all those parts of you on that could be turned on.</v>

115
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.661
<v Speaker 1>You think,</v>

116
00:04:37.661 --> 00:04:37.781
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

117
00:04:37.781 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>that's just a linear pathway uphill.</v>

118
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.161
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

119
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:42.100
<v Speaker 1>it's just from one success to another.</v>

120
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:42.431
<v Speaker 1>It's no,</v>

121
00:04:42.431 --> 00:04:43.264
<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>

122
00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.210
<v Speaker 1>It's like here you are and you're not doing too badly and the first step is a</v>

123
00:04:46.211 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>complete bloody catastrophe.</v>

124
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.230
<v Speaker 1>It's worse and then maybe you can pull yourself together and you hit a new</v>

125
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>plateau and then that crumbles and shakes and bang.</v>

126
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:59.500
<v Speaker 1>It's worse again and so because part of the reason that people don't become</v>

127
00:04:59.501 --> 00:05:04.501
<v Speaker 1>enlightened is because it's punctuated by intermittent deserts essentially by</v>

128
00:05:05.051 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 1>intermittent catastrophes,</v>

129
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.390
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't know that well then you're basically screwed because you go</v>

130
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.330
<v Speaker 1>ahead on your movement forward and you collapsed and you think,</v>

131
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:13.481
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

132
00:05:13.481 --> 00:05:14.081
<v Speaker 1>that didn't work.</v>

133
00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:14.831
<v Speaker 1>I collapsed.</v>

134
00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:15.191
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

135
00:05:15.191 --> 00:05:15.880
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

136
00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 1>that's par for the course.</v>

137
00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.170
<v Speaker 1>It's not indication that you failed.</v>

138
00:05:20.171 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just indication that it's really hard and that when you learn something,</v>

139
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>you also unlearn something and the thing you unlearned is probably useful and</v>

140
00:05:27.851 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>unlearning it actually is painful.</v>

141
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:30.011
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

142
00:05:30.011 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you have to get out of a bad relationship,</v>

143
00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.310
<v Speaker 1>it's like not every,</v>

144
00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.203
<v Speaker 1>not any.</v>

145
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>There isn't any relationship that's a hundred percent bad.</v>

146
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:39.670
<v Speaker 1>So when you jump out of it,</v>

147
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>well maybe you're in better shape,</v>

148
00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 1>but you're still lonesome and disoriented.</v>

149
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 1>You don't know what your past was and you don't know what your present isn't.</v>

150
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.230
<v Speaker 1>He don't know what your future is.</v>

151
00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:48.460
<v Speaker 1>It's that's not.</v>

152
00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.380
<v Speaker 1>That's why people stay with the devil they know instead of you know,</v>

153
00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.880
<v Speaker 1>looking for the devil they don't know so,</v>

154
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>so anyways,</v>

155
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.640
<v Speaker 1>the fact that you're full of faults doesn't mean you have to stop and thank God</v>

156
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:04.461
<v Speaker 1>for that.</v>

157
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>That's a really useful thing and the fact that you're full of faults doesn't</v>

158
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:13.331
<v Speaker 1>mean that you can't learn and so you can pause it in an ideal and you're going</v>

159
00:06:13.411 --> 00:06:14.420
<v Speaker 1>to be wrong about it,</v>

160
00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter because what you're right about is positing the ideal,</v>

161
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>moving towards it.</v>

162
00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:20.660
<v Speaker 1>If the actual ideal isn't</v>

163
00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.410
<v Speaker 1>conceptualized perfectly,</v>

164
00:06:24.411 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>well first surprise,</v>

165
00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.061
<v Speaker 1>surprise,</v>

166
00:06:26.061 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 1>because like what are you going to do that's perfect.</v>

167
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.450
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't matter that it's imperfect,</v>

168
00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:31.281
<v Speaker 1>imperfect,</v>

169
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:33.770
<v Speaker 1>it just matters that you do it and that you move forward.</v>

170
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>So that's really,</v>

171
00:06:34.851 --> 00:06:38.000
<v Speaker 1>that's really positive news as far as I'm concerned because you could actually</v>

172
00:06:38.001 --> 00:06:38.481
<v Speaker 1>do that,</v>

173
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

174
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.420
<v Speaker 1>You can do it badly and anyone can do that.</v>

175
00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:42.254
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

176
00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:43.183
<v Speaker 1>that's useful.</v>

177
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.781
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

178
00:06:44.781 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 1>So like if you were an efficient person,</v>

179
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.130
<v Speaker 1>you would have just done that but you're not.</v>

180
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:50.211
<v Speaker 1>But who cares,</v>

181
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:50.431
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

182
00:06:50.431 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>and you still end up in the,</v>

183
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>in the same place and maybe the trip is even more interesting.</v>

184
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

185
00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Probably too interesting.</v>
