00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.130
<v Speaker 1>I think what people have to adapt to the fact that systems chronically collapse</v>

2
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:14.480
<v Speaker 1>at every level of severity.</v>

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 1>And that's life life.</v>

4
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:20.930
<v Speaker 1>He is the sequential collapse of systems at each level of resolution.</v>

5
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker 1>And so systems last for a while,</v>

6
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.270
<v Speaker 1>great depend on,</v>

7
00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.873
<v Speaker 1>but then they,</v>

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.020
<v Speaker 1>then they collapse.</v>

9
00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.880
<v Speaker 1>And you need to be the sort of thing that can transform itself during a collapse</v>

10
00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>so that you're there for the next system.</v>

11
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 1>And that's a death and rebirth essentially.</v>

12
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.150
<v Speaker 1>That's your death and rebirth so that the old you that was in the old</v>

13
00:00:41.151 --> 00:00:44.660
<v Speaker 1>environment gets punished out of existence and that hurts like hell and gets you</v>

14
00:00:44.661 --> 00:00:49.520
<v Speaker 1>all depressed and anxious and then you're in a state of crisis and as things</v>

15
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>fall apart and then up comes a new you and there's a new environment and away</v>

16
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:54.224
<v Speaker 1>way you go.</v>

17
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.090
<v Speaker 1>And so people have to be,</v>

18
00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 1>people have to be disciplined enough to be part of a system and flexible enough</v>

19
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>to transform when the system fails.</v>

20
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.390
<v Speaker 1>And that's basically the two fundamental,</v>

21
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.600
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

22
00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>w adaptive elements that enable success of living.</v>

23
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.970
<v Speaker 1>And people have known that in one form or another for in story form for</v>

24
00:01:22.011 --> 00:01:23.090
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
