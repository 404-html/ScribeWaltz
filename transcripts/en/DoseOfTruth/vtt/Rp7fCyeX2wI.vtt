1
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>And the Midianites sold Joseph into Egypt unto Potiphar,</v>

2
00:00:11.841 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>an officer of Pharaohs and captain of the guard.</v>

3
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Potiphar,</v>

4
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:17.540
<v Speaker 1>an officer of Pharaoh,</v>

5
00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Speaker 1>captain of the guard,</v>

6
00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>and Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites,</v>

7
00:00:21.441 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>which had brought him down.</v>

8
00:00:22.281 --> 00:00:24.740
<v Speaker 1>Thither so now he's a slave.</v>

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.380
<v Speaker 1>So now you'd think,</v>

10
00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:27.531
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

11
00:00:27.531 --> 00:00:28.364
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>

12
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.760
<v Speaker 1>this is a man who has a lot of reason to be irritated at the structure of</v>

13
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:34.441
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

14
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:34.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:38.610
<v Speaker 1>He's gone from being the favorite to being betrayed by all of his brothers.</v>

16
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.630
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty rough.</v>

17
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.500
<v Speaker 1>And then he's being transformed into a slave and now he's being,</v>

18
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>he's being sold to work as a slave.</v>

19
00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>So you'd think that that would corrupt his character because you know,</v>

20
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.331
<v Speaker 1>one of the things,</v>

21
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:51.890
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the case anyways,</v>

22
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.070
<v Speaker 1>I think people are always looking for an excuse to have their character</v>

23
00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:55.904
<v Speaker 1>corrupted.</v>

24
00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Because if your character is corrupted,</v>

25
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.620
<v Speaker 1>then you get to lie and you get to cheat and you get to steal and you get to be</v>

26
00:01:00.621 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 1>trade and you get to act resentfully and he get to do nothing.</v>

27
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's all easy.</v>

28
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.680
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to lie than to tell the truth.</v>

29
00:01:06.681 --> 00:01:08.600
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to do nothing than to do something.</v>

30
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 1>So there's always part of you thinking,</v>

31
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:11.181 --> 00:01:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I need a justification for being useless and horrible because that,</v>

33
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.310
<v Speaker 1>that'd be a lot less work.</v>

34
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>And so then if something terrible comes along,</v>

35
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.141
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

36
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:21.830
<v Speaker 1>Aha,</v>

37
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>that's just exactly the excuse that I was waiting for.</v>

38
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.840
<v Speaker 1>And then out all of outcomes,</v>

39
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.691
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:01:28.691 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>a soldier Dimson when he was in the concentration camps in Russia,</v>

41
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.360
<v Speaker 1>watching how people behaved,</v>

42
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.321
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:38.860
<v Speaker 1>he said that there were people that were put into camps who immediately became</v>

44
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:39.431
<v Speaker 1>trustees,</v>

45
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.061
<v Speaker 1>are guards,</v>

46
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:43.490
<v Speaker 1>and they were even more vicious than the people who had been hired as guards.</v>

47
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And his idea was that they had collected all that,</v>

48
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>he called it fallenness,</v>

49
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly,</v>

50
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 1>around them in normal life.</v>

51
00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>But they didn't have the opportunity to express it.</v>

52
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.800
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as you gave them the opportunity,</v>

53
00:01:58.801 --> 00:01:59.431
<v Speaker 1>it was like there,</v>

54
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 1>it was right away.</v>

55
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:01.284
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

56
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.620
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

57
00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.620
<v Speaker 1>So one of the messages that seems to echo through these old testament stories is</v>

58
00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:12.940
<v Speaker 1>that just because something terrible happens to you doesn't mean that you get to</v>

59
00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:13.774
<v Speaker 1>be,</v>

60
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>that you get to wander off the path and make things worse.</v>

61
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>And maybe it doesn't matter how terrible it is that what happens to you.</v>

62
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a tough call,</v>

63
00:02:24.761 --> 00:02:25.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

64
00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:28.720
<v Speaker 1>because you see people now and then in life who they've really got it rough man,</v>

65
00:02:28.721 --> 00:02:31.870
<v Speaker 1>like 50 bad things are happening to them at the same time and you think,</v>

66
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.201
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

67
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 1>it's no wonder if you are bitter and resentful and hostile and be like,</v>

68
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.340
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

69
00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Speaker 1>no wonder.</v>

70
00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.940
<v Speaker 1>But then you meet people and social needs and again talked about this in the</v>

71
00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:40.810
<v Speaker 1>Gulag archipelago.</v>

72
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>He said he met lots of people in the not lot.</v>

73
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>He met enough people to impress him in the concentration camp system who didn't</v>

74
00:02:48.251 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 1>allow their misfortunes to corrupt them.</v>

75
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And that's something man,</v>

76
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>because maybe the only real misfortune is to become corrupted.</v>

77
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a really useful thing to think.</v>

78
00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.891
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

79
00:02:58.891 --> 00:02:59.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe the rest of it,</v>

80
00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.080
<v Speaker 1>maybe the rest of it is trivial in comparison.</v>

81
00:03:03.081 --> 00:03:06.770
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a rough thing because you can be in very harsh circumstances,</v>

82
00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:08.900
<v Speaker 1>but I do think there's something to that.</v>
