1
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>when you also have to look with regards to the shadow ideas,</v>

3
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:15.580
<v Speaker 1>like you have to get in touch with the depths of your anger.</v>

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.271
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5
00:00:16.271 --> 00:00:19.060
<v Speaker 1>lots of people are resentful about all sorts of things.</v>

6
00:00:19.061 --> 00:00:23.680
<v Speaker 1>They're resentful about Oh women and they're resentful about men and they're</v>

7
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 1>resentful about the patriarchy.</v>

8
00:00:25.181 --> 00:00:28.900
<v Speaker 1>And there are resentful about the left wing and resentful about the right wing</v>

9
00:00:28.901 --> 00:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>and the resentful about politicians and they're resentful about like the</v>

10
00:00:33.461 --> 00:00:38.250
<v Speaker 1>cataclysmic force of nature and its ability to make people sick and,</v>

11
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.461
<v Speaker 1>and suffer.</v>

12
00:00:39.461 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>And they're resentful about their own inadequacies and about their bad parenting</v>

13
00:00:44.321 --> 00:00:47.560
<v Speaker 1>and God like the list is just bloody endless.</v>

14
00:00:47.561 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 1>And that can make you very,</v>

15
00:00:49.661 --> 00:00:50.494
<v Speaker 1>very angry.</v>

16
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>That's part of that resentment and cynical and bitter and dark and full of</v>

17
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:59.560
<v Speaker 1>fantasies about destruction and the desire to bring things down and the wish</v>

18
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>that everyone else suffered and the desire to shake your fist at God.</v>

19
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And all of that's really dark.</v>

20
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

21
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:07.181
<v Speaker 1>Young said,</v>

22
00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>well the shadow of the human shout,</v>

23
00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:10.750
<v Speaker 1>it extends all the way down to hell.</v>

24
00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And you really meant that,</v>

25
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>because all of the terrible things that people are motivated to do are</v>

27
00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>associated with that shadow domain.</v>

28
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>Like none of you are any,</v>

29
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.440
<v Speaker 1>none of you are saints in any likelihood.</v>

30
00:01:26.441 --> 00:01:28.720
<v Speaker 1>You have a terrible capacity for destructiveness.</v>

31
00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:32.500
<v Speaker 1>And when you start to consult your resentment and to see how angry you are,</v>

32
00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.260
<v Speaker 1>it can terrify you to see the depths of that anger.</v>

33
00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes that'll manifest itself in very destructive fantasies,</v>

34
00:01:38.471 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.073
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

36
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>which you might not want to become conscious of because there's so brutal let's</v>

37
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.001
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>

38
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:49.750
<v Speaker 1>and so aggressive that you can't even believe that you generate them the nice</v>

39
00:01:49.751 --> 00:01:50.950
<v Speaker 1>person that's you.</v>

40
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like so it's quite frightening to open the door and see all that.</v>

41
00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>And that also associates you with the entire dark shadow of mankind,</v>

42
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

43
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.010
<v Speaker 1>The sate tannic element of the human character.</v>

44
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

45
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>but it opens the door down understanding as well too,</v>

46
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.120
<v Speaker 1>to understanding how people can do terrible things because you could see</v>

47
00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>yourself as one of the people who could do terrible things.</v>

48
00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 1>That's really useful.</v>

49
00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:14.914
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.873
<v Speaker 1>cause then you,</v>

51
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.050
<v Speaker 1>well then maybe you start to be motivated to be the sort of person who wouldn't</v>

52
00:02:20.051 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>do terrible things.</v>

53
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

54
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>if you can really come to terms with the fact that that's part and parcel of</v>

55
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:25.480
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

56
00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.210
<v Speaker 1>It also is some perverse sense.</v>

57
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 1>It's also a discovery of your own strength though because you know if you have</v>

58
00:02:31.931 --> 00:02:33.820
<v Speaker 1>that desire for aggression,</v>

59
00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>that desire for destruction and that that,</v>

60
00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>that ability to fantasize in that aggressive manner,</v>

61
00:02:40.271 --> 00:02:44.320
<v Speaker 1>it also means that you can incorporate some of that into your speech and into</v>

62
00:02:44.321 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>your actions so that you're a lot more immovable,</v>

63
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

64
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.450
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

65
00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>and a lot more of a force to contend with.</v>

66
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>It can give you some respect for yourself.</v>

67
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 1>When you realize that you're a force of destruction as well as creation,</v>

68
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>then you're also more likely to treat yourself with a bit more intelligent</v>

69
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.844
<v Speaker 1>caution,</v>

70
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>to know that you're a part of you.</v>

72
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>Is it ticking bomb in some sense that could go off.</v>

73
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.223
<v Speaker 1>And so you,</v>

74
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

75
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>you try it a bit more lightly around yourself and maybe you encourage people to</v>

76
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:18.100
<v Speaker 1>tread a bit more lightly around you as well,</v>

77
00:03:18.101 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>which isn't such a bad thing.</v>

78
00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.430
<v Speaker 1>And all the people that I really admired that I know have a clearly dangerous</v>

79
00:03:24.431 --> 00:03:27.220
<v Speaker 1>side and you don't want to get,</v>

80
00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to have that activated any more than necessary.</v>

81
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.710
<v Speaker 1>But it's also what makes them respectable and strong,</v>

82
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.630
<v Speaker 1>especially if they have that under control.</v>

83
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.973
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

84
00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.811
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

85
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:40.180
<v Speaker 1>that's a bit of a dialogue about shadow integration.</v>

86
00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

87
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.850
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

88
00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Challenging undertaking,</v>

89
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.711
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:03:45.711 --> 00:03:49.580
<v Speaker 1>to pull in that dark side of your character.</v>

91
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.040
<v Speaker 1>And that would be all the things that you've repressed or failed to develop as a</v>

92
00:03:55.041 --> 00:03:57.650
<v Speaker 1>consequence of trying to be a harmless.</v>

93
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.513
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

94
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.663
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

95
00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.730
<v Speaker 1>well let's say a harmless and</v>

96
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.860
<v Speaker 1>harmless citizen who looks virtuous on the surface.</v>

97
00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.600
<v Speaker 1>That's the union persona.</v>

98
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.370
<v Speaker 1>And you need that because everybody needs a mask that they wear in public,</v>

99
00:04:13.371 --> 00:04:14.204
<v Speaker 1>like a suit,</v>

100
00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.920
<v Speaker 1>so that we can tolerate seeing each other on the street.</v>

102
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.340
<v Speaker 1>We don't have to look right into our depths every time we interact.</v>

103
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.720
<v Speaker 1>We need that persona,</v>

104
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.120
<v Speaker 1>but that has to be transcendent.</v>

105
00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>And the way to transcend that is to integrate the darker parts of the character.</v>

106
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 1>They're very useful.</v>

107
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.223
<v Speaker 1>That aggression,</v>

108
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.670
<v Speaker 1>that's sexual demand,</v>

109
00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:36.504
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>

110
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.260
<v Speaker 1>All of that's very difficult to socialize that competitiveness,</v>

111
00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.160
<v Speaker 1>but unbelievably useful in terms of force of character.</v>

112
00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>If you could manage it.</v>
