1
00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.573
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.390
<v Speaker 1>What's your take on universal income?</v>

3
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Is it a fast track to new communism,</v>

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.260
<v Speaker 1>capitalism killer or a possible way out of starvation for humanity?</v>

5
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.723
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

6
00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

7
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it addresses the fundamental problem and I think it's a,</v>

8
00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.310
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a mirror of the rights responsibility problem.</v>

9
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

10
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.373
<v Speaker 1>you might say,</v>

11
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 1>well everyone has a right to the basics of life at first of all,</v>

12
00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:42.850
<v Speaker 1>that's a debatable proposition because</v>

13
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.510
<v Speaker 1>the question is who's going to provide those necessities?</v>

14
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>And the answer shouldn't be someone else under compulsion.</v>

15
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.513
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

16
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.770
<v Speaker 1>because each right comes at the expense of someone else's responsibility.</v>

17
00:00:57.771 --> 00:01:02.771
<v Speaker 1>And so you don't want to multiply rights beyond minimum necessity because you</v>

18
00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:07.901
<v Speaker 1>also multiply diverse responsibilities beyond tolerance.</v>

19
00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>But more importantly than that I would say is that</v>

20
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>let's make it more concrete.</v>

21
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.830
<v Speaker 1>So let's imagine that as the technological revolution progresses,</v>

22
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.960
<v Speaker 1>more and more people will be in danger of being replaced by intelligent</v>

23
00:01:24.961 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>

24
00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Now we don't know if that's true because it hasn't happened yet.</v>

25
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:29.221
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

26
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>And everyone has been predicting that that was going to happen since like 1960</v>

27
00:01:32.761 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>and it hasn't happened.</v>

28
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>And so there may be an infinite amount of work and we're never going to run out</v>

29
00:01:37.441 --> 00:01:37.801
<v Speaker 1>of work.</v>

30
00:01:37.801 --> 00:01:39.240
<v Speaker 1>I suspect that's probably the case.</v>

31
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:44.241
<v Speaker 1>But let's assume that people do get dispossessed as technology's transform.</v>

32
00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>And then we have the problem of the development of people for who have no viable</v>

33
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>means of making a living.</v>

34
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.030
<v Speaker 1>And the question might be,</v>

35
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>what's the fundamental problem there?</v>

37
00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.993
<v Speaker 1>And one answer is,</v>

38
00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.281
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>they don't have any money,</v>

40
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 1>but I actually don't think that that is the fundamental problem.</v>

41
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

42
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:07.910
<v Speaker 1>I've had many people in my clinical practice who were unemployed and had money.</v>

43
00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Now they didn't have a lot of money,</v>

44
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.370
<v Speaker 1>but they had enough money and enough money to keep privation at bay,</v>

45
00:02:14.371 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

46
00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.200
<v Speaker 1>And enough money to,</v>

47
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.891
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:16.891 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 1>that was the rub.</v>

49
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>Enough money to get themselves into plenty of trouble.</v>

50
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.250
<v Speaker 1>And so one of my clients,</v>

51
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:23.851
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

52
00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:24.684
<v Speaker 1>was a,</v>

53
00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I liked him quite a lot.</v>

54
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:26.640
<v Speaker 1>And he had,</v>

55
00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.120
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

56
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>he had worked in a hospital and he'd been hurt.</v>

57
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.493
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

58
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.860
<v Speaker 1>and then he got onto painkillers because he'd been hurt.</v>

59
00:02:34.861 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>And then he got addicted to painkillers and then he got addicted to cocaine and</v>

60
00:02:38.911 --> 00:02:43.911
<v Speaker 1>his life took a bad nosedive and he is actually pretty good unless he had money.</v>

61
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>But as soon as he had a check,</v>

62
00:02:47.131 --> 00:02:47.490
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

63
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:48.301
<v Speaker 1>he was gone.</v>

64
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.320
<v Speaker 1>He was in a ditch,</v>

65
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.610
<v Speaker 1>he was in a bar,</v>

66
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.210
<v Speaker 1>he spent all his money and he was face down in a ditch.</v>

67
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's where he woke up the next day.</v>

68
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I'm telling you that story is because it wasn't that he didn't</v>

69
00:03:00.581 --> 00:03:01.031
<v Speaker 1>have money,</v>

70
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't the problem.</v>

71
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.943
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

72
00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.990
<v Speaker 1>The problem was that he didn't have a purpose.</v>

73
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a place anymore.</v>

74
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>He got thrown out of the structure that would have enabled him to find</v>

75
00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>productive meaning,</v>

76
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

77
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.141
<v Speaker 1>when you might've said,</v>

78
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:14.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:03:14.261 --> 00:03:16.330
<v Speaker 1>he should have been able to conjure that up on his own.</v>

80
00:03:16.331 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps that's the case.</v>

81
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>Although he wasn't the world's most sophisticated person,</v>

82
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.820
<v Speaker 1>and people very substantially in their sophistication and it,</v>

84
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>and he didn't have a good family.</v>

85
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:27.910
<v Speaker 1>He didn't have a support network around him.</v>

86
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of a lost character in many,</v>

87
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:30.574
<v Speaker 1>many ways.</v>

88
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 1>And so it was easy for him to fall out of the world,</v>

89
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.450
<v Speaker 1>which is what he did.</v>

90
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.690
<v Speaker 1>And providing him with money was not going to fix that and say what is going to</v>

91
00:03:40.751 --> 00:03:41.584
<v Speaker 1>fix that?</v>

92
00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good question.</v>

93
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

94
00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>we have a program,</v>

95
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>some of you people might be interested in it.</v>

96
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.343
<v Speaker 1>It's called,</v>

97
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>it's part of a suite of online writing programs called the self authoring suite.</v>

98
00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.870
<v Speaker 1>It's out self authoring dot calm and one of the programs is called future</v>

99
00:04:01.631 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>authoring.</v>

100
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.850
<v Speaker 1>And we've experimented with this program in an attempt to address this problem.</v>

101
00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.751
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

102
00:04:07.751 --> 00:04:12.751
<v Speaker 1>So I mentioned to you tonight the idea that we live out a story and we need a</v>

103
00:04:14.711 --> 00:04:16.780
<v Speaker 1>purpose to live out that story properly.</v>

104
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>And what that implies is that you need a purpose.</v>

105
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:20.381
<v Speaker 1>You need a point,</v>

106
00:04:20.381 --> 00:04:21.370
<v Speaker 1>you need a name,</v>

107
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 1>you need to precise saying you need an aim that's of sufficient</v>

108
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.660
<v Speaker 1>nobility.</v>

109
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.100
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of any other word,</v>

110
00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.761
<v Speaker 1>sufficient,</v>

111
00:04:30.761 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 1>no ability to justify your miserable existence even to yourself.</v>

112
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:37.120
<v Speaker 1>And you need to develop that aim.</v>

113
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.550
<v Speaker 1>And so we built this program.</v>

114
00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.750
<v Speaker 1>I started working on it about 15 years ago when I was giving my students</v>

115
00:04:43.751 --> 00:04:45.850
<v Speaker 1>exercises to do at university.</v>

116
00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:50.680
<v Speaker 1>And one of the exercises I had them do was that they had to pick a small problem</v>

117
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 1>maybe in their family or with their room and fix it,</v>

118
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.840
<v Speaker 1>not try to fix it,</v>

119
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:56.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

120
00:04:56.231 --> 00:04:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but actually pick a problem that was small that they could fix,</v>

121
00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>clean up the cigarette butts in the yard,</v>

122
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:02.830
<v Speaker 1>outside the residents.</v>

123
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.833
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

124
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>clean the room.</v>

125
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.350
<v Speaker 1>We had one kid whose mother had died in the family,</v>

126
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 1>got kind of fragmented and he decided that he was going to take over the</v>

127
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>maternal duties in the household and the kids were supposed to write about what</v>

128
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:17.260
<v Speaker 1>happened when they tried to put this into practice because doing things like</v>

129
00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.690
<v Speaker 1>that is way more difficult than anybody ever realizes.</v>

130
00:05:19.691 --> 00:05:23.850
<v Speaker 1>And so he tried to become mother and the family needed a mother and he,</v>

131
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.680
<v Speaker 1>he encountered all sorts of terrible resistance,</v>

132
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.750
<v Speaker 1>which is completely unsurprising.</v>

133
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

134
00:05:29.141 --> 00:05:29.591
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

135
00:05:29.591 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>people in his family were annoyed that he would dare to try to take their dead</v>

136
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:33.730
<v Speaker 1>mother's place.</v>

137
00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:34.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

138
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:38.080
<v Speaker 1>even though he was trying to do it for the best of reasons and we,</v>

139
00:05:38.081 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I played with that for a couple of years and that was very interesting.</v>

140
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:45.250
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized that I was teaching students all these stories about</v>

141
00:05:45.251 --> 00:05:45.671
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

142
00:05:45.671 --> 00:05:50.671
<v Speaker 1>but nobody had ever had them write a story about their purpose essentially.</v>

143
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:52.473
<v Speaker 1>So I thought,</v>

144
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.201
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

145
00:05:53.201 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>isn't that interesting here are these,</v>

146
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.811
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

147
00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:56.471
<v Speaker 1>these kids,</v>

148
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>they've been in university,</v>

149
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 1>they've been in school for 15 years</v>

150
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>and no one has ever sat them down and said,</v>

151
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.700
<v Speaker 1>well what sort of character do you want to develop?</v>

152
00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>Who should you be and why don't you write that out and justify it,</v>

153
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.281
<v Speaker 1>six pages,</v>

155
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>something like that with the same amount of care and attention that you might</v>

156
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:21.350
<v Speaker 1>spend or even more on an essay about the war of 1812 or something like that.</v>

157
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.513
<v Speaker 1>Think well,</v>

158
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.840
<v Speaker 1>and the more I thought about that,</v>

159
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.674
<v Speaker 1>the more</v>

160
00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.050
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

161
00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Flabbergasted I would say I became because I thought,</v>

162
00:06:28.601 --> 00:06:28.691
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

163
00:06:28.691 --> 00:06:29.440
<v Speaker 1>what the heck?</v>

164
00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.440
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible that we could set up an education system and run people</v>

165
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:39.340
<v Speaker 1>through it for 15 years and never have them forced,</v>

166
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:40.330
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

167
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.410
<v Speaker 1>to figure out who they want it to be and to justify it in an articulate manner.</v>

168
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:48.130
<v Speaker 1>And so I built this program with my colleagues to help people do that.</v>

169
00:06:48.131 --> 00:06:49.510
<v Speaker 1>And I used it my classes first.</v>

170
00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:50.021
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought,</v>

171
00:06:50.021 --> 00:06:50.231
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

172
00:06:50.231 --> 00:06:54.430
<v Speaker 1>well here's the game and this is like rural to treat yourself like you're</v>

173
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:55.990
<v Speaker 1>someone responsible for helping.</v>

174
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.630
<v Speaker 1>And that doesn't mean be good to yourself.</v>

175
00:06:58.631 --> 00:07:00.760
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean me be nice to yourself.</v>

176
00:07:00.761 --> 00:07:05.230
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean give yourself an easy life that isn't actually what you do to</v>

177
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:05.591
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

178
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:06.460
<v Speaker 1>If you care for them,</v>

179
00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.490
<v Speaker 1>you actually present them with something like an optimal challenge.</v>

180
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:10.510
<v Speaker 1>That's what you do with kids.</v>

181
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.420
<v Speaker 1>If you love them as you present them with an optimal challenge so they can</v>

182
00:07:13.421 --> 00:07:14.260
<v Speaker 1>develop and grow.</v>

183
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you should do for yourself if you're taking care of yourself.</v>

184
00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:18.791
<v Speaker 1>So I just thought,</v>

185
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:19.031
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

186
00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:19.900
<v Speaker 1>well here's the game.</v>

187
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.001
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

188
00:07:22.001 --> 00:07:25.390
<v Speaker 1>assume that you're worth taking a care that you're worth taking care of.</v>

189
00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:27.220
<v Speaker 1>And that it's your responsibility to do so.</v>

190
00:07:27.221 --> 00:07:29.020
<v Speaker 1>Even if you don't like yourself very much.</v>

191
00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.740
<v Speaker 1>And lots of people don't and they have their reasons because everybody is very</v>

192
00:07:32.741 --> 00:07:33.970
<v Speaker 1>aware of their own flaws,</v>

193
00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:34.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're narcissistic,</v>

195
00:07:35.711 --> 00:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you're more aware of your own flaws then of anyone else's flaws.</v>

196
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:41.770
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you're not very happy with yourself and you don't think that you</v>

197
00:07:41.771 --> 00:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>deserve to have an okay life.</v>

198
00:07:43.781 --> 00:07:47.410
<v Speaker 1>And so you punish yourself and you set yourself up for failure and all and all</v>

199
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:47.681
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>

200
00:07:47.681 --> 00:07:48.790
<v Speaker 1>and that happens all the time.</v>

201
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.320
<v Speaker 1>Or you just don't aim or you don't have any goals or you know you're guilty and</v>

202
00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:55.840
<v Speaker 1>resentful and feel that you should be punished.</v>

203
00:07:55.841 --> 00:07:57.580
<v Speaker 1>So you have to abandon all that.</v>

204
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.140
<v Speaker 1>Treat yourself like you're someone you're responsible for helping,</v>

205
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 1>responsible for helping.</v>

206
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 1>Imagine yourself three to five years into the future.</v>

207
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.740
<v Speaker 1>You get to have what you need.</v>

208
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.610
<v Speaker 1>If you're taking care of yourself,</v>

209
00:08:11.611 --> 00:08:12.444
<v Speaker 1>you can have it,</v>

210
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.230
<v Speaker 1>but you have to figure out what it is because you are not going to get it unless</v>

211
00:08:16.231 --> 00:08:17.064
<v Speaker 1>you aim at it.</v>

212
00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:21.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's rule 10 is be precise in your speech.</v>

213
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.340
<v Speaker 1>And the reason I wrote that rule is,</v>

214
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.460
<v Speaker 1>is because you can be bloody sure that you're not going to hit a target unless</v>

215
00:08:26.461 --> 00:08:27.001
<v Speaker 1>you ain't mad it.</v>

216
00:08:27.001 --> 00:08:28.560
<v Speaker 1>And the more precise you make the target,</v>

217
00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:30.670
<v Speaker 1>the higher the probability that you'll aim at it,</v>

218
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:32.250
<v Speaker 1>that you'll hit it when you aim at it.</v>

219
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.950
<v Speaker 1>So what do you want?</v>

220
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.341
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

221
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:35.461
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

222
00:08:35.461 --> 00:08:38.730
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to even think about what I want because as soon as I figured out</v>

223
00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:39.301
<v Speaker 1>what I want,</v>

224
00:08:39.301 --> 00:08:44.160
<v Speaker 1>then I've made clear Mike conditions for failure and it's the last thing I'm</v>

225
00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:44.940
<v Speaker 1>going to do.</v>

226
00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.560
<v Speaker 1>And so people envelop themselves in Vegas so they don't have to confront their</v>

227
00:08:49.561 --> 00:08:50.370
<v Speaker 1>own failure,</v>

228
00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:53.790
<v Speaker 1>but then they fail and just don't notice except for maybe,</v>

229
00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

230
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:59.530
<v Speaker 1>two decades when it's too bloody late and then they're all catastrophic.</v>

231
00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 1>Lee hurt because they wasted their life.</v>

232
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>It's a very bad plan.</v>

233
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>It's better just to figure out what you want and to tell yourself and then to</v>

234
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:08.790
<v Speaker 1>tell your partner and to tell the people around you.</v>

235
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:12.840
<v Speaker 1>And maybe you can get it or maybe at least while you're struggling towards it,</v>

236
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>you'll come up with a better plan,</v>

237
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>which is more likely the case.</v>

238
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.570
<v Speaker 1>What do you want from your family?</v>

239
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 1>If you could have what you,</v>

240
00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.390
<v Speaker 1>what was good for you,</v>

241
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>what do you want from your intimate relationship?</v>

242
00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:27.150
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to educate yourself because you don't know enough?</v>

243
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.890
<v Speaker 1>What do you want for a career or job because not everyone has a career.</v>

244
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to spend your time outside of work in a productive and</v>

245
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:35.394
<v Speaker 1>meaningful manner?</v>

246
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:40.050
<v Speaker 1>How are you going to resist the temptations of drugs and alcohol and and and</v>

247
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:41.250
<v Speaker 1>sexual misconduct?</v>

248
00:09:41.251 --> 00:09:41.581
<v Speaker 1>Let's say,</v>

249
00:09:41.581 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 1>cause those are the big three.</v>

250
00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.253
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

251
00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:48.190
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to maintain yourself physically and mentally?</v>

252
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.040
<v Speaker 1>While those are seven good questions,</v>

253
00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.230
<v Speaker 1>you can have what you want.</v>

254
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.123
<v Speaker 1>What do you want?</v>

255
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 1>It's an operational realization of the new testament principle.</v>

256
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Ask and you will receive knock and the door will open and you think,</v>

257
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:06.481
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

258
00:10:06.481 --> 00:10:06.841
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

259
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>there's no possibility that that's the case.</v>

260
00:10:08.761 --> 00:10:10.590
<v Speaker 1>It's like actually it is the case.</v>

261
00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:12.390
<v Speaker 1>If you don't specify what you want,</v>

262
00:10:12.391 --> 00:10:13.224
<v Speaker 1>you won't get it,</v>

263
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>and if you specify what you want and you want it,</v>

264
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>which means you're willing to make the sacrifices necessary to get it,</v>

265
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:25.130
<v Speaker 1>then the probability that you'll get it expands immensely and miraculously in</v>

266
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:26.124
<v Speaker 1>some sense.</v>

267
00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:26.371
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

268
00:10:26.371 --> 00:10:26.791
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

269
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:31.740
<v Speaker 1>it assumes that what you want is within the bounds of appropriate reason,</v>

270
00:10:31.741 --> 00:10:32.580
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

271
00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:36.450
<v Speaker 1>but you could also dream big and there's always the possibility that'll work out</v>

272
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:37.284
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

273
00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:40.350
<v Speaker 1>So people as answer those questions,</v>

274
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.330
<v Speaker 1>then they write for 15 minutes,</v>

275
00:10:42.331 --> 00:10:42.691
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

276
00:10:42.691 --> 00:10:45.900
<v Speaker 1>your life is the way you want it to be in four years.</v>

277
00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.333
<v Speaker 1>What does it look like?</v>

278
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:48.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

279
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:48.901
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

280
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:49.950
<v Speaker 1>As much as you can,</v>

281
00:10:49.951 --> 00:10:51.540
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about being too accurate.</v>

282
00:10:51.541 --> 00:10:52.550
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about grammar,</v>

283
00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 1>spelling.</v>

284
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry about getting it right because you're not going to get it right</v>

285
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

286
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>just sketch the damn thing out.</v>

287
00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 1>If you could have what you wanted,</v>

288
00:10:59.281 --> 00:11:00.090
<v Speaker 1>what would it be?</v>

289
00:11:00.090 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 1>And then we have them do the opposite,</v>

290
00:11:01.621 --> 00:11:01.891
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

291
00:11:01.891 --> 00:11:02.610
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

292
00:11:02.610 --> 00:11:06.390
<v Speaker 1>take stock of yourself for a minute with all your weaknesses and inadequacies</v>

293
00:11:06.391 --> 00:11:09.960
<v Speaker 1>and bitterness and resentment and sinful tendencies.</v>

294
00:11:09.961 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's say.</v>

295
00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.770
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine that you let all of that goal and occupy you just wear which little</v>

296
00:11:17.851 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 1>corner of Hell would you occupy in three to five years.</v>

297
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you write about that?</v>

298
00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.680
<v Speaker 1>And everyone knows where they go if they let themselves.</v>

299
00:11:26.130 --> 00:11:31.130
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have something to avoid and you have something to strive for and</v>

300
00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:36.300
<v Speaker 1>that makes you optimally motivated because maybe you're afraid,</v>

301
00:11:36.301 --> 00:11:36.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

302
00:11:36.541 --> 00:11:40.010
<v Speaker 1>you find out you don't like your job and you're afraid to change your job and</v>

303
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.873
<v Speaker 1>then you think,</v>

304
00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:41.521
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

305
00:11:41.521 --> 00:11:42.900
<v Speaker 1>well if I don't change my job,</v>

306
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 1>then I'm heading for this little corner of Hell that I outlined.</v>

307
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.261
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

308
00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>well that's not a very good plan.</v>

309
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:48.900
<v Speaker 1>It's very strict,</v>

310
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:50.940
<v Speaker 1>threatening and stressful to change my job,</v>

311
00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:53.010
<v Speaker 1>but it beats the hell out of ending up there.</v>

312
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:56.740
<v Speaker 1>And so then you have your anxieties behind you pushing you forward instead of in</v>

313
00:11:56.741 --> 00:11:57.221
<v Speaker 1>front of you,</v>

314
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:58.420
<v Speaker 1>stopping you called.</v>

315
00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:03.840
<v Speaker 1>And then we asked people to write a plan to implement their positive vision,</v>

316
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 1>to justify it,</v>

317
00:12:05.321 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>to come up with this strategy for,</v>

318
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.360
<v Speaker 1>for making it into a real world realization.</v>

319
00:12:10.361 --> 00:12:13.870
<v Speaker 1>And we tested that on thousands of university students.</v>

320
00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:14.704
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

321
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:18.670
<v Speaker 1>and the upshot was that it decreased the probability that they would drop out of</v>

322
00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 1>university by 30% in fact,</v>

323
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:21.581
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>

324
00:12:21.581 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

325
00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:26.740
<v Speaker 1>we did it for 90 minutes before kids went to college in the fall.</v>

326
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:29.560
<v Speaker 1>They came to their summer orientation,</v>

327
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 1>neither wrote for 90 minutes about something that required writing,</v>

328
00:12:33.611 --> 00:12:38.110
<v Speaker 1>but there wasn't so relevant or they wrote out of plan and it dropped the</v>

329
00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:43.111
<v Speaker 1>dropout rate among young men 50% in the first semester and it had the biggest</v>

330
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:46.270
<v Speaker 1>effect on young men who didn't do that well in high school and who weren't</v>

331
00:12:46.271 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards a professional career.</v>

332
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:52.030
<v Speaker 1>The consequence of that was that the university used it for one year and then</v>

333
00:12:52.031 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 1>stop doing it.</v>

334
00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:53.831
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

335
00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:55.480
<v Speaker 1>which was not surprising in the least,</v>

336
00:12:55.930 --> 00:13:00.930
<v Speaker 1>but the reason that I'm laying out this long story for you is because that's</v>

337
00:13:01.301 --> 00:13:02.260
<v Speaker 1>what people need.</v>

338
00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:03.123
<v Speaker 1>They need,</v>

339
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:06.400
<v Speaker 1>they need a differentiated and delineated purpose.</v>

340
00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.730
<v Speaker 1>It's way more important than the money.</v>

341
00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.170
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

342
00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:11.520
<v Speaker 1>It isn't money that you need.</v>

343
00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.260
<v Speaker 1>I know you need money for God's sake.</v>

344
00:13:13.261 --> 00:13:14.041
<v Speaker 1>I'm not ignorant.</v>

345
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Everybody needs money.</v>

346
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.800
<v Speaker 1>That's not the point here.</v>

347
00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.160
<v Speaker 1>It's the provision of money without purpose is not helpful.</v>

348
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.540
<v Speaker 1>And what people need is a purpose and they need that to develop that for</v>

349
00:13:24.541 --> 00:13:25.141
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

350
00:13:25.141 --> 00:13:27.270
<v Speaker 1>obviously because it's something you have to participate in,</v>

351
00:13:27.271 --> 00:13:30.840
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that society has to foster and the reason they need that</v>

352
00:13:30.841 --> 00:13:33.870
<v Speaker 1>purpose is because that's what gives their life meaning.</v>

353
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:34.771
<v Speaker 1>Think,</v>

354
00:13:34.771 --> 00:13:34.921
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

355
00:13:34.921 --> 00:13:35.754
<v Speaker 1>think about this.</v>

356
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think that you would be satisfied if you had money without</v>

357
00:13:39.931 --> 00:13:40.830
<v Speaker 1>responsibility?</v>

358
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:42.631
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

359
00:13:42.631 --> 00:13:42.871
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

360
00:13:42.871 --> 00:13:45.900
<v Speaker 1>got no responsibility because that's what everyone wants.</v>

361
00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:47.400
<v Speaker 1>It's like I had a client,</v>

362
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.530
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to retire when he was kind of young,</v>

363
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.181
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

364
00:13:51.181 --> 00:13:51.271
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

365
00:13:51.271 --> 00:13:52.470
<v Speaker 1>what's your retirement dream?</v>

366
00:13:52.471 --> 00:13:52.711
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

367
00:13:52.711 --> 00:13:52.861
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

368
00:13:52.861 --> 00:13:57.210
<v Speaker 1>I envisioned myself on a beach in a tropical island with a Margarita in my hand.</v>

369
00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.553
<v Speaker 1>And I thought,</v>

370
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.910
<v Speaker 1>what the hell is that?</v>

371
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:03.601
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

372
00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:03.871
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

373
00:14:03.871 --> 00:14:04.860
<v Speaker 1>let's play that out.</v>

374
00:14:04.861 --> 00:14:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Let's be adult about this.</v>

375
00:14:06.001 --> 00:14:06.271
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

376
00:14:06.271 --> 00:14:07.130
<v Speaker 1>so you go down to the,</v>

377
00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.420
<v Speaker 1>you're this like red headed white guy.</v>

378
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.980
<v Speaker 1>You go down to the Caribbean and you sit on a beach and you're sitting in the</v>

379
00:14:13.981 --> 00:14:17.370
<v Speaker 1>beach and you have like six Margaritas and you're there for like three hours.</v>

380
00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.720
<v Speaker 1>What happens the next day?</v>

381
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

382
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.120
<v Speaker 1>your Sun burnt to a crisp,</v>

383
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:21.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

384
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.900
<v Speaker 1>So you can't even go out of your hotel room and you're hung over.</v>

385
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:25.831
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

386
00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:28.830
<v Speaker 1>And let's say now you hide in your hotel room for three or four days and you</v>

387
00:14:28.831 --> 00:14:31.830
<v Speaker 1>recover and then you repeat that every day for three months.</v>

388
00:14:32.190 --> 00:14:36.780
<v Speaker 1>It's like you go outside and all the locals get away from you because you're the</v>

389
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:41.790
<v Speaker 1>new drunk Letcher who's come down from the north and that's your vision for</v>

390
00:14:41.791 --> 00:14:42.624
<v Speaker 1>retirement.</v>

391
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:43.291
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

392
00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:43.920
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

393
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.000
<v Speaker 1>so you have all the money.</v>

394
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.320
<v Speaker 1>You want no responsibility.</v>

395
00:14:46.321 --> 00:14:47.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to take care of yourself.</v>

396
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.050
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a partner,</v>

397
00:14:49.051 --> 00:14:50.160
<v Speaker 1>so you don't have to take care of them.</v>

398
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.083
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any,</v>

399
00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.760
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to take care of them.</v>

400
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't have a job.</v>

401
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:54.561
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

402
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:55.394
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

403
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do exactly?</v>

404
00:14:57.650 --> 00:14:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Sit in the sun and Drink Margaritas.</v>

405
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.040
<v Speaker 1>It's like there's no,</v>

406
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.673
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

407
00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:05.300
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good vision.</v>

408
00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't want no responsibility.</v>

409
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:09.830
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong.</v>

410
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.100
<v Speaker 1>People find the meaning in their life by adopting responsibility.</v>

411
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.653
<v Speaker 1>And so</v>

412
00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:17.060
<v Speaker 1>provision of money,</v>

413
00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

414
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:18.651
<v Speaker 1>they say,</v>

415
00:15:18.651 --> 00:15:20.270
<v Speaker 1>man does not live by bread alone.</v>

416
00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:22.880
<v Speaker 1>And there's wisdom in that.</v>

417
00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like you don't want no responsibility.</v>

418
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:28.040
<v Speaker 1>You might dream about that if you're crushed by your job,</v>

419
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:29.690
<v Speaker 1>but then you have the wrong job.</v>

420
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Or do you have the wrong attitude or you have the wrong job and the wrong</v>

421
00:15:32.301 --> 00:15:32.751
<v Speaker 1>attitude.</v>

422
00:15:32.751 --> 00:15:33.770
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is.</v>

423
00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.350
<v Speaker 1>You want lots of responsibility and society needs to foster that and we need to</v>

424
00:15:39.351 --> 00:15:44.210
