<v Speaker 1>Hi Jp.</v>

2
00:00:09.301 --> 00:00:12.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering how the computer program that rates university courses as</v>

3
00:00:12.811 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>worthwhile or not.</v>

4
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.210
<v Speaker 1>It's coming along well.</v>

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.400
<v Speaker 1>It isn't rating them as worthwhile.</v>

6
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.240
<v Speaker 1>It's rating them as postmodern Neil Marxist or not and it's actually fully</v>

7
00:00:21.241 --> 00:00:22.074
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>

8
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.000
<v Speaker 1>I was going to launch it and I didn't,</v>

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.590
<v Speaker 1>I didn't design it.</v>

10
00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

11
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.850
<v Speaker 1>somebody volunteered to design it and presented it to me and it seems to work</v>

12
00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:30.684
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

13
00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

14
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>I was going to launch it at the end of August so that this year's university</v>

15
00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>students could benefit from it.</v>

16
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:41.220
<v Speaker 1>But there was the Charlottesville event and then I got busy and I also wasn't</v>

17
00:00:41.221 --> 00:00:45.510
<v Speaker 1>feeling great and so I just didn't hit the window of time properly.</v>

18
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.540
<v Speaker 1>But I hope to be able to launch it for the January incoming class to do a video</v>

19
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.400
<v Speaker 1>about what's wrong with the university system,</v>

20
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.520
<v Speaker 1>that many things that are wrong with the university system and to launch the</v>

21
00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>website at the same time.</v>

22
00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Also had people suggest to me that maybe it wasn't a good idea that it would</v>

23
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.540
<v Speaker 1>increase polarization,</v>

24
00:01:03.541 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>but I've thought about that for about a month and a half.</v>

25
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the benefit to the consumer,</v>

26
00:01:08.641 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>so that would be the informed student outweighs any danger of polarization.</v>

27
00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 1>And besides that,</v>

28
00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:17.070
<v Speaker 1>something has to be done because the situation in the universities is really</v>

29
00:01:17.071 --> 00:01:17.904
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

30
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.163
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

31
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:20.580
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

32
00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.021
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

33
00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 1>so let's see what else we've got here in the chat room.</v>

34
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.181
<v Speaker 1>D.</v>

35
00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:28.490
<v Speaker 1>E v.</v>

36
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.821
<v Speaker 1>S.</v>

37
00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:29.121
<v Speaker 1>S.</v>

38
00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:29.511
<v Speaker 1>K.</v>

39
00:01:29.511 --> 00:01:29.870
<v Speaker 1>H.</v>

40
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.081
<v Speaker 1>E.</v>

41
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:30.381
<v Speaker 1>R.</v>

42
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:31.214
<v Speaker 1>Three.</v>

43
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>That's quite a mouthful.</v>

44
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Says I'm studying to be a teacher,</v>

45
00:01:34.161 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also an introvert.</v>

46
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>Could this be a big problem?</v>

47
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>Can I still be a successful teacher?</v>

48
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:39.764
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

49
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.960
<v Speaker 1>what seems to predict success at teaching best is intelligence and</v>

50
00:01:44.961 --> 00:01:46.040
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness.</v>

51
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the data so far.</v>

52
00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:49.220
<v Speaker 1>So if you're conscientious,</v>

53
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.140
<v Speaker 1>then you'll probably be fine.</v>

54
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

55
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.580
<v Speaker 1>x extra introverts have a harder time speaking in front of groups,</v>

56
00:01:55.581 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 1>but you can learn to do that.</v>

57
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:57.111
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

58
00:01:57.111 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>an introvert can become a very successful public speaker.</v>

59
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>May Not enjoy it the same way that an extrovert might.</v>

60
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.600
<v Speaker 1>But that doesn't mean that you can't learn the skills.</v>

61
00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:09.710
<v Speaker 1>And what I would recommend for an introvert is the same thing that I do when I'm</v>

62
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>lecturing is I never talked to the whole group.</v>

63
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

64
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't matter how big the crowd is,</v>

65
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm always picking out individuals in the group and talking specifically to</v>

66
00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:18.440
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

67
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.040
<v Speaker 1>So I'll make a point to an individual and I watched their face and see if</v>

68
00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:23.840
<v Speaker 1>they're nodding and understanding right?</v>

69
00:02:23.841 --> 00:02:27.580
<v Speaker 1>Because that way you make contact with the entire audience and then you know,</v>

70
00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.200
<v Speaker 1>all talk to someone for about 15 seconds or so.</v>

71
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to put them on the spot too much.</v>

72
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.290
<v Speaker 1>And then I shift my attention to someone else and I sort of pinpoint around the</v>

73
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:40.040
<v Speaker 1>room and that keeps everybody in the room focused on what I'm saying because</v>

74
00:02:40.041 --> 00:02:43.430
<v Speaker 1>each person reflect the entire crowd back to you.</v>

75
00:02:43.431 --> 00:02:46.880
<v Speaker 1>And so I would say if you're an introvert or if you want to speak in public in</v>

76
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:47.480
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

77
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.980
<v Speaker 1>forget about the damn crowd.</v>

78
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>

79
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.460
<v Speaker 1>Speak to people one on one.</v>

80
00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:54.800
<v Speaker 1>At a time and an introvert can do that just fine.</v>

81
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.113
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

82
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

83
00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.710
<v Speaker 1>that's where your strength would be.</v>

84
00:02:58.711 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>And I would say you're,</v>

85
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to be unsuccessful as a teacher if you don't work hard</v>

86
00:03:04.871 --> 00:03:05.230
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

87
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>And if you're not interested in it.</v>

88
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 1>So if you're an introvert,</v>

89
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't worry about that.</v>

90
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

91
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that will be the biggest problem that you'll face.</v>

92
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
