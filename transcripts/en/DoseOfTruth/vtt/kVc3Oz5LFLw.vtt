00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Recently I took a job working at a camp with at risk boys were out.</v>

2
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Well there I will live and work as a counselor and a house with the kids.</v>

3
00:00:14.101 --> 00:00:17.160
<v Speaker 1>Any advice for working with young people with behavioral issues?</v>

4
00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.650
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

5
00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:19.483
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.433
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

7
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.030
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.890
<v Speaker 1>It depends on what the behavioral issues are.</v>

9
00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.860
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what our risk meets,</v>

10
00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

11
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.831
<v Speaker 1>so I,</v>

12
00:00:27.831 --> 00:00:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I can't be too specific.</v>

13
00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.060
<v Speaker 1>But what I can tell you is that almost nothing beats listening.</v>

14
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

15
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>like take a kid for a walk,</v>

16
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>let him talk.</v>

17
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:38.801
<v Speaker 1>Like listen to them,</v>

18
00:00:38.801 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>ask them questions.</v>

19
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:40.330
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

20
00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>because most disturbed people,</v>

21
00:00:43.121 --> 00:00:48.121
<v Speaker 1>and maybe even most people don't actually have anyone they can talk to and they</v>

22
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:50.230
<v Speaker 1>need to talk first of all,</v>

23
00:00:50.231 --> 00:00:53.350
<v Speaker 1>to find out that someone actually cares enough to listen.</v>

24
00:00:53.351 --> 00:00:57.580
<v Speaker 1>So it's sort of like a validation of the fact that they exist and second so that</v>

25
00:00:57.581 --> 00:00:59.260
<v Speaker 1>they can sort out their own thoughts.</v>

26
00:00:59.261 --> 00:01:01.510
<v Speaker 1>So as a beginning counselor,</v>

27
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>the best thing you can do is listen.</v>

28
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to give advice really.</v>

29
00:01:05.441 --> 00:01:05.681
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:06.730
<v Speaker 1>because what you want,</v>

31
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.600
<v Speaker 1>you can ask questions that might lead someone in an advisable direction.</v>

32
00:01:10.601 --> 00:01:14.920
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with giving advice is that people are much more likely to</v>

33
00:01:14.921 --> 00:01:18.640
<v Speaker 1>remember something and to implement it if they've thought it up in their own</v>

34
00:01:18.641 --> 00:01:19.270
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>

35
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>I think that actually produces a kind of neurological transformation.</v>

36
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.000
<v Speaker 1>The idea has to be in gendered from within.</v>

37
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:26.620
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the prime dicta of,</v>

38
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>of psychoanalytic theory for example.</v>

39
00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:30.160
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's a really good one.</v>

40
00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.293
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

41
00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.081
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

43
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:32.950
<v Speaker 1>when and with regards,</v>

44
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.470
<v Speaker 1>so Brendan Trista says trippy snakes and retinas.</v>

45
00:01:35.471 --> 00:01:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

46
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.180
<v Speaker 1>Like it's really specific.</v>

47
00:01:37.181 --> 00:01:38.710
<v Speaker 1>So this woman named,</v>

48
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:39.544
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

49
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

50
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.391
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

51
00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I probably can't remember her name.</v>

52
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Me and he either she,</v>

53
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.490
<v Speaker 1>she wrote a book about trees and serpents.</v>

54
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.941
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

55
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>she's a UCLA professor.</v>

56
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

57
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.481
<v Speaker 1>the fruit,</v>

58
00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the tree and the serpent,</v>

59
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:52.394
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called.</v>

60
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.810
<v Speaker 1>She showed quite clearly that not only do our retinas say directly detects</v>

61
00:01:56.811 --> 00:01:57.171
<v Speaker 1>snakes,</v>

62
00:01:57.171 --> 00:02:00.260
<v Speaker 1>but they do a better job in the bottom half of the retina.</v>

63
00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>And that we're really good at detecting the a camouflage patterns that are</v>

64
00:02:04.971 --> 00:02:08.090
<v Speaker 1>characteristic of snakes to snakes have these like diamond patterns,</v>

65
00:02:08.091 --> 00:02:08.631
<v Speaker 1>which are very,</v>

66
00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:09.464
<v Speaker 1>very rare.</v>

67
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.530
<v Speaker 1>And we have specialized circuitry for detecting those.</v>

68
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:17.531
<v Speaker 1>And there was recent research conducted that showed that children six months old</v>

69
00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>who had never been exposed to anything,</v>

70
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:20.390
<v Speaker 1>even resembling a snake,</v>

71
00:02:20.391 --> 00:02:22.730
<v Speaker 1>had an automatic response to snakes.</v>

72
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.470
<v Speaker 1>And so it actually seems to be innate,</v>

73
00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.333
<v Speaker 1>not just,</v>

74
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.773
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

75
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.310
<v Speaker 1>not just easily learned.</v>

76
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.110
<v Speaker 1>So that's really quite interesting.</v>
