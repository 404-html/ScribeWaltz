1
00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.983
<v Speaker 1>Mistake.</v>

2
00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.911
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3
00:00:25.911 --> 00:00:30.590
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the reasons that I did I take the biblical elections I did last</v>

4
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.610
<v Speaker 1>year were so helpful for me.</v>

5
00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:36.611
<v Speaker 1>And I think one of the things that's quite interesting about those stories,</v>

6
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.410
<v Speaker 1>even having stories in particular,</v>

7
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.550
<v Speaker 1>those bloody people,</v>

8
00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.560
<v Speaker 1>they just make mistakes all the time.</v>

9
00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.120
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

10
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:45.501
<v Speaker 1>So Abraham,</v>

11
00:00:45.501 --> 00:00:46.334
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

12
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

13
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>he was chosen by God.</v>

14
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 1>I politically like all the people there and I mean he just pick one absolutely</v>

15
00:00:55.161 --> 00:00:57.050
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic mistake after another.</v>

16
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 1>And so that's life man making in regretting huge mistakes.</v>

17
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't mean that you should just go on and drop again the mistakes.</v>

18
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 1>So you have to take responsibility for the people that I watched in my life</v>

19
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.290
<v Speaker 1>lived probably that say they learned from the mistakes,</v>

20
00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't beat themselves to death because of the,</v>

21
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.731
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:01:22.731 --> 00:01:23.181
<v Speaker 1>when you think,</v>

23
00:01:23.181 --> 00:01:24.014
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.021
<v Speaker 1>so this says,</v>

25
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>well this was a regretted it to validate.</v>

26
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.921
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

27
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:31.370
<v Speaker 1>well we don't take adult term is out in the public square and stone.</v>

28
00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 1>And so you probably shouldn't do that to yourself.</v>

29
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.000
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

30
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 1>if you regret it,</v>

31
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.420
<v Speaker 1>well then what you have to do is if you have to repent and you have to atone.</v>

32
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.470
<v Speaker 1>And so what's reprint unrepentant,</v>

34
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Nate?</v>

35
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.531
<v Speaker 1>It meets well,</v>

36
00:01:46.531 --> 00:01:51.531
<v Speaker 1>it means you have to go over what you did and you have to figure out now that</v>

37
00:01:51.721 --> 00:01:52.710
<v Speaker 1>you know it was a mistake,</v>

38
00:01:52.711 --> 00:01:54.990
<v Speaker 1>who after figuring out why you were Sadam clueless,</v>

39
00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:58.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a damn stupid and exactly what we did wrong.</v>

40
00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Like with each the decision point,</v>

41
00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 1>like you know when you first met the person that you have the affair with,</v>

42
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.390
<v Speaker 1>you probably flirted with him a little bit more than that.</v>

43
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Then you probably flirted with them to a degree that you regarded as risky and</v>

44
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.593
<v Speaker 1>access,</v>

45
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 1>but you did it anyways.</v>

46
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.231
<v Speaker 1>Snow.</v>

47
00:02:19.231 --> 00:02:19.951
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out,</v>

48
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:20.784
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.280
<v Speaker 1>why in the world did I think that was a good idea?</v>

50
00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Then you have to know exactly.</v>

51
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.210
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

52
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 1>if you're walking down a path and you'd get lost and you wander off the path and</v>

53
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:32.820
<v Speaker 1>you get lost,</v>

54
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>you have to figure out how it is that you wandered off the path.</v>

55
00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Because the purpose of of repaired take let's say is so good when you're back on</v>

56
00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>the path.</v>

57
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:43.441
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

58
00:02:43.441 --> 00:02:44.520
<v Speaker 1>you can find your way back.</v>

59
00:02:44.521 --> 00:02:48.330
<v Speaker 1>That would be the first purpose and the second is so you don't wonder off again.</v>

60
00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.920
<v Speaker 1>And if you wondered off once that your pro for wandering off in that matter and</v>

61
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:56.280
<v Speaker 1>so then you'd have to figure out why your program to wandering off for that</v>

62
00:02:56.281 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>matter right down into the most painful level of detail and then you have to</v>

63
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>figure out how not to do it again and then as soon as you figure out how not to</v>

64
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:06.010
<v Speaker 1>do it again,</v>

65
00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.490
<v Speaker 1>then you should start beating yourself up.</v>

66
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.511
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

67
00:03:10.511 --> 00:03:12.340
<v Speaker 1>because you've learned your lesson.</v>

68
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.070
<v Speaker 1>That's sort of the principle.</v>

69
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.860
<v Speaker 1>I tried out bloods in principles of discipline for children in chapter five what</v>

70
00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:20.890
<v Speaker 1>is the best principles?</v>

71
00:03:20.891 --> 00:03:25.891
<v Speaker 1>Is you still more forced than this necessarily minimal necessary for us,</v>

72
00:03:26.731 --> 00:03:27.564
<v Speaker 1>it's a great,</v>

73
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.470
<v Speaker 1>it's a great rule of thumb and you use that on yourself when you make mistakes,</v>

74
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.890
<v Speaker 1>you know and make you so you have to figure out thing when you get wrong by your</v>

75
00:03:38.651 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>own criteria.</v>

76
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.350
<v Speaker 1>When you said you did something wrong,</v>

77
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.550
<v Speaker 1>you said you regretted it.</v>

78
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.911
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

79
00:03:42.911 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>you did something wrong because otherwise you would regret it.</v>

80
00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.260
<v Speaker 1>Or Nesbitt,</v>

81
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>you're just regretting the fact that fucked up your life and you actually,</v>

82
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:50.680
<v Speaker 1>you know what that's,</v>

83
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>that's feeling sorry for yourself.</v>

84
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>That's not regretting.</v>

85
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:53.590
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

86
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.170
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to sort those things out because you don't get to feel</v>

87
00:03:56.171 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>sorry for yourself.</v>

88
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>You just get to regret it.</v>

89
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.290
<v Speaker 1>And if you've read regretted me to did something wrong,</v>

90
00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.570
<v Speaker 1>and then you have to out what you did wrong.</v>

91
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Exactly right down to the detailed levels and what was wrong with your</v>

92
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:11.080
<v Speaker 1>perception and your beliefs that led you in that direction.</v>

93
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Everyone would have to do to put that right and then you have to put it right</v>

94
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.330
<v Speaker 1>and then maybe you have to go around and make it manage to over people that you</v>

95
00:04:19.331 --> 00:04:20.164
<v Speaker 1>heard.</v>

96
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to be that.</v>

97
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And then perhaps you'll find yourself back on the path.</v>

98
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>And then you have to stay on the path as best you can.</v>

99
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.260
<v Speaker 1>And if that's the case in some sense,</v>

100
00:04:33.261 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 1>because if we all had to pay the ultimate price for our sins,</v>

101
00:04:37.331 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>every single one of us would be [inaudible].</v>

102
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.920
<v Speaker 1>So we are just as part of why the concept of original sin and so useful and</v>

103
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:49.630
<v Speaker 1>everyone feels it because everyone's guilty.</v>

104
00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 1>Never one's ashamed of themselves.</v>

105
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.420
<v Speaker 1>So we have this inbuilt sense of something going wrong and if we can name it</v>

106
00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.590
<v Speaker 1>haunts us.</v>

107
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's why the idea of original sin is so useful,</v>

108
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:05.490
<v Speaker 1>even though it has perhaps some conceptual problems associated with it.</v>

109
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps it's not all good.</v>

110
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.190
<v Speaker 1>But in this particular situation,</v>

111
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you know you're a bad person but soon as everyone else.</v>

112
00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.230
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't mark you out as a particularly horrible.</v>

113
00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't mean the horribleness isn't real,</v>

114
00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just you.</v>

115
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 1>And then what you do about it is you're trying to be better.</v>

116
00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you do about what's wrong with you to begin with.</v>

117
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.400
<v Speaker 1>Every,</v>

118
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.390
<v Speaker 1>every one of us,</v>

119
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>we've all got things to learn,</v>

120
00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:40.181
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

121
00:05:40.181 --> 00:05:41.050
<v Speaker 1>And plenty of them.</v>

122
00:05:41.051 --> 00:05:42.410
<v Speaker 1>The world is what it could be in.</v>

123
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>That's our fault.</v>

124
00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:46.030
<v Speaker 1>And so we've got lots to learn and so to you,</v>

125
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:50.800
<v Speaker 1>and you try and learn and you treat yourself with affirm enough,</v>

126
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:55.510
<v Speaker 1>had something you learn and not a harsh enough handsome that you've died while</v>

127
00:05:55.511 --> 00:05:56.344
<v Speaker 1>you're learning.</v>

128
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.423
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

129
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.180
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] zero.</v>

130
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 2>That's the end of the night.</v>

131
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.490
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>
