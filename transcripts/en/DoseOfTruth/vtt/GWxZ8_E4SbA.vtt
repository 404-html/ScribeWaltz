1
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:08.580
<v Speaker 1>In Dante's inferno.</v>

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.230
<v Speaker 1>I think I mentioned this at one point.</v>

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>So Dante's inferno,</v>

4
00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a very interesting story.</v>

5
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a descent into hell a,</v>

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>and it's actually one of the places that we sort of derive the popular</v>

7
00:00:19.081 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 1>conception of hell was partly based on Dante's,</v>

8
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>on Dante's imagination,</v>

9
00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:24.234
<v Speaker 1>on his work.</v>

10
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>And what Dante was trying to do was to discover the hierarchical structure of</v>

11
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:29.154
<v Speaker 1>evil.</v>

12
00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.641
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

13
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 1>you might think there is a hierarchical structure of good,</v>

14
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>some things are better than other things,</v>

15
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a hierarchical structure of evil.</v>

16
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Some evils are greater than other evils and he put betrayal in the,</v>

17
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>in the,</v>

18
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>in the lowest part of Hail,</v>

19
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.151
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

20
00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:43.560
<v Speaker 1>So if you were betraying people,</v>

21
00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>you were right beside Satan himself.</v>

22
00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.530
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

23
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's good.</v>

24
00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>That's very smart.</v>

25
00:00:48.751 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>While Dante was a genius after all,</v>

26
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 1>and I think the reason for that is that you see,</v>

28
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>if someone trusts you,</v>

29
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.950
<v Speaker 1>they're laying their vulnerability open to you.</v>

30
00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.390
<v Speaker 1>Now they might just be naive,</v>

31
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:00.841
<v Speaker 1>let's say.</v>

32
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:01.680
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

33
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.560
<v Speaker 1>we won't think about that because you're just a child.</v>

34
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:05.394
<v Speaker 1>If you're naive,</v>

35
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>you can still be betrayed.</v>

36
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>But if you're an adult and you trust,</v>

37
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.600
<v Speaker 1>it's often because you,</v>

38
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.010
<v Speaker 1>if you're an actual adult,</v>

39
00:01:11.011 --> 00:01:15.150
<v Speaker 1>it's you willingly open yourself up knowing that you could be hurt.</v>

40
00:01:15.151 --> 00:01:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

41
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.710
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're not naive anymore.</v>

42
00:01:16.711 --> 00:01:21.711
<v Speaker 1>So you decide to trust and you see y'all opened myself up and I know that I'm</v>

43
00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.970
<v Speaker 1>laying myself open to you.</v>

44
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.390
<v Speaker 1>If you choose to use that power and then that's a good thing to know.</v>

45
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:27.601
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:01:27.601 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 1>if you've been hurt as a child,</v>

47
00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>it hurt as a naive person.</v>

48
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:31.051
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

49
00:01:31.051 --> 00:01:32.550
<v Speaker 1>well why should I ever trust again?</v>

50
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 1>Which is a really good question.</v>

51
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is the reason you trust,</v>

52
00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:36.361
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

53
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>once you're an adult is because you're courageous.</v>

54
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.711
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

55
00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:40.470
<v Speaker 1>you're courageous.</v>

56
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.480
<v Speaker 1>It's an act of courage to trust.</v>

57
00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 1>And the reason it's useful is because if you trust someone,</v>

58
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:51.441
<v Speaker 1>you opened the door to reciprocity and negotiation and cooperation and you</v>

59
00:01:52.171 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>entice the best part of the person forward.</v>

60
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.160
<v Speaker 1>And so it's a,</v>

61
00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.480
<v Speaker 1>it's a courageous act.</v>

62
00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>But then if you be traced someone,</v>

63
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>then what you've done is you've taken the best part of them,</v>

64
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 1>which is the part that will courageously trust,</v>

65
00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>with open eyes.</v>

67
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:07.560
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

68
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>And you've stuck a dagger in that.</v>

69
00:02:09.541 --> 00:02:13.050
<v Speaker 1>And so you've purposefully damaged the best part of the,</v>

70
00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>and so that's why it's such a egregious fault.</v>

71
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

72
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.700
<v Speaker 1>and it's often people don't recover from that sort of playing it.</v>

73
00:02:20.701 --> 00:02:21.180
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

74
00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 1>if you'd be traced someone badly enough,</v>

75
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

76
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.360
<v Speaker 1>you can damage them.</v>

77
00:02:24.361 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Like you can give them post traumatic stress disorder if you really,</v>

78
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>if you really put your mind to it,</v>

79
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:29.641
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

80
00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>that's not just a psychological disorder.</v>

81
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 1>If you have posttraumatic stress disorder,</v>

82
00:02:33.911 --> 00:02:38.520
<v Speaker 1>it produces permanent neurological alterations that make you more neurotic,</v>

83
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.290
<v Speaker 1>more sensitive to negative emotion,</v>

84
00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:41.760
<v Speaker 1>really for the rest of your life.</v>

85
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.421
<v Speaker 1>Like you can,</v>

86
00:02:42.421 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you can recover from it to some degree,</v>

87
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>but stress will tend to re instantiate that PTSD.</v>

88
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.220
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

89
00:02:51.221 --> 00:02:54.060
<v Speaker 1>you hurt someone and it's not merely cycle.</v>

90
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Not that psychological is merely,</v>

91
00:02:55.921 --> 00:02:57.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's not merely psychological,</v>

92
00:02:57.601 --> 00:02:57.811
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

93
00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

94
00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.600
<v Speaker 1>it's fundamental physiological damage.</v>
