00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Dr. I am a 23 year old male with</v>

2
00:00:09.111 --> 00:00:11.090
<v Speaker 1>paranoid schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.760
<v Speaker 1>I feel like controlling 95 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

4
00:00:13.761 --> 00:00:15.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's say I think you mean that</v>

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.280
<v Speaker 1>you're controlling 95 percent of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I desire to seek a partner,</v>

6
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:23.540
<v Speaker 1>but I am afraid how to reveal it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any advice on how to approach it?</v>

7
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven,</v>

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>that's a really hard question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:32.640
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not under any obligation when you</v>

10
00:00:32.641 --> 00:00:37.641
<v Speaker 1>first meet someone to drown them in</v>
<v Speaker 1>information about your identity.</v>

11
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>So I would say</v>
<v Speaker 1>the devil's in the details.</v>

12
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>Fundamentally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have a relationship with someone</v>

13
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.650
<v Speaker 1>and it's progressing and you're being</v>
<v Speaker 1>honest,</v>

14
00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:54.040
<v Speaker 1>my suspicions are that it will come up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with its own accord.</v>

15
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you'll be able to tell in the</v>

16
00:00:55.941 --> 00:00:59.950
<v Speaker 1>situation when the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>introduce it is,</v>

17
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.111
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

18
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.040
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're asking me this because you've</v>

19
00:01:03.041 --> 00:01:05.800
<v Speaker 1>been in a relationship for a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you haven't revealed it,</v>

20
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>then I don't know what to tell you about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that because an [inaudible] I wouldn't</v>

21
00:01:11.651 --> 00:01:14.020
<v Speaker 1>give someone general advice about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.913
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

23
00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.020
<v Speaker 1>sorry</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I,</v>

24
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>if are we speaking to a client and I had</v>
<v Speaker 1>some real</v>

25
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.250
<v Speaker 1>detailed information about their current</v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

26
00:01:28.251 --> 00:01:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I would sit down and help them</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategize about that.</v>

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Ask about the person you're telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Figure out how long you've gone out with</v>

28
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:36.530
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way that it might be</v>

29
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>revealed that you would be comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

30
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:43.451
<v Speaker 1>I suspect probably what you should do is</v>
<v Speaker 1>find someone you trust to talk about it.</v>

31
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>If you're already in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you're not,</v>

32
00:01:46.611 --> 00:01:50.600
<v Speaker 1>then assume that if going into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship,</v>

33
00:01:50.601 --> 00:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>your basic goal is honesty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you'll handle it appropriately.</v>

34
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>When the situation comes up.</v>
