00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we know for our kick and traditional</v>

2
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.010
<v Speaker 1>culture is the symbolic return to chaos</v>
<v Speaker 1>is equivalent to preparing a new</v>

3
00:00:15.011 --> 00:00:18.040
<v Speaker 1>creation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the death of your current state of</v>

4
00:00:18.041 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>being can be the preparation for a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ba.</v>

5
00:00:20.321 --> 00:00:22.420
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things the cycle analysts</v>

6
00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is implicit in he adds</v>

7
00:00:24.521 --> 00:00:26.380
<v Speaker 1>discussion of the somatic</v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation,</v>

8
00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:31.381
<v Speaker 1>is if you do this voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a much better chance of doing</v>

9
00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:35.320
<v Speaker 1>it successfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the rule is while if you go out to</v>

10
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.890
<v Speaker 1>hunt for a dragon and you're in pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>good shape while you're doing it and</v>

11
00:00:38.891 --> 00:00:41.260
<v Speaker 1>you're all prepared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the damn thing might not eat you.</v>

12
00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.550
<v Speaker 1>But if you're lying in bed and you know</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're covered with cheesy dust and new,</v>

13
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you're hung over from three days worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of drinking,</v>

14
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 1>then the dragon will just eat you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's probably a good thing for</v>

15
00:00:49.901 --> 00:00:51.760
<v Speaker 1>everyone that it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

16
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.210
<v Speaker 1>So the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be prepared and part of the way that</v>

17
00:00:55.211 --> 00:00:58.690
<v Speaker 1>you're prepared is by being awake and</v>
<v Speaker 1>having the,</v>

18
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the many sources of power that are at</v>

19
00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>your fingertips that are part of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>biological and cultural inheritance at,</v>

20
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.640
<v Speaker 1>at the ready so that you can respond.</v>

21
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>It follows that we may interpret the</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychic chaos of the future showman as a</v>

22
00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>sign that the profane man is being</v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolved and a new personality being</v>

23
00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:23.161
<v Speaker 1>prepared for birth transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>constant theme,</v>

24
00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paradise Lost and redemption.</v>

25
00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the story of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're in a fallen state.</v>

26
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.730
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:33.810
<v Speaker 1>because things aren't perfect and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could be better and everyone's</v>

28
00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so things have fallen apart.</v>

29
00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.250
<v Speaker 1>They're always in the state of being</v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen apart.</v>

30
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.250
<v Speaker 1>And what are we trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're trying to put them back</v>

31
00:01:42.251 --> 00:01:45.190
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the eternal story of mankind</v>

32
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
