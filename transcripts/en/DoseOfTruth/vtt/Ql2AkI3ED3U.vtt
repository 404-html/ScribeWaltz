1
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Individuals was I describe us Mecca who are saying when they say he wants to say</v>

2
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.081
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

3
00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:20.320
<v Speaker 1>if you sweet individual and I have no problems with other religions and I did</v>

4
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.110
<v Speaker 1>not want to be engaged with any politics or any show or to link politics with</v>

5
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:25.830
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>

6
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>please leave me alone.</v>

7
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.451
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

8
00:00:27.451 --> 00:00:27.750
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

9
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.991
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

10
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:30.690
<v Speaker 2>And now I wouldn't say it would be the majority of Muslims worldwide.</v>

11
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.370
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure you agree with that,</v>

12
00:00:32.371 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that it isn't self evidently the case that the majority of</v>

13
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:41.481
<v Speaker 2>human beings are violent and warlike and so my sense is is that given the</v>

14
00:00:42.421 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 2>essential peace peacefulness of most people,</v>

15
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 2>they're going to take a look at the Islamic doctrine and extract from it those</v>

16
00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 2>elements that are supportive of that more individual piece,</v>

17
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.220
<v Speaker 2>but that still leaves open the question of exactly what the doctrine means as a</v>

18
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 2>set of motivational principles and that seems to be a big part of the current</v>

19
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 2>problem and also the need for current discourse.</v>

20
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.080
<v Speaker 2>What I would hope is that it would be possible to undertake a dialogue with</v>

21
00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

22
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.130
<v Speaker 2>let's say between Islam and the West are between Islam and Judeo Christianity</v>

23
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 2>and defined within Islam itself the seeds that would enable that dialogue to</v>

24
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 2>occur so that some sort of long term negotiated conceptual and practical piece</v>

25
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:21.774
<v Speaker 2>could be attained.</v>

26
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.880
<v Speaker 2>But the more I've read about Islam,</v>

27
00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.120
<v Speaker 2>the more difficult it is for me to understand how that might be managed,</v>

28
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:28.320
<v Speaker 2>especially because of its,</v>

29
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.450
<v Speaker 2>well because of the war like tradition that emerged from from Medina and then</v>

30
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.340
<v Speaker 2>moved outward ins at a staggering rate from that.</v>

31
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.210
<v Speaker 2>And also the thing that's quite quite disconcerting to me,</v>

32
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.081
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not,</v>

33
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 2>my Christianity hasn't been rife with internal divisions like that between the</v>

34
00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Speaker 2>counselors and the Catholics,</v>

35
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.930
<v Speaker 2>but it also was the case that what you might describe as the civil war that's</v>

36
00:01:51.091 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 2>been occurring within Islam,</v>

37
00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 2>more or less started as far as I can tell,</v>

38
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:58.530
<v Speaker 2>more or less started that day that Muhammad died and has never stopped since</v>

39
00:01:58.531 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 2>then.</v>

40
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 2>And that also seems to be,</v>

41
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.930
<v Speaker 2>well obviously it's a problem for the Islamic community itself,</v>

42
00:02:03.931 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 2>but it also seems to be a problem,</v>

43
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 2>an increasing problem for the west because we can't not be tangled up in that.</v>

44
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.681
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:10.681 --> 00:02:10.850
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

46
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.850
<v Speaker 1>we have to share the planet with one fifth of humanity and it's very clear that</v>

47
00:02:16.321 --> 00:02:21.321
<v Speaker 1>things have to change and it is the duty of Muslims to change the theological</v>

48
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.880
<v Speaker 1>underpinnings of their religion.</v>

49
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.490
<v Speaker 1>And as far as I'm concerned,</v>

50
00:02:26.491 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>this is being pushed by those that I call them the farmers or modifiers.</v>

51
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 1>And these are individuals who maybe know a little bigger groups.</v>

53
00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>They are forming views and maybe even being led by some nation states,</v>

54
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.710
<v Speaker 1>the leaders of countries who are low,</v>

55
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.470
<v Speaker 1>she'll before that change,</v>

56
00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>the big question is either going to agree on what to change.</v>

57
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.920
<v Speaker 1>So what is this inbuilt into Islam is this idea that does contract with God.</v>

58
00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.593
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

59
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm submit edits to the Corolla and it's the same thing.</v>

60
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:03.731
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:08.731
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed boys is seen by Muslims as infallible as somebody who never made a</v>

62
00:03:09.881 --> 00:03:10.714
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

63
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It's an uphill battle for those Muslims inside this lamb who was seeking</v>

64
00:03:15.911 --> 00:03:16.870
<v Speaker 1>modernization,</v>

65
00:03:16.871 --> 00:03:21.871
<v Speaker 1>who was seeking the forearm to agree on how to Eddie score.</v>

66
00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:27.641
<v Speaker 1>How tough is to wait Muslims to accept a truly peaceful right and a truly</v>

67
00:03:29.741 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 1>tolerant idea of religion that separates religion from politics,</v>

68
00:03:33.821 --> 00:03:35.180
<v Speaker 1>respects women,</v>

69
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.270
<v Speaker 1>supposed to lie to people of other faiths and people within Islam who wants to</v>

70
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.520
<v Speaker 1>leave their face.</v>

71
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So how do you get the theological underpinnings for that?</v>

72
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

73
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.180
<v Speaker 1>that's the big button with him within his,</v>

74
00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

75
00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.101
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

76
00:03:49.101 --> 00:03:49.381
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

77
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 2>and the danger there too is that,</v>

78
00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're not sort of thing is it tempted often reform from within a</v>

79
00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:55.820
<v Speaker 2>religious community.</v>

80
00:03:55.821 --> 00:04:00.290
<v Speaker 2>One of the dangers there is that instead of reforming it peacefully,</v>

81
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:02.120
<v Speaker 2>all you do is add another sect</v>

82
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.283
<v Speaker 1>to the,</v>

83
00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:04.930
<v Speaker 1>for us secular people,</v>

84
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.310
<v Speaker 1>it seems from,</v>

85
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>from a distance it seems kind of easy to say,</v>

86
00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.800
<v Speaker 1>well why don't they just separate religion from politics and yeah,</v>

87
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>we want to be here.</v>

88
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

89
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.500
<v Speaker 1>they can be the legislators to look at it that way.</v>

90
00:04:18.501 --> 00:04:21.790
<v Speaker 1>Too simplistic because then you get the people who want to be religious.</v>

91
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>These Medina subset,</v>

92
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.513
<v Speaker 1>what do you say?</v>

93
00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>The Medina Muslims,</v>

94
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.240
<v Speaker 1>an expression of his Muslim less is to combat you to Islam.</v>

95
00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.811
<v Speaker 1>To kill me as,</v>

97
00:04:32.811 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to if it's to get women to cover up.</v>

98
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.460
<v Speaker 1>It's to keep the warning us about live life to their,</v>

99
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.303
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

100
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.930
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

101
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.950
<v Speaker 2>it's the thing that's made me,</v>

102
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say nervous to some degree from the perspective of someone who</v>

103
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.710
<v Speaker 2>analyzes totalitarian ideology because the thing about totalitarian ideology is</v>

104
00:04:51.711 --> 00:04:53.210
<v Speaker 2>it tends to be totalitarian,</v>

105
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.811
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

106
00:04:53.811 --> 00:04:55.820
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely all consuming.</v>

107
00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>

108
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.620
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

109
00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.660
<v Speaker 2>that's why also when I've been assessing,</v>

110
00:04:59.661 --> 00:05:02.850
<v Speaker 2>cause I've done a fair bit of research into comparative religion and,</v>

111
00:05:02.851 --> 00:05:06.080
<v Speaker 2>and done my best to expand my knowledge base.</v>

112
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 2>And I've always had a hard time with Islam in that regard because it's difficult</v>

113
00:05:11.421 --> 00:05:15.920
<v Speaker 2>for me to extract out the purely religious elements and to compare them to let's</v>

114
00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:20.240
<v Speaker 2>say religious sentiments that have emerged across across humankind and all sorts</v>

115
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:21.320
<v Speaker 2>of different times and eras.</v>

116
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.750
<v Speaker 2>And to separate that from the political doctrine.</v>

117
00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.440
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I'm tempted to think more that Islam,</v>

118
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 2>broadly and vaguely speaking,</v>

120
00:05:30.021 --> 00:05:33.020
<v Speaker 2>is something much more like a political movement than it is in fact like a</v>

121
00:05:33.021 --> 00:05:33.854
<v Speaker 2>religious movement.</v>

122
00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.600
<v Speaker 1>It is a political theory and it's a political movement.</v>

123
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.860
<v Speaker 1>It started out even in Mecca in the early days,</v>

124
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:41.970
<v Speaker 1>come to my daughter.</v>

125
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.580
<v Speaker 1>It was a political message.</v>

126
00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.021
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't,</v>

127
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:45.340
<v Speaker 1>it just has religious message,</v>

128
00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

129
00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Even in the early days in McAfee was absolute is Islam by its nature is absolute</v>

130
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.300
<v Speaker 1>complete and total submission of the individual to God.</v>

131
00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>And then Medina Mohammed then came around with a political,</v>

132
00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 1>a blueprint for how society ought to live.</v>

133
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.850
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between the individual and God.</v>

134
00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>There's relationship between men and women.</v>

135
00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 1>It has been this relationship between parent and child,</v>

136
00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.790
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the government</v>

137
00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.070
<v Speaker 1>and the subjects and their duties.</v>

138
00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>It has a court system.</v>

139
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 1>It has a military sisters.</v>

140
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.360
<v Speaker 1>So from its very beginnings is like,</v>

141
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 1>it was more of a political theory.</v>

142
00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.510
