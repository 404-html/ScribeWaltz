1
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.140
<v Speaker 1>There are a variety of very complex</v>
<v Speaker 1>things facing us and one of them is</v>

2
00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.630
<v Speaker 1>called the Iq issue that we talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

3
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Another is this polarization between</v>
<v Speaker 1>left and right.</v>

4
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be characterizing</v>
<v Speaker 1>everywhere in the West,</v>

5
00:00:19.811 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the same in Australia,</v>

6
00:00:21.251 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all through Europe,</v>

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.670
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the US.</v>

8
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.420
<v Speaker 1>I think you guys are actually a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>more protected against the most places.</v>

9
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.720
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the other one is,</v>

10
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.460
<v Speaker 1>well we need a dialogue between Islam</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Christianity and Judaism for that</v>

11
00:00:36.461 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I mean the big,</v>

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.500
<v Speaker 1>the big clash for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Western world is,</v>

13
00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.160
<v Speaker 1>is Islam versus Christianity and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

14
00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.450
<v Speaker 1>people don't think about it in those</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms because many intellectuals in the</v>

15
00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>west think of themselves as secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a massive,</v>

16
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.700
<v Speaker 1>it's a massive problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm hoping to conduct a whole series</v>

17
00:00:57.701 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 1>of conversations with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with Muslims,</v>

18
00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.730
<v Speaker 1>a former and present pro and anti to try</v>
<v Speaker 1>to facilitate a dialogue because there's</v>

19
00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:08.440
<v Speaker 1>lots to talk about.</v>

20
00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied religious thinking a lot</v>

21
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.420
<v Speaker 1>and I'm pretty ignorant about Islam</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's complicated system and it's</v>

22
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I can tell you that what I've read</v>

23
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:25.681
<v Speaker 1>about Islam has not made me feel better</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the chances of reconciliation</v>

24
00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.710
<v Speaker 1>between the Christian and the Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

25
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>So like I don't know what to make of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact,</v>

26
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:35.410
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you look at the figure of</v>

27
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>Christ and I don't care if you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious or not,</v>

28
00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>and I don't even care a Christ existed</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not,</v>

29
00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.420
<v Speaker 1>and I certainly don't care at the moment</v>
<v Speaker 1>about claims to divinity or the lock</v>

30
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>there up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just speaking as let's say I'm</v>

31
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>speaking as a secondary intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean as a figure.</v>

32
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.800
<v Speaker 1>He's a figure of peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that that's disputable.</v>

33
00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:58.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he certainly,</v>

34
00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.390
<v Speaker 1>he wasn't a war Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one thing.</v>

35
00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.720
<v Speaker 1>That's for certain he never led armies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

36
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 1>whereas that's not the case with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed at all.</v>

37
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad was clearly and indisputably a</v>
<v Speaker 1>war Lord.</v>

38
00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.710
<v Speaker 1>And so it isn't the obvious to me what</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make of that except that it's bloody</v>

39
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:19.390
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had a child bride as well,</v>

40
00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:24.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one is somewhat less problematic to</v>

42
00:02:24.641 --> 00:02:29.641
<v Speaker 1>me because I think that you can write</v>
<v Speaker 1>that off to the cultural mores of the</v>

43
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:32.210
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm.</v>

44
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.850
<v Speaker 1>I know that there's a weakness in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we have to address</v>

45
00:02:36.851 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the wind,</v>

46
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 1>the founder of your religion spread that</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion by the sword.</v>

47
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 1>It makes it rather difficult and when</v>
<v Speaker 1>your religion has been embroiled in a</v>

48
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.700
<v Speaker 1>vicious civil war from the day of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed's death,</v>

49
00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly the case in Islam</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the Sudanese and the and the</v>

50
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 1>Shiites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that war started literally the day that</v>

51
00:02:57.761 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult for me to see how</v>

52
00:03:00.881 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>that could be reconciled with the claims</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Islam is a religion of peace.</v>

53
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We solved that one when Martin Luther</v>

54
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:10.600
<v Speaker 2>hammered some stuff on a door a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time ago and the Protestants and the</v>

55
00:03:10.601 --> 00:03:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Catholics just went their separate ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean there's been some rough</v>

56
00:03:14.141 --> 00:03:19.120
<v Speaker 2>feelings over the years I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no generational wars that I can</v>

57
00:03:19.121 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>think of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

58
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.663
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

59
00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean there was plenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.733
<v Speaker 1>as you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were.</v>

62
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.950
<v Speaker 1>There's been plenty of Christian schism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other thing too is that it's not</v>

63
00:03:28.951 --> 00:03:31.770
<v Speaker 1>that easy to lay those at the feet of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ.</v>

64
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because because just even merely as an</v>

65
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:36.840
<v Speaker 1>archetypal figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

66
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:37.231
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>

67
00:03:37.231 --> 00:03:40.890
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the western world's hypothesis of the</v>

68
00:03:40.891 --> 00:03:42.420
<v Speaker 1>ideal man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

69
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.630
<v Speaker 1>as a moral character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty much above reproach and I</v>

70
00:03:47.881 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.570
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult for me to say the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about Muhammad now.</v>

72
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.190
<v Speaker 1>That might be because I'm an ignorant</v>
<v Speaker 1>all western white guy,</v>

73
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 1>but like I'm doing my best man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big buyer of Taoism for example,</v>

74
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:08.870
<v Speaker 1>and there's great wisdom in Taoism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found value real value in,</v>

75
00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>in so much of the religious reading that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

76
00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.520
<v Speaker 1>that I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm really stumbling with Islam.</v>

77
00:04:14.521 --> 00:04:19.521
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard for me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to see it as other than a primarily</v>

78
00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>political system</v>

79
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 2>and did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it's being imply enforced</v>

80
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:30.150
<v Speaker 2>right now with wwe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what Isis is all about.</v>

81
00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.640
<v Speaker 2>Their estate establish a religious</v>
<v Speaker 2>caliphate,</v>

82
00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:34.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the borders of two,</v>

83
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 2>two countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

84
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.820
<v Speaker 2>it's less about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I think of religion,</v>

85
00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.480
<v Speaker 2>when I think of the Christian religion</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how it's applied here in my home</v>

86
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:43.560
<v Speaker 2>state of Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.380
<v Speaker 2>it's when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

88
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.470
<v Speaker 2>when we go to church and we tie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has very little to do with politics</v>

89
00:04:49.471 --> 00:04:50.420
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

90
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's this huge,</v>

91
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 2>massive separation between religion and</v>
<v Speaker 2>politics for the most part in the US and</v>

92
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.700
<v Speaker 2>to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are moments of ambiguity and,</v>

93
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.180
<v Speaker 2>and tempers flare over and I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 2>monument on this piece of property or</v>

94
00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:02.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's as stiff as it gets.</v>

95
00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the scariest bit of that that I can</v>

96
00:05:04.621 --> 00:05:07.470
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some drunk fellow ran over a monument or</v>

97
00:05:07.471 --> 00:05:09.780
<v Speaker 2>the 10 commandments a few months ago and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tipped it over.</v>

98
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.470
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

99
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 2>like that's what happens when</v>

100
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.020
<v Speaker 3>I agree to your point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you're not a Christian Kyle and</v>

101
00:05:16.021 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

102
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 3>Christian kind of alcove there in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Georgia,</v>

103
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 3>no one ever is going to come to you and</v>
<v Speaker 3>say you have to pay a different rate of</v>

104
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:25.260
<v Speaker 3>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to go to different stores.</v>

105
00:05:25.261 --> 00:05:27.780
<v Speaker 3>You have the religious law will not be</v>
<v Speaker 3>enforced</v>

106
00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 2>as a law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

107
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:30.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not gonna lose any hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

108
00:05:30.661 --> 00:05:31.494
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I,</v>

109
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 2>I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

110
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 2>the Bible has many restrictions that it</v>
<v Speaker 2>places on Christians and I ignore all of</v>

111
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:38.770
<v Speaker 2>them virtually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

112
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:40.320
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't,</v>

113
00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 2>I know there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's no</v>

114
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.690
<v Speaker 2>religious police to come and kick my</v>
<v Speaker 2>door in and drag me away and torture me</v>

115
00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:50.490
<v Speaker 2>and threatened my family and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and.</v>

116
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

117
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.140
<v Speaker 1>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other,</v>

118
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.200
<v Speaker 1>there's other cataclysms that are on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>that exist on the conceptual,</v>

119
00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:01.820
<v Speaker 1>the conceptual realm as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

120
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:03.140
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

121
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.470
<v Speaker 1>the state's dominated by Islam are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically productive and that's quite</v>

122
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:14.891
<v Speaker 1>an interesting mystery and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>

123
00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:20.100
<v Speaker 1>And many of the many of the Islamic</v>
<v Speaker 1>states that we purport to regard as</v>

124
00:06:20.101 --> 00:06:25.101
<v Speaker 1>allies hold values that are antithetical</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our system and a,</v>

125
00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.900
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia is a classic example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

126
00:06:27.901 --> 00:06:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And I cannot for the life of me</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>

127
00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 1>except in a psychoanalytic matter why</v>
<v Speaker 1>the radical feminists tolerate America's</v>

128
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.770
<v Speaker 1>ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America's lie.</v>

129
00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 1>The fact that America is allied with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudis,</v>

130
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:45.570
<v Speaker 1>it's just absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

131
00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.720
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's not much different as far</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm concerned that it would be if</v>

132
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.830
<v Speaker 1>black people didn't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If America was allied with a slave</v>

133
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:59.420
<v Speaker 1>owning a black slave owning state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course also happens in Saudi</v>

134
00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Arabia by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not</v>

135
00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.330
<v Speaker 3>so when did the feminist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's gotta be because Muslims right now</v>

136
00:07:04.331 --> 00:07:06.730
<v Speaker 3>are higher up on the victim hierarchy</v>
<v Speaker 3>than then,</v>

137
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:10.350
<v Speaker 3>so even if it's way over there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not allowed to speak out against</v>

138
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:10.680
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

139
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.820
<v Speaker 1>I think it's their unconscious wish for</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal male domination.</v>

140
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like that.</v>

141
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 2>That's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's the left's ability to</v>

142
00:07:21.801 --> 00:07:26.270
<v Speaker 2>apologize for anything that's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the people on the left,</v>

143
00:07:26.271 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 2>and maybe I'm just as crazy as you guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

144
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.940
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Muslims are oppressed women.</v>

145
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cultural.</v>

146
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 2>We need to understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh guys think they're girls that you</v>

147
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

148
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 2>we need to understand where they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming from.</v>

149
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're so open minded to it,</v>

150
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.890
<v Speaker 2>even if it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

151
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.260
<v Speaker 1>That's also the agreeableness say that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were talking about earlier.</v>

152
00:07:46.261 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because agree,</v>

153
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:50.300
<v Speaker 1>agreeable people agree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:55.570
<v Speaker 1>that's why the term exists and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there is a real apology and if you</v>

155
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.220
<v Speaker 1>ally that with high openness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that open mindedness,</v>

156
00:07:59.221 --> 00:08:01.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's associated activity,</v>

157
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.470
<v Speaker 1>you get agreeable openness and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's definitely.</v>

158
00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 2>And then it even goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll call and I'll forgive you beating</v>

159
00:08:09.771 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 2>your wife and if you're low in</v>
<v Speaker 2>conscientiousness,</v>

160
00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 2>everything keeping really goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Bill Moore puts it nicely when he</v>

161
00:08:17.571 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

162
00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:23.170
<v Speaker 2>the lift would not for one second be</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay with apartheid in South Africa,</v>

163
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just banging that drum hating</v>

164
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:29.270
<v Speaker 2>every second of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason the oppression of</v>

165
00:08:29.271 --> 00:08:32.030
<v Speaker 2>women in Saudi Arabia has gotten a</v>
<v Speaker 2>complete pass.</v>

166
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:35.660
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a real deal.</v>

167
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.553
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what</v>

168
00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.820
<v Speaker 2>the heck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just the driving thing alone.</v>

169
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Taylor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you hold it that they liked her?</v>

170
00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I broke up.</v>

171
00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.480
<v Speaker 2>You broke that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't hear what you were saying</v>

172
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>that you're still a little frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

173
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:53.234
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

174
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.740
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just taking away their ability to drive.</v>

175
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women don't have mobility without men.</v>

176
00:08:56.970 --> 00:09:00.660
<v Speaker 2>That is hugely oppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you made that change in America and</v>

177
00:09:00.661 --> 00:09:04.070
<v Speaker 2>none other than our wellness stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

178
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>you actually don't see a more concrete</v>
<v Speaker 1>embodiment of the idea of individual</v>

179
00:09:10.211 --> 00:09:13.300
<v Speaker 1>autonomy than the automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

180
00:09:13.301 --> 00:09:16.900
<v Speaker 1>I think maybe it was the Soviet Union's</v>
<v Speaker 1>import and then,</v>

181
00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:17.990
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

182
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.830
<v Speaker 1>a manufacturer if the automobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the doom,</v>

183
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:25.840
<v Speaker 1>communism because nothing screams</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous individual like a car,</v>

184
00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:28.630
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will derive it yourself.</v>

185
00:09:28.631 --> 00:09:31.120
<v Speaker 1>You can go on any road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one tells you what to do.</v>

186
00:09:31.121 --> 00:09:35.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the fact that women can't drive in</v>

187
00:09:35.441 --> 00:09:37.540
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tells the entire story.</v>

188
00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:42.780
<v Speaker 1>And so the fact I cannot understand for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the life of me why we are so blind in</v>

189
00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:45.790
<v Speaker 1>the west,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we make the assumption that those</v>

190
00:09:45.791 --> 00:09:49.390
<v Speaker 1>people are our allies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in what way?</v>
