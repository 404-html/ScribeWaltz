00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Last question is since it is the holiday season now,</v>

2
00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>and hopefully young people will be inspired to read a bit over the break,</v>

3
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.230
<v Speaker 1>what book?</v>

4
00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Give me two books that you can recommend to the high school.</v>

5
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:21.621
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

6
00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:22.454
<v Speaker 1>We'll be like,</v>

7
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

8
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.890
<v Speaker 1>well I would say high school did a really good book is as Viktor Frankl's man's</v>

9
00:00:28.881 --> 00:00:29.714
<v Speaker 1>search for meaning.</v>

10
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a very deep book and it's,</v>

11
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:32.240
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

12
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I would say it's an accessible book and it's very thoughtful and so I think</v>

13
00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:37.280
<v Speaker 1>that's a great one.</v>

14
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.880
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's salutary for young people to read 1984 and brave new world as</v>

15
00:00:44.031 --> 00:00:44.490
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

16
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if those are still on high school reading lists,</v>

17
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.930
<v Speaker 1>but they certainly should be because they lay out two different totalitarian</v>

18
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.920
<v Speaker 1>futures,</v>

19
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.630
<v Speaker 1>both of which are quite,</v>

20
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.130
<v Speaker 1>not only quite plausible,</v>

21
00:00:55.131 --> 00:00:57.860
<v Speaker 1>but pieces of which you can see already in operation.</v>

22
00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.253
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.321
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

24
00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:01.011
<v Speaker 1>search for meaning,</v>

25
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I really like,</v>

26
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.170
<v Speaker 1>there's one by Carl you'll to called modern man in search of a soul,</v>

27
00:01:06.171 --> 00:01:09.470
<v Speaker 1>which I think is another one that would be good for high school kids to read.</v>

28
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.750
<v Speaker 1>It's as far as Carl Jung's writings go.</v>

29
00:01:11.751 --> 00:01:13.220
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty accessible and it's,</v>

30
00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.110
<v Speaker 1>it also speaks to the,</v>

31
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.920
<v Speaker 1>what would you say to the high value and potential integrity of the human psyche</v>

32
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 1>and soul and,</v>

33
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.520
<v Speaker 1>and the importance for individuals,</v>

34
00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 1>including high school cause students to get their acts together and to figure</v>

35
00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:31.490
<v Speaker 1>out how to organize themselves and to contribute to the world.</v>

36
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.740
<v Speaker 1>So that's what I would recommend.</v>

37
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.970
<v Speaker 1>Great choices.</v>

38
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I love all the books you just mentioned.</v>

39
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And so this is going to be your first Christmas as a grandfather.</v>

40
00:01:39.471 --> 00:01:40.304
<v Speaker 1>Excited.</v>

41
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

42
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.751
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty nice.</v>

43
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:42.081
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:47.081
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're going to have three Christmases because my kids each have their own</v>

45
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 1>household established in Toronto and so we're going to have a Christmas at each</v>

46
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:50.931
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

47
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:54.830
<v Speaker 1>So that's where you're going to be eating a lot of Turkey basically.</v>

48
00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:55.121
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:55.371
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

50
00:01:55.371 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>it was her.</v>

51
00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.361
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

52
00:01:56.361 --> 00:01:56.501
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

53
00:01:56.501 --> 00:01:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

54
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.651
<v Speaker 1>I'm and it's,</v>

55
00:01:57.651 --> 00:01:57.891
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

56
00:01:57.891 --> 00:02:01.070
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun to have a baby around again and to watch her watch her develop.</v>

57
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>You've got to the point now where she can hold a rattle and she's experimenting</v>

58
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>with a bunch of new sounds and,</v>

59
00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.140
<v Speaker 1>and smiles quite a lot.</v>

60
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.490
<v Speaker 1>Makes eye contact and it's discovered her feet.</v>

61
00:02:10.491 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

62
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.960

<v Speaker 1>it's really fun.</v>

65
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>It's remarkable watching them grow.</v>

66
00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>So lastly,</v>

67
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:18.290

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

74
00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:26.030
