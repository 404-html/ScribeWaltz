1
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.113
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.153
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.340
<v Speaker 2>there's all this Lindsay shepherd that you're,</v>

4
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:14.630
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

5
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

7
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.290
<v Speaker 2>trans folk I a lot about these issues in Sweden.</v>

8
00:00:19.291 --> 00:00:22.820
<v Speaker 2>This one of the few that's sweetness about it to slaughter activists.</v>

9
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.580
<v Speaker 2>And recently I wrote about how it coincides with the autism diagnosis.</v>

10
00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.810
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's the same in the United States.</v>

11
00:00:32.811 --> 00:00:33.644
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

12
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

13
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 2>the number of,</v>

14
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.660
<v Speaker 2>especially young women who's never had any doubts about their sexual,</v>

15
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.320
<v Speaker 2>about their gender identity,</v>

16
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.760
<v Speaker 2>but then they file,</v>

17
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.790
<v Speaker 2>find the like minded people with problems connecting socially on the Internet.</v>

18
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.260
<v Speaker 2>And then all of a sudden they decide that I'm,</v>

19
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.550
<v Speaker 2>I'm another woman,</v>

20
00:00:53.551 --> 00:00:54.384
<v Speaker 2>I'm a man.</v>

21
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.321
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

22
00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 2>most of them have a diagnosis within the autism spectrum.</v>

23
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 2>And to even say this and say that this is something we need to investigate is</v>

24
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.480
<v Speaker 2>sort of transphobia,</v>

25
00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.680
<v Speaker 2>because then you're,</v>

26
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

27
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 2>you're questioning the motives,</v>

28
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.940
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

29
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.140
<v Speaker 2>within the person.</v>

30
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.523
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>

31
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

32
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 2>you're basically saying that it's not,</v>

33
00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not an gender identity or feeling that full.</v>

34
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

35
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.730
<v Speaker 2>it's like maybe it's going to be worse.</v>

36
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.601
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

37
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:28.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

38
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 1>it's going to get worse because look like,</v>

39
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

40
00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.130
<v Speaker 1>here's the logical fallacy.</v>

41
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 1>Not all transsexuals have mental illness,</v>

42
00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 1>but many people with mental illness are going to be confused about their</v>

43
00:01:41.141 --> 00:01:41.974
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

44
00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.121
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

45
00:01:43.121 --> 00:01:46.780
<v Speaker 1>So that the pool of people confused about their identity is extraordinarily</v>

46
00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:47.614
<v Speaker 1>large.</v>

47
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.371
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

48
00:01:48.371 --> 00:01:51.880
<v Speaker 1>if you produce a social fad,</v>

49
00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.060
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what we're doing with gender transformation,</v>

50
00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>then everyone who's unstable is going to gravitate very rapidly towards that fat</v>

51
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.340
<v Speaker 1>that's happened many times with different forms of pathology.</v>

52
00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:04.210
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

53
00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a book called the discovery of the unconscious by an existentialist</v>

54
00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>psychotherapist named Henri Aliber Shay,</v>

55
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.240
<v Speaker 1>which is a great book,</v>

56
00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.133
<v Speaker 1>Great Book,</v>

57
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>and he tracks the cyclical recurrence of multiple personality disorder over the</v>

58
00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:22.460
<v Speaker 1>last 300 years.</v>

59
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.540
<v Speaker 1>So a case will be reported after everyone forgets about it.</v>

60
00:02:26.541 --> 00:02:27.530
<v Speaker 1>For a generation or two,</v>

61
00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 1>a case will be reported and then it spreads like wildfire.</v>

62
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.990
<v Speaker 1>And there's multiple personality everywhere.</v>

63
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.290
<v Speaker 1>And then people get skeptical about it and the reports dropoff to zero and it</v>

64
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.430
<v Speaker 1>goes underground again.</v>

65
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.200
<v Speaker 1>And then three generations again,</v>

66
00:02:41.201 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>somebody reports a case history and Poof,</v>

67
00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 1>up it comes again.</v>

68
00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>And so the there,</v>

69
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:49.420
<v Speaker 1>there are these in Carl Jung wrote about this a lot.</v>

70
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:54.100
<v Speaker 1>There are these psychic epidemics that occur from time to time.</v>

71
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.061
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

72
00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:55.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

73
00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.830
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happened for example,</v>

74
00:02:56.831 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 1>in the 1980s when,</v>

75
00:02:58.051 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

76
00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.930
<v Speaker 1>there was a huge in the United States in particular about,</v>

77
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.823
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

78
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.830
<v Speaker 1>satanistic ritual abuse in daycares and that that produced an absolute uproar</v>

79
00:03:09.741 --> 00:03:13.760
<v Speaker 1>for like five years and many did you have that?</v>

80
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

81
00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 2>One of the professors here at hope Sola tubes,</v>

82
00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.601
<v Speaker 2>so university,</v>

83
00:03:18.601 --> 00:03:23.570
<v Speaker 2>she wrote a book about most of them men of power.</v>

84
00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.900
<v Speaker 2>We're in Arlington Hospital.</v>

85
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

86
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.123
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

87
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

88
00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 2>even though it was,</v>

89
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's blatantly,</v>

90
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:31.391
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

91
00:03:31.391 --> 00:03:31.720
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

92
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.553
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

93
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

94
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.340
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't gender scientists</v>

95
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.870
<v Speaker 2>because he would criticize it was sort of a,</v>

96
00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.620
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

97
00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

98
00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.030
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

99
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.351
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

100
00:03:42.351 --> 00:03:43.184
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

101
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.790
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

102
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>he's actually one of the architects behind our,</v>

103
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:47.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

104
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 2>how we view men's violence against women.</v>

105
00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.430
<v Speaker 2>But you also wrote about this satanic rituals that men in power had against</v>

106
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.743
<v Speaker 2>children,</v>

107
00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.820
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't in daycare.</v>

108
00:03:59.821 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 2>It was just like against children everywhere.</v>

109
00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

110
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>AH,</v>

111
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.990
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

112
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.261
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:08.650
<v Speaker 1>there's a great book written in the United States called saint silence by a</v>

115
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.230
<v Speaker 1>social worker and the lawyer that investigated that,</v>

116
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.550
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

117
00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 1>satanic ritual abuse epidemic.</v>

118
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.220
<v Speaker 1>And it makes the Salem witch hunts looked like nothing.</v>

119
00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

120
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.040
<v Speaker 1>the longest prison sentence is in history,</v>

121
00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>were handed out for the hypothetical perpetrators of these satanic ritual abuse.</v>

122
00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 1>They dug under whole towns in places looking for the tunnels where the,</v>

123
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>where the sacrifices were being performed.</v>

124
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

125
00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>they invented a whole new categories of clinical diagnosis,</v>

126
00:04:36.491 --> 00:04:37.540
<v Speaker 1>late onset,</v>

127
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.100
<v Speaker 1>female sexual predator,</v>

128
00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.020
<v Speaker 1>of whom there are zero.</v>

129
00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.320
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

130
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>That is a category that does not exist.</v>

131
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.193
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievable.</v>

132
00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.420
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like a great book.</v>

133
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

134
00:04:47.781 --> 00:04:51.830
<v Speaker 2>like a great horror horror movie or something like be satanic circles,</v>

135
00:04:51.831 --> 00:04:53.390
<v Speaker 2>but to actually believe in it,</v>

136
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.930
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

137
00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:54.980
<v Speaker 2>it's really crazy.</v>

138
00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
