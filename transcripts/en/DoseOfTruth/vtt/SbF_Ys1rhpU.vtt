00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any guidance around taking notes from books and lectures?</v>

2
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:11.931
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:11.931 --> 00:00:12.141
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4
00:00:12.141 --> 00:00:12.974
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

5
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Like don't be taking notes during the lecture.</v>

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:17.773
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

7
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Because then you're not listening to the lecture.</v>

8
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.900
<v Speaker 1>It's like listen to the lecture and then take notes afterwards.</v>

9
00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Now that doesn't work for every discipline,</v>

10
00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.500
<v Speaker 1>but it certainly works for disciplines like it.</v>

11
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.200
<v Speaker 1>Students in my lectures,</v>

12
00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:30.891
<v Speaker 1>I always tell them,</v>

13
00:00:30.891 --> 00:00:33.650
<v Speaker 1>don't take notes during the lecture.</v>

14
00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Listen to the damn lecture.</v>

15
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.320
<v Speaker 1>You can take notes afterwards because what that does is force you to practice</v>

16
00:00:39.321 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>remembering and then with regards to books,</v>

17
00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:43.730
<v Speaker 1>it's like read,</v>

18
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>don't highlight,</v>

19
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>don't underline like that.</v>

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.640
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's just rubbish.</v>

21
00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 1>I think it's pseudo work.</v>

22
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>Read a couple of paragraphs or maybe an essay,</v>

23
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.621
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

24
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:56.150
<v Speaker 1>Depending on the density of the book.</v>

25
00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Close the book.</v>

26
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.333
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

27
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Write down what you're thinking.</v>

28
00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:01.790
<v Speaker 1>Write down what you remember but,</v>

29
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.540
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

30
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Speaker 1>but in the context of what you're thinking about because that instantiates it</v>

31
00:01:07.461 --> 00:01:09.890
<v Speaker 1>into your memory and give and puts it at hand.</v>

32
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 1>Like people ask me for example,</v>

33
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>how it is that I can remember all the things that I talk about extemporaneously</v>

34
00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.191
<v Speaker 1>when I'm lecturing.</v>

35
00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is because I've thought them through.</v>

36
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.901
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

37
00:01:20.901 --> 00:01:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I read them and I think,</v>

38
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.221
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

39
00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:22.551
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

40
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:24.260
<v Speaker 1>well that's an interesting idea.</v>

41
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 1>How does it relate to all these other ideas that I know?</v>

42
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it significance for this idea and what's its significance for this</v>

43
00:01:31.731 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>idea and do I believe it and how my dad criticize it.</v>

44
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.840
<v Speaker 1>So it's Kinda like I'm,</v>

45
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm attaching little memory hooks to it in,</v>

46
00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.130
<v Speaker 1>in five different ways.</v>

47
00:01:40.131 --> 00:01:41.030
<v Speaker 1>And then I've got it.</v>

48
00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:41.361
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

49
00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:45.950
<v Speaker 1>it's part of me and that seems to be part of recall rather than,</v>

50
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.250
<v Speaker 1>so rather than recognition and recall is the spontaneous act of remembering</v>

51
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 1>something complex.</v>

52
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>And when you recall something,</v>

53
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:58.910
<v Speaker 1>you're actually practicing remembering it and that's what you need to do if you</v>

54
00:01:58.911 --> 00:02:00.140
<v Speaker 1>want that to be part of you.</v>

55
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.560
<v Speaker 1>So I would say separate out the function of reading and note taking.</v>

56
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.980
<v Speaker 1>So read,</v>

57
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.993
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

58
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.430
<v Speaker 1>write or read,</v>

59
00:02:10.431 --> 00:02:10.791
<v Speaker 1>write,</v>

60
00:02:10.791 --> 00:02:11.480
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

61
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.750
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

62
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Because the last two things are quite similar,</v>

63
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.990
<v Speaker 1>but don't like read the book and then read a sentence and then write down that</v>

64
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:18.501
<v Speaker 1>sentence.</v>

65
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>That's not helpful.</v>

66
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.560
<v Speaker 1>You could read the sentence,</v>

67
00:02:21.561 --> 00:02:22.371
<v Speaker 1>close the book,</v>

68
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:25.310
<v Speaker 1>and then reformulate the sentence so that now it's your sentence,</v>

69
00:02:25.311 --> 00:02:25.581
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

70
00:02:25.581 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll remember it.</v>

71
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Then you'll understand it.</v>

72
00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:28.460
<v Speaker 1>That works really well.</v>
