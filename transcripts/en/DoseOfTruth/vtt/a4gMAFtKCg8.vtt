1
00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>When I,</v>

2
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.420
<v Speaker 1>when I talked to friends or family and I tell them,</v>

3
00:00:09.421 --> 00:00:12.200
<v Speaker 1>what if we don't stop behaving this way,</v>

4
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>it would be you don't stop lying.</v>

5
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:16.230
<v Speaker 1>If you don't become more too thrilled about what's happening,</v>

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.320
<v Speaker 1>then this could end in,</v>

7
00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:18.591
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

8
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>in genocide and they just look like,</v>

9
00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>why are you talking about</v>

10
00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:23.741
<v Speaker 2>you?</v>

11
00:00:23.741 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 2>I'd always does that.</v>

12
00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's true.</v>

13
00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 2>There's not even a shock.</v>

14
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.361
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

16
00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:32.080
<v Speaker 2>It shouldn't even be a shark because it's the natural state of affairs that</v>

17
00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 2>always happens.</v>

18
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.731
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

19
00:00:33.731 --> 00:00:33.931
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

20
00:00:33.931 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 2>we also think that there was something that was in some sense limited to,</v>

21
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.270
<v Speaker 2>well let's say what happened in Germany in the 20th century,</v>

22
00:00:40.271 --> 00:00:41.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's not limited to that at all.</v>

23
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 2>It happens everywhere.</v>

24
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.941
<v Speaker 1>Berlin,</v>

25
00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:43.421
<v Speaker 1>where I live,</v>

26
00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:47.620
<v Speaker 1>it's full of monuments from the Holocaust museums with,</v>

27
00:00:47.621 --> 00:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

28
00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

29
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

30
00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.783
<v Speaker 2>never forget.</v>

31
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Still it's,</v>

32
00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.540
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

33
00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.260
<v Speaker 1>it's not something that we have internalized somehow that,</v>

34
00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

35
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.253
<v Speaker 2>then you can read,</v>

36
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.050
<v Speaker 2>you can remember what you don't understand.</v>

37
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.220
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

38
00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.100
<v Speaker 2>No matter how hard you try and the issue is,</v>

39
00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.830
<v Speaker 2>what does it mean to remember?</v>

40
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.500
<v Speaker 2>But what I know what it means to remember,</v>

41
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.680
<v Speaker 2>like technically if you make a mistake and you've represented it properly in</v>

42
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:14.794
<v Speaker 2>your memory,</v>

43
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.870
<v Speaker 2>you don't make the same mistake again.</v>

44
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 2>That's actually what memories for,</v>

45
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.241
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

46
00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:19.931
<v Speaker 2>Because you think,</v>

47
00:01:19.931 --> 00:01:20.764
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

48
00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 2>why do you remember the past?</v>

49
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Well there's two reasons.</v>

50
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:29.431
<v Speaker 2>One is to repeat things you did well that worked out and to not repeat things</v>

51
00:01:30.371 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 2>you did badly.</v>

52
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.660
<v Speaker 2>The purpose of memory is to do that.</v>

53
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 2>It's not to represent the world.</v>

54
00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.571
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is,</v>

55
00:01:37.571 --> 00:01:41.680
<v Speaker 2>but only institute works works basically and to not do what doesn't work.</v>

56
00:01:41.681 --> 00:01:41.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

57
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:42.491
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

58
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:46.060
<v Speaker 2>He used to bring the success as into the future and leave the failures behind</v>

59
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.441
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

60
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:50.800
<v Speaker 2>well we're going to remember the Holocaust.</v>

61
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

62
00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.630
<v Speaker 2>well what are you going to remember?</v>

63
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So humans cannot have like a collective memory that they used to like a warning</v>

64
00:01:57.471 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>signal.</v>

65
00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.421
<v Speaker 2>Oh sure.</v>

66
00:01:58.421 --> 00:01:59.171
<v Speaker 2>We do that too.</v>

67
00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:00.910
<v Speaker 2>But we have formulated properly.</v>

68
00:02:00.911 --> 00:02:01.211
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

69
00:02:01.211 --> 00:02:02.044
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

70
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.550
<v Speaker 2>so one question while a question and this question has plagued me forever,</v>

71
00:02:06.551 --> 00:02:07.384
<v Speaker 2>I would say is,</v>

72
00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.231
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

73
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 2>what is it that we're supposed to have learned from what happened in Germany in</v>

74
00:02:12.641 --> 00:02:13.510
<v Speaker 2>the 1930s?</v>

75
00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 2>What are we learn that there was something wrong with Germans?</v>

76
00:02:16.451 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Is that the lesson?</v>

77
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 2>That's not really a very useful lesson.</v>

78
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.943
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

79
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.820
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

80
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.031
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

81
00:02:22.031 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 2>that was isolated to that time and place that,</v>

82
00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.650
<v Speaker 2>that it was the consequence of following pathological leadership.</v>

83
00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.830
<v Speaker 2>That it was a consequence of economic turmoil.</v>

84
00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.280
<v Speaker 2>And there's all sorts of things you could learn from it.</v>

85
00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.390
<v Speaker 2>My sense is that what needs to be learned from it is that that's what we're</v>

86
00:02:42.791 --> 00:02:43.624
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

87
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.480
<v Speaker 1>So it's not this sub culture is a country,</v>

88
00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:48.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not the German and the Dutch sheets,</v>

89
00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.410
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees do it.</v>

90
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 2>This is the great discovery of Jane Goodall,</v>

91
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.850
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

92
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 2>She found that the chimps raided,</v>

93
00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

95
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.600
<v Speaker 2>and when they were juveniles in particular,</v>

96
00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:02.434
<v Speaker 2>and when they,</v>

97
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.370
<v Speaker 2>when they're out on the borders of their territory doing their patrols.</v>

98
00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 2>And they came across chimps from another troop,</v>

100
00:03:09.941 --> 00:03:11.650
<v Speaker 2>they tear them to pieces.</v>

101
00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.581
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

102
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

103
00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

104
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.920
<v Speaker 2>that's not human.</v>

105
00:03:14.921 --> 00:03:15.580
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

106
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.510
<v Speaker 2>this is deeper than,</v>

107
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Speaker 2>it's even deeper than human.</v>

108
00:03:18.001 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 2>This wasn't,</v>

109
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>she rolls up we into desk.</v>

110
00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.903
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

111
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.181
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

112
00:03:23.181 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>She was shocked.</v>

113
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.181
<v Speaker 2>She was shocked.</v>

114
00:03:25.181 --> 00:03:25.600
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

115
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 2>for a bunch of reasons.</v>

116
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:26.801
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

117
00:03:26.801 --> 00:03:27.281
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

118
00:03:27.281 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 2>she was properly cautious because she thought that human interactions with the</v>

119
00:03:32.141 --> 00:03:34.840
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees might have interfered with their natural behavior.</v>

120
00:03:34.841 --> 00:03:36.460
<v Speaker 2>And that was such a shocking finding.</v>

121
00:03:36.461 --> 00:03:37.900
<v Speaker 2>She was unwilling to publish it.</v>

122
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.370
<v Speaker 2>But I also think it violated her noble savage assumption.</v>

123
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.061
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

124
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 2>that the state of nature was basically good.</v>

125
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.000
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>

126
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.950
<v Speaker 2>lots of people think the reason that human beings are corrupt because they're</v>

127
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.220
<v Speaker 2>socialized to be corrupt.</v>

128
00:03:51.221 --> 00:03:51.431
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

129
00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:52.810
<v Speaker 2>that the reason we're war,</v>

130
00:03:52.811 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>

131
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:56.270
<v Speaker 2>is because we're socialized improperly.</v>

132
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 2>And I mean you can certainly socialize people to be more or less warlike,</v>

133
00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 2>but this is a way deeper problem.</v>

134
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Then mirror socialization,</v>

135
00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.391
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

136
00:04:07.391 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 2>even though socialization is very,</v>

137
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.030
<v Speaker 2>very important.</v>

138
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.601
<v Speaker 2>So she,</v>

139
00:04:10.601 --> 00:04:10.841
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

140
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 2>she was very hesitant to publish it,</v>

141
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.051
<v Speaker 2>but she did.</v>

142
00:04:14.051 --> 00:04:14.884
<v Speaker 2>And it's been,</v>

143
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.670
<v Speaker 2>it's become clear in the,</v>

144
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.630
<v Speaker 2>in the decades following that that was normative behavior for chimpanzees.</v>

145
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

146
00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's also partly the fact that people have,</v>

147
00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 2>we have ourselves backwards.</v>

148
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.970
<v Speaker 2>We always ask stupid questions.</v>

149
00:04:30.971 --> 00:04:31.211
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

150
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:32.350
<v Speaker 2>why are we anxious?</v>

151
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a stupid question.</v>

152
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.291
<v Speaker 2>The question,</v>

153
00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:40.291
<v Speaker 2>the real question is how is it ever that anyone has ever calm even for a</v>

154
00:04:40.511 --> 00:04:41.380
<v Speaker 2>microsecond?</v>

155
00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.251
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

156
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:43.310
<v Speaker 2>And it's the case.</v>

157
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.980
<v Speaker 2>Why are we aggressive?</v>

158
00:04:44.981 --> 00:04:45.814
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

159
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.983
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

160
00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>how is it that we can now and then be peaceful?</v>

161
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.430
<v Speaker 2>That's the question.</v>

162
00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 2>So we have these things backwards.</v>

163
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.140
<v Speaker 2>We don't understand ourselves and we can't remember what we don't understand.</v>

164
00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

165
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 2>you can remember what you don't understand.</v>

166
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.013
<v Speaker 2>It's uh,</v>

167
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

168
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:08.100
<v Speaker 2>in some sense to try to remember what you do and understand is to be in a state</v>

169
00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:09.184
<v Speaker 2>of trauma.</v>

170
00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 2>And I would say that that would characterize the Germans.</v>

171
00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Hitler was,</v>

172
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.773
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

173
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 2>a singular personality in very creative,</v>

174
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 2>very assertive,</v>

175
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.673
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

176
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 2>and also very good at</v>

177
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 2>pattern recognition.</v>

178
00:05:26.891 --> 00:05:28.150
<v Speaker 2>It was part of his creativity.</v>

179
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.201
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

180
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 2>So now here's the,</v>

181
00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:31.361
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>

182
00:05:31.361 --> 00:05:32.680
<v Speaker 2>he was a very creative person.</v>

183
00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

184
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

185
00:05:34.961 --> 00:05:37.300
<v Speaker 2>it's part of being creative is to recognize patterns.</v>

186
00:05:37.301 --> 00:05:39.910
<v Speaker 2>To pick them up unconsciously because that's what an artist does,</v>

187
00:05:39.911 --> 00:05:43.120
<v Speaker 2>is pick up patterns unconsciously and then portray them right.</v>

188
00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.090
<v Speaker 2>And in an attempt to make them conscious that that's part of the artistic</v>

189
00:05:46.091 --> 00:05:46.924
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

190
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.441
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

191
00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 2>So now he's brutalized,</v>

192
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:50.321
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

193
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 2>He went through trench warfare and World War One and he's thought it because he</v>

194
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:55.260
<v Speaker 2>wanted to become an artist and,</v>

195
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.260
<v Speaker 2>and he applied to become an artist.</v>

196
00:05:57.261 --> 00:05:58.094
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in,</v>

197
00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 2>I think it was in Vienna.</v>

198
00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

199
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 2>I think it was three times.</v>

200
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:02.330
<v Speaker 2>And he was,</v>

201
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 2>Hebrews rejected all three times.</v>

202
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.323
<v Speaker 2>Homeless.</v>

203
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.590
<v Speaker 2>Many of his friends had been killed in world war one was brutal.</v>

204
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.080
<v Speaker 2>And there's no evidence that he was a coward in World War One.</v>

205
00:06:12.081 --> 00:06:13.460
<v Speaker 2>He got a medal for valor,</v>

206
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.271
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Speaker 2>and if I remember correctly,</v>

208
00:06:16.041 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>there was one time in his life where he was in trench warfare,</v>

209
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 2>is seen with his friends and he wandered off away from them.</v>

210
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 2>And when he came back,</v>

211
00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 2>a mortar had landed in the middle of the group and killed everyone.</v>

212
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:30.710
<v Speaker 2>Now that does something to you psychologically as well,</v>

213
00:06:30.711 --> 00:06:30.921
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

214
00:06:30.921 --> 00:06:32.510
<v Speaker 2>Because it makes you feel special,</v>

215
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 2>marked out because you didn't die.</v>

216
00:06:34.821 --> 00:06:36.020
<v Speaker 2>But everyone else did.</v>

217
00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

218
00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 2>So anyways,</v>

219
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.450
<v Speaker 2>so there is Hitler and then he's surrounded by brutalized man in Germany is</v>

220
00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:42.800
<v Speaker 2>completely demolished and,</v>

221
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

222
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.270
<v Speaker 2>and the economy is in shambles in the communists or threatening and it's like,</v>

223
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.991
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

224
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 2>and then of course there's hyperinflation and,</v>

225
00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:50.540
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

226
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

227
00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 2>and the Germans all feel betrayed and it's like it's a mass,</v>

228
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:54.801
<v Speaker 2>a mass,</v>

229
00:06:54.801 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 2>the magnitude of which we can barely even imagine.</v>

230
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 2>And so then he starts talking to people cause he's not very happy and,</v>

231
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.240
<v Speaker 2>and he's willing to go with the crowd leads him.</v>

232
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.410
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

233
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.700
<v Speaker 2>Now the funny thing is,</v>

234
00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:12.050
<v Speaker 2>is that a good leader has a dialogue with the crowd,</v>

235
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:17.270
<v Speaker 2>but a good leader isn't willing to go wherever the crowd wants to go.</v>

236
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 2>It's a dialogue and not Hitler.</v>

237
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:21.620
<v Speaker 2>It's not a dialogue precisely.</v>

238
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:22.311
<v Speaker 2>Or if it is,</v>

239
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a dialogue with a darker side of it.</v>

240
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 2>So this is,</v>

241
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.330
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>

242
00:07:26.331 --> 00:07:31.331
<v Speaker 2>So he stands up in front of the crowd and he has some oratorical ability so we</v>

243
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 2>can captivate people.</v>

244
00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 2>And because maybe he is one of those vessels through which the crowd can speak.</v>

245
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:41.420
<v Speaker 2>So he says these sentences,</v>

246
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 2>nothing happens.</v>

247
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.090
<v Speaker 2>And he says these sentences and he gets a bit of rise out of the crowd.</v>

248
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.850
<v Speaker 2>And then he says the same sentences,</v>

249
00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.010
<v Speaker 2>but he puts a flourish on them and then it gets a real rise out of the crowd.</v>

250
00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.640
<v Speaker 2>And the little pattern recognition module in his mind thinks,</v>

251
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.474
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

252
00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.710
<v Speaker 2>not so much of that and quite a bit more of this.</v>

253
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:03.590
<v Speaker 2>And so then he does that again and he gets a little better at it.</v>

254
00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.700
<v Speaker 2>And so there's quite a bit more of the crowd pleasing rhetoric and the crowds</v>

255
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:12.701
<v Speaker 2>get more enthusiastic and he's watching and attending and shifting his behavior</v>

256
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.113
<v Speaker 2>pattern.</v>

257
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:15.093
<v Speaker 2>The pattern,</v>

258
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 2>the pattern is met,</v>

259
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 2>the pattern of the crowds desire is manifesting itself in his imagination and</v>

260
00:08:20.841 --> 00:08:22.130
<v Speaker 2>he's giving voice to it.</v>

261
00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.331
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

262
00:08:23.331 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

263
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:27.770
<v Speaker 2>what does the angry post war German crowd want?</v>

264
00:08:28.610 --> 00:08:33.610
<v Speaker 2>So you could think of Hitler as the articulated embodiment of the maddened</v>

265
00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.743
<v Speaker 2>crowd,</v>

266
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

267
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.270
<v Speaker 2>And then there's a dynamic,</v>

268
00:08:38.271 --> 00:08:38.481
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

269
00:08:38.481 --> 00:08:40.910
<v Speaker 2>So the crowd boot broadcasts,</v>

270
00:08:40.911 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 2>it's resentment to the leader,</v>

271
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>and the leader says,</v>

272
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.191
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

273
00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:44.720
<v Speaker 2>this is what you mean in the crowd goes,</v>

274
00:08:44.721 --> 00:08:45.554
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

275
00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 2>that's what we mean.</v>

276
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.260
<v Speaker 2>And then they get more fired up and,</v>

277
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:49.820
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

278
00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.400
<v Speaker 2>and the leader listens and recognizes the pattern,</v>

279
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:52.641
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>

280
00:08:52.641 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>so this is what you want?</v>

281
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 2>And the crowd goes yes.</v>

282
00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 2>And feedback loop.</v>

283
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:00.120
<v Speaker 2>Right then he was very good at that.</v>

284
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:00.631
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

285
00:09:00.631 --> 00:09:05.631
<v Speaker 2>you willing to use the gift of his voice in the service of the darkest desire of</v>

286
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 2>the maddened crowd.</v>

287
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 2>While it's like calling Satan himself up from the depths to good enough</v>

288
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:14.521
<v Speaker 2>metaphor,</v>

289
00:09:14.521 --> 00:09:15.354
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

290
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.580
<v Speaker 2>unless someone can come up with a better one,</v>

291
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.930
<v Speaker 2>like that's a good one.</v>
