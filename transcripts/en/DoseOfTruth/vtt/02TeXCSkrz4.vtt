1
00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.430
<v Speaker 1>It's basically</v>

2
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.473
<v Speaker 1>material</v>

3
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.950
<v Speaker 1>route 60 12 of us were like,</v>

4
00:00:36.951 --> 00:00:41.951
<v Speaker 1>we just put your house in perfect order before you criticize the world.</v>

5
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.920
<v Speaker 1>It's a consequence that the discussion surrounded is a conference,</v>

6
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.800
<v Speaker 1>a problem that I be trying to for a very long time.</v>

7
00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 1>And so to fix it teams to clearly formulated girl,</v>

8
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>which is actually the most difficult,</v>

9
00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.573
<v Speaker 1>harder.</v>

10
00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.133
<v Speaker 1>Once you,</v>

11
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>once you can formulate the problem,</v>

12
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 1>it's fairly easy for lay on possibilities,</v>

13
00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 1>but it clearly formulate the problem is very difficult.</v>

14
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean it's necessarily easy.</v>

15
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.040
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

16
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker 1>so to solve the problems,</v>

17
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 1>to formulate the drug,</v>

18
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>but also then to</v>

19
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>articulate it deeply enough so that it principal,</v>

20
00:01:28.231 --> 00:01:29.730
<v Speaker 1>it might go away.</v>

21
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>if you have an argument with someone in your family,</v>

23
00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.120
<v Speaker 1>your wife or your husband or the sibling,</v>

24
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>and there's real conflict around it.</v>

25
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.130
<v Speaker 1>If you on foot properly and be walked through it,</v>

26
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>then you don't have to have to fight,</v>

27
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.470
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

28
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.303
<v Speaker 1>Because you,</v>

29
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.510
<v Speaker 1>you've negotiated a settlement problem disappears.</v>

30
00:01:50.511 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>And that's actually how you normally,</v>

31
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:52.890
<v Speaker 1>if you understand something,</v>

32
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:54.330
<v Speaker 1>is that the problem isn't here.</v>

33
00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>That takes care principle.</v>

34
00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>And so the problem that I want to talk to you about tonight is I probably</v>

35
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.320
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't make me from specific,</v>

36
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I spent a lot of time thinking about totalitarianism [inaudible].</v>

37
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>We're very interested in both of those topics interested in ideological</v>

38
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:17.740
<v Speaker 1>possession,</v>

39
00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>but I'm more interested in something that's the most extreme area.</v>

40
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.240
<v Speaker 1>The larger</v>

41
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.820
<v Speaker 1>the proclivity of people to use.</v>

42
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.730
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably brutal means.</v>

43
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>I've been forcing adherence to the ideology because eating all that in itself is</v>

44
00:02:39.601 --> 00:02:40.434
<v Speaker 1>a mystery.</v>

45
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 1>Why people believe things that they do,</v>

46
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>but why they're willing to use,</v>

47
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.210
<v Speaker 1>why they're willing to commit atrocities in service of those ideologies.</v>

48
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It's a much deeper history and one of the stories that really affected me when I</v>

49
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 1>was studying happened in Nazi Germany,</v>

50
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>indigo like counts the Soviet Union because those are the two forms of master</v>

51
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 1>trust.</v>

52
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:08.613
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that</v>

53
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.983
<v Speaker 1>deeply.</v>

54
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.430
<v Speaker 1>What is the story that never really left my imagination?</v>

55
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>This was a story or something that was inflicted upon my prisoner</v>

56
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>in Auschwitz during the time of the Nazi concentration camps.</v>

57
00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand that?</v>

58
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:29.321
<v Speaker 1>Something like that,</v>

59
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:31.180
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to put yourself to the area,</v>

60
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.081
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

61
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.950
<v Speaker 1>and that's an uncomfortable thing to do for all sorts of reasons.</v>

62
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>You can put yourself there as big thing,</v>

63
00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 1>which is actually more comforting in some sense.</v>

64
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's hot but it's comforting.</v>

65
00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>But your option is basically victim or perpetrator,</v>

66
00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.730
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

67
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>Think a situation like that.</v>

68
00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.450
<v Speaker 1>I think it's easier for people to imagine themselves as addicting.</v>

69
00:03:49.451 --> 00:03:52.150
<v Speaker 1>It's not that that's easy cause it's not,</v>

70
00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a paragraph into two bootcamp,</v>

71
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's nowhere near as error</v>

72
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking as it is to hazard your cell phone perpetrator.</v>

73
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And you might not be willing to do that.</v>

74
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:08.290
<v Speaker 1>But that's actually a mistake because unless you're willing to think that the</v>

75
00:04:08.291 --> 00:04:13.291
<v Speaker 1>sorts of people who perpetrated the catastrophes of Nazi Germany and the Stella</v>

76
00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:16.400
<v Speaker 1>was Soviet Union,</v>

77
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:17.353
<v Speaker 1>I was China,</v>

78
00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:18.663
<v Speaker 1>Cambodia,</v>

79
00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:19.391
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

80
00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:20.224
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

81
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.180
<v Speaker 1>without we Annie,</v>

82
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>including North Korea,</v>

83
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>including now and then as the way that this neighbor.</v>

84
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.260
<v Speaker 1>And that means that the people who do it a different species that you are the</v>

85
00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:36.721
<v Speaker 1>same and I don't really think that we're ever going to be able to stop back</v>

86
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.180
<v Speaker 1>short claim so it can be stopped and that better be the case without reading</v>

87
00:04:45.011 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>those situations as if we're the perpetrators and that's a terrible thing to do,</v>

88
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.620
<v Speaker 1>but they don't think that there's any way situations without understanding that.</v>

89
00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>One of the things I often encourage my students to understanding,</v>

90
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.480
<v Speaker 1>we never contemplating history and reading history is that they stopped creating</v>

91
00:05:04.481 --> 00:05:08.800
<v Speaker 1>history like if something happened in the past and start hurting like it's an</v>

92
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:11.920
<v Speaker 1>autobiography because it's much more effective.</v>

93
00:05:11.921 --> 00:05:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Your historical creature,</v>

94
00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:14.920
<v Speaker 1>when you read about history,</v>

95
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:15.611
<v Speaker 1>when you read history,</v>

96
00:05:15.611 --> 00:05:20.611
<v Speaker 1>you are greeting now you might not know that because you're not every form of</v>

97
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:21.101
<v Speaker 1>human.</v>

98
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:26.101
<v Speaker 1>You could be like your whatever particular form you joke right here is now about</v>

99
00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.340
<v Speaker 1>you have the potential within the a multiplicity of the,</v>

100
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.200
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Alexander Pope who said,</v>

101
00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.150
<v Speaker 1>if I remember correctly and nothing human is foreign to me that's a hell of a</v>

102
00:05:40.151 --> 00:05:42.190
<v Speaker 1>statement on the up shop.</v>

103
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.750
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite something cause there's obviously the great people down</v>

104
00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:46.210
<v Speaker 1>inside.</v>

105
00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:47.530
<v Speaker 1>It's really something to,</v>

106
00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.160
<v Speaker 1>and so to develop a detailed self understanding is to develop an understanding</v>

107
00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>that enables you to,</v>

108
00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.040
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

109
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:57.610
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

110
00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>to understand what your affiliation with the Nazi camp guards.</v>

111
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And that's a very unpleasant thing.</v>

112
00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.450
<v Speaker 1>So the situation with</v>

113
00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:14.020
<v Speaker 1>second was people were brought there often in Cali cars often in either freezing</v>

114
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:20.351
<v Speaker 1>weather or in very hot water and they're all crammed together in cattle are</v>

115
00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>standing mostly as many people as it possibly can be crammed in.</v>

116
00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.940
<v Speaker 1>And like that man,</v>

117
00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.970
<v Speaker 1>there's many of them died on the way there.</v>

118
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.880
<v Speaker 1>They Pete of sauce tumor,</v>

119
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:35.890
<v Speaker 1>they froze to death if they were on the outer sides of the car or they suffocate</v>

120
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.673
<v Speaker 1>they yard.</v>

121
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:39.573
<v Speaker 1>So it's all,</v>

122
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.380
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to lens and how terrible that must have baby.</v>

123
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:46.940
<v Speaker 1>And then of course they bribed accounts and they were sorted it to people who</v>

124
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:52.210
<v Speaker 1>from whom some useful labor might conceivably be extracted or those who were</v>

125
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.160
<v Speaker 1>doing a relatively immediate death.</v>

126
00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.500
<v Speaker 1>And then that's all bad know for sure.</v>

127
00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people were initiated to begin with and then they were separated</v>

128
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.060
<v Speaker 1>under brutal conditions from their,</v>

129
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.380
<v Speaker 1>from their life and so from their past and the present and the future.</v>

130
00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely traumatizing.</v>

131
00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 1>The families were destroyed,</v>

132
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:18.800
<v Speaker 1>everything was taken away from them.</v>

133
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:24.550
<v Speaker 1>They were treated as badly as animals are treated when they're treated badly and</v>

134
00:07:25.251 --> 00:07:25.720
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

135
00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 1>and they were brought to these accounts and the counselor cute places that they</v>

136
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.440
<v Speaker 1>were the size of small cities and you think of camp,</v>

137
00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>don't think of the city that review.</v>

138
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 1>That's what they were.</v>

139
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.100
<v Speaker 1>And that was enough for the people who have admin accounts,</v>

140
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

141
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.130
<v Speaker 1>which is really something because you think that would be enough no matter how</v>

142
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>wrong you were motivated by,</v>

143
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:48.490
<v Speaker 1>you might think that that would do the trick in all fundamentally they really</v>

144
00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 1>didn't do the trick.</v>

145
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>You know there,</v>

146
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:53.420
<v Speaker 1>there was a sign over Auschwitz,</v>

147
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:57.710
<v Speaker 1>which is so Alaskan brought back decided that existed in many,</v>

148
00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:58.981
<v Speaker 1>in many variants.</v>

149
00:07:58.981 --> 00:07:59.190
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

150
00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.330
<v Speaker 1>if there was only one of the,</v>

151
00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.200
<v Speaker 1>and I can't say the German,</v>

152
00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:06.940
<v Speaker 1>it's something like Arabic connect to free material is lacking but it needs</v>

153
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.780
<v Speaker 1>workable second free.</v>

154
00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.890
<v Speaker 1>That was the model of camp.</v>

155
00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:13.081
<v Speaker 1>That's awesome.</v>

156
00:08:13.081 --> 00:08:18.081
<v Speaker 1>Really stuck in my mind because it was a joke but it's actually a chill,</v>

157
00:08:19.130 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 1>it's really something to think of a mind that would conceptualize thousand Jill</v>

158
00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.090
<v Speaker 1>and could have been that sort of place.</v>

159
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.371
<v Speaker 1>Work rule,</v>

160
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:32.371
<v Speaker 1>second free account that was designed to work people to death and not even for</v>

161
00:08:32.841 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>the work that they do.</v>

162
00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:34.820
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

163
00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:39.260
<v Speaker 1>because if the Nazis would've had any sense and say we can be motivated by what</v>

164
00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:40.100
<v Speaker 1>they say thing with,</v>

165
00:08:40.101 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 1>again we're motivated by,</v>

166
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:44.750
<v Speaker 1>they would have said the caps off the entrepreneur humane manner.</v>

167
00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.890
<v Speaker 1>They would abuse you people.</v>

168
00:08:45.891 --> 00:08:49.570
<v Speaker 1>They put in the counts as slaves to further the war effort and they might avoid</v>

169
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>

170
00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.020
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't what they did.</v>

171
00:08:51.021 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 1>They brought Paul to Jews and the Gypsies and all the other people.</v>

172
00:08:53.961 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>They decided worth worth having around each of the couch.</v>

173
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>So you just basically work the point to see the death.</v>

174
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.960
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that was because that was one way you could make the depth.</v>

175
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.240
<v Speaker 1>The worst it could be,</v>

176
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:06.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

177
00:09:06.751 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>because they usually work as a punishment.</v>

178
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

179
00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.040
<v Speaker 1>if you work,</v>

180
00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.280
<v Speaker 1>you killed it anymore.</v>

181
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.590
<v Speaker 1>Soldiered isn't talked about this in the gulag.</v>

182
00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:16.201
<v Speaker 1>He was there,</v>

183
00:09:16.201 --> 00:09:16.501
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

184
00:09:16.501 --> 00:09:17.001
<v Speaker 1>well at least,</v>

185
00:09:17.001 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>but he was playing breaks as a prisoner.</v>

186
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 1>He had the gradis gratification,</v>

187
00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:24.720
<v Speaker 1>let's say if you need to build a straight wall of bricks,</v>

188
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:24.931
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

189
00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:26.870
<v Speaker 1>There was something about productive labor.</v>

190
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.830
<v Speaker 1>He's engaged in productive labor or the name we need to find at least see some</v>

191
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.920
<v Speaker 1>tiny shred of useful meaning in this absolutely dismal,</v>

192
00:09:34.921 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>wretched earner,</v>

193
00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>a circumstance.</v>

194
00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 1>But there were people who were running the camps like Auschwitz,</v>

195
00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:42.570
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to take,</v>

196
00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:44.600
<v Speaker 1>even now the way it worse than that,</v>

197
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:45.613
<v Speaker 1>invert it.</v>

198
00:09:45.990 --> 00:09:49.440
<v Speaker 1>And so one of the things that the count cards used to do to the new prisoners</v>

199
00:09:49.441 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>was to have them pick up wet socks,</v>

200
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 1>wet 100 pounds,</v>

201
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 1>100 pounds,</v>

202
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:56.640
<v Speaker 1>socks went salt,</v>

203
00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 1>and then carry them on their backs.</v>

204
00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>And remember I already told you that these people had already been through from</v>

205
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:05.320
<v Speaker 1>one side of the account to the other at.</v>

206
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't enough either.</v>

207
00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:12.020
<v Speaker 1>Even though there was no reason to move the soul and it was only a demonstration</v>

208
00:10:12.271 --> 00:10:17.271
<v Speaker 1>of power levels with demonstration of the sub absolute subjugation of the</v>

209
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 1>prisoners to this,</v>

210
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.210
<v Speaker 1>what would you call it?</v>

211
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Universal human necessity for work.</v>

212
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:23.240
<v Speaker 1>We have to work for it.</v>

213
00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:28.000
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the curses God blazoned on us at the end of the story about me.</v>

214
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.240
<v Speaker 1>People have deployed and,</v>

215
00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 1>and you can find meaning in that you can invert,</v>

216
00:10:32.701 --> 00:10:37.701
<v Speaker 1>it becomes a torture and you do that by making it pointless if an and office</v>

217
00:10:38.531 --> 00:10:39.270
<v Speaker 1>appointments.</v>

218
00:10:39.270 --> 00:10:40.910
<v Speaker 1>So we carry that red sock,</v>

219
00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.500
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice salt from one side of the camp out was obviously a parody of work and</v>

220
00:10:47.131 --> 00:10:50.370
<v Speaker 1>that was what the joke referred to this parody and work,</v>

221
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.600
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't enough either.</v>

222
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 1>They had to carry it back.</v>

223
00:10:54.420 --> 00:10:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

224
00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.510
<v Speaker 1>You think there's a real artist in math,</v>

225
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:57.000
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

226
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 1>The same artists that came up with a joke.</v>

227
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.310
<v Speaker 1>There's something about that that system,</v>

228
00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.130
<v Speaker 1>it's almost unmeasurable,</v>

229
00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.690
<v Speaker 1>dark and that would be trying to understand that.</v>

230
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Why is that exactly?</v>

231
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's a question.</v>

232
00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:13.170
<v Speaker 1>It's gone up vote.</v>

233
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>Although it's a question that people don't like to ask or answer,</v>

234
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.603
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

235
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.890
<v Speaker 1>in your country and Anaheim,</v>

236
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.233
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

237
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 1>we have this spectacle of the mass murder.</v>

238
00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>It's a competitive game that often young men played.</v>

239
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

240
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.230
<v Speaker 1>I call it a game for good reasons and competitive and for good reason that the</v>

241
00:11:36.391 --> 00:11:37.224
<v Speaker 1>mass members,</v>

242
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.130
<v Speaker 1>school shooters,</v>

243
00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>those sorts of people,</v>

244
00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.710
<v Speaker 1>they keep track of each other.</v>

245
00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 1>Now they try to up the ante.</v>

246
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:44.440
<v Speaker 1>Each tap,</v>

247
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.410
<v Speaker 1>the most egregious attacker is probably the one at Sandy Hook,</v>

248
00:11:49.411 --> 00:11:50.244
<v Speaker 1>I would say.</v>

249
00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Or the elementary school kids were killed because that brings up another level</v>

250
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:54.811
<v Speaker 1>of Mres,</v>

251
00:11:54.811 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

252
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:55.953
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

253
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.000
<v Speaker 1>why didn't you go after it?</v>

254
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:57.843
<v Speaker 1>You get this</v>

255
00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:04.170
<v Speaker 1>if you're all tour for her Revengeance why not punish the guilty and answer</v>

256
00:12:05.801 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

257
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Because it's more effective to punish the innocent because it's more of a</v>

258
00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:11.860
<v Speaker 1>violation.</v>

259
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a greater violation of good,</v>

260
00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:15.911
<v Speaker 1>let's say it,</v>

261
00:12:15.911 --> 00:12:17.240
<v Speaker 1>since it's a more evil laugh,</v>

262
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.850
<v Speaker 1>it's more vegetable active.</v>

263
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

264
00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:21.440
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most data sets this,</v>

265
00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:23.410
<v Speaker 1>it might be elementary school children,</v>

266
00:12:23.411 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 1>especially ones that you don't know.</v>

267
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:28.090
<v Speaker 1>And so the killer of the sandy hook killer,</v>

268
00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.550
<v Speaker 1>something like he had me think this through.</v>

269
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

270
00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 1>And that's another thing to consider.</v>

271
00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:37.880
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to the point where you do something like that on a win or to take</v>

272
00:12:37.881 --> 00:12:38.680
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

273
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.280
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

274
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:39.671
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

275
00:12:39.671 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 1>or even years of dark fantasizing before you get to that point.</v>

276
00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:45.200
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

277
00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 1>and you can go places that are hard to get imaginable.</v>

278
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.910
<v Speaker 1>When you allow yourself to be taken over by the kind of spirit that produces</v>

279
00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:55.060
<v Speaker 1>that kind of fantasy.</v>

280
00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:56.081
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

281
00:12:56.081 --> 00:13:01.081
<v Speaker 1>Then where do you go as a place where you think that bringing them a deadly</v>

282
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:06.331
<v Speaker 1>weapon into an elementary school and deliberately targeting innocent children is</v>

283
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:13.870
<v Speaker 1>actually up a goal that's reasonable to pursue.</v>
