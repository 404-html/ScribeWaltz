1
00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:03.793
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly the symbolism of the great side.</v>

3
00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 3>All hierarchy to,</v>

4
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.470
<v Speaker 3>to power.</v>

5
00:00:14.471 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

6
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.480
<v Speaker 3>And selfish power.</v>

7
00:00:16.481 --> 00:00:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 3>Is it is utterly naive.</v>

9
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.390
<v Speaker 3>It's ignorant,</v>

10
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

11
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.610
<v Speaker 3>So I say education has to be totally reconstituted it,</v>

12
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.550
<v Speaker 3>including public education to be getting the most distant path so that show our</v>

13
00:00:27.551 --> 00:00:30.040
<v Speaker 3>young people today who know nothing about how the,</v>

14
00:00:30.041 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 3>how the world was created that they inhabit.</v>

15
00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

16
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Because understand,</v>

17
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

18
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.360
<v Speaker 3>what marvelous paradise they live in.</v>

19
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 3>And it's the product of capitalism is the product we're probably going to</v>

20
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:42.100
<v Speaker 3>individual innovation is the most of,</v>

21
00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.810
<v Speaker 3>is the product of a,</v>

22
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 3>of a Western tradition that everyone wants to trash.</v>

23
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:45.880
<v Speaker 3>Now is there,</v>

24
00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.020
<v Speaker 3>if you'd be good in the past and show it off to talk about war and because the</v>

25
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 3>war is the one thing that wakes people up.</v>

26
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.241
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

27
00:00:52.241 --> 00:00:53.074
<v Speaker 3>As we see right?</v>

28
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.933
<v Speaker 2>Wars.</v>

29
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.620
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

30
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

31
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.491
<v Speaker 3>Wars.</v>

32
00:00:56.491 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 3>The reality principle.</v>

33
00:00:57.331 --> 00:00:57.691
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

34
00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.870
<v Speaker 3>I'm father and all five of my uncles went to World War II.</v>

35
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.210
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

36
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.780
<v Speaker 3>in my,</v>

37
00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.981
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

38
00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:03.700
<v Speaker 3>my father was w was part of the,</v>

39
00:01:03.701 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 3>the force that have landed in Japan.</v>

40
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

41
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.250
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

42
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

43
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

44
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.060
<v Speaker 3>it has him,</v>

45
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.950
<v Speaker 3>he was a paratrooper.</v>

46
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

47
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.971
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

48
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:09.131
<v Speaker 3>at the,</v>

49
00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:10.770
<v Speaker 3>at the time of the Japanese surrender.</v>

50
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.200
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

51
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

52
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

53
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.550
<v Speaker 3>and a couple of uncles got shot up and so on.</v>

54
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 3>When you have the reality of war,</v>

55
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 3>when people see the reality of the horrors of war,</v>

56
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 3>Berlin burned to a crisp and and so on or you,</v>

57
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:23.910
<v Speaker 3>your starvation.</v>

58
00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:24.360
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

59
00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.500
<v Speaker 3>Then you understand,</v>

60
00:01:25.501 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

61
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.020
<v Speaker 3>this is marvelous mechanism that brings water,</v>

62
00:01:28.021 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

63
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.700
<v Speaker 3>to the,</v>

64
00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.371
<v Speaker 3>to the kitchen.</v>

65
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 3>And when you do flip on a light late in the electricity,</v>

66
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 3>the electricity,</v>

67
00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 2>I know for me like I suppose it's because I have somewhat of a depressive</v>

68
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:36.831
<v Speaker 2>temperament.</v>

69
00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:37.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

70
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.840
<v Speaker 2>one thing that staggers me on a consistent basis is the fact that anything ever</v>

71
00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:42.674
<v Speaker 2>works.</v>

72
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.041
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

73
00:01:43.041 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 2>because it's so unlikely,</v>

74
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:44.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:01:44.691 --> 00:01:44.931
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

76
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:45.440
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

77
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.650
<v Speaker 2>to be in a situation where our electronic communications work,</v>

78
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 2>where our,</v>

79
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.430
<v Speaker 2>where our electric grid works and it works all the time.</v>

80
00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:52.581
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

81
00:01:52.581 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 2>It works 100% of the time.</v>

82
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 2>And the reason for that is that there are mostly men out there who are breaking</v>

83
00:01:58.791 --> 00:02:00.950
<v Speaker 2>themselves into pieces repairing this thing,</v>

84
00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 2>which just falls apart all the time.</v>

85
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.630
<v Speaker 2>I said this in the moment</v>

86
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 3>bait.</v>

87
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.221
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

88
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 3>In Toronto several years ago,</v>

89
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:07.561
<v Speaker 3>I said that,</v>

90
00:02:07.561 --> 00:02:07.720
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

91
00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.470
<v Speaker 3>this is the invisible at all these,</v>

92
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.900
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

93
00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>

94
00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.651
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

95
00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 3>and he's elitist professors,</v>

96
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.890
<v Speaker 3>snaring and men.</v>

97
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:17.250
<v Speaker 3>It's men who are maintaining everything around us or anything.</v>

98
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 3>This is an invisible army.</v>

99
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

100
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.470
<v Speaker 3>Which are you?</v>

101
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.880
<v Speaker 3>What your feminists don't notice,</v>

102
00:02:20.881 --> 00:02:21.330
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

103
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.163
<v Speaker 3>Nothing would work</v>

104
00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:23.870
<v Speaker 2>or regarded regardless.</v>

105
00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:24.621
<v Speaker 2>Impressive.</v>

106
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:25.280
<v Speaker 2>Which is,</v>

107
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

108
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 2>like a professor is someone who's standing on a hill surrounded by a wall,</v>

109
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:31.310
<v Speaker 2>which is surrounded by another wall,</v>

110
00:02:31.311 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 2>which is surrounded by another wall.</v>

111
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Like it's walls all the way down.</v>

112
00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.570
<v Speaker 2>Who stands up there and says,</v>

113
00:02:35.571 --> 00:02:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm brave and independent.</v>

114
00:02:37.011 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

115
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.670
<v Speaker 2>you've got this protected area that's so unlikely.</v>

116
00:02:40.671 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Speaker 2>It's so absolutely unlikely.</v>

117
00:02:42.321 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that people aren't on their knees in gratitude all the time for the</v>

118
00:02:46.251 --> 00:02:50.360
<v Speaker 2>fact that we have central heating and air conditioning and Ken pure water and</v>

119
00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:51.350
<v Speaker 2>reliable food,</v>

120
00:02:51.351 --> 00:02:52.070
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

121
00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 2>it's so,</v>

122
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:53.271
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

123
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.830
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely unbelievable.</v>

124
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 3>People used to die for,</v>

125
00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.760
<v Speaker 3>then the water supply was contaminated with,</v>

126
00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 3>for heaven's sakes.</v>

127
00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

128
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 3>People don't understand.</v>

129
00:03:01.151 --> 00:03:01.331
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

130
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:02.590
<v Speaker 3>Then I had clean water,</v>

131
00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 3>fresh milk,</v>

132
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 3>fresh orange juice,</v>

133
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.330
<v Speaker 3>all of these things.</v>

134
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.380
<v Speaker 3>There's a moral goals,</v>

135
00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.910
<v Speaker 3>the time,</v>

136
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:07.950
<v Speaker 3>all the time that,</v>

137
00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 3>that w western culture is,</v>

138
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.650
<v Speaker 3>is heading.</v>

139
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.850
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

140
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:11.081
<v Speaker 3>It can be,</v>

141
00:03:11.081 --> 00:03:12.680
<v Speaker 3>because we are so dependent on this,</v>

142
00:03:12.681 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 3>on this invisible infrastructure where a heading for an absolute catastrophe,</v>

143
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 3>when do hottest figure out how to paralyze the power grid.</v>

144
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.220
<v Speaker 3>The entire culture will be chaotic.</v>

145
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.020
<v Speaker 3>You'll have mobs in the street.</v>

146
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

147
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.760
<v Speaker 3>And within three days.</v>

148
00:03:27.761 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

149
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 3>Window.</v>

150
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 3>And so suddenly the food supplies interrupted and there's no link.</v>

151
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.100
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>

152
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 3>no way to communicate.</v>

153
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 3>There'll be like the Robert,</v>

154
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.370
<v Speaker 3>I mean that that is the way western culture is going to collapse.</v>

155
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

156
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.140
<v Speaker 3>And it won't take much.</v>

157
00:03:38.141 --> 00:03:39.070
<v Speaker 3>You'll just,</v>

158
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.030
<v Speaker 3>because we are so interconnected and now we are.</v>

159
00:03:43.031 --> 00:03:43.751
<v Speaker 3>So it's so,</v>

160
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.750
<v Speaker 3>it's so dependent on communications and computers into the,</v>

161
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

162
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

163
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.470
<v Speaker 3>I used to predict for years there'll be an asteroid hitting the earth and you</v>

164
00:03:51.471 --> 00:03:52.304
<v Speaker 3>have enough,</v>

165
00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.570
<v Speaker 2>the solar flares work.</v>

166
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.160
<v Speaker 2>So back in,</v>

167
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.020
<v Speaker 2>this happens about once every century.</v>

168
00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:01.170
<v Speaker 2>So back about 1880 and I don't remember the exact year,</v>

169
00:04:01.171 --> 00:04:03.540
<v Speaker 2>there was a significant enough solar flare,</v>

170
00:04:03.541 --> 00:04:07.440
<v Speaker 2>so that produces an electromagnetic pulse like a hydrogen bomb because the sun</v>

171
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:12.441
<v Speaker 2>is a hydrogen bomb and electromagnetic pulse will emerge from the sun and wave</v>

172
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:15.800
<v Speaker 2>across the earth and it produces huge spikes in electrical,</v>

173
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

174
00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 2>electrical current along anything that's electronic and he'll burn them out.</v>

175
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.880
<v Speaker 2>It led it lip telegraph operators on fire in the 18 hundreds and one of those</v>

176
00:04:23.881 --> 00:04:27.420
<v Speaker 2>things took out the Quebec power grid in 1985 and knocked out the whole</v>

177
00:04:27.421 --> 00:04:28.470
<v Speaker 2>northeast corridor.</v>

178
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.860
<v Speaker 2>And so they figured those things are about one in new century event.</v>

179
00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.023
<v Speaker 2>But those single,</v>

180
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I have my brother in law who's a very smart guy.</v>

181
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 2>He designed the chip in the iPhone.</v>

182
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:41.790
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about political issues the last time I went and saw him in San</v>

183
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.791
<v Speaker 2>Francisco.</v>

184
00:04:41.791 --> 00:04:45.670
<v Speaker 2>And his notion was that all that the government should be doing right now is</v>

185
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:49.080
<v Speaker 2>stress testing our infrastructure the same way they stress test the banks</v>

186
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 2>because we're so full of these single points of failure that,</v>

187
00:04:52.021 --> 00:04:53.340
<v Speaker 2>and I think you're absolutely right.</v>

188
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Luckily we've been,</v>

189
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.140
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

190
00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.070
<v Speaker 2>what would you call,</v>

191
00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:59.370
<v Speaker 2>invaded by stupid terrorists instead of smart terrorists?</v>

192
00:04:59.371 --> 00:05:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Because it's a smart terrorist could do an unbelievable amount of damage in a</v>

193
00:05:02.971 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 2>very short period of time.</v>

194
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.130
<v Speaker 2>So when it's just God's good graces that that hasn't happened yet.</v>

195
00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

196
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 3>and then what will happen is that if the men,</v>

197
00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:12.301
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

198
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:17.301
<v Speaker 3>the men will reconstruct civilization while the women cower in the houses.</v>

199
00:05:17.341 --> 00:05:19.440
<v Speaker 3>And I have the men go out and do all the dirty work.</v>

200
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.520
<v Speaker 3>That's what's going to happen again.</v>

201
00:05:20.521 --> 00:05:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Only men will,</v>

202
00:05:21.391 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 3>will bring civilization back again.</v>

203
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
