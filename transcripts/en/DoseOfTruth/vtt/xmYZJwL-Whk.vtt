00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 1>We don't from a statistical perspective that if you're intelligent.</v>

2
00:00:11.151 --> 00:00:12.320
<v Speaker 1>So if you have a high Iq,</v>

3
00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>which just some degrees matter of chance,</v>

4
00:00:14.031 --> 00:00:14.864
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.853
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

6
00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>unless you think you had some choice in picking your parents or if their entire</v>

7
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:21.260
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary history.</v>

8
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.341
<v Speaker 1>So if you're,</v>

9
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>if you have a high Iq and your conscientious,</v>

10
00:00:24.411 --> 00:00:25.460
<v Speaker 1>which is another trait,</v>

11
00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>then you're more likely to be financials financially successful,</v>

12
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.250
<v Speaker 1>say by the time you in middle age.</v>

13
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>And so that looks like a temperamental,</v>

14
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>too temperamental traits whose presence enables you to beat randomness over</v>

15
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:39.964
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

16
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.410
<v Speaker 1>But you could object to that and say,</v>

17
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:42.621
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

18
00:00:42.621 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 1>that happens to be true for this society at this point in time.</v>

19
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.430
<v Speaker 1>And that's probably true because I think imagine conscientious people store more</v>

20
00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:52.424
<v Speaker 1>value,</v>

21
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 1>they hoard more things well in a different society that would just make you a</v>

22
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>target for murder.</v>

23
00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.711
<v Speaker 1>So those,</v>

25
00:00:59.711 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 1>those traits work very well in this society at that,</v>

26
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.531
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>

27
00:01:02.531 --> 00:01:06.580
<v Speaker 1>But you could also argue that that's also a matter of chance because there</v>

28
00:01:06.581 --> 00:01:11.581
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't be unconscientious people if at some point in the past unconscientious</v>

29
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:13.690
<v Speaker 1>snus hadn't aided their survival.</v>

30
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.310
<v Speaker 1>So what constitutes beating a system depends on the parameters that you put</v>

32
00:01:20.311 --> 00:01:23.820
<v Speaker 1>around the system and you know that you can think the same thing about,</v>

33
00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.481
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

34
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>look at how successful he is.</v>

35
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.293
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

36
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>You mean financially?</v>

37
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.371
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

38
00:01:29.371 --> 00:01:30.090
<v Speaker 1>so then,</v>

39
00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:01:30.331 --> 00:01:31.200
<v Speaker 1>how's his health?</v>

41
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.490
<v Speaker 1>How was his marriage?</v>

42
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

43
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>his relationships with his children,</v>

44
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 1>what price did he pay for his wealth?</v>

45
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.471
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:38.304
<v Speaker 1>like as you,</v>

47
00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.520
<v Speaker 1>as you add dimensions of the valuation,</v>

48
00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Speaker 1>whether that particular person won or lost might not be so self evident.</v>
