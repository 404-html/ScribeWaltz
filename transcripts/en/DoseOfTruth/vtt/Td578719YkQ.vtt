1
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Just to stay with him for a moment.</v>

2
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>He's painted as the great defender of freedom.</v>

3
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>It's possible that your country,</v>

4
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:13.201
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

5
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:14.310
<v Speaker 1>and certainly my country,</v>

6
00:00:14.311 --> 00:00:19.311
<v Speaker 1>Australia would have not continued as free societies had it not been for that</v>

7
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:23.100
<v Speaker 1>man courageously standing at a time when so few did.</v>

8
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.791
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't.</v>

9
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:25.080
<v Speaker 1>The inventor of freedom.</v>

10
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.041
<v Speaker 1>Freedom is,</v>

11
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:29.160
<v Speaker 1>we understand it and I want to unpack that a bit.</v>

12
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.270
<v Speaker 1>Something very,</v>

13
00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>very few people in very few cultures down through the ages and even today I've</v>

14
00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.330
<v Speaker 1>ever really experienced.</v>

15
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh well,</v>

16
00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.900
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

17
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:38.141
<v Speaker 2>Ben.</v>

18
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:39.490
<v Speaker 2>Partly because we're afraid of it,</v>

19
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.691
<v Speaker 2>I would say.</v>

20
00:00:40.691 --> 00:00:41.524
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

21
00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 2>people think of freedom as the ability to implement your whim and freedom opens</v>

22
00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:50.080
<v Speaker 2>up that as a possibility,</v>

23
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.150
<v Speaker 2>but sustainable freedom,</v>

24
00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 2>that isn't what it's about at all.</v>

25
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.430
<v Speaker 2>It's about,</v>

26
00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.260
<v Speaker 2>it's primarily about responsibility.</v>

27
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.960
<v Speaker 2>It's about determining which load you're going to pick up and carry.</v>

28
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.600
<v Speaker 2>That's the proper definition of appropriate freedom.</v>

29
00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not grout DM gratification of instantaneous impulse.</v>

30
00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.010
<v Speaker 2>It's self evident that that doesn't work.</v>

31
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Two year olds do that and that's why they can't live in the world.</v>

32
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.230
<v Speaker 2>They can't organize themselves across time.</v>

33
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.030
<v Speaker 2>They can't sacrifice the moment for the future and the more sophisticated you</v>

34
00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:19.361
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

35
00:01:19.361 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 2>I suppose in some sense the more you're able to do that and then your freedom</v>

36
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 2>becomes the freedom to choose the proper responsibility.</v>

37
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's not,</v>

38
00:01:27.371 --> 00:01:30.370
<v Speaker 2>that's also not something that we've been good at communicating to young people.</v>

39
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.050
<v Speaker 2>If we talk to them about responsibility,</v>

40
00:01:32.051 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 2>we don't generally do it in a finger wagging sort of way.</v>

41
00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:35.141
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

42
00:01:35.141 --> 00:01:36.130
<v Speaker 2>well you're breaking the rules,</v>

43
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you're a bad person and,</v>

44
00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

45
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 2>and well that may be true because people break the rules and there's no shortage</v>

46
00:01:41.981 --> 00:01:43.210
<v Speaker 2>of badness in people.</v>

47
00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

48
00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.600
<v Speaker 2>the proper message for young people is to say,</v>

49
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:46.721
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

50
00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:46.931
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

51
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 2>you don't understand you,</v>

52
00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.560
<v Speaker 2>you want to take on responsibility,</v>

53
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.220
<v Speaker 2>you want to take on the heaviest load that you can conceive of that you might be</v>

54
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:58.840
<v Speaker 2>able to move because it gives your life nobility and purpose and that offsets</v>

55
00:01:58.841 --> 00:01:59.674
<v Speaker 2>the tragedy.</v>

56
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.060
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

57
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.270
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

58
00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.690
<v Speaker 2>and not only psychologically,</v>

59
00:02:01.691 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 2>not only does it offset it psychologically because you have a purpose and</v>

60
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.330
<v Speaker 2>something to wake up for,</v>

61
00:02:07.331 --> 00:02:07.571
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

62
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 2>And to face the difficulties of the day,</v>

63
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 2>but also because if you face the difficulties of the day properly,</v>

64
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 2>you actually ameliorate suffering not only in the psychological sense,</v>

65
00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:20.770
<v Speaker 2>but because you make the world at least a less terrible place.</v>

66
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.730
<v Speaker 2>And that's something,</v>

67
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.241
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

68
00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 2>To move things away from hell is something,</v>

69
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.930
<v Speaker 2>even if you're not,</v>

70
00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

71
00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:29.530
<v Speaker 2>self evidently moving forthrightly to heaven too,</v>

72
00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.800
<v Speaker 2>to move things away from the worst they can be as well.</v>

73
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:34.630
<v Speaker 2>That's a noble goal in and of itself.</v>

74
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.440
<v Speaker 2>So [inaudible] and young people are starving for that idea.</v>

75
00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.150
<v Speaker 2>It's very interesting to watch.</v>

76
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.673
<v Speaker 2>As I look at it</v>

77
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>seems to me that that acton had it right.</v>

78
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Freedom properly understood,</v>

79
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.030
<v Speaker 1>needs to be seen as a negative and as a positive.</v>

80
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:50.080
<v Speaker 1>The negatives is,</v>

81
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>is this sort of concept of freedom from fear,</v>

82
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:54.191
<v Speaker 1>addiction,</v>

83
00:02:54.191 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 1>persecution,</v>

84
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Karen tyranny,</v>

85
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:58.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

86
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>in a personal and then,</v>

87
00:03:00.101 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

88
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>freedom to be used to reach your potential.</v>

89
00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 1>But it seems to me that what's missing is an understanding that freedom exercise</v>

90
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.420
<v Speaker 1>within a framework of responsibility.</v>

91
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Are you doing what you ought?</v>

92
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.310
<v Speaker 1>We'll guarantee you ongoing freedom for yourself and fuel and neighbors freedom</v>

93
00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:23.311
<v Speaker 1>exercised in a way that confuses it with license tends to destroy freedom.</v>

94
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:24.401
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

95
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:29.350
<v Speaker 1>you could even go so far as to say that misunderstood freedom turns out to be</v>

96
00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.090
<v Speaker 1>its own worst enemy.</v>

97
00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>

98
00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Uh Huh.</v>

99
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.321
<v Speaker 2>Well that's,</v>

100
00:03:31.321 --> 00:03:31.780
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

101
00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.280
<v Speaker 2>that's the difficult distinction between freedom of the moment and,</v>

102
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.090
<v Speaker 2>and freedom of,</v>

103
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.923
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>

104
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.510
<v Speaker 2>the freedom with everything taken into account.</v>

105
00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 2>And I remember real admirer of the work of John Piaget.</v>

106
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Piaget is a developmental psychologist and few people know the world's most well</v>

107
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:51.540
<v Speaker 2>known developmental psychologists and few people know that he was actually</v>

108
00:03:51.541 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 2>motivated in his intellectual pursuits by the desire to reconcile science with</v>

109
00:03:55.651 --> 00:03:56.370
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

110
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 2>That was what his driving force from the time that he was a young man,</v>

111
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.280
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't know that even necessarily by reading his writings because it's</v>

112
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:04.110
<v Speaker 2>implicit rather than explicit in them.</v>

113
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.970
<v Speaker 2>But he,</v>

114
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.170
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

115
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.860
<v Speaker 2>he has a different model of what constitutes morality than,</v>

116
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.760
<v Speaker 2>than Freud.</v>

117
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.170
<v Speaker 2>Freud's model is combative.</v>

118
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.520
<v Speaker 2>It's sort of the superego as tyrant.</v>

119
00:04:15.521 --> 00:04:18.090
<v Speaker 2>So the superego would be the strictures of society,</v>

120
00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.253
<v Speaker 2>the ID,</v>

121
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.240
<v Speaker 2>the biological impulses.</v>

122
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.830
<v Speaker 2>And the eagle crushed between those.</v>

123
00:04:22.831 --> 00:04:23.041
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

124
00:04:23.041 --> 00:04:25.860
<v Speaker 2>So the ego is this thing that's crushed between nature and culture.</v>

125
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.090
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a really,</v>

126
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.410
<v Speaker 2>it's a tense and combative model of the Human Psyche and there's something about</v>

127
00:04:31.411 --> 00:04:31.910
<v Speaker 2>it that's,</v>

128
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.400
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

129
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.810
<v Speaker 2>that's accurate because some of the restrictions that are put on your impulse</v>

130
00:04:36.811 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 2>gratification are imposed on you in a,</v>

131
00:04:39.691 --> 00:04:39.921
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

132
00:04:39.921 --> 00:04:41.130
<v Speaker 2>in a sense to radically.</v>

133
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.530
<v Speaker 2>But Piaget's perspective was much more</v>

134
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 2>optimistic and I think much more accurate.</v>

135
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.810
<v Speaker 2>He noticed that as children organize themselves spontaneously as they developed,</v>

136
00:04:51.811 --> 00:04:54.840
<v Speaker 2>especially within the confines of their own spontaneous play,</v>

137
00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.620
<v Speaker 2>they didn't so much subsume art or inhibit their dark and aggressive impulses as</v>

138
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 2>make them sophisticated and transform them into universally acceptable games.</v>

139
00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.200
<v Speaker 2>So for Piaget,</v>

140
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.770
<v Speaker 2>a game that a group of children were playing,</v>

141
00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.270
<v Speaker 2>that all of them were playing voluntarily and that was going well and that they</v>

142
00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:22.650
<v Speaker 2>all wanted to continue playing was a microcosm of society and literally a</v>

143
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 2>microcosm of society.</v>

144
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.540
<v Speaker 2>The reason the children were playing those games was to practice being</v>

145
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 2>productive members of society.</v>

146
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.710
<v Speaker 2>And he felt that the appropriate game tended towards what he described as an</v>

147
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Nyquil abraded state.</v>

148
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.550
<v Speaker 2>So in acrylic graded state would be a game that you'll play because you've</v>

149
00:05:38.551 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 2>decided it's a good game,</v>

150
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.740
<v Speaker 2>but that you can play with others because they've also decided that it's a good</v>

151
00:05:43.741 --> 00:05:44.400
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>

152
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.180
<v Speaker 2>And so that can work at the individual level and at the familial level and at</v>

153
00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.080
<v Speaker 2>the social level.</v>

154
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.390
<v Speaker 2>And if you get all those things working simultaneously,</v>

155
00:05:51.391 --> 00:05:53.850
<v Speaker 2>then you have a sustainable enterprise.</v>

156
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.680
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

157
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.820
<v Speaker 2>it's predicated not so much on the,</v>

158
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.620
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>

159
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

160
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.010
<v Speaker 2>inhibition of impulse or on the regulation of it,</v>

161
00:06:01.011 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 2>but of the integration of impulses into a,</v>

162
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.460
<v Speaker 2>into a pattern of being that gratifies them on a relatively permanent basis.</v>

163
00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.731
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

164
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:11.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

165
00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 2>if you want to go to university and become a physician,</v>

166
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of sacrifice of impulsive gratification that goes along</v>

167
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>

168
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.060
<v Speaker 2>But if you become a physician,</v>

169
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 2>then it's a noble enterprise.</v>

170
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.820
<v Speaker 2>People support you socially and all of the needs that you need to have</v>

171
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:26.331
<v Speaker 2>fulfilled.</v>

172
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 2>We'll also be fulfilled by that enterprise.</v>

173
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.971
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

174
00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:30.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a way better model.</v>

175
00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 2>And so it's strange that the maximum freedom comes with the adoption of a</v>

176
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:39.080
<v Speaker 2>discipline and then also the adoption of responsibility that frees you up and</v>

177
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 2>everyone else around you in the long run.</v>

178
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:42.500
<v Speaker 2>And if you explain that to people,</v>

179
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:44.270
<v Speaker 2>especially in this day and age,</v>

180
00:06:44.271 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 2>when they'd be fed a never ending diet of idiot rights and freedoms,</v>

181
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.580
<v Speaker 2>they're immediately on board with it because they know and know that most of the</v>

182
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 2>meaning that people experience in their life as a consequence of adopting</v>

183
00:06:55.521 --> 00:06:56.354
<v Speaker 2>responsibility.</v>

184
00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 2>So they're starving for that.</v>

185
00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Our idea to be articulated.</v>
