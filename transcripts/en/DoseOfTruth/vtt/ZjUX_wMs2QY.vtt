00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.770
<v Speaker 1>You have to ask why it is that you would if you were a postmodernist yourself,</v>

2
00:00:12.771 --> 00:00:15.920
<v Speaker 1>why it is that you would privilege the idea of power above all else.</v>

3
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.710
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what is it that you're pushing to the margin,</v>

4
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.740
<v Speaker 1>and so that's something that we're going to talk about.</v>

5
00:00:21.741 --> 00:00:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

6
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>here's one thing you might push to the margin.</v>

7
00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:29.111
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you believe that hierarchies are a consequence of power.</v>

8
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.050
<v Speaker 1>Well then you push competence to the margin and then applying the postmodern</v>

9
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.720
<v Speaker 1>mark modernist logic.</v>

10
00:00:35.721 --> 00:00:36.410
<v Speaker 1>You might say,</v>

11
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.591
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

12
00:00:36.591 --> 00:00:40.490
<v Speaker 1>the reason you're privileging power is so that you can produce so that you could</v>

13
00:00:40.491 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 1>push competence to the margin,</v>

14
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.380
<v Speaker 1>and so you want to keep that in mind too,</v>

15
00:00:45.381 --> 00:00:47.000
<v Speaker 1>because that's going to become important.</v>

16
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>As we discussed the relationship between postmodernism and Marxism,</v>

17
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.930
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're after the destruction of the idea of competence itself.</v>
