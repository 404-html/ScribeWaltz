1
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.400
<v Speaker 1>So now we've also spent a lot of time selecting entrepreneurs.</v>

2
00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:15.401
<v Speaker 1>I work with this company in California that has started schools for</v>

3
00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:19.670
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs in a 100 and now I think 160 different countries all over the</v>

4
00:00:19.671 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.590
<v Speaker 1>This the guy who started this,</v>

6
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.210
<v Speaker 1>whose name is a Dale ressies,</v>

7
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:23.810
<v Speaker 1>it real,</v>

8
00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>it's an absolute monster.</v>

9
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:29.900
<v Speaker 1>The guy started while all he started all those six schools in five years,</v>

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 1>165 schools,</v>

11
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 1>you know in all all across the world,</v>

12
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>eight different languages and we've been screening people for entrepreneurial</v>

13
00:00:37.011 --> 00:00:39.140
<v Speaker 1>ability and if you're going to be an entrepreneur,</v>

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.180
<v Speaker 1>you almost have the opposite profile.</v>

15
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.073
<v Speaker 1>As a soldier,</v>

16
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.340
<v Speaker 1>you're very high in openness and you're lower in conscientiousness or at least</v>

17
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is irrelevant.</v>

18
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that seems to be that like if you're an orderly person and</v>

19
00:00:51.801 --> 00:00:53.900
<v Speaker 1>you'd like to follow up procedures and rules,</v>

20
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of hard for you to start a company because when you first start a</v>

21
00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:59.810
<v Speaker 1>company or engage in any other creative process,</v>

22
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>because entrepreneurs turned out to be the same as artists,</v>

23
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.190
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to,</v>

24
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 1>you're not operating within a rural governance structure.</v>

25
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.671
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

26
00:01:07.671 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>there may be many times where you have to break a small rule to,</v>

27
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.300
<v Speaker 1>to move properly at a higher level of analysis.</v>

28
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.560
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

29
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>there's no algorithmic way of generating a new company,</v>

30
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

31
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.813
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>

32
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.520
<v Speaker 1>And so it's people who are very high in openness,</v>

33
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>who happened to be good entrepreneurs.</v>

34
00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.440
<v Speaker 1>And so they just,</v>

35
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>something I thought was extraordinarily cool because we'd,</v>

36
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.510
<v Speaker 1>we'd also already known what predicts managerial administrative and academic</v>

37
00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>ability and Iq is crucial for any complex jobs.</v>

38
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:37.910
<v Speaker 1>So we'll just leave that behind.</v>

39
00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 1>But what predicts academic ability,</v>

40
00:01:39.801 --> 00:01:43.940
<v Speaker 1>for example at the University of Toronto is an intelligence obviously,</v>

41
00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>but also conscientiousness.</v>

42
00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>The correlation between creativity and grades at the UFT is zero.</v>

43
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.043
<v Speaker 1>Zero.</v>

44
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

45
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.671
<v Speaker 1>But it's not,</v>

46
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:54.810
<v Speaker 1>it's not surprising that the thing is that,</v>

47
00:01:54.811 --> 00:01:54.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

48
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:56.420
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to be cynical about that.</v>

49
00:01:56.421 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>But one of the things you have to understand about creative people is that they</v>

50
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.490
<v Speaker 1>continually step outside of the domain of evaluation structures.</v>

51
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.061
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

52
00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:09.650
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you're going to say you're going to evaluate a hundred performance of a</v>

53
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:11.450
<v Speaker 1>hundred professors on their lecturing ability,</v>

54
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>well you kind of have to measure what's common across all the professors in</v>

55
00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.320
<v Speaker 1>order to come up with the standards for evaluation.</v>

56
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.430
<v Speaker 1>Well that means you're not going to be able to use that structure to evaluate a</v>

57
00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:26.810
<v Speaker 1>particularly creative professor because he or she is going to do something in a</v>

58
00:02:26.811 --> 00:02:30.260
<v Speaker 1>way that's so different that it won't show up on the evaluation measure.</v>

59
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.600
<v Speaker 1>And of course that's what happens in universities.</v>

60
00:02:32.601 --> 00:02:33.434
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.010
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

62
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.350
<v Speaker 1>somebody sent me a couple of days ago,</v>

63
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.130
<v Speaker 1>somebody sent me an essay that they had written for their master's thesis that</v>

64
00:02:40.131 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>was wildly creative and they were basically told to leave the program and that</v>

65
00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:45.794
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't continue.</v>

66
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.640
<v Speaker 1>Not in a mean way.</v>

67
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:47.000
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

68
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:02:47.181 --> 00:02:49.370
<v Speaker 1>what happened was that what they were thinking was,</v>

70
00:02:49.371 --> 00:02:53.870
<v Speaker 1>so outside of the conventions in the discipline is that no one had any idea what</v>

71
00:02:53.871 --> 00:02:54.860
<v Speaker 1>to do with the essay.</v>

72
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.851
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

73
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>and then that's really the law of creative people,</v>

74
00:02:57.981 --> 00:02:58.161
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>They're always stepping of evaluation structures and so it's not that surprising</v>

76
00:03:02.831 --> 00:03:07.180
<v Speaker 1>that the relationship between creativity and grades at the u of t is zero.</v>

77
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.320
<v Speaker 1>We found out as well by looking at graduate student performance across multiple</v>

78
00:03:11.321 --> 00:03:12.154
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

79
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Speaker 1>that there was a negative correlation between creativity and graduate school</v>

80
00:03:16.001 --> 00:03:16.834
<v Speaker 1>performance.</v>

81
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't even zero.</v>

82
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>It was worse than negative.</v>

83
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>Being creative was negative and you think,</v>

84
00:03:22.751 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>well that could make you cynical as well,</v>

85
00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

86
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>but you can't be cynical in that way because one of the things that happens in</v>

87
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:35.101
<v Speaker 1>science is that science tends to progress incrementally rather than in great</v>

88
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:39.510
<v Speaker 1>leaps now and then someone comes along who blows the structure out of a science</v>

89
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>advances it ridiculously like Einstein.</v>

90
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:43.570
<v Speaker 1>But like most people are,</v>

91
00:03:43.571 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>nine Stein had may be thank God for that.</v>

92
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time you're in a discipline,</v>

93
00:03:48.521 --> 00:03:48.760
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

94
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 1>you understand the discipline,</v>

95
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.440
<v Speaker 1>and then once you've developed understanding of the discipline,</v>

96
00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>you know what the next micro question is that should be answered.</v>

97
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 1>And part of the reason that science is so powerful is because it allows people</v>

98
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:06.220
<v Speaker 1>who aren't genius level creatives to make real advances in the generation of</v>

99
00:04:06.221 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>knowledge.</v>

100
00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.160
<v Speaker 1>One tiny micro step at a time.</v>

101
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if there's 100,000 people doing it and each of them is making</v>

102
00:04:13.901 --> 00:04:14.621
<v Speaker 1>a micro step.</v>

103
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:14.861
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

104
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>we're zipping along as fast as we possibly want to zip along.</v>

105
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.990
<v Speaker 1>And so it turns out to be conscientiousness.</v>

106
00:04:19.991 --> 00:04:22.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the excellent predictor of graduate student performance.</v>

107
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.400
<v Speaker 1>That's the best predictor for law.</v>

108
00:04:24.401 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 1>It's the best predictor for managerial positions.</v>

109
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>It's the best predictor for administrative positions.</v>

110
00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Anything that has a structure of rules that needs to be applied,</v>

111
00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 1>conscientiousness is a great predictor.</v>

112
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.861
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

113
00:04:35.861 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's not good for predicting artistic ability or entrepreneurial ability.</v>

114
00:04:39.431 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And that's also really important because one of the things,</v>

115
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>this is partly why bureaucracies stultify,</v>

116
00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.581
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

117
00:04:45.581 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Because what happens is they,</v>

118
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.591
<v Speaker 1>as they develop,</v>

119
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:51.250
<v Speaker 1>they get chock full of conscientious people with a few psychopaths thrown in</v>

120
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>there just for good measure that get chocked full of,</v>

121
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>of conscientious people busily zooming efficiently down to single track.</v>

122
00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And then all of a sudden the landscape shifts and they're going very,</v>

123
00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:05.350
<v Speaker 1>very efficiently in exactly the wrong direction.</v>

124
00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:07.150
<v Speaker 1>And then the whole bloody thing falls apart.</v>

125
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 1>So you need to have some creative wing nuts in your organization to come up with</v>

126
00:05:12.731 --> 00:05:16.660
<v Speaker 1>completely absurd ideas that might just on the off chance be true.</v>

127
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>And so creativity is strange in that manner too because it's a high risk,</v>

128
00:05:21.341 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 1>high return game.</v>

129
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.510
<v Speaker 1>You're a lot safer in your life to find a functioning entity and to operate as a</v>

130
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>cog within it as long as the entity keeps functioning.</v>

131
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Because if you're creative and you go off on tangents all the time,</v>

132
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>there's some probability that one of those tangents is going to be exactly what</v>

133
00:05:39.191 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>is needed at the time and you're going to become hyper successful as a</v>

134
00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:42.964
<v Speaker 1>consequence.</v>

135
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.120
<v Speaker 1>But there's much more probability that even though your,</v>

136
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>some of your ideas might be highly valuable,</v>

137
00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.270
<v Speaker 1>the probability that this is the right time and place for them is</v>

138
00:05:52.271 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>extraordinarily low.</v>

139
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.350
<v Speaker 1>So to produce a successful creative product,</v>

140
00:05:56.351 --> 00:05:56.891
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

141
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:57.800
<v Speaker 1>in the marketplace,</v>

142
00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:02.810
<v Speaker 1>you need a ridiculous combination of creativity so that you keep generating</v>

143
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:07.811
<v Speaker 1>ideas and then a network around you of people who have skills that you don't,</v>

144
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.280
<v Speaker 1>and then the production of a,</v>

145
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>of a product,</v>

146
00:06:11.781 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 1>let's say whatever that happens to be,</v>

147
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:18.340
<v Speaker 1>that's actually in demand by the marketplace at exactly that moment and that</v>

148
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:20.450
<v Speaker 1>someone else hasn't already done better.</v>

149
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.840
<v Speaker 1>So the sensible thing to tell anybody who wants to be creative is that stupid.</v>

150
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:27.471
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't do it.</v>

151
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:27.661
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

152
00:06:27.661 --> 00:06:32.661
<v Speaker 1>it's your probability of success is so low that it's better just to do something</v>

153
00:06:33.081 --> 00:06:33.710
<v Speaker 1>sensible.</v>

154
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>But the problem with that is that creative people can't do that because they're</v>

155
00:06:37.311 --> 00:06:40.130
<v Speaker 1>creative and if they shut down their creativity,</v>

156
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.290
<v Speaker 1>it's like an extrovert who's gone to live in a,</v>

157
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>in an isolated cell,</v>

159
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.520
<v Speaker 1>a creative person who isn't being creative,</v>

160
00:06:46.521 --> 00:06:47.354
<v Speaker 1>they just,</v>

161
00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.890
<v Speaker 1>they just wither and die.</v>

162
00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 1>So they're stuck with it.</v>

163
00:06:50.301 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

164
00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.280
<v Speaker 1>but it is a high risk,</v>

165
00:06:52.281 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 1>high return strategy.</v>

166
00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 1>So probably better if you want to be creative or if you are,</v>

167
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.680
<v Speaker 1>and you should take this advice to heart because I'd been watching people for a</v>

168
00:07:00.681 --> 00:07:01.514
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

169
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>If you want to engage in a creative pursuit,</v>

170
00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:09.430
<v Speaker 1>you should find something stable to do that will generate you an income and you</v>

171
00:07:09.771 --> 00:07:12.530
<v Speaker 1>should pursue the thing that you're creative about on the side.</v>

172
00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:17.420
<v Speaker 1>Because monetizing creative production is so bloody difficult that especially</v>

173
00:07:17.421 --> 00:07:20.060
<v Speaker 1>now like especially in like artistic domains,</v>

174
00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.890
<v Speaker 1>generation of music and that sort of thing.</v>

175
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:26.891
<v Speaker 1>It's like you just have no idea how many million songs there are on the Internet</v>

176
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:32.650
<v Speaker 1>and the vast majority of the commercially available get downloaded zero times,</v>

177
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:34.011
<v Speaker 1>like 80 PR,</v>

178
00:07:34.011 --> 00:07:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I think there's 80 million songs or something like that on the net and I believe</v>

179
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.590
<v Speaker 1>it's something in the neighborhood of 70 million get downloaded zero times and</v>

180
00:07:42.591 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 1>then there's 100 that can get downloaded like 350 million times.</v>

181
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.870
<v Speaker 1>And so those people are wildly successful and everyone else collapses in</v>

182
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:51.440
<v Speaker 1>failure.</v>

183
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:52.273
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

184
00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.483
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

185
00:07:55.730 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>we'll talk about that more.</v>

186
00:07:57.170 --> 00:07:57.441
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:59.090
<v Speaker 1>So that's not a bad overview for,</v>

188
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.270
<v Speaker 1>for initial foray into psychometrics.</v>
