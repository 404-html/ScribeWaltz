1
00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:06.941
<v Speaker 1>Adam and eve,</v>

2
00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:07.121
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3
00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.040
<v Speaker 1>The mother and father of all humanity.</v>

4
00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:12.850
<v Speaker 1>So you could give them a nephrological slat and you can say Adam is cultured.</v>

5
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Say and Eve is nature because they're the archetipal parents.</v>

6
00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>It's a perfectly reasonable interpretation.</v>

7
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.590
<v Speaker 1>They have twin sons,</v>

8
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Cain and Abel.</v>

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.480
<v Speaker 1>So let's read first born creatures,</v>

10
00:00:25.481 --> 00:00:29.140
<v Speaker 1>first born human creatures in the new self conscious world.</v>

11
00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.150
<v Speaker 1>So what are the first two individuals in the new self conscious world like?</v>

12
00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.590
<v Speaker 1>And let's find out.</v>

13
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.790
<v Speaker 1>And Adam knew eve,</v>

14
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:37.624
<v Speaker 1>his wife,</v>

15
00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>and she conceived and Bare Cain and said,</v>

16
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.590
<v Speaker 1>I have gotten a man from the Lord.</v>

17
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.671
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

18
00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.110
<v Speaker 1>she bare his brother Abel,</v>

19
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.140
<v Speaker 1>the younger brother and Abel was a keeper of sheep.</v>

20
00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 1>But Cain was a tiller of the ground.</v>

21
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 1>And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the</v>

22
00:00:53.111 --> 00:00:53.381
<v Speaker 1>ground,</v>

23
00:00:53.381 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>an offering unto the Lord.</v>

24
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

25
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.760
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to remove this from,</v>

26
00:00:57.761 --> 00:00:58.594
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

27
00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.690
<v Speaker 1>his story from its entrapment in a particular temporal domain within a 10 or</v>

28
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:06.250
<v Speaker 1>culture when to say something like this.</v>

29
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.230
<v Speaker 1>if you work,</v>

31
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>you make sacrifices,</v>

32
00:01:09.881 --> 00:01:10.450
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 1>That's what works all about.</v>

34
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.700
<v Speaker 1>And the reason you make sacrifices is because you're offering up to the unknown,</v>

35
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>the fruits of your labor in the hope that as a consequence of your diligent</v>

36
00:01:19.751 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 1>effort,</v>

37
00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.700
<v Speaker 1>you're going to be favored,</v>

38
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:21.911
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

39
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:22.481
<v Speaker 1>Because otherwise,</v>

40
00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 1>why work?</v>

41
00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 1>The point of working is to transform the transcendent into something benevolent.</v>

42
00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.260
<v Speaker 1>So you work and you work and you work and you say,</v>

43
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>is that sufficient?</v>

44
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:34.240
<v Speaker 1>And the answer you get from the transcendent is the answer.</v>

45
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.291
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

46
00:01:35.291 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly true that lots of people work.</v>

47
00:01:37.401 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't go all that well,</v>

48
00:01:38.891 --> 00:01:39.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 1>They make sacrifices and they do what they think they have to do in their life</v>

50
00:01:43.871 --> 00:01:46.210
<v Speaker 1>is one string of catastrophes after another,</v>

51
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

52
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>So we have this situation in the process of time,</v>

53
00:01:49.451 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground,</v>

54
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 1>an offering unto the Lord and Abel.</v>

55
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.690
<v Speaker 1>He also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof.</v>

56
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 1>And the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering.</v>

57
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:03.850
<v Speaker 1>So what that means is that Oh,</v>

58
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>they able working away,</v>

59
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.611
<v Speaker 1>Bam,</v>

60
00:02:05.611 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>things are going great for him,</v>

61
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:07.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

62
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:08.290
<v Speaker 1>Fortune smiles on him.</v>

63
00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>He's doing wonderfully.</v>

64
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>He's got everything he needs.</v>

65
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.731
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:13.301
<v Speaker 1>old cane,</v>

67
00:02:13.301 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>he's scrounging away in the ground and things aren't going as well for him at</v>

68
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:17.021
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

69
00:02:17.021 --> 00:02:17.321
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

70
00:02:17.321 --> 00:02:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Plagues locusts,</v>

71
00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:19.294
<v Speaker 1>you name it.</v>

72
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>Farm life isn't going well.</v>

73
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.820
<v Speaker 1>So what happens?</v>

74
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.611
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

75
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:29.320
<v Speaker 1>Cain was very wroth and his countenance fell precisely,</v>

76
00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.681
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

77
00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:34.681
<v Speaker 1>Because if you work diligently towards a certain end and you don't get there,</v>

78
00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Speaker 1>then you're continents fell.</v>

79
00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:37.511
<v Speaker 1>Falls,</v>

80
00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:37.751
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

81
00:02:37.751 --> 00:02:38.351
<v Speaker 1>You're angry,</v>

82
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:38.951
<v Speaker 1>frustrated,</v>

83
00:02:38.951 --> 00:02:39.551
<v Speaker 1>disappointed,</v>

84
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:39.881
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>

85
00:02:39.881 --> 00:02:40.451
<v Speaker 1>anxious,</v>

86
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 1>threatened,</v>

87
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.651
<v Speaker 1>ashamed,</v>

88
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:42.430
<v Speaker 1>guilty.</v>

89
00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.620
<v Speaker 1>The whole panoply of negative emotions.</v>

90
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's fair enough because of course if you fail,</v>

91
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.300
<v Speaker 1>that's sweats going to be the consequence.</v>

92
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 1>But then there's this little twist on it,</v>

93
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:51.311
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

94
00:02:51.311 --> 00:02:53.450
<v Speaker 1>This specifically human twist it.</v>

95
00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like that kind of moral of the whole story.</v>

96
00:02:56.141 --> 00:02:59.110
<v Speaker 1>And so you find the Lord saying,</v>

97
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>

98
00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.891
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

99
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.371
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

100
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>what's up with you?</v>

101
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.250
<v Speaker 1>Why are you so unhappy?</v>

102
00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>If you just got your act together,</v>

103
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.300
<v Speaker 1>then you'd be accepted if you really got your act together,</v>

104
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>which is a statement,</v>

105
00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

106
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Speaker 1>If you keep making sacrifices and the same terrible thing keeps happening,</v>

107
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 1>there's always the possibility that you're just actually not doing it the right</v>

108
00:03:22.811 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

109
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.570
<v Speaker 1>And if you just get yourself straightened up,</v>

110
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.500
<v Speaker 1>tap together,</v>

111
00:03:26.501 --> 00:03:26.831
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>And drop the preconceptions that you don't really need and adjust your behavior</v>

113
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:31.601
<v Speaker 1>accordingly.</v>

114
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:33.610
<v Speaker 1>Then fortune would smile on you.</v>

115
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>And that's exactly what the Lord says to Cain,</v>

116
00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:36.934
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

117
00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't walk around with such a crabby look on your face.</v>

118
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.171
<v Speaker 1>If you did well,</v>

119
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you'll be accepted.</v>

120
00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:43.390
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't do well,</v>

121
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.250
<v Speaker 1>sin lies at the door.</v>

122
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

123
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:46.391
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:50.260
<v Speaker 1>this is a deep motif in ancient Hebrew thinking.</v>

125
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>If the world isn't laying itself out in a manner that you find acceptable,</v>

126
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.130
<v Speaker 1>you're faced with a tough choice.</v>

127
00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Either the world is a terrible place bent on your destruction,</v>

128
00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.330
<v Speaker 1>or you're doing something wrong and it bloody well better be that you're doing</v>

129
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:07.174
<v Speaker 1>something wrong.</v>

130
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Because if the world is a terrible place bent on your destruction,</v>

131
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.520
<v Speaker 1>you've got absolutely no hope.</v>

132
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.690
<v Speaker 1>And Kate and talk with Abel,</v>

133
00:04:17.691 --> 00:04:18.470
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>

134
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.670
<v Speaker 1>and it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel,</v>

135
00:04:22.671 --> 00:04:23.450
<v Speaker 1>his brother,</v>

136
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.283
<v Speaker 1>and killed him.</v>

137
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.730
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

138
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

139
00:04:26.361 --> 00:04:27.194
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty easy.</v>

140
00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:28.310
<v Speaker 1>It's simple.</v>

141
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.640
<v Speaker 1>It means this will say things aren't going that well for you.</v>

142
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.530
<v Speaker 1>And it's really not because life's unfair and everything's stacked against you.</v>

143
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:38.690
<v Speaker 1>It's because you're kind of a arrogant,</v>

144
00:04:38.691 --> 00:04:39.441
<v Speaker 1>stubborn,</v>

145
00:04:39.441 --> 00:04:41.150
<v Speaker 1>because I totalitarian,</v>

146
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.830
<v Speaker 1>cowardly idiot.</v>

147
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.900
<v Speaker 1>And as a consequence of that,</v>

148
00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:48.380
<v Speaker 1>the world is turning into something resembling a wasteland around you and you</v>

149
00:04:48.381 --> 00:04:50.240
<v Speaker 1>have this option change.</v>

150
00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

151
00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Or continue.</v>

152
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 1>Or You have another option,</v>

153
00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.823
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

154
00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:57.663
<v Speaker 1>look around.</v>

155
00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.470
<v Speaker 1>There's all those people doing well.</v>

156
00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>The world's a terrible place bans on my destruction.</v>

157
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be just the most interesting thing?</v>

158
00:05:05.171 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>If as things are going to hell for me,</v>

159
00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>I could take along just for the ride.</v>

160
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.420
<v Speaker 1>Some of those successful people who are successful just for unfair reasons</v>

161
00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.691
<v Speaker 1>anyways,</v>

162
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

163
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:21.490
<v Speaker 1>So instead of using all that negative emotion has a cue that there's something</v>

164
00:05:21.491 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 1>about me that might need to be transformed.</v>

165
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.341
<v Speaker 1>I can say,</v>

166
00:05:24.341 --> 00:05:25.174
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

167
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

168
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.790
<v Speaker 1>why not just eradicate the target of my resentment,</v>

169
00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:31.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

170
00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Not only because that sort of removes the problem of comparison,</v>

171
00:05:34.211 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>but more profoundly.</v>

172
00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:37.630
<v Speaker 1>And I think sort of again,</v>

173
00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:39.820
<v Speaker 1>eliminate honestly profoundly.</v>

174
00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you make the decision that the world's a terrible place and it's on</v>

175
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.244
<v Speaker 1>your destruction,</v>

176
00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.061
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

177
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:46.211
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

178
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 1>what's the logical response to that?</v>

179
00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 1>And then you think something like this.</v>

180
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.083
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Girtha foes,</v>

182
00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 1>Mephistopheles Credo.</v>

183
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>This spirit I that endlessly denies and rightly too,</v>

184
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.270
<v Speaker 1>for all that comes to birth is fit for overthrow as nothing worth wherefore the</v>

185
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

186
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>we're better sterilized.</v>

187
00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>Thus all that's here is evil.</v>

188
00:06:19.791 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Recognized is gained to me and downfall,</v>

189
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.650
<v Speaker 1>rune and sin,</v>

190
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 1>the very element I prosper in</v>

191
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:28.793
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

192
00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.750
<v Speaker 1>girth draws our attention to this credo.</v>

193
00:06:31.751 --> 00:06:32.261
<v Speaker 1>Not once,</v>

194
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>but twice in his writing a file.</v>

195
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Austin has Mephistopheles say right once again,</v>

196
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.750
<v Speaker 1>go on to share.</v>

197
00:06:40.751 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Nothing passed with no made one.</v>

198
00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.041
<v Speaker 1>What matters?</v>

199
00:06:45.041 --> 00:06:45.761
<v Speaker 1>Our creative,</v>

200
00:06:45.761 --> 00:06:46.571
<v Speaker 1>endless toil.</v>

201
00:06:46.571 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 1>When add a snapchat,</v>

202
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:48.940
<v Speaker 1>oblivion ends the coil,</v>

203
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:50.590
<v Speaker 1>it is by gone.</v>

204
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll show this riddle run as good as if things never had begun yet.</v>

205
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:57.280
<v Speaker 1>Circle back existence to possess.</v>

206
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:59.500
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather have eternal emptiness.</v>

207
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.350
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think about cane,</v>

208
00:07:02.351 --> 00:07:05.740
<v Speaker 1>like figures like Stella and you think,</v>

209
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:08.080
<v Speaker 1>well what exactly was he motivated by?</v>

210
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:09.070
<v Speaker 1>And on the one hand you think,</v>

211
00:07:09.071 --> 00:07:09.460
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

212
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.830
<v Speaker 1>he was trying to extend his cultural dominion,</v>

213
00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:12.310
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

214
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.100
<v Speaker 1>Played by his own self conscious neuroticism.</v>

215
00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.380
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to extend the,</v>

216
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:18.903
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

217
00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.540
<v Speaker 1>the borders of his totalitarian certainty to every corner just to not be plagued</v>

218
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:27.160
<v Speaker 1>by the unknown.</v>

219
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.941
<v Speaker 1>And you think,</v>

220
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:28.541
<v Speaker 1>fair enough.</v>

221
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:28.841
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

222
00:07:28.841 --> 00:07:31.810
<v Speaker 1>like we're all pretty nervous and a little stability is a good thing.</v>

223
00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.913
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

224
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Because they make a fundamental judgment,</v>

225
00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.990
<v Speaker 1>which is the judgment of Mephistopheles.</v>

226
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:39.213
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

227
00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.650
<v Speaker 1>life is terrible,</v>

228
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.693
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

229
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:45.370
<v Speaker 1>terrible were self conscious.</v>

230
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:46.570
<v Speaker 1>We get sick,</v>

231
00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:47.620
<v Speaker 1>we go insane.</v>

232
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:48.543
<v Speaker 1>We're going to die.</v>

233
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Children,</v>

234
00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:52.270
<v Speaker 1>innocent children suffer everywhere.</v>

235
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.540
<v Speaker 1>How in the world is it right to let such a state continue?</v>

236
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it would be better.</v>

237
00:08:00.101 --> 00:08:04.390
<v Speaker 1>All things considered just to bring the whole game to an end.</v>

238
00:08:04.870 --> 00:08:09.870
<v Speaker 1>And so then you think again with Haley Adda that the reason that human societies</v>

239
00:08:10.631 --> 00:08:12.130
<v Speaker 1>fall apart is twofold.</v>

240
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.270
<v Speaker 1>One is things go from bad to worse of their own accord,</v>

241
00:08:16.271 --> 00:08:16.601
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

242
00:08:16.601 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Thermodynamic reality,</v>

243
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:19.540
<v Speaker 1>pure entropy,</v>

244
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:23.560
<v Speaker 1>structured entities decay.</v>

245
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:25.180
<v Speaker 1>But then there's a twist.</v>

246
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Structured entities constructed by humans are sped in their process of decay by</v>

247
00:08:32.231 --> 00:08:35.470
<v Speaker 1>the participants of the individuals within that society.</v>

248
00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:40.770
<v Speaker 1>Who have essentially decided that the game is not worth the price and that under</v>

249
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:43.480
<v Speaker 1>such conditions,</v>

250
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:47.020
<v Speaker 1>the only reasonable thing for a self conscious,</v>

251
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.140
<v Speaker 1>painfully self conscious individual to do is to work as hard as he or she</v>

252
00:08:52.301 --> 00:08:57.301
<v Speaker 1>possibly can to take the maximum amount of revenge on the conditions of</v>

253
00:08:57.431 --> 00:09:01.780
<v Speaker 1>existence and to ensure that the entire game folds up,</v>

254
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.730
<v Speaker 1>the consciousness disappears,</v>

255
00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>and the being is eradicated.</v>
