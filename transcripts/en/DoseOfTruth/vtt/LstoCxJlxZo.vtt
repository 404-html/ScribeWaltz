1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.220
<v Speaker 1>We know that the snake is</v>

2
00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.220
<v Speaker 1>utilized conceptually and metaphorically as representation of transformation,</v>

3
00:00:07.221 --> 00:00:07.491
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

4
00:00:07.491 --> 00:00:11.630
<v Speaker 1>because the snake is something that can shed its skin and be reborn.</v>

5
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>We know that a snake is something that's innately attractive and terrifying</v>

6
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>human beings and other primates so that if you come across a snake,</v>

7
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.790
<v Speaker 1>you're likely to be at least startled,</v>

8
00:00:22.791 --> 00:00:24.080
<v Speaker 1>if not horrified by it,</v>

9
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:28.820
<v Speaker 1>but also attracted to it in a way that is underneath your voluntary</v>

10
00:00:28.821 --> 00:00:29.481
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>

11
00:00:29.481 --> 00:00:29.691
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

12
00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Because snakes attract orienting reflex isn't they activate the systems</v>

13
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:36.980
<v Speaker 1>underneath your consciousness that actually govern the structure of that</v>

14
00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:37.814
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

15
00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.130
<v Speaker 1>We know that the snake can be well represented as well as internal chaos,</v>

16
00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:44.360
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this,</v>

17
00:00:44.361 --> 00:00:49.361
<v Speaker 1>imagine that it's not unreasonable for a self conscious mind searching for a</v>

18
00:00:50.211 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>mode of self representation to remark on the parallels between the structure of</v>

19
00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:57.140
<v Speaker 1>the snake and the spine and the brain.</v>

20
00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Given that a snake is essentially a spine with a brain and then imagine as well</v>

21
00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:05.540
<v Speaker 1>that the most archaic aspects of our nervous system,</v>

22
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.340
<v Speaker 1>those that govern novelty and orienting and anxiety responses are in fact</v>

23
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:15.341
<v Speaker 1>precisely those that were described by Mclean as nested inside the reptilian</v>

24
00:01:15.921 --> 00:01:18.910
<v Speaker 1>brain and then imagine along with the Hindu Yogis,</v>

25
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.360
<v Speaker 1>that the purpose of Kundalini Yoga is to activate the circuitry that's</v>

26
00:01:23.361 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>associated with that snake,</v>

27
00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:25.634
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

28
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.810
<v Speaker 1>to produce a permanent state of alert wakefulness.</v>

29
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>It's associated with consciousness,</v>

30
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.420
<v Speaker 1>so imagine this.</v>

31
00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:42.421
<v Speaker 1>Imagine an animal like like a zebra grazing mindlessly in the herd with no</v>

32
00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:45.340
<v Speaker 1>consciousness whatsoever,</v>

33
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.400
<v Speaker 1>and then imagine it's relatively undeveloped cortical structures activated</v>

34
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:55.471
<v Speaker 1>suddenly by the movement of a lion off in the perimeter and then imagine for</v>

35
00:01:55.841 --> 00:01:59.830
<v Speaker 1>that brief moment the thought Zebra is actually conscious state.</v>

36
00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:02.710
<v Speaker 1>That requires a tremendous amount of energy and difficult to maintain,</v>

37
00:02:02.711 --> 00:02:07.711
<v Speaker 1>but because the threat and the uncertainty manifest itself within the zebras</v>

38
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.180
<v Speaker 1>mode of consciousness,</v>

39
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.650
<v Speaker 1>it wakes momentarily.</v>

40
00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.380
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine that human beings are like that.</v>

41
00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:19.381
<v Speaker 1>Zebra always because we've become self conscious because we know that the</v>

42
00:02:20.111 --> 00:02:21.910
<v Speaker 1>unknown is around us all the time.</v>

43
00:02:21.911 --> 00:02:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Even when we think we're safe,</v>

44
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.850
<v Speaker 1>we're never safe.</v>

45
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that the reason we're so conscious is because as a consequence of our</v>

46
00:02:29.081 --> 00:02:29.711
<v Speaker 1>discovery,</v>

47
00:02:29.711 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>of the possibility of our own mortality,</v>

48
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.180
<v Speaker 1>all this underlying circuitry that in other animals is only apparent when</v>

49
00:02:37.181 --> 00:02:40.240
<v Speaker 1>they're startled or afraid or interested or curious.</v>

50
00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:41.051
<v Speaker 1>In human beings.</v>

51
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:44.650
<v Speaker 1>It's on all the time and that's what makes us conscious and the reason for that</v>

52
00:02:44.651 --> 00:02:49.651
<v Speaker 1>is because we developed enough cortical elaboration to note that we're always</v>

53
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>threatened by everything that's around us.</v>

54
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine that.</v>

55
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.071
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:55.000
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty awful,</v>

57
00:02:55.001 --> 00:02:55.421
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

58
00:02:55.421 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 1>Because it's at the basis of all our innate existential,</v>

59
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.530
<v Speaker 1>but then imagine as well that without that terror pushing us forward and and our</v>

60
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 1>constant reference to the dangerous aspect of the unknown,</v>

61
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>we would have never been motivated to produce the kind of societies that we've</v>

62
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.211
<v Speaker 1>produced,</v>

63
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:18.211
<v Speaker 1>which are essentially very remarkably elaborated devices that enable us to find</v>

64
00:03:19.961 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>some protection from that unknown and to manipulate,</v>

65
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.550
<v Speaker 1>manipulate it effectively,</v>

66
00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.900
<v Speaker 1>and then remembering that Surrey,</v>

67
00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.100
<v Speaker 1>we will return to genesis young says the snake was regarded by early gnostic</v>

68
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:40.371
<v Speaker 1>Christians as a kind of deity whose faculties were more developed and advanced</v>

69
00:03:40.681 --> 00:03:43.590
<v Speaker 1>than the original daddy that actually structured the world.</v>

70
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 1>The idea there being that the world initially was a pretty dismal place.</v>

71
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.920
<v Speaker 1>Everyone wasn't conscious.</v>

72
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.150
<v Speaker 1>We all existed at the level of the animal and then the snake came along and</v>

73
00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:54.984
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

74
00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.220
<v Speaker 1>wake up.</v>

75
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.113
<v Speaker 1>Wake up.</v>

76
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.920
<v Speaker 1>And the movement from that state of unsolved consciousness paradise to this</v>

77
00:04:01.921 --> 00:04:06.921
<v Speaker 1>profane state of awakening can be regarded not so much as a descent but as an</v>

78
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:08.850
<v Speaker 1>asset of sorts,</v>

79
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.390
<v Speaker 1>even though a painful one.</v>

80
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.850
<v Speaker 1>And then you have Gareth.</v>

81
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.560
<v Speaker 1>This commentary from Mephistopheles,</v>

82
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.060
<v Speaker 1>his representation of Satan and his capacity for temptation,</v>

83
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.050
<v Speaker 1>who says,</v>

84
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>follow the adage of my cousin,</v>

85
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.330
<v Speaker 1>snake from dreams of godlike knowledge,</v>

86
00:04:27.331 --> 00:04:32.331
<v Speaker 1>you will wake to fear in which your very soul shall quake a statement,</v>

87
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.850
<v Speaker 1>associating the human tendency to attribute to all revolutionary sources of new</v>

88
00:04:41.041 --> 00:04:41.874
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

89
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.130
<v Speaker 1>a kind of demonic being,</v>

90
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the problem of the woman.</v>

91
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Now we know that within the context of the Judeo Christian tradition,</v>

92
00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.420
<v Speaker 1>women have unduly suffered for their role in tempting humanity in the embodied</v>

93
00:04:58.331 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 1>form of Adam towards higher order self consciousness,</v>

94
00:05:02.201 --> 00:05:02.741
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

95
00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:03.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

96
00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.840
<v Speaker 1>let's just take a look at how human beings and their mating relationships differ</v>

97
00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 1>from those of other animals like chimpanzees to whom we are very closely</v>

98
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>genetically related.</v>

99
00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at the mating strategies of female chimpanzees,</v>

100
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:19.450
<v Speaker 1>you see that they really don't care who they sleep with,</v>

101
00:05:19.451 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>so to speak.</v>

102
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.300
<v Speaker 1>Any old chimpanzee will do.</v>

103
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.960
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

104
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>the last dominant male chimps tend to be chased away by the more dominant nailed</v>

105
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:27.881
<v Speaker 1>chimps,</v>

106
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 1>but if a female than less dominant chimp can get the hell away from the watchful</v>

107
00:05:31.991 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>gaze of the dominance hierarchy,</v>

108
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.230
<v Speaker 1>they're perfectly happy to mate.</v>

109
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.900
<v Speaker 1>Human females are not like that.</v>

110
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>There is selective of maters and there's a tremendous body of evolutionary</v>

111
00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 1>psychological information that suggests that although both genders,</v>

112
00:05:46.631 --> 00:05:49.900
<v Speaker 1>value intelligence and physical appearance,</v>

113
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>females value the ability to attain dominance,</v>

114
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy status in men far more than men,</v>

115
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.940
<v Speaker 1>admire the ability to attain dominant status in women,</v>

116
00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:06.970
<v Speaker 1>which is to say that men don't care what a woman has with regards to potential</v>

117
00:06:07.371 --> 00:06:08.420
<v Speaker 1>for attaining status.</v>

118
00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with women,</v>

119
00:06:09.441 --> 00:06:12.620
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the strong determinant of mating preference.</v>

120
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:13.820
<v Speaker 1>So then let's say,</v>

121
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

122
00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>we don't know why the hell are cortex has expanded so rapidly,</v>

123
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between five and 3 million years ago.</v>

124
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Let's offer this as a hypothesis.</v>

125
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.780
<v Speaker 1>The women started to get choosy and because they were so damn complicated,</v>

126
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:31.781
<v Speaker 1>the whole human species had to exaggerate it's critical growth prior to any even</v>

127
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 1>use for that critical growth,</v>

128
00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:38.090
<v Speaker 1>just so that the men had uneven hand in the competition,</v>

129
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>So women put tremendous selection pressure on the human being to develop</v>

131
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:44.354
<v Speaker 1>tremendous,</v>

132
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>tremendous cortical expansion.</v>

133
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Now we already know that from a mythological perspective that women are</v>

134
00:06:50.841 --> 00:06:54.320
<v Speaker 1>frequently cast into the same conceptual domain,</v>

135
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.160
<v Speaker 1>the temptress domain as the benevolent aspect of the unknown,</v>

136
00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 1>and we know as well from representations of hero mythology that it is the</v>

137
00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:04.460
<v Speaker 1>individual who goes out to confront chaos,</v>

138
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.980
<v Speaker 1>who's most likely to free from the dragon,</v>

139
00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:08.320
<v Speaker 1>not only treasured,</v>

140
00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:09.410
<v Speaker 1>but a virgin,</v>

141
00:07:09.411 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>say in the case of mythological representations like St George and the dragon</v>

142
00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:21.280
<v Speaker 1>in the Old Testament in genesis,</v>

143
00:07:21.281 --> 00:07:21.671
<v Speaker 1>there's no.</v>

144
00:07:21.671 --> 00:07:26.380
<v Speaker 1>There's this notion that not only did people become self conscious because they</v>

145
00:07:26.381 --> 00:07:27.011
<v Speaker 1>did something,</v>

146
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 1>but they did this voluntarily,</v>

147
00:07:28.901 --> 00:07:29.170
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

148
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.350
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

149
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.650
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

150
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:32.020
<v Speaker 1>they made this decision on their own.</v>

151
00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>So Milton puts words into God's mouth and says,</v>

152
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:41.750
<v Speaker 1>so will fall.</v>

153
00:07:41.751 --> 00:07:45.560
<v Speaker 1>He meaning the human being and his faithless progeny,</v>

154
00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 1>whose fault?</v>

155
00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.850
<v Speaker 1>Whose about his own engrave he had of me,</v>

156
00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:50.181
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

157
00:07:50.181 --> 00:07:51.014
<v Speaker 1>he could have.</v>

158
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I made him Justin,</v>

159
00:07:52.251 --> 00:07:53.084
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.780
<v Speaker 1>It's efficient to have stood though free to fall,</v>

161
00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:57.591
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

162
00:07:57.591 --> 00:07:57.741
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

163
00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:02.741
<v Speaker 1>maybe the notion of the heritable sin of Adam characterizing human beings and</v>

164
00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:06.920
<v Speaker 1>their fallen existential condition isn't just the black heart ravings of</v>

165
00:08:06.921 --> 00:08:09.320
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist southern Baptist lunatics,</v>

166
00:08:09.321 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

167
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.330
<v Speaker 1>There's something to this.</v>

168
00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:15.650
<v Speaker 1>Human beings are the only creatures that seem to live at odds with their own</v>

169
00:08:15.651 --> 00:08:20.000
<v Speaker 1>experience and it's not so unreasonable to suppose that it's hard dawning</v>

170
00:08:20.001 --> 00:08:24.020
<v Speaker 1>capacity for self consciousness that put us in that uncomfortable position.</v>

171
00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 1>So why do I associate the eating of the apple with selfconsciousness?</v>

172
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:30.591
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

173
00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:30.741
<v Speaker 1>let's.</v>

174
00:08:30.741 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 1>Because that's how the story lays itself out.</v>

175
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:36.590
<v Speaker 1>You have the collateral evidence of the Buddhist story of enlightenment,</v>

176
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:37.191
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

177
00:08:37.191 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 1>His contact with death.</v>

178
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>You have multiple media,</v>

179
00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:44.510
<v Speaker 1>medieval representations of Eve offering to animal to Adam.</v>

180
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 1>Not An apple,</v>

181
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:47.390
<v Speaker 1>but a skull.</v>

182
00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>You have multiple representations of the tree,</v>

183
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:54.050
<v Speaker 1>of the knowledge of good and evil in medieval iconography as not containing</v>

184
00:08:54.051 --> 00:08:54.561
<v Speaker 1>apples,</v>

185
00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 1>but containing skulls and you have the the statements that are within the</v>

186
00:08:59.461 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 1>context of genesis itself.</v>

187
00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:08.230
<v Speaker 1>And the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and</v>

188
00:09:08.871 --> 00:09:12.050
<v Speaker 1>they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.</v>

189
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

190
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:15.800
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of information packed into those two lines,</v>

191
00:09:15.801 --> 00:09:16.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

192
00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:17.720
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean to have your eyes open?</v>

193
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:18.441
<v Speaker 1>Or half?</v>

194
00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:20.180
<v Speaker 1>Your brain is visual cortex.</v>

195
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:21.253
<v Speaker 1>It's not on.</v>

196
00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:24.290
<v Speaker 1>It's not unreasonable to presume that that means a quick,</v>

197
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.730
<v Speaker 1>a quick magnification of consciousness.</v>

198
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Your conscious during the day,</v>

199
00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:33.590
<v Speaker 1>that's when your eyes are open or what happens when your eyes are open?</v>

200
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

201
00:09:34.221 --> 00:09:35.180
<v Speaker 1>you know you're naked.</v>

202
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

203
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:36.260
<v Speaker 1>what does that mean?</v>

204
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:36.651
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:36.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:37.761
<v Speaker 1>you're vulnerable,</v>

207
00:09:37.761 --> 00:09:38.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

208
00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.540
<v Speaker 1>To social comment,</v>

209
00:09:39.541 --> 00:09:40.520
<v Speaker 1>to social judgment,</v>

210
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.331
<v Speaker 1>to dominance,</v>

211
00:09:41.331 --> 00:09:41.901
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy,</v>

212
00:09:41.901 --> 00:09:43.010
<v Speaker 1>status maneuvering,</v>

213
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.920
<v Speaker 1>and to all the terrible things that the unknown world can,</v>

214
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:48.200
<v Speaker 1>can recap on you.</v>

215
00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:49.580
<v Speaker 1>And so then what do you do?</v>

216
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:50.241
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

217
00:09:50.241 --> 00:09:51.410
<v Speaker 1>you create culture,</v>

218
00:09:51.650 --> 00:09:52.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

219
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.170
<v Speaker 1>And that's what this little sentence says.</v>

220
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.400
<v Speaker 1>And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.</v>

221
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.130
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty eventful sequence all crammed up in two little sentences.</v>

222
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.130
<v Speaker 1>So then what happens?</v>

223
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 1>I think it's extremely interesting.</v>

224
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 1>So before Adam and eve figure out that they're naked,</v>

225
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:15.540
<v Speaker 1>they're cruising around the garden.</v>

226
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 1>Having a fine time doing whatever they want.</v>

227
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:19.170
<v Speaker 1>They don't take any thoughts for the future,</v>

228
00:10:19.171 --> 00:10:19.600
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

229
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I don't have a prefrontal cortex.</v>

230
00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:26.330
<v Speaker 1>They're living in a in a paradox lists environment like an animal lives.</v>

231
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:28.451
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

232
00:10:28.451 --> 00:10:30.550
<v Speaker 1>what happens after they become self conscious?</v>

233
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:31.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

234
00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>prior to this,</v>

235
00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Adam's walking around with God,</v>

236
00:10:34.691 --> 00:10:35.230
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

237
00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:36.790
<v Speaker 1>and you think about what that means.</v>

238
00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:37.930
<v Speaker 1>It means something like this.</v>

239
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.820
<v Speaker 1>An animal isn't in the world of good and evil and animal nature points out is</v>

240
00:10:42.821 --> 00:10:43.870
<v Speaker 1>beyond good and evil,</v>

241
00:10:43.871 --> 00:10:44.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

242
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Enraptured in entirely by the actions of automatic instinct governed by</v>

243
00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:52.870
<v Speaker 1>processes that are completely transcendent.</v>

244
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:53.530
<v Speaker 1>The animals,</v>

245
00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:55.720
<v Speaker 1>nothing but a force of nature.</v>

246
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.090
<v Speaker 1>There is no opposition between the animal in the world.</v>

247
00:10:58.091 --> 00:10:59.440
<v Speaker 1>The animal is the world,</v>

248
00:11:00.770 --> 00:11:03.590
<v Speaker 1>and just as in the case of the animal,</v>

249
00:11:03.591 --> 00:11:05.450
<v Speaker 1>prior to the eating of the apple,</v>

250
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:08.120
<v Speaker 1>Adam walks around the garden with God.</v>

251
00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:13.180
<v Speaker 1>There's no discontinuity between him and the and the transcendent world as such,</v>

252
00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:16.880
<v Speaker 1>but as soon as he becomes naked,</v>

253
00:11:17.510 --> 00:11:19.520
<v Speaker 1>he hides well.</v>

254
00:11:19.521 --> 00:11:20.354
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

255
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:20.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

256
00:11:20.751 --> 00:11:22.220
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't need to be answered.</v>

257
00:11:22.221 --> 00:11:23.420
<v Speaker 1>All you have to think about it.</v>

258
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 1>Why would you hide if you know you're naked?</v>

259
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

260
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.860
<v Speaker 1>it's simple.</v>

261
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:30.740
<v Speaker 1>You'll hide because you think you can get hurt.</v>

262
00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:35.890
<v Speaker 1>You think that whatever you are is so vulnerable that if it shows itself to the</v>

263
00:11:36.711 --> 00:11:38.870
<v Speaker 1>transcendent to others,</v>

264
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.160
<v Speaker 1>to the natural world,</v>

265
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.870
<v Speaker 1>that something terrible will happen,</v>

266
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:42.890
<v Speaker 1>and then you think,</v>

267
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.161
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

268
00:11:43.161 --> 00:11:45.230
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty logical presupposition,</v>

269
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:45.920
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

270
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.753
<v Speaker 1>Look at us.</v>

271
00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 1>So God comes cruising around the garden after Adam and Eve,</v>

272
00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.300
<v Speaker 1>the apple in the cool of the day and Adam and Eve hide themselves among the</v>

273
00:12:01.811 --> 00:12:04.480
<v Speaker 1>trees of the garden and God says to Adam,</v>

274
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:06.123
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

275
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.690
<v Speaker 1>where are you?</v>

276
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.763
<v Speaker 1>Adam says,</v>

277
00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 1>I heard your voice,</v>

278
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.860
<v Speaker 1>and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself,</v>

279
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:20.070
<v Speaker 1>and that story has bottomless depth because it means something like this.</v>

280
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:23.380
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of genesis,</v>

281
00:12:23.381 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 1>there's this notion that there is a transcendent relationship between the</v>

282
00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:28.000
<v Speaker 1>individual and God,</v>

283
00:12:28.001 --> 00:12:28.271
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

284
00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:31.180
<v Speaker 1>The identity of logo 70 individual,</v>

285
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:32.111
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

286
00:12:32.111 --> 00:12:33.070
<v Speaker 1>I know it shouldn't by the way,</v>

287
00:12:33.071 --> 00:12:36.970
<v Speaker 1>that our entire idea of intrinsic human right,</v>

288
00:12:36.971 --> 00:12:41.971
<v Speaker 1>it's predicated on it as we've been at some pains to demonstrate a relationship</v>

289
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:47.131
<v Speaker 1>between the limited and the limitless eradicated by the dawn of self</v>

290
00:12:48.161 --> 00:12:48.780
<v Speaker 1>consciousness.</v>

291
00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:49.613
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

292
00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:49.751
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

293
00:12:49.751 --> 00:12:53.020
<v Speaker 1>let's say you have a destiny just for the sake of argument,</v>

294
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

295
00:12:53.620 --> 00:12:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Because you are a being with a tremendous history and an unbelievable potential.</v>

296
00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:01.000
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you have a destiny just for the sake of argument,</v>

297
00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:05.320
<v Speaker 1>what would cause you to hide from that destiny?</v>

298
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

299
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.113
<v Speaker 1>obviously</v>

300
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:11.410
<v Speaker 1>your own reflections on your mortal vulnerability,</v>

301
00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

302
00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:16.770
<v Speaker 1>How could I be characterized by any transcendent power whatsoever when I'm</v>

303
00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:22.180
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to social alienation,</v>

304
00:13:22.210 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

305
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:27.690
<v Speaker 1>When I have this body which is capable of terrifying degeneration that will</v>

306
00:13:28.691 --> 00:13:32.440
<v Speaker 1>eventually decay into old edge and that is bounded by death.</v>

307
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:37.620
<v Speaker 1>How could I be good for anything which is precisely what this little story says,</v>

308
00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.960
<v Speaker 1>and so God figures out that Adam and eve ate the fruit and that's pretty</v>

309
00:13:43.961 --> 00:13:46.390
<v Speaker 1>decisive move because once you wake up,</v>

310
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

311
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.093
<v Speaker 1>you're awake,</v>

312
00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:49.203
<v Speaker 1>and he says,</v>

313
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.010
<v Speaker 1>and this is not an injunction,</v>

314
00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:51.873
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

315
00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.020
<v Speaker 1>this is a description,</v>

316
00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.273
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

317
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you've done it now unto the woman.</v>

318
00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.191
<v Speaker 1>He says,</v>

319
00:13:57.191 --> 00:14:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I will greatly multiply the Isaura night conception in sorrow shalt thou bring</v>

320
00:14:01.391 --> 00:14:02.230
<v Speaker 1>forth children.</v>

321
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:03.453
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

322
00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:04.743
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

323
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

324
00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 1>we have a big CORTEX,</v>

325
00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:08.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

326
00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:09.693
<v Speaker 1>Really big.</v>

327
00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.360
<v Speaker 1>It grew fast and what that meant is that there was an evolutionary arms race</v>

328
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.580
<v Speaker 1>between skull size,</v>

329
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 1>date of birth,</v>

330
00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:21.400
<v Speaker 1>and pelvic diameter girth.</v>

331
00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:24.190
<v Speaker 1>The wider the pelvis,</v>

332
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:28.510
<v Speaker 1>the less effectively you can walk a larger the skull.</v>

333
00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 1>The bigger the brain,</v>

334
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.180
<v Speaker 1>the younger the baby,</v>

335
00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.160
<v Speaker 1>the more dependent and vulnerable.</v>

336
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.380
<v Speaker 1>So what do we have in the case of human beings,</v>

337
00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:40.450
<v Speaker 1>the female human pelvis has already stretched to the limits of its structural</v>

338
00:14:40.451 --> 00:14:41.200
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>

339
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.910
<v Speaker 1>So the hole in its center is as big as it can get without compromising the</v>

340
00:14:45.911 --> 00:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>structural integrity of the pelvis while still allowing women to walk and run.</v>

341
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.120
<v Speaker 1>So how have babies adapted to that?</v>

342
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:53.431
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

343
00:14:53.431 --> 00:14:54.320
<v Speaker 1>that's simple.</v>

344
00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.950
<v Speaker 1>A mammo of our size should have a gestation period of two years.</v>

345
00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.960
<v Speaker 1>We have a gestation period of nine months.</v>

346
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Why you got to get the damn baby out before it's head gets too big?</v>

347
00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:04.760
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

348
00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:05.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

349
00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 1>it means it's vulnerable,</v>

350
00:15:06.411 --> 00:15:06.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

351
00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Nothing more vulnerable than a baby human being except maybe a baby kitten room.</v>

352
00:15:10.931 --> 00:15:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

353
00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:13.400
<v Speaker 1>But it's got a pouch to hide in at least.</v>

354
00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:15.110
<v Speaker 1>So we're born vulnerable,</v>

355
00:15:15.111 --> 00:15:15.441
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

356
00:15:15.441 --> 00:15:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Characteristic of the birth of the hero.</v>

357
00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Who suffers in childbirth?</v>

358
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:20.060
<v Speaker 1>Women.</v>

359
00:15:20.060 --> 00:15:20.893
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

360
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 1>Baby skulls?</v>

361
00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Just a little bit too big,</v>

362
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:26.000
<v Speaker 1>has to be crunched and compacted during birth,</v>

363
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.510
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

364
00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:30.260
<v Speaker 1>The skull bones aren't joined together so that the baby's head can be squashed</v>

365
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.290
<v Speaker 1>and visibly deformed during the process of birth.</v>

366
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Prior to the 20th century,</v>

367
00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:37.340
<v Speaker 1>what was the death rate among women giving birth?</v>

368
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 1>One in three,</v>

369
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.320
<v Speaker 1>one in five.</v>

370
00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Terrible.</v>

371
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.233
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

372
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the price you pay for self consciousness</v>

373
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:49.140
<v Speaker 1>and I desire shall be to the husband and he shall rule over thee.</v>

374
00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:50.640
<v Speaker 1>This is not an injunction.</v>

375
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:52.050
<v Speaker 1>This is a description.</v>

376
00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:58.510
<v Speaker 1>The additional burden that dependent offspring place on women,</v>

377
00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.070
<v Speaker 1>place them at a disadvantage.</v>

378
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:02.890
<v Speaker 1>What's the consequence of that from a historical perspective?</v>

379
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.251
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

380
00:16:03.251 --> 00:16:05.590
<v Speaker 1>any feminist can answer that question,</v>

381
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.513
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

382
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.990
<v Speaker 1>Add on to Adam.</v>

383
00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:09.441
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

384
00:16:09.441 --> 00:16:14.240
<v Speaker 1>because you listened to your wife and have eaten the tree of which I commanded</v>

385
00:16:14.241 --> 00:16:14.391
<v Speaker 1>thee,</v>

386
00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:14.691
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

387
00:16:14.691 --> 00:16:15.524
<v Speaker 1>don't eat that.</v>

388
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Cursed is the ground for the sake in sorrow shall though he'd have it for all</v>

389
00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:20.293
<v Speaker 1>the days of thy life.</v>

390
00:16:20.690 --> 00:16:21.321
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>

391
00:16:21.321 --> 00:16:21.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

392
00:16:21.830 --> 00:16:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Once you're self conscious,</v>

393
00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.223
<v Speaker 1>you work.</v>

394
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.800
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

395
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:24.951
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

396
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:25.970
<v Speaker 1>animals don't work.</v>

397
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Why do people work well?</v>

398
00:16:27.381 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Because we know,</v>

399
00:16:28.610 --> 00:16:28.911
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

400
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:31.520
<v Speaker 1>we know that if it isn't gonna happen today,</v>

401
00:16:31.850 --> 00:16:34.040
<v Speaker 1>it's going to happen tomorrow and if it isn't going to happen tomorrow,</v>

402
00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:37.310
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen next week or the week after the month after the year</v>

403
00:16:37.311 --> 00:16:39.860
<v Speaker 1>after and we bloody well better prepare.</v>

404
00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.120
<v Speaker 1>So that's what we do.</v>

405
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:46.270
<v Speaker 1>Constantly prepare and prepare and prepare so we're not bounded and motivated by</v>

406
00:16:47.511 --> 00:16:50.630
<v Speaker 1>what's happening from second to second like the animal is in.</v>

407
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:51.940
<v Speaker 1>It's still paradisical state.</v>

408
00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:56.390
<v Speaker 1>We're constantly tormented by an endless string of what if questions,</v>

409
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:58.250
<v Speaker 1>because when we look at the unknown,</v>

410
00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:03.400
<v Speaker 1>we can see the possibility for everything including our own punishment or own</v>

411
00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:04.310
<v Speaker 1>tournament,</v>

412
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:05.570
<v Speaker 1>our own demise,</v>

413
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.860
<v Speaker 1>and so we're motivated like no other animal to work and so we work.</v>

414
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.130
<v Speaker 1>But that is another aspect that alienates us from paradise.</v>

415
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:14.023
<v Speaker 1>Wellbeing</v>

416
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.780
<v Speaker 1>thorns and thistles shall it bring forth for the analysis.</v>

417
00:17:17.781 --> 00:17:21.550
<v Speaker 1>You'll eat the herb of the field in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread</v>

418
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:25.540
<v Speaker 1>til thou return unto the ground for Dust Thou art and unto dust shall thou</v>

419
00:17:25.541 --> 00:17:26.374
<v Speaker 1>return,</v>

420
00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:27.490
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

421
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:28.031
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

422
00:17:28.031 --> 00:17:31.690
<v Speaker 1>the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden to till the ground from</v>

423
00:17:31.691 --> 00:17:32.620
<v Speaker 1>whence he was taken.</v>

424
00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.490
<v Speaker 1>So he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden</v>

425
00:17:36.491 --> 00:17:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree</v>

426
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:41.950
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>
