1
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.190
<v Speaker 1>So on to Sigmund Freud,</v>

2
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>we're going to give him somewhat short shrift,</v>

3
00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm afraid because we only have an hour to talk about Freud,</v>

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.423
<v Speaker 1>but that's okay.</v>

5
00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

6
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.710
<v Speaker 1>we could get a fair way through it.</v>

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.113
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

8
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.370
<v Speaker 1>he's still persona non grata,</v>

9
00:00:20.371 --> 00:00:24.210
<v Speaker 1>I would say among experimental psychologists and probably clinical psychologists</v>

10
00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>swell.</v>

11
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.630
<v Speaker 1>But that seems to me to be very unfair.</v>

12
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

13
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:29.123
<v Speaker 1>Freud,</v>

14
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:31.140
<v Speaker 1>Freud is one of those thinkers who,</v>

15
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.063
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

16
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.301
<v Speaker 1>all the laughter,</v>

17
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:38.301
<v Speaker 1>his mistakes and the reason for that is that everything that he discovered or</v>

18
00:00:38.521 --> 00:00:42.720
<v Speaker 1>put forward is so entrenched in our culture now that we think it's self evident.</v>

19
00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.610
<v Speaker 1>And so everything correct has been assimilated and that just leaves everything</v>

20
00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:50.550
<v Speaker 1>that's more or less floating on top to look wrong.</v>

21
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:51.391
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

22
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>but Freud is also one of those thinkers who was always wrong in an interesting</v>

23
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.554
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

24
00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.060
<v Speaker 1>And that's very useful.</v>

25
00:00:57.061 --> 00:00:57.894
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>

26
00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

27
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>I also think that many of the things that he put his finger on,</v>

28
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.450
<v Speaker 1>that our ups of still disputed,</v>

29
00:01:03.451 --> 00:01:04.051
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

30
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:08.220
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the Oedipus complex are much more useful than people are willing to</v>

31
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.433
<v Speaker 1>admit,</v>

32
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 1>especially in the clinical realm.</v>

33
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Because the oedipal complex,</v>

34
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>which we'll talk about quite a bit,</v>

35
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360
<v Speaker 1>is actually a description of a fairly stable form of familial psychopathology</v>

36
00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:29.520
<v Speaker 1>where child gets trapped within the confines of a family because the</v>

37
00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:34.521
<v Speaker 1>relationship with one parent or the other or both is so tight that they can't</v>

38
00:01:34.651 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>break beyond it.</v>

39
00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 1>And maybe because of their own inability to move towards independence,</v>

40
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>but more frequently because of,</v>

41
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

42
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.910
<v Speaker 1>what you might describe as a kind of conspiracy between the sun and the parent</v>

43
00:01:47.911 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 1>or the child and the parent,</v>

44
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

45
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.250
<v Speaker 1>that prevents them from moving towards autonomous life and keeps them in a state</v>

46
00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:00.390
<v Speaker 1>of essentially a state of childhood dependence.</v>

47
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Freud said,</v>

48
00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I started my professional activity as a neurologist trying to bring relief to my</v>

49
00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:10.140
<v Speaker 1>neurotic patients under the influence of an older friend.</v>

50
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.530
<v Speaker 1>And by my own efforts I discovered some important new facts about the</v>

51
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:15.120
<v Speaker 1>unconscious and psychic life,</v>

52
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>the role of instinctual urges and so on.</v>

53
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>Out of these findings grew a new science psychoanalysis,</v>

54
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>a part of psychology and a new treatment for the neuroses.</v>

55
00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>I had to pay heavily for this bit of good luck.</v>

56
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 1>People did not believe in my facts and thought my theories unsavory.</v>

57
00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Resistance was strong and unrelenting.</v>

58
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.090
<v Speaker 1>In the end I succeeded in inquiring pupils and building it up,</v>

59
00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.250
<v Speaker 1>an international psychoanalytic association,</v>

60
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 1>but the struggle is not over.</v>

61
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.020
<v Speaker 1>He made that recording just shortly before he died.</v>

62
00:02:44.021 --> 00:02:44.854
<v Speaker 1>He moved to La,</v>

63
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.020
<v Speaker 1>to England to escape the Nazis.</v>

64
00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.141
<v Speaker 1>Before Freud,</v>

65
00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:50.974
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

66
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>the mind was,</v>

67
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.950
<v Speaker 1>it's complicated because Freud of course was not the only person to be thinking</v>

68
00:02:59.951 --> 00:03:01.630
<v Speaker 1>along the lines that he thought.</v>

69
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>Pierre Jenay who was one of his teachers had originated and started to develop.</v>

70
00:03:06.641 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Many of the ideas that I would say were popularized by Freud,</v>

71
00:03:09.311 --> 00:03:10.144
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

72
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>the idea of the unconscious mind was not certainly not as well developed prior</v>

73
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>to Freud as it became afterwards and</v>

74
00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.921
<v Speaker 1>before that.</v>

75
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:24.754
<v Speaker 1>I suppose</v>

76
00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>you might say that in so far as people thought of the mind at all,</v>

77
00:03:30.881 --> 00:03:35.350
<v Speaker 1>they they thought in philosophical terms and the mind would be that part of you</v>

78
00:03:35.351 --> 00:03:39.700
<v Speaker 1>that's that you're aware of like in the dark and the Cartesian sense.</v>

79
00:03:39.701 --> 00:03:40.391
<v Speaker 1>Descartes said,</v>

80
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>I think therefore I am and it kind of seems in some sense self evident that</v>

81
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.840
<v Speaker 1>you're aware of and have control over the contents of your own mind.</v>

82
00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.500
<v Speaker 1>But that was what Freud really questioned and he questioned it,</v>

83
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:54.161
<v Speaker 1>deeply said,</v>

84
00:03:54.161 --> 00:03:59.161
<v Speaker 1>well first of all the idea that you're one thing like one mind is a dubious idea</v>

85
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:04.900
<v Speaker 1>to begin with because people are full of internal contradictions and then the</v>

86
00:04:04.901 --> 00:04:07.810
<v Speaker 1>idea that your mind is all of one type,</v>

87
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>it's all of one form was also very questionable as far as Freud was concerned</v>

88
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:17.971
<v Speaker 1>because you could be fractionated into subcomponents and you know the idea for</v>

89
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:18.581
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

90
00:04:18.581 --> 00:04:22.300
<v Speaker 1>that your anger or your sexual desire could be an autonomous part of your</v>

91
00:04:22.301 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 1>personality in some sense that it could overtake you and control you.</v>

92
00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.060
<v Speaker 1>That's really a Friday and idea and one of the classic Freud and ideas really is</v>

93
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:36.061
<v Speaker 1>that people are made out of sub personalities and those subpersonalities are</v>

94
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:36.964
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

95
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the things I really like about the psychoanalytic thinkers</v>

96
00:04:40.121 --> 00:04:45.121
<v Speaker 1>because even the psychologists who say over the last 30 years or there abouts</v>

97
00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.230
<v Speaker 1>since maybe longer now anyways,</v>

98
00:04:49.231 --> 00:04:52.060
<v Speaker 1>since the demise of behaviorism as an ideology</v>

99
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.280
<v Speaker 1>and the admission by psychologists that there were,</v>

100
00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.420
<v Speaker 1>there is an active unconscious or many active unconsciousness,</v>

101
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:02.860
<v Speaker 1>which is a better way of thinking about it.</v>

102
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.510
<v Speaker 1>Psychologists still really haven't come to terms with the idea in any deep sense</v>

103
00:05:07.511 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 1>that these unconscious processes are living things.</v>

104
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:15.580
<v Speaker 1>You know there when when psychologists talk for example about the cognitive</v>

105
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.181
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>

106
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:21.100
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about something that they described it more machine like with</v>

107
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 1>more machine like metaphors and that's not reasonable.</v>

108
00:05:23.981 --> 00:05:28.810
<v Speaker 1>You you understand things a lot better if you understand that the subcomponents</v>

109
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 1>that make up people,</v>

110
00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.750
<v Speaker 1>the fragmentary bits of them and also the biological subsystems that that are</v>

111
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 1>part and parcel of your being are much more intelligently viewed as</v>

112
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 1>personalities there.</v>

113
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>They're kind of unit dimensional personalities in some sense so that for</v>

114
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:44.411
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

115
00:05:44.411 --> 00:05:45.101
<v Speaker 1>if you're angry,</v>

116
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:46.300
<v Speaker 1>you're nothing but angry.</v>

117
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's an overstatement obviously.</v>

118
00:05:48.671 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're afraid you're nothing but afraid or if you're hungry,</v>

119
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 1>you're nothing but hunger.</v>

120
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>While that's certainly true,</v>

121
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:57.200
<v Speaker 1>if you get hungry enough or thirsty or too hot or any of those things,</v>

122
00:05:57.201 --> 00:05:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

123
00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>you kind of collapsed to a simpler personality that only has one motivation in</v>

124
00:06:02.061 --> 00:06:02.451
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

125
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>And we'll talk a lot as we progress about the grounding of those unit</v>

126
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:09.470
<v Speaker 1>dimensional motivational systems in biology.</v>

127
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:14.471
<v Speaker 1>But I'd have to say that Freud was among the first read least the first to</v>

128
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.960
<v Speaker 1>synthesize a coherent theory of this multiplicity and to put it forth,</v>

129
00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.140
<v Speaker 1>well also insisting that much of what was happening to you and inside of you was</v>

130
00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:32.050
<v Speaker 1>not immediately accessible to your awareness.</v>

131
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>And it's a very profound,</v>

132
00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.690
<v Speaker 1>it's very profound discovery.</v>

133
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.650
<v Speaker 1>It means among any among many other things that you can formulate ideas.</v>

134
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.551
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

135
00:06:43.551 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 1>it means that you can act out things that you don't understand for reasons that</v>

136
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>you don't understand.</v>

137
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.480
<v Speaker 1>It also means that your memory can contain things that's represented in one way,</v>

138
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:57.830
<v Speaker 1>but that can't be understood in another.</v>

139
00:06:57.831 --> 00:06:58.790
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>

140
00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 1>and we know this is true because there are independent memory systems,</v>

141
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:04.640
<v Speaker 1>there's an independent memory system for procedures.</v>

142
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>That's for actions.</v>

143
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 1>There's an independence memory system for what you might describe as imagination</v>

144
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

145
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.100
<v Speaker 1>for the memory that uses images.</v>

146
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 1>And then there's uh,</v>

147
00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.240
<v Speaker 1>another system that articulates knowledge.</v>

148
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:19.370
<v Speaker 1>That's the semantic memory system.</v>

149
00:07:19.371 --> 00:07:24.110
<v Speaker 1>And it's not obvious at all that the contents of all of those are equivalent.</v>

150
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.460
<v Speaker 1>And that's why,</v>

151
00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:26.294
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

152
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>you can dream things that you don't know.</v>

153
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Speaker 1>Cause one of the things you might think is that your dreams watch you act and</v>

154
00:07:32.781 --> 00:07:36.350
<v Speaker 1>they watch other people act and then they make a little drama out of that.</v>

155
00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 1>And that drama has information in it.</v>

156
00:07:38.121 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>But you don't necessarily know what that information is in that.</v>

157
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>You can't describe it consciously.</v>

158
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.941
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

159
00:07:43.941 --> 00:07:44.051
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

160
00:07:44.051 --> 00:07:49.051
<v Speaker 1>it's akin to the Ph Eddie and idea that kids can play a game and you can take</v>

161
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:52.220
<v Speaker 1>them away from the game and then they won't know how to describe the rules,</v>

162
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>even though they can play the game.</v>

163
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:58.451
<v Speaker 1>And so dreams can contain information that's full of the encoding of behavior</v>

164
00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.120
<v Speaker 1>that has information in it that you're not consciously aware of.</v>

165
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.780
<v Speaker 1>And so then you can become consciously aware of that in kind of a revelation</v>

166
00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

167
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what you do when you become aware of the meaning of a dream or the</v>

168
00:08:09.411 --> 00:08:11.420
<v Speaker 1>meaning of a fantasy or something like that.</v>

169
00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 1>And that's all,</v>

170
00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>all our ability to think that way in some ways can be traced back to France.</v>
