00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Our daughter entered her life at 24 due to depression.</v>

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.110
<v Speaker 1>If someone is determined to end their life,</v>

3
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.400
<v Speaker 1>how can one change their mind?</v>

4
00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:06.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5
00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:06.941
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:06.941 --> 00:00:07.774
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

7
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm very sorry about that.</v>

8
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:11.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a terrible thing.</v>

9
00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.513
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

10
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.990
<v Speaker 1>I had this friend</v>

11
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:22.103
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>

12
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.193
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

13
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>There's been a lot of depression in our family,</v>

14
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>so it's a question that cuts close to the bone.</v>

15
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.623
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

16
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I had this friend and friend of my parents and her grand daughter committed</v>

17
00:00:51.461 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.833
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

19
00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>she was just beating herself up about what could have I done,</v>

20
00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:58.210
<v Speaker 1>what could have I done differently?</v>

21
00:00:58.211 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>This is the problem with suicide.</v>

22
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:02.050
<v Speaker 1>It leaves everybody behind thinking,</v>

23
00:01:02.051 --> 00:01:02.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

24
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:03.700
<v Speaker 1>what could've I done?</v>

25
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.320
<v Speaker 1>I could have treated the person better.</v>

26
00:01:05.321 --> 00:01:06.131
<v Speaker 1>I could have listened.</v>

27
00:01:06.131 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>I could have been there.</v>

28
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.691
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

29
00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 1>and she was just beating yourself up about this really feeling that she wasn't a</v>

30
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:13.391
<v Speaker 1>useful person,</v>

31
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:14.770
<v Speaker 1>that she'd failed as a grandmother.</v>

32
00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.150
<v Speaker 1>She's a really good person,</v>

33
00:01:16.151 --> 00:01:16.984
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

34
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.090
<v Speaker 1>And so I went for a walk with her and I said,</v>

35
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.750
<v Speaker 1>and she,</v>

36
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.310
<v Speaker 1>she's married and she likes her husband,</v>

37
00:01:21.311 --> 00:01:22.330
<v Speaker 1>and he's a really good guy.</v>

38
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.570
<v Speaker 1>I met.</v>

39
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.403
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

40
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.593
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

41
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.800
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

42
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.480
<v Speaker 1>you're blaming yourself for the,</v>

43
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.913
<v Speaker 1>for your granddaughter,</v>

44
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.753
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>

45
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.750
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

46
00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:32.830
<v Speaker 1>are you blaming your husband?</v>

47
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Are you sitting him down and telling him what to use?</v>

48
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Useless bastard.</v>

49
00:01:36.911 --> 00:01:40.360
<v Speaker 1>He was as a grandfather because his grand daughter committed suicide and how he</v>

50
00:01:40.361 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>failed completely.</v>

51
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.491
<v Speaker 1>She said,</v>

52
00:01:42.491 --> 00:01:42.701
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

53
00:01:42.701 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 1>I'd never do that.</v>

54
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.951
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

55
00:01:44.951 --> 00:01:45.784
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.530
<v Speaker 1>don't do it to yourself.</v>

57
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>No people.</v>

58
00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Depression was a terrible thing and many,</v>

59
00:01:57.221 --> 00:01:57.641
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

60
00:01:57.641 --> 00:01:58.720
<v Speaker 1>many things cause it,</v>

61
00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 1>and we don't understand.</v>

62
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.170
<v Speaker 1>We understand some of them,</v>

63
00:02:02.171 --> 00:02:03.760
<v Speaker 1>but lots of them we don't understand at all.</v>

64
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:03.971
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

65
00:02:03.971 --> 00:02:06.430
<v Speaker 1>sometimes people get depressed because they're really sick.</v>

66
00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>We know that depression could be an inflammatory disease,</v>

67
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:11.830
<v Speaker 1>it might be associated with audio,</v>

68
00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 1>immune dysfunction.</v>

69
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.330
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of reasons that people get depressed and depressed.</v>

70
00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 1>People can go places that are so dark,</v>

71
00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>you just cannot imagine it.</v>

72
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.190
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't necessarily the case that you can always rescue someone,</v>

73
00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:25.024
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

74
00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

75
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

76
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>but drowning yourself in the aftermath of a suicide is not helpful.</v>

77
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.353
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

78
00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a good room for self forgiveness there.</v>

79
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:33.941
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

80
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:34.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

81
00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.990
<v Speaker 1>maybe you did some things you shouldn't have done that were reprehensible and</v>

82
00:02:37.991 --> 00:02:38.501
<v Speaker 1>all of that,</v>

83
00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 1>but you don't want to beat yourself up.</v>

84
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Remember the presumption of innocence,</v>

85
00:02:42.941 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

86
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Innocent until proven guilty and you have to apply that to yourself.</v>

87
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

88
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.840
<v Speaker 1>I think there are times when people are so depressed or if there isn't anything</v>

89
00:02:52.841 --> 00:02:53.800
<v Speaker 1>that anyone can do.</v>

90
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>You know when the depressed person thinks,</v>

91
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is probably the worst part of it,</v>

92
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.710
<v Speaker 1>it depressed person thinks</v>

93
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.671
<v Speaker 1>everywhere I look,</v>

94
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>it's nothing but catastrophe and there's,</v>

95
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any way out of it.</v>

96
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

97
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I can't see any path forward whatsoever and then they think as well,</v>

98
00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:19.240
<v Speaker 1>and maybe it's the combination of these two thoughts that that really make</v>

99
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>people suicidal.</v>

100
00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's hopeless.</v>

101
00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.770
<v Speaker 1>It isn't going to get any better.</v>

102
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.030
<v Speaker 1>No matter where I turn,</v>

103
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:25.864
<v Speaker 1>there's no escape.</v>

104
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 1>The suffering is unbearable and I had absolutely no use whatsoever.</v>

105
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Do anyone.</v>

106
00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>It would be better for everyone if I was just gone because I'm going,</v>

107
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>if I'm not so much of a burden now that it's going to destroy their life,</v>

108
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:43.000
<v Speaker 1>then I'm going to be that much of a burden in the future.</v>

109
00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:45.700
<v Speaker 1>And so target,</v>

110
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>imagine what that's like for people,</v>

111
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's dreadful and there's lots of ways you get there and so</v>

112
00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.910
<v Speaker 1>you can listen to people.</v>

113
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 1>You can desperately encouraged them to seek the help they need.</v>

114
00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.081
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

115
00:03:59.081 --> 00:03:59.680
<v Speaker 1>like I've,</v>

116
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I've seen antidepressants work miracles on very,</v>

117
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.520
<v Speaker 1>very many people now.</v>

118
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 1>They don't work for everyone and they're not a panacea,</v>

119
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

120
00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>they have side effects and all of that.</v>

121
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>But one of the side effects of untreated depression is that you kill yourself</v>

122
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>and there is no recovery from that.</v>

123
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 1>And the are the probabilities actually rather high.</v>

124
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.900
<v Speaker 1>So you can go to war with them about antidepressants.</v>

125
00:04:22.901 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>If the person can't get out of their depression and their,</v>

126
00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.230
<v Speaker 1>and their suicidal,</v>

127
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:29.800
<v Speaker 1>it's like what do they have to lose one month on antidepressants?</v>

128
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.143
<v Speaker 1>They'll know,</v>

129
00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

130
00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.240
<v Speaker 1>they might have to experiment longer because it would depend on,</v>

131
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

132
00:04:34.541 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 1>some people respond better to some classes of antidepressants than the others.</v>

133
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.563
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

134
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 1>it's worth having a war with someone if they're in dire straits and they won't</v>

135
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:45.400
<v Speaker 1>do everything they can to get better.</v>

136
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:46.900
<v Speaker 1>ECT works.</v>

137
00:04:46.901 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Electric convulsive therapy works for intractable depression.</v>

138
00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a terrible thing to contemplate,</v>

139
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>but the modern versions of ECT aren't one flew over the cuckoo's nest.</v>

140
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:56.171
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

141
00:04:56.171 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>it's like there's no coming back from death.</v>

142
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.300
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

143
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.110
<v Speaker 1>it isn't clear.</v>

144
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.670
<v Speaker 1>You can't rescue everyone.</v>

145
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.460
<v Speaker 1>People get sick and they die.</v>

146
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.680
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes the way they die,</v>

147
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.080
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's depression.</v>

148
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Depression is a multifaceted phenomena.</v>

149
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.670
<v Speaker 1>You can be there for them,</v>

150
00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.533
<v Speaker 1>you can listen,</v>

151
00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:19.340
<v Speaker 1>you can watch,</v>

152
00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:20.660
<v Speaker 1>you can intervene,</v>

153
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.480
<v Speaker 1>you can try to understand,</v>

154
00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:24.890
<v Speaker 1>you can hold them accountable.</v>

155
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Speaker 1>You can do all of those things,</v>

156
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.823
<v Speaker 1>but that,</v>

157
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.570
<v Speaker 1>but everyone has their own destiny,</v>

158
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.440
<v Speaker 1>and you're not omnipotent.</v>

160
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:39.080
<v Speaker 1>And so sometimes it catastrophe yield curves like your daughters and</v>

161
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.703
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

162
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.940
<v Speaker 1>and then you should try to drag the least amount of misery forward that you can.</v>

163
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.573
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

164
00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 1>Once you recover from your grief.</v>

165
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
