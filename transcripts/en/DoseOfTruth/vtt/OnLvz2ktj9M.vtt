00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.900
<v Speaker 1>You can tell me what you think about this,</v>

2
00:00:07.901 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>but this is a statistic that just absolutely shocked and staggered me when I</v>

3
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>went through the Intel intelligence literature.</v>

4
00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:14.290
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

5
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.760
<v Speaker 1>it is illegal in the United States to induct anybody who has an Iq of less than</v>

6
00:00:18.761 --> 00:00:23.440
<v Speaker 1>83 and the reason for that is you know that the American armed forces have been</v>

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>conducting intelligence research for like more than a hundred years.</v>

8
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And that was partly because they needed a way of sorting people rapidly during</v>

9
00:00:30.311 --> 00:00:33.100
<v Speaker 1>times of military expansion during war time.</v>

10
00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:35.140
<v Speaker 1>But it was also because I,</v>

11
00:00:35.141 --> 00:00:37.810
<v Speaker 1>qts and especially in the early part of the 20th century,</v>

12
00:00:37.811 --> 00:00:39.210
<v Speaker 1>were used to identify,</v>

13
00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.910
<v Speaker 1>let's say the deserving poor who could really benefit from additional</v>

14
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:47.170
<v Speaker 1>educational attainment and advancement and the unit and the military was hoping</v>

15
00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:52.171
<v Speaker 1>to identify people from nor class strata that could be a streamed into say,</v>

16
00:00:53.201 --> 00:00:55.530
<v Speaker 1>officer training programs and so forth or,</v>

17
00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.330
<v Speaker 1>or even skills training programs to,</v>

18
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.650
<v Speaker 1>to move people from the underclass into at least the working class and may be</v>

19
00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:02.980
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>

20
00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.080
<v Speaker 1>So they had a bloody stake in this man.</v>

21
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to find people,</v>

22
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:11.110
<v Speaker 1>they want it to sort them properly and they wanted to do social good when they</v>

23
00:01:11.111 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>weren't just trying to win a war,</v>

24
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.761
<v Speaker 1>let's say,</v>

25
00:01:12.761 --> 00:01:15.250
<v Speaker 1>which often also is a social good.</v>

26
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>But what happened was that by,</v>

27
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember when this legislation was introduced,</v>

28
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:19.901
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't,</v>

29
00:01:19.901 --> 00:01:21.790
<v Speaker 1>it was in the later part of the 20th century,</v>

30
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.360
<v Speaker 1>but their basic finding was that by say the 1980s they had determined that if</v>

31
00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:31.630
<v Speaker 1>you had an Iq of less than 83 there was not a damn thing that the unit that the</v>

32
00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:32.291
<v Speaker 1>army could do,</v>

33
00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:37.270
<v Speaker 1>the armed forces could do to transform you into someone who could do something</v>

34
00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:40.100
<v Speaker 1>that was more productive than non productive.</v>

35
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>And at the thera terrible thing about that is that it's about 10% of the</v>

36
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:44.524
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

37
00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>And so you look at a statistic like that and you think,</v>

38
00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.851
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>

39
00:01:48.851 --> 00:01:52.870
<v Speaker 1>you've got this is this is enterprise,</v>

40
00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:55.780
<v Speaker 1>this massive enterprise that's chronically hungry for people.</v>

41
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.351
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

42
00:01:56.351 --> 00:01:57.010
<v Speaker 1>It's always,</v>

43
00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>they're always looking for people.</v>

44
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.020
<v Speaker 1>They're really oriented towards taking people from the underclass and lower</v>

45
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:03.730
<v Speaker 1>working class and pushing them up.</v>

46
00:02:03.731 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 1>The societal strata and during wartime,</v>

47
00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>they're actually desperate to bring in recruits,</v>

48
00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:09.250
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

49
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And their conclusion is that 10% of the population can't be trained to do</v>

50
00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:14.584
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

51
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>anything sufficiently useful to make them militarily operable.</v>

52
00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

53
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.950
<v Speaker 1>I just read out,</v>

54
00:02:20.951 --> 00:02:22.000
<v Speaker 1>my jaw just dropped.</v>
