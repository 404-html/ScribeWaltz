1
00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And sexual selection is no joke.</v>

2
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>It could be the primary thing.</v>

3
00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly one of the primary things that's driven human evolution.</v>

4
00:00:13.661 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And I think you can say that</v>

5
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.100
<v Speaker 1>you think about the environment again,</v>

6
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 1>let's think about the environment.</v>

7
00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.680
<v Speaker 1>So you have a dominance hierarchy and that's really an old structure.</v>

8
00:00:26.681 --> 00:00:31.120
<v Speaker 1>The dominance is harkeys 300 million years old because it emerged pretty much</v>

9
00:00:31.121 --> 00:00:32.050
<v Speaker 1>whenever there was,</v>

10
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 1>whenever there was a nervous system,</v>

11
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:34.780
<v Speaker 1>emergent nervous system,</v>

12
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.510
<v Speaker 1>and whenever animals had occupied the same territory,</v>

13
00:00:37.511 --> 00:00:40.840
<v Speaker 1>they automatically organize themselves into something approximating a dominance</v>

14
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:41.171
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

15
00:00:41.171 --> 00:00:42.460
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very,</v>

16
00:00:42.461 --> 00:00:42.851
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

17
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:43.241
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

18
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:44.470
<v Speaker 1>very old structure.</v>

19
00:00:44.471 --> 00:00:45.820
<v Speaker 1>It's older than trees,</v>

20
00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.530
<v Speaker 1>it's older than flowers,</v>

21
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.820
<v Speaker 1>it's old.</v>

22
00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And as far as real goes,</v>

23
00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:53.140
<v Speaker 1>from a Darwinian sense,</v>

24
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.270
<v Speaker 1>permanent is real.</v>

25
00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>And so when you,</v>

26
00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:57.401
<v Speaker 1>you can say,</v>

27
00:00:57.401 --> 00:00:57.671
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:00:57.671 --> 00:00:57.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

29
00:00:57.911 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 1>our burial ancestors adapted themselves to treats.</v>

30
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.060
<v Speaker 1>And so the tree was a long,</v>

31
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.950
<v Speaker 1>around long enough to be a feature of the environment.</v>

32
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.400
<v Speaker 1>But the dominance hierarchy has been around a lot longer than trees.</v>

33
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.090
<v Speaker 1>And you can think of the dominance hierarchy both as an adaptation to the</v>

34
00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

35
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.140
<v Speaker 1>because you'd kind of think about the dominant Turkey has a cultural construct,</v>

36
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.080
<v Speaker 1>but if a cultural construct lasts long enough,</v>

37
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.910
<v Speaker 1>then it becomes part of the environment.</v>

38
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.550
<v Speaker 1>And so the dominant Turkey's part of the environment.</v>

39
00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:27.160
<v Speaker 1>And what seems to happen roughly speaking,</v>

40
00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.360
<v Speaker 1>and this is an oversimplification,</v>

41
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.531
<v Speaker 1>but we'll go with it,</v>

42
00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:34.531
<v Speaker 1>is that males have a dominance hierarchy and there's a relatively small number</v>

43
00:01:36.101 --> 00:01:38.320
<v Speaker 1>of males that are relatively successful.</v>

44
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 1>And those successful males have preferential access to female reproductive</v>

45
00:01:43.361 --> 00:01:44.170
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>

46
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.430
<v Speaker 1>either because of the females actively choose the more dominant males,</v>

47
00:01:48.431 --> 00:01:49.091
<v Speaker 1>which is very,</v>

48
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:49.924
<v Speaker 1>very common.</v>

49
00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.640
<v Speaker 1>Or because the more dominant males chase all the less dominant males away so</v>

50
00:01:54.641 --> 00:01:57.700
<v Speaker 1>that even if the females don't exercise choice,</v>

51
00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:58.750
<v Speaker 1>which they often do,</v>

52
00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.960
<v Speaker 1>then the only males left around that can serve as reasonable mating partners are</v>

53
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>the more powerful ones.</v>

54
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.160
<v Speaker 1>And so you think you got to really radical determiners of evolution as a</v>

55
00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>consequence of that one?</v>

56
00:02:13.391 --> 00:02:14.224
<v Speaker 1>Is that</v>

57
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.953
<v Speaker 2>each,</v>

58
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about female dominance hierarchies at the moment,</v>

59
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.720
<v Speaker 1>but I can talk about that.</v>

60
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:22.790
<v Speaker 1>But that's why this is an oversimplification,</v>

61
00:02:22.791 --> 00:02:27.620
<v Speaker 1>but what happens is that the males obviously are selected for their ability to</v>

62
00:02:27.621 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>move up dominance hierarchies obviously because the ones that are at the top of</v>

63
00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 1>the dominance hierarchy reproduce preferentially.</v>

64
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:38.840
<v Speaker 1>And so that means the male dominance hierarchy becomes a method of selection.</v>

65
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.050
<v Speaker 1>But then allied with that is the female proclivity for choice on whatever</v>

66
00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:47.750
<v Speaker 1>dimension the dominance hierarchy happens to be arranged.</v>

67
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:52.751
<v Speaker 1>And so then female sexual selection also becomes a radical nonrandom selector</v>

68
00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

69
00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.720
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

70
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.680
<v Speaker 1>of what,</v>

71
00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>what genetic material is to move into the next generation.</v>

72
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.570
<v Speaker 1>And so I,</v>

73
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>I fail to see how any of that can be separated from the emergence of complex</v>

74
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:10.120
<v Speaker 1>nervous systems and mind over the course of evolution because people aren't,</v>

75
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>creatures aren't making random choices,</v>

76
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 1>they're not random at all.</v>

77
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.920
<v Speaker 1>So we even notice it.</v>

78
00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Such things like managing the Peacock's tail,</v>

79
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

80
00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.090
<v Speaker 1>and it's covered with eyes,</v>

81
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting because eyes of course attract attention and lots of</v>

82
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>animals have evolved.</v>

83
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.450
<v Speaker 1>I light markings like Moss,</v>

84
00:03:28.451 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>there's moss that when they unfold their wings,</v>

85
00:03:30.341 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 1>they have two big eyes on the back of them.</v>

86
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's to keep birds from eating them.</v>

87
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:33.491
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

88
00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Cause the birds don't like being stared at.</v>

89
00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>So they stay away from the moths.</v>

90
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.500
<v Speaker 1>But so a peacock's tail is nothing but eyes.</v>

91
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.820
<v Speaker 1>And so it's very attractive and it shimmers and there's something about it</v>

92
00:03:42.821 --> 00:03:43.481
<v Speaker 1>that's beautiful,</v>

93
00:03:43.481 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 1>which is quite interesting to the females have obviously been selecting the male</v>

94
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>peacock peacocks for beauty.</v>

95
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>They have this insane tail while so they,</v>

96
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:53.770
<v Speaker 1>evolutionary biologists have thought,</v>

97
00:03:53.771 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 1>well what possible utility could that tail be?</v>

98
00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>Is it just maybe the females got fixated on tail so to speak.</v>

99
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

100
00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.280
<v Speaker 1>you got a Baldwin effect loop going there and the male peacocks just got bigger</v>

101
00:04:06.281 --> 00:04:08.710
<v Speaker 1>and bigger tales and it's just like an evolutionary dead end.</v>

102
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.951
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

103
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:09.221
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

104
00:04:09.221 --> 00:04:12.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a positive feedback list system that's gone out of control.</v>

105
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.500
<v Speaker 1>But they have done things that like look at the symmetry and,</v>

106
00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:17.220
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

107
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.370
<v Speaker 1>and breadth say,</v>

108
00:04:18.371 --> 00:04:23.371
<v Speaker 1>or the symmetry and size and overall quality of the male peacock's tail as a</v>

109
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.180
<v Speaker 1>marker for physical health.</v>

110
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.370
<v Speaker 1>So reduce parasite load for example.</v>

111
00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>And it does turn out that the healthier male peacocks have better tail display.</v>

112
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.281
<v Speaker 1>And so the way,</v>

113
00:04:32.281 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 1>what the females seem to be doing is using some marker or some set of markers as</v>

114
00:04:36.971 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>a proxy indicator for,</v>

115
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.873
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>

116
00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:40.773
<v Speaker 1>for health.</v>

117
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.010
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

118
00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I think you could say with,</v>

119
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>with reasonable,</v>

120
00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.690
<v Speaker 1>you could say reasonable that reasonably that female human beings do the same</v>

121
00:04:49.691 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>thing to male human beings.</v>

122
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>And there's some of that vice versa too.</v>

123
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Like we evaluate each other,</v>

124
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:54.641
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

125
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.301
<v Speaker 1>for symmetry,</v>

126
00:04:55.301 --> 00:04:58.930
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the elements of beauty because healthier people tend to be more</v>

127
00:04:58.931 --> 00:05:01.450
<v Speaker 1>symmetrical and lots of animals use symmetry.</v>

128
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.900
<v Speaker 1>Butterflies if butterflies won't mate with another butterfly,</v>

129
00:05:04.901 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 1>if it deviates from symmetry by the tiniest amounts,</v>

130
00:05:07.451 --> 00:05:08.284
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine.</v>

131
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.410
<v Speaker 1>So symmetry is a marker and there's other markers like shoulder width to waste</v>

132
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.140
<v Speaker 1>with his wanton waste,</v>

133
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>with to hip with this is another,</v>

134
00:05:16.451 --> 00:05:19.630
<v Speaker 1>that's usually what males use that to evaluate females in park.</v>

135
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.460
<v Speaker 1>So there's lots of markers of health.</v>

136
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.643
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

137
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but it also looks to me like the,</v>

138
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:25.210
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

139
00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.670
<v Speaker 1>the data worldwide seems to indicate that women,</v>

140
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>so managing that women May to cross dominance hierarchies and up</v>

141
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 1>socioeconomically speaking and on average across cultures,</v>

142
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>women go for men who are about four to five years older.</v>

143
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.441
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

144
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>it varies.</v>

145
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 1>In the Scandinavian countries that's shrunk a little bit,</v>

146
00:05:41.531 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 1>but not that much.</v>

147
00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>And in other cultures it's bigger.</v>

148
00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.280
<v Speaker 1>I would say that depends to some degree on difficulty of establishing economic</v>

149
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:49.114
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>

150
00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.661
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

151
00:05:49.661 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 1>Because in richer countries it's easier to have enough economic independence if</v>

152
00:05:52.781 --> 00:05:57.740
<v Speaker 1>you're a male to B to B are useful participant in the process of having</v>

153
00:05:57.741 --> 00:05:58.574
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>

154
00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.503
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

155
00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.490
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't matter cross culturally,</v>

156
00:06:01.491 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>it's still across an op where man mate across and down,</v>

157
00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>they don't care much about socioeconomic status.</v>

158
00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem to be part of their selection method.</v>

159
00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

160
00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking.</v>

161
00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:13.153
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

162
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:19.090
<v Speaker 1>so I think that part of that is also that the ability of women to select for</v>

163
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.241
<v Speaker 1>male health,</v>

164
00:06:20.241 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>it's something like that because it isn't the only that,</v>

165
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.800
<v Speaker 1>because if you're healthy and energetic,</v>

166
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.010
<v Speaker 1>you're much more likely to be successful because it's very hard to be successful</v>

167
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:28.731
<v Speaker 1>if you're ill,</v>

168
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>obviously.</v>

169
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

170
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>so because the competition is just too high.</v>

171
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:33.411
<v Speaker 1>And both,</v>

172
00:06:33.411 --> 00:06:34.250
<v Speaker 1>both genders,</v>

173
00:06:34.251 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>both sexes select each other for attractiveness,</v>

174
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:37.730
<v Speaker 1>both select for intelligence,</v>

175
00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:39.650
<v Speaker 1>both at select for personality,</v>

176
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.270
<v Speaker 1>although the different,</v>

177
00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 1>there are differences there in terms of what's what stressed.</v>

178
00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>But so,</v>

179
00:06:46.311 --> 00:06:46.910
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

180
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.850
<v Speaker 1>so I think you can derive a couple of things out of out of this.</v>

181
00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:51.920
<v Speaker 1>And this is where I think people are different than,</v>

182
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.151
<v Speaker 1>than other animals.</v>

183
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 1>Importantly different is that,</v>

184
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.940
<v Speaker 1>so you imagine that there's tremendous selection pressure to,</v>

185
00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.620
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.000
<v Speaker 1>towards the production,</v>

187
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>let's say of man who are good at climbing male dominance hierarchies or climbing</v>

188
00:07:06.291 --> 00:07:07.910
<v Speaker 1>the male dominance hierarchy.</v>

189
00:07:07.911 --> 00:07:11.660
<v Speaker 1>But the thing that's so interesting about people is that we've multiplied our</v>

190
00:07:11.661 --> 00:07:12.800
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies.</v>

191
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.641
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

192
00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>if you take an animal that's got a rather static behavioral pattern,</v>

193
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>then there's,</v>

194
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>there's the single hierarchy.</v>

195
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Elephant seals are a good example of that.</v>

196
00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.640
<v Speaker 1>So elephant seals,</v>

197
00:07:22.641 --> 00:07:24.190
<v Speaker 1>the males are absolutely massive.</v>

198
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.801
<v Speaker 1>They're way,</v>

199
00:07:24.801 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 1>way bigger than the females.</v>

200
00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.760
<v Speaker 1>And they basically have harems roughly speaking,</v>

201
00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:34.060
<v Speaker 1>and they use physical prowess as their marker of status essentially.</v>

202
00:07:34.401 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 1>And obviously size is a huge part of that because otherwise the male elephant</v>

203
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:38.870
<v Speaker 1>seals wouldn't be as,</v>

204
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:39.831
<v Speaker 1>they're massive.</v>

205
00:07:39.831 --> 00:07:41.870
<v Speaker 1>These things are absolutely enormous.</v>

206
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>And so it's just power slash health,</v>

207
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:46.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

208
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 1>maybe aggression,</v>

209
00:07:47.061 --> 00:07:47.894
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

210
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 1>It's whatever makes them more um,</v>

211
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 1>suitable for the kind of physical combat that elephant seals engage it.</v>

212
00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:57.253
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

213
00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:02.440
<v Speaker 1>and the degree to which power is associated with dominance status in those sorts</v>

214
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>of situations seems to be associated with the size differential between males</v>

215
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.414
<v Speaker 1>and females.</v>

216
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.800
<v Speaker 1>So the more power is an issue with regards to male competence,</v>

217
00:08:12.801 --> 00:08:16.400
<v Speaker 1>the larger the bales are compared to the females and the more likely the males</v>

218
00:08:16.401 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>are going to have a harem relationship with the females.</v>

219
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 1>And you see that a little bit in human beings because men are bigger than women.</v>

220
00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:24.260
<v Speaker 1>They're not overwhelmingly bigger.</v>

221
00:08:24.261 --> 00:08:25.520
<v Speaker 1>That's sexual dimorphism.</v>

222
00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:26.151
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

223
00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>there's some men that are smaller than some women,</v>

224
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:29.880
<v Speaker 1>but on average men are tolerant there.</v>

225
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>They have more upper body strength and so forth.</v>

226
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 1>So there is a power element to male competition,</v>

227
00:08:34.790 --> 00:08:38.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as extended as it would be among animals say like,</v>

228
00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:39.800
<v Speaker 1>like elephant seals.</v>

229
00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:45.100
<v Speaker 1>So in the elephant seal you see maybe there's one stable set of traits that's</v>

230
00:08:45.861 --> 00:08:49.220
<v Speaker 1>being selected for that makes the males more likely to reproduce.</v>

231
00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:50.181
<v Speaker 1>But human beings,</v>

232
00:08:50.181 --> 00:08:54.230
<v Speaker 1>we're very weird creatures because we're so conceptually flexible.</v>

233
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 1>And so what seems to have happened,</v>

234
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe we started males started selecting each other for don in dominance</v>

235
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 1>competitions for something like cognitive flexibility and conscientiousness.</v>

236
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 1>It's something like that.</v>

237
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 1>So that would be the ability to abstractly represent the world and then the</v>

238
00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 1>ability operate effectively within it to represent yourself socially in a way.</v>

239
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:19.230
<v Speaker 1>And then to carry through with that because that enables people to trust you.</v>

240
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.880
<v Speaker 1>So it's something like that.</v>

241
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.720
<v Speaker 1>And so that produced cortical expansion and then women were selecting men who</v>

242
00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:29.430
<v Speaker 1>are good at that and not produce cortical expansion.</v>

243
00:09:29.431 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>And then there's an arms race between women and men with regards to</v>

244
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:33.991
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

245
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>So the women kept up or they certainly kept up with,</v>

246
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.040
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

247
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.560
<v Speaker 1>with intelligence as,</v>

248
00:09:39.561 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>as the evolutionary cycle continued.</v>

249
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:47.630
<v Speaker 1>But one of the consequences of selection for cortical expansion and increased</v>

250
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:54.270
<v Speaker 1>cognitive flexibility was that the number of dominance hierarchies that human</v>

251
00:09:54.271 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>beings could produce started to multiply,</v>

252
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.761
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

253
00:09:56.761 --> 00:09:59.100
<v Speaker 1>Because there's all sorts of ways that you can be successful.</v>

254
00:09:59.430 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

255
00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 1>you think about how many ways you can be successful in a modern culture,</v>

256
00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>and you can be successful in dimensions that aren't even associated with each</v>

257
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

258
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>So you can be successful socially that that's what an extrovert would do.</v>

259
00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:13.890
<v Speaker 1>You could be successful in terms of intimate relationships.</v>

260
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>That's what a agreeable person would do.</v>

261
00:10:16.290 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>A disagreeable person would be more successful with regards to competition.</v>

262
00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.230
<v Speaker 1>A person who is high in neuroticism would be,</v>

263
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>would be tried to protect themselves and to establish some sort of security and</v>

264
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:28.410
<v Speaker 1>open person would be looking for a flexible,</v>

265
00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 1>creative environment.</v>

266
00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:31.680
<v Speaker 1>And so there's this multiplicity of,</v>

267
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.200
<v Speaker 1>of ways that you can establish a dominance hierarchy and be successful in it.</v>

268
00:10:37.201 --> 00:10:38.070
<v Speaker 1>And if you're creative,</v>

269
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 1>you can come up with your own damn dominance hierarchy,</v>

270
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:41.760
<v Speaker 1>which is exactly what you're doing.</v>

271
00:10:41.761 --> 00:10:42.511
<v Speaker 1>If you're creative,</v>

272
00:10:42.511 --> 00:10:42.790
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

273
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:43.040
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

274
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 1>you spin up a game that's your game and then you,</v>

275
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.400
<v Speaker 1>you make the rules.</v>

276
00:10:47.401 --> 00:10:49.930
<v Speaker 1>And that's hard because if you make a new game with new rule,</v>

277
00:10:49.931 --> 00:10:51.180
<v Speaker 1>if it's hard to monetize it,</v>

278
00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:53.970
<v Speaker 1>but you can be the best at playing that game.</v>

279
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And so that's a huge advantage to being creative if you can pull it off.</v>

280
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:58.831
<v Speaker 1>So then you think,</v>

281
00:10:58.831 --> 00:10:58.981
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

282
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:03.981
<v Speaker 1>what's happened among human beings is the multiplication of the set of possible</v>

283
00:11:04.471 --> 00:11:05.520
<v Speaker 1>dominance hierarchies.</v>

284
00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So it's become very broad.</v>

285
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.070
<v Speaker 1>And then you could say,</v>

286
00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:08.251
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

287
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:08.611
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

288
00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 1>what's driving selection now is the ability to be successful across multiple</v>

289
00:11:12.211 --> 00:11:13.560
<v Speaker 1>sets of dominance hierarchies.</v>

290
00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:16.590
<v Speaker 1>And that account's at least in part for our cognitive flexibility.</v>

291
00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>And so that's really what a human being is.</v>

292
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>A human being is a creature that has high potential for succeeding across a very</v>

293
00:11:23.521 --> 00:11:26.190
<v Speaker 1>wide range of potential human dominance hierarchies.</v>

294
00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And so that gives us our transformative psyche.</v>

295
00:11:29.521 --> 00:11:30.450
<v Speaker 1>That's the niche,</v>

296
00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.230
<v Speaker 1>that's the niche that we've both produced and occupy.</v>

297
00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:35.760
<v Speaker 1>And I think it's out of that,</v>

298
00:11:35.761 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>that hero mythology emerges fundamentally because I think what the hero is,</v>

299
00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:44.550
<v Speaker 1>the mythological hero is a representation of that part of the psyche that's</v>

300
00:11:44.551 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>particularly good at being successful across sets of dominance hierarchies.</v>
