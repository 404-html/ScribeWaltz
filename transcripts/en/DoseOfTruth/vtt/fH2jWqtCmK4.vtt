00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

2
00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.800
<v Speaker 1>the evidence about mental,</v>

3
00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:11.420
<v Speaker 1>the mental health crisis that adolescence,</v>

4
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>when Greg and I wrote the article,</v>

5
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.791
<v Speaker 1>we were,</v>

6
00:00:13.791 --> 00:00:14.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>we saw lots of hints that depression and anxiety were gone way up and we think</v>

8
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:21.580
<v Speaker 1>that's related to the protection you have do.</v>

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

10
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:22.220
<v Speaker 1>So let,</v>

11
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about that just for a sec and then go back to the book.</v>

12
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.250
<v Speaker 1>So I've got a dem potential demographic explanations for that in part.</v>

13
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:29.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.130
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if you guys have looked into this or not.</v>

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.821
<v Speaker 1>Well there,</v>

16
00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:32.570
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

17
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.090
<v Speaker 1>there's two things that I think might be contributing to it.</v>

18
00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>One is two or three things.</v>

19
00:00:38.991 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>One is the average age at which children are,</v>

20
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.653
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

21
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 1>the average age at which people have children has gone way up.</v>

22
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.001
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>

23
00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:47.161
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

24
00:00:47.161 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>So why does that matter?</v>

25
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.561
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:51.800
<v Speaker 1>because I think people get more conservative and cautious as they get older,</v>

27
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.060
<v Speaker 1>but that's true.</v>

28
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 1>But it's a very small effect.</v>

29
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.610
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

30
00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.920
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>

31
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:55.450
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

32
00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

33
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380
<v Speaker 1>It's the having of the kids,</v>

34
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.940
<v Speaker 1>which is what makes them more conservative.</v>

35
00:00:58.941 --> 00:00:59.960
<v Speaker 1>When you have kids,</v>

36
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you are more threat sensitive,</v>

37
00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.410
<v Speaker 1>you're more likely to vote for the right wing party.</v>

38
00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.720
<v Speaker 1>So just delaying child,</v>

39
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>child,</v>

40
00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.930
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

41
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:07.763
<v Speaker 1>childbirth wouldn't.</v>

42
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.091
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

43
00:01:08.091 --> 00:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>What about,</v>

44
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:09.980
<v Speaker 1>what about fewer siblings?</v>

45
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:10.641
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>

46
00:01:10.641 --> 00:01:11.360
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

47
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.193
<v Speaker 1>that's part of it.</v>

48
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:12.741
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

49
00:01:12.741 --> 00:01:14.180
<v Speaker 1>and this is what we're seeing in Asia too.</v>

50
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.890
<v Speaker 1>When you have a lot of kids,</v>

51
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>you're not quite as worried,</v>

52
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:19.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't have all your eggs in one basket.</v>

53
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.460
<v Speaker 1>Well and you can probably just worried and the siblings raise each other.</v>

54
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.820
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

55
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:23.091
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

56
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:23.924
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a lot of</v>

57
00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.480
<v Speaker 1>quite,</v>

58
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

59
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:28.730
<v Speaker 1>It's the free play and the fighting,</v>

60
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>the working things out for themselves.</v>

61
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 1>Those are essential skills of adulthood.</v>

62
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.631
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

63
00:01:32.631 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>So cool.</v>

64
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.010
<v Speaker 1>So then all right.</v>

65
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Smaller family sizes,</v>

66
00:01:35.811 --> 00:01:36.620
<v Speaker 1>part of it.</v>

67
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:01:36.861 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>and then also what's happening increasingly in schools is that kids aren't</v>

69
00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>allowed free play and there are certain,</v>

70
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.190
<v Speaker 1>not even loud,</v>

71
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>rough and tumble free play.</v>

72
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.793
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

73
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.280
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

74
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.420
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the biggest things about,</v>

75
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 1>so the two,</v>

76
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:48.151
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

77
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:48.490
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

78
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 1>there are three giant there.</v>

79
00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of cards.</v>

80
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.971
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

81
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

82
00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:52.940
<v Speaker 1>this is such actually,</v>

84
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:55.670
<v Speaker 1>it's really fun puzzle because it's like the biggest social science puzzle of</v>

85
00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:56.504
<v Speaker 1>our age.</v>

86
00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.230
<v Speaker 1>What is happening that's making so many of our systems go haywire and I'm</v>

87
00:02:00.231 --> 00:02:01.190
<v Speaker 1>focusing on the university.</v>

88
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>The big three I would say are one is the loss of,</v>

89
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:04.910
<v Speaker 1>of free,</v>

90
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>unsupervised free play.</v>

91
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.430
<v Speaker 1>And Peter Gray has been brilliant on this season I Boston College,</v>

92
00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.350
<v Speaker 1>showing how even among young animals,</v>

93
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 1>they have to practice the skills for adulthood and getting in at showing that</v>

94
00:02:15.861 --> 00:02:16.120
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

95
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.953
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

96
00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.760
<v Speaker 1>So getting in conflicts and then dealing with it and sometimes losing your,</v>

97
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:22.603
<v Speaker 1>come back,</v>

98
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.920
<v Speaker 1>having game in which there's a problem,</v>

99
00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:26.720
<v Speaker 1>but you have to work it out with the game stops.</v>

100
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.160
<v Speaker 1>That's what kids always did.</v>

101
00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.250
<v Speaker 1>It's only recently the night beginning in the nineties that they're always</v>

102
00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.980
<v Speaker 1>supervised because we're afraid if we take our eyes off them,</v>

103
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>there'll be kidnapped.</v>

104
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>And that was never a risk was never right.</v>
