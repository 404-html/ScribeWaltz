1
00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:07.011
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

2
00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.570
<v Speaker 1>it's taken me just a little while too.</v>

3
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.673
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

4
00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Someone says,</v>

5
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:13.181
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

6
00:00:13.181 --> 00:00:13.450
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

7
00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

8
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll like go for that.</v>

9
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.433
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

10
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:17.933
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

11
00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.121
<v Speaker 1>hi Jordan.</v>

12
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:21.370
<v Speaker 1>What are feelings and why do we have the,</v>

13
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.253
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

14
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.450
<v Speaker 1>here's a way of thinking about it.</v>

15
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.550
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

16
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.530
<v Speaker 1>let's say you were walking down a pathway.</v>

17
00:00:29.531 --> 00:00:30.970
<v Speaker 1>I actually saw this happen one day,</v>

18
00:00:30.971 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 1>so I'll tell you this story.</v>

19
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:35.110
<v Speaker 1>So I was walking along the cliffs near,</v>

20
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.880
<v Speaker 1>I think it was San Diego or la,</v>

21
00:00:36.881 --> 00:00:37.714
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

22
00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I think probably,</v>

23
00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.673
<v Speaker 1>I think it was,</v>

24
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I think it was San Diego.</v>

25
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.991
<v Speaker 1>Anyways,</v>

26
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:46.490
<v Speaker 1>I was walking along there with some friends and uh,</v>

27
00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>and a brother of a friend of mine who's quite a toll guys about six foot five,</v>

28
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:51.641
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

29
00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>And he was walking along the path on the edge of the cliff,</v>

30
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:55.570
<v Speaker 1>kind of sandy and with,</v>

31
00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.380
<v Speaker 1>with scrub pine around overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</v>

32
00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.431
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

33
00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 1>it was march I think.</v>

34
00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:03.280
<v Speaker 1>So it was warm but not too warm.</v>

35
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.750
<v Speaker 1>We were walking along and all of a sudden his little girl who I think was like</v>

36
00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:08.584
<v Speaker 1>four or five,</v>

37
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I said she was walking in front of him.</v>

38
00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And in front of me and I guess we are going round a little bit of a corner and</v>

39
00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:18.490
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden she jumped right up on his shoulders,</v>

40
00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.620
<v Speaker 1>which I'd never seen a child do that.</v>

41
00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:21.454
<v Speaker 1>It was like watching,</v>

42
00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

43
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:22.240
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

44
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>if a cat's sleep and you and you and you go out it,</v>

45
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:29.830
<v Speaker 1>it'll like jump up and puff out its hair and can jump straight up.</v>

46
00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.060
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what this kid did.</v>

47
00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:33.760
<v Speaker 1>And there was a rattlesnake at the side of the,</v>

48
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.871
<v Speaker 1>of the path.</v>

49
00:01:34.871 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Now it was cold,</v>

50
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 1>which was probably good.</v>

51
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

52
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.240
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy named uh,</v>

53
00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

54
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.220
<v Speaker 1>oh I can't read.</v>

55
00:01:44.221 --> 00:01:45.780
<v Speaker 1>He wrote a great book on fear.</v>

56
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.921
<v Speaker 1>It'll come to me,</v>

57
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:47.551
<v Speaker 1>it'll come to me.</v>

58
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>It's a book that I should have on my book list actually.</v>

59
00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.010
<v Speaker 1>And he showed that there are circuits in your brain.</v>

60
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.120
<v Speaker 1>They're reflex circuits.</v>

61
00:01:57.121 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>So this has been demonstrated to some degree much earlier that map.</v>

62
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.880
<v Speaker 1>So imagine that a snake is a pattern.</v>

63
00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine that there's a pattern on your retina that constitutes the</v>

64
00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:06.841
<v Speaker 1>snake.</v>

65
00:02:06.841 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And then imagine that that can be transformed into another pattern,</v>

66
00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>which is a muscular output pattern.</v>

67
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 1>And that muscular output pattern is to jump you in the air.</v>

68
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>So your eyes make your,</v>

69
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.570
<v Speaker 1>your make your muscles move in a particular way.</v>

70
00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:26.430
<v Speaker 1>And that happens before you see the snake and before you're afraid.</v>

71
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.080
<v Speaker 1>And the reason for that is that,</v>

72
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.670
<v Speaker 1>so it's there not many neural connections between snake detection and leaping in</v>

73
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:33.504
<v Speaker 1>the air.</v>

74
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>And that's because if you waited to feel fear and waited to see the snake,</v>

75
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.340
<v Speaker 1>that would take between a quarter and half a second,</v>

76
00:02:41.341 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>something like that and the snake would have already bitten you.</v>

77
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:49.290
<v Speaker 1>So unless you had those really short neuropathways that have been conserved in</v>

78
00:02:49.291 --> 00:02:52.260
<v Speaker 1>the evolutionary process since like the beginning of time,</v>

79
00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>anything super fast and simple would be able to kill you.</v>

80
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.690
<v Speaker 1>So now,</v>

81
00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>so let's say that you do encounter something unexpected.</v>

82
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh first you have these bodily reflexes that are really fast.</v>

83
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>And then the next thing that happens generally speaking is that you feel an</v>

84
00:03:08.201 --> 00:03:08.681
<v Speaker 1>emotion.</v>

85
00:03:08.681 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you're frozen.</v>

86
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.700
<v Speaker 1>So if you hear a real growl behind you,</v>

87
00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.331
<v Speaker 1>you'll freeze.</v>

88
00:03:13.331 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll feel fear and that'll keep you frozen.</v>

89
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.610
<v Speaker 1>And so the,</v>

90
00:03:17.611 --> 00:03:18.371
<v Speaker 1>the fear is,</v>

91
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

92
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>an indication of that physiological state.</v>

93
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>And then only after that will you start to think and strategize.</v>

94
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And so you need reactions at multiple levels of temporal resolution in order to</v>

95
00:03:31.841 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>keep you safe in the world.</v>

96
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>And the fast reactions are muscular and reflexive.</v>

97
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:36.760
<v Speaker 1>And then the next ones,</v>

98
00:03:36.761 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking or something like emotions and they're low resolution,</v>

99
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:41.524
<v Speaker 1>but quick,</v>

100
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.861
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

101
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 1>like if you're afraid,</v>

102
00:03:43.091 --> 00:03:45.610
<v Speaker 1>it means there's something that may be dangerous.</v>

103
00:03:45.611 --> 00:03:46.444
<v Speaker 1>It's vague.</v>

104
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>And it's not until you explore it that you know exactly what the danger is.</v>

105
00:03:49.871 --> 00:03:52.480
<v Speaker 1>But the fear is a good enough initial category.</v>

106
00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>So you could think about feelings as instinctual categories,</v>

107
00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.540
<v Speaker 1>things to love,</v>

108
00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:59.590
<v Speaker 1>things to eat,</v>

109
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.120
<v Speaker 1>things to run away from,</v>

110
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.600
<v Speaker 1>things to run towards their low resolution categories.</v>

111
00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.120
<v Speaker 1>And that's how animals categorize the world.</v>

112
00:04:07.121 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>They use emotion and motivation to categorize the world.</v>

113
00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.500
<v Speaker 1>So we have them to keep ourselves properly oriented in the world and to react</v>

114
00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:16.540
<v Speaker 1>quickly and so that we can stay alive.</v>
